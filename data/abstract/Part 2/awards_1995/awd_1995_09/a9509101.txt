Abstract    :
              9509101  RICE   Genetic recombination is a prominent feature of virtually all
              complex, multicellular organisms.  Yet some species of plants and animals lack
              this genetic feature, including many agriculturally important species like
              fruit trees, grape varieties, etc.  The proposed research tests one of the
              prevailing theories about the importance of genetic recombination, i.e., it
              accelerates the rate of beneficial adaptation in response to environmental
              change.           The common fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) is used as a
              model system owing to its inexpensive culturing, short generation time, and
              availability of numerous genetic tools critical for the operation of
              multi-generation experiments.  Using a new strain recently developed in Dr.
              Rice's laboratory, he will experimentally vary the amount of genetic
              recombination in different populations.  He will then challenge these
              populations with a new environment (low grade thermal stress), as it might
              occur during a period of rapid global warming.  Next he will measure the rate
              of adaptation and relate this to the experimentally controlled level of genetic
              recombination.  Current theory predicts that genetic recombination will greatly
              enhance the capacity of the populations to adapt to the new environment.   The
              capacity for rapid adaptation is becoming increasingly important owing to the
              rapid environmental change induced by human activities.  Results from these
              experiments will contribute to basic understanding of plant and animal breeding
              programs, and will help to predict the capacity of different life forms to
              adapt to human-induced environmental change.
