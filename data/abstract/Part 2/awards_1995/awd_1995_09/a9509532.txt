Abstract    :
                This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at North Carolina State University in
              the purchase of a modern single-  crystal diffraction system.  This new
              instrumentation will enhance greatly research in a number  of areas, including
              the following:  (1)  Organosulfur Complexes as Highly Conducting  Materials;
              (2)  Synthesis of Natural Products and Biologically Active Compounds Via 
              Homochiral N-Acylpyridinium Salts; (3)  Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity of
              Vanadium-  Protein Model Systems; (4)  Stereocontrolled Nucleophilic Addition
              Reactions to Acyclic  Acetals; (5)  Metal Halides at the Interface of Molecular
              and Solid State Chemistry; and (6)   Synthesis and Characterization of
              Organic-Based Magnetic Materials.    The X-ray diffractometer is used to make
              accurate and precise measurements of the full three-  dimensional structure of
              a molecule.  The information obtained gives the precise values of all  the bond
              distances and bond angles of a given molecule and it gives accurate information
              about  the spatial arrangement of that molecule relative to the neighboring
              molecules.
