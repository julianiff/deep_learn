Abstract    :
                   This research will focus on optimizing the physical properties of lead
              complexes identified in Phase I as safer, more volatile precusors for chemical
              vapor deposition (CVD) of ferroelectric materials.  These lead CVD precursors
              will contain ligands surrounding the lead center carefully selected to optimize
              the physical, chemical, and environmental characteristics of the reagents. 
              Deposition of device quality lead zirconate titanate films will be demonstrated
              and large scale synthetic methods will be developed.   CVD is the most
              promising manufacturing method for lead based ferroelectrics, and these new
              ferroelectrics will be specifically designed to meet high purity film growth
              and current safety requirements.  This makes desirable for numerous electronic
              devices including non-volatile memories, electro-optic spatial light
              modulators, piezoelectric actuators, and pyroelectric infrared detectors.
