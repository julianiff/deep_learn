Abstract    :
              A much-touted advantage of the relational data model is the existence of a
              formal calculus and algebra to model database queries. In practice, these
              formalisms fail to model many of the features present in commercial query
              languages (e.g., SQL):  grouping, aggregation, duplicate values, and sort
              orders. The gap only widens as one moves to object- oriented query languages,
              such as OQL of ODMG-93, which must deal with multiple bulk (collection) types,
              arbitrary nesting of type constructors, methods and embedded query expressions.
              Such features also appear in relational query language standards proposals,
              such as SQL3. This work addresses efficient query processing for modern
              database languages. It seeks to demonstrate through prototype implementation
              that new language features can be handled more effectively if these features
              have direct support in a query calculus. The research framework is based on
              such a calculus, called the monoid comprehension calculus. Instead of starting
              from relational algebra and making extensions, our formal model represents
              naturally the new emerging features of database lang uages. A successful
              outcome for the research will lead to a better basis for implementing the query
              processors of commercial database systems, both of pure object-oriented models
              and relational-object
