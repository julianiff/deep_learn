Abstract    :
              9509032  Etges   The range of host plants used by groups of insects can be broad
              or very narrow, including host plant specificity or restriction to a single
              host.  Since most insects, which constitute the vast majority of all animal
              species, use plants during some part of their life cycles for food or as a
              place to reproduce, it is important to understand the causes for insects to be
              host specialists or generalists.  Patterns of host use may be important in
              explaining the diversification of insect groups.  Particular aspects of host
              plants may either limit or increase the number of hosts an insect species can
              use.  Over long time intervals, this may give rise to related groups of insect
              species that share host affinities.   The research project supported by this
              award will use patterns of DNA sequence data similarities to study the degree
              of genetic relatedness among a group of over 40 species in the Drosophila
              mulleri species complex (Insecta: Diptera: Drosophilidae).  The pattern of
              species relationships determined will be compared to the host use of these
              species in nature.  Two clusters of species in this complex, each with three
              species, will be studied in greater detail for evidence of population level
              variation in DNA sequence data.  The fruit flies in this study group breed on
              cacti and their larvae feed on cactus host plants.  There has been an apparent
              host shift with some species feeding on the cactus genus Opuntia, whose members
              are easily recognized by paddle shaped parts, to other cacti whose growth form
              is columnar or barrel shaped.  Knowledge of relationships among the Drosophila
              species will allow determination of the number of times that this shift between
              cactus types has occurred.   %%%  This award will provide information on the
              biodiversity and host plant associations in a group of specialized cactus
              feeding flies.  This research represents an important model system for
              understanding host shifts and the origin of insect pests that may be of value
              in developing non-chemical  means of controlling pests.  ***
