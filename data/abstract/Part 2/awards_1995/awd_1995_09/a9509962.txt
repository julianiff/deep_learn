                                             The goal of this project is to develop a sound
              basis and methodology for the representation of corpora and linguistic
              information in corpora, as well as for the design of text-handling tools, for
              use in corpus-based natural language processing (NLP) research. The work is
              undertaken in collaboration with the Laboratoire Parole et Langage in
              Aix-en-Provence, France. The project involves (1) analysis of the needs of
              corpus-based NLP research, both in terms of the kinds and degree of annotation
              required and the requirements for efficient processing, accessibility, etc.;
              (2) analysis of general properties and configuration of corpora, analysis of
              the relevant structural and logical features of component text types, and the
              design of encoding mechanisms that can represent all required elements and
              features while accomodating the requirements determined in (1); and (3)
              specifications for text software design, coordinated with (2), designed to
              avoid redundancy and maximize the modifiability, extendability, and reusability
              of corpus-handling software. The methods and materials developed in this
              project will provide a comprehensive framework for the machine representation
              and manipulation of large corpora for corpus-based NLP research, thus enabling
              both software and data to be easily shared, used, and re-used in the future.  u
