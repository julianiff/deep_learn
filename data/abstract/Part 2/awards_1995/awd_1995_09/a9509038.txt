Abstract    :
              With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program Professor Schelly of the
              University of Texas, Arlington will elaborate the dynamics of electroporation
              of bilayer vesicles.  In this methodology, cell membranes or models thereof are
              exposed to electric field pulses which results in pore formation in the cell
              wall.  These openings are useful in that it provides access to the
              intracellular contents which can be altered or removed.  In this investigation,
              the mechanisms of pore formation and closure will be studied.  Further, data
              will be garnered on pore stability, durability and size control.    The ability
              to manipulate the intracellular contents of biological cells would be extremely
              useful in the treatment of diseases.  In this project, a methodology will be
              studies in which holes/pores are formed in the cell wall of a cell or cellular
              wall model.  It is through these pores that manipulation can occur.  Thus, the
              mechanism of pore formation as well as factors which control stability of the
              pore, its size and longevity are the goals of this investigation.  This is a
              significant project with regard to health care.  For example, physicians could
              use this technique to place a drug in a given cell and by means of the cell's
              natural course, the drug would be delivered to a specific site for action.
