Abstract    :
              9509006  Holsinger    Much progress has been made in understanding the evolution
              of plant mating systems since Thomas Knight proposed in 1799 that "No plant
              fertilizes itself for a perpetuity of generations.".  In these two centuries,
              however, most studies have shared one significant feature with Knight's
              work--an emphasis on the fitness consequences of inbreeding.  To botanists
              inbreeding depression is an obstacle that must be overcome; to geneticists it
              is the only force that can oppose the otherwise certain spread of a selfing
              allele.  As a result, experimental and theoretical analyses of inbreeding
              depression have dominated the study of plant mating systems for many years.   
              The mass-action model recently developed by Dr. Holsinger shows that the
              dynamics of pollen transfer may have an impact on the evolutionary dynamics of
              plant mating systems as great as that of inbreeding depression, and it shows
              considerable promise as a comprehensive framework for analyzing the impact of
              individual differences in pollen transfer dynamics.  It is also the only
              approach in which mixed mating systems are evolutionarily stable for a broad
              range of parameter values, unless the range of possible selfing rates is
              constrained.  The work proposed here will extend existing mass-action models in
              ways that allow determination of which aspects of the reproductive process have
              the greatest impact on the evolutionary dynamics of plant mating systems.
