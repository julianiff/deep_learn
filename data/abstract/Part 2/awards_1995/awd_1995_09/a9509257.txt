Abstract    :
              9509257  Lyon  This proposal suggests new operating principles and approaches to
               constructing switches for optical signals.  The devices proposed  here utilize
              an asymmetric semiconductor quantum structure (such as  a stepped quantum well)
              embedded in a parallel plate metallic  waveguide.  Preliminary work indicates
              that these structures can be  used to construct ultrafast electrooptic and
              all-optical devices.   In particular, calculations have been performed which
              suggest that  these structures will support coupled-field (coupled electrical
              and  optical pulses) solitons.    The objectives of the proposed work are to
              study the physics of  these structures, use this information to refine the
              models and  calculations, and to fabricate and test devices based on these 
              principles.  The work will involve investigations of various types  of
              asymmetric quantum structures, ultrafast electrical pulse  propagation on
              parallel-plate metallic waveguides, and the  interactions of these electrical
              pulses with optical pulses  traveling through the semiconductor embedded within
              the waveguide.   Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) will be used to grow the
              semiconductor  materials, which will then be analyzed with various optical and 
              electrical probes.  The electrical pulses will be generated and  measured with
              ultrafast optical pulses.  Building upon this new  knowledge, optical switches
              will be designed, fabricated, and  tested.  ***
