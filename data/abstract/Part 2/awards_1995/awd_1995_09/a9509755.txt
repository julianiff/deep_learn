Abstract    :
              9509755  Amasino  This award supports the Sixth International Conference on 
              Arabidopsis Research to be held at the University of  Wisconsin, Madison,
              Wisconsin, June 7-11, 1995.  The aim is  to provide an opportunity for
              researchers to exchange ideas  on all aspects of Arabidopsis research,
              including genome-  related efforts.  The conference will include sessions on 
              embryonic and post embryonic development, environmental  effects on
              development, response to environmental stress and  pathogens, plant growth
              regulators, biochemical genetics,  cell biology, biochemistry, and
              genome-related research.  This is the first international Arabidopsis
              conference to be  held since the August 1993 meeting at Ohio State University 
              and the number of researchers using Arabidopsis has been  growing at a
              tremendous rate.  There were over 600  participants at the last meeting and a
              greater number is  expected to attend this meeting.  The conference will 
              maximize participation of young scientists by inviting  relatively young PIs,
              postdoctoral fellows, and graduate  students to give the majority of talks.
