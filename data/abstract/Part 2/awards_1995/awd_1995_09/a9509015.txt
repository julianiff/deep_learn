Abstract    :
              9509015  Miller Baker   The purpose of the research is to assess the levels of
              deleterious t haplotypes in house mouse populations in order to test basic
              assumptions by modellers of the transmission ratio distortion phenomenon. In
              this study the PI will use DNA sequencing to elucidate the molecular mechanisms
              of segregation disorder.     The proposed research is one of the few field
              studies of segregation disorder. In addition, the PI will be studying the
              impact of dispersal, social structure and mating behavior on population
              genetics. This investigation of female choice will be of interest to behavioral
              ecologists and population geneticists studying sexual selection.
