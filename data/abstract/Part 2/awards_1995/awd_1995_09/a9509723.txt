Abstract    :
              This proposal is to design and implement a science measurement described as part
              of research element 1 "Satellite Assessment of Land Use/Land Cover."  This
              element is part of the Vice-Presidential initative, the GLOBE Program (Global
              Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environement), a program that engages
              K-12 students around the globe in taking scientific measurements and data that
              is authentic research data used by scientists.  This project is to use
              satellite images to provide information on land cover/land use patterns in
              communities of the participating students and teachers.  Students are given
              data consisting of miltispectural images, and using the distinctive spectral
              signatures which classify forests, crops and other covers, they will map the
              vegetative cover of their monitoring sites.  Studnets will create thematic maps
              with their sateliite images and make ground-truthing expeditions to verify the
              land cover interpretations initially made in the classroom.   Studnets learn to
              treat these images as data and experimental protocols are designed by
              scientists to incorporate measurements makde by these studients.  Supporitng
              science curriculum materials are to be designed by a tem of scientist, science
              educators, and K-12 teachers and students.  Development of a model curriculum
              on the use of satellite data sets and development of a common base for
              understanding and implementing technologies required for use of satellite
              imagery in GLOBE classrooms are seen as outcomes of this project.
