Abstract    :
              9509277  Meech    A workshop on the theme of "Toward Other Planetary Systems"
              (TOPS) will  be held at the Hawaii Preparatory Academy in Kamuela, Hawaii June 
              11-18, 1995.  Sixteen top science teacher-student pairs from high  schools
              statewide in Hawaii will participate in the workshop.  The  purpose of the
              workshop is to introduce students and teachers to areas  of planetary science
              that are pushing the limits of ground-based and  space-based astronomical
              technology.  There will be discussions of how  astronomers use the Mauna Kea
              telescopes and space-based facilities to  search for evidence of planet
              formation in other solar systems.  This,  (i) will create a new awareness of
              the forefront research of  astronomical science in Hawaii, (ii) will provide an
              exciting basis for  young students to consider careers in astronomy, and
              finally (iii) will  provide a wealth of new teaching materials to be used by
              science  educators at the high school level.  The workshop will involve 
              collaboration between many research scientists, telescope support  staff, and
              high school educators.  The format of the workshop is  arranged to allow
              discussions, demonstrations, hands-on activities, an  observatory tour, and
              night time observing opportunities for the  participants.  The teachers will be
              able to develop astronomy  activities, based on the workshop materials, for use
              in their classes  in the future.      This will be the third consecutive year
              of the program.  Educational  materials, for suggested astronomy classroom
              activities, will be  published and distributed to schools statewide after the
              end of the  grant period.
