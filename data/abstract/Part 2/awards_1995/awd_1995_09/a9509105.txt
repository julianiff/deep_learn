Abstract    :
              MCB 9509105  Catherine Walsh    This proposal is designed to provide valuable
              preliminary data contributing to the long-term goal of characterizing thymic
              function in cartilaginous fish, the most primitive groups of jawed vertebrates
              to possess a distinct thymus.  The work focuses on the preliminary
              characterization of possible phylogenetic equivalents of specialized cells
              identified in mammalian thymi as thymic nurse cells.  The thymic nurse cells
              are suspected to have roles in interthymic T-cell maturation and/or removal of
              nonfunctional or self reactive thymocytes.  The research planning grant will be
              used to develop a full research proposal to characterize the functional role
              and evolutionary significance of elasmobranch thymic cells.  %%%  This project
              will investigate the evolution of the thymus and the interrelation of cells in
              the thymus.  It will provide evidence to explain how cells acquire different
              functions in the body of an organism.  ***
