Abstract    :
              9509290  Chen  The long range objective of the proposed research is to elucidate
              the fundamental principles that govern the differential and selective mRNA
              degradation in mammalian cells. The focus of the research is on the molecular
              mechanism by which p64, a polyribosome-associated RNA binding protein,
              participates in the turnover of labile c-fos proto-oncogene mRNA through its
              interaction with the cognate RNA target, an RNA determinant of instability
              present in the c-fos protein coding region. In this application four specific
              aims are proposed: 1. To purify the p64 RNA-binding protein and raise
              antibodies to it, 2. To clone a full-length cDNA for p64, 3. To determine the
              RNA binding specificity of the p64 RNA-binding protein, and 4. To characterize
              the properties and functions of p64. The studies in this application will
              provide significant insight into general biochemical and molecular principles
              governing the differential decay of mRNAs in mammalian cells.  %%%  The
              identification of diverse biological systems in which messengerRNA stability
              regulates gene expression has demonstrated the importance and generality of
              this type of control. In mammalian cells, the half-lifes of some mRNAs span
              several hours or even days, while other mRNAs decay within minutes of their
              initial synthesis. The molecular mechanisms by which mRNAs are differentially
              targeted for degradation remain relatively poorly understood. The long range
              objective of this research is to elucidate the fundamental principles that
              govern the differential and selective mRNA degradation in mammalian cells which
              will, in turn, further our understanding of basic mechanisms controlling cell
              growth and differentiation.  ***
