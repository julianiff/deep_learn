Abstract    :
              9509122  Ichiye    While electronic structure calculations of gas-phase
              molecules is  a very well developed field, such calculations for molecules in 
              solation are still in their infancy.  This research will  incorporate solvent
              effects into electronic structure calculations  of proteins.  Simple continuum
              solvent models are insufficient to  describe phenomena such as hydrogen
              bonding, local dielectric  perturbations and phenomena involving separations of
              only a few  water layers.  To model the molecular nature of solvation, the 
              approach used here will add a statistical mechanical integral  equation theory,
              previously developed by this group to describe  aqueous solvation of globular
              molecules, into density functional  electronic structure methods.  %%%  While
              electronic structure calculations of gas-phase molecules is  a very well
              developed field, such calculations for molecules in  solution are still in
              their infancy.  This research will  incorporate solvent effects into electronic
              structure calculations  of proteins.  Electronic structure calculations are
              very important  in computational and theoretical biophysics.  For instance,
              they  are important in gaining a fundamental understanding of the 
              structure-function relationships of electron transfer proteins and  enzymes. 
              They are also important in the development of potential  energy function
              parameters.    ***
