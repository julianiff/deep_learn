Abstract    :
              9509871  Sheldon  This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER)  will support
              the completion of a political history of the Washington State Court of Appeals.
               It will analyze how that court evolved from its creation in 1969 and what has
              accounted for that evolution.  Both quantitative and qualitative data will be
              gathered from court documents, interviews of judges and commissioners, and
              surveys of law clerks, experienced appellate attorneys and  staff personnel. 
              These data will be classified according to how the judges go about their tasks
              and how they interact with one another.  Such data should help explain how the
              court meets its goals.  The aging of the Court's personnel and the efficiency
              of data gathering during the P.I.'s university sabbatical  provide an urgency
              to the research that justifies a SGER.  %%%%  This Small Grant for Exploratory
