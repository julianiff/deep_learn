Abstract    :
              9509991  Spector       This proposal for an RUI award is to study particle 
              physics by investigating supersymmetric gauge theories with  soliton, monopole
              and instanton solutions.  Supersymmetry is  an invariance which transforms
              bosons into fermions.  Non-  dissipative soliton-like solutions of the
              non-linear  equations of motion provide different choices of vacuua of  the
              theory.  Their role in strong and weak coupling  approximations to the theory
              will be computed.  ***
