Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9509842    This is a study of the electrochemical kinetic behavior
              of diamond (doped and undoped; single-crystal and polycrystalline) and an
              evaluation of its potential as an electrode material in electrochemical
              technology. Factors influencing the electrochemical behavior of diamond film
              are explored, including dopant levels, type of dopants, surface pretreatment,
              plasma etching, annealing treatments, diamond morphology, and graphitic
              content.    Undoped and doped diamond thin films with various surface
              morphologies are grown on molybdenum silicon, glassy carbon, single-crystal
              diamond, and graphite substrates by microwave plasma and hot-filament
              techniques.  Anodic and cathodic transfer coefficients, corrosion rate,
              exchange current density, double-layer capacitance, film resistance,
              polarization resistance, and/or charge-transfer resistance of diamond
              electrodes in a 0.5 M salt solution are determined using AC impedance and DC
              polarization techniques.  Voltammetric techniques are used to study redox
              behavior of model systems, working potential limits of diamond electrodes in
              various electrolytes, and electrocatalysis by doped diamond and by
              platinum/iridium or ruthenium dioxide on diamond.    It is generally accepted
              that further advances in industrial electrochemistry will require new electrode
              materials.  Diamond is a promising, but as yet  unproven, candidate.  ***
