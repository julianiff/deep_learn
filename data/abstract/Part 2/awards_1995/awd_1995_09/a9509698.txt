Abstract    :
               9509698   The project is to coordinate, assemble, adapt, and integrate
              curricular components of the GLOBE (Global Learning and Observations to Benefit
              the Environment) Project for Phase II of its operation.  Modular
              age-appropriate curricular units that are integrated with and support GLOBE
              measurements, as well as related student materials, are to be developed and
              classroom-tested. The concept of the curriculum is to direct students through a
              progressive collaborative learning experience so they have both skills and
              content not only to gather science-grade data, but to understand the science
              and meaning of their findings.  Attention is given to adapt curriculum that
              involves telecollaborative student investigations so it is readily adapted into
              a wide range of cultures, languages, and socio-economic circumstances.
