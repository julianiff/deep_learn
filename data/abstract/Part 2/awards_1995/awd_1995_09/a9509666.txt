Abstract    :
              Smith   In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global Learning
              and Observations to Benefit the Environment Program (GLOBE) this project is
              designed to meet the GLOBE goals and objectives of linking scientists and
              schoolchildren in a global information network with the ultimate goal of better
              understanding the Earth's environment and changes that take place within it.
              Many of the GLOBE student measurements will be spatially correlated with
              geographic information such as that derived from satellite imagery, aerial
              photography, and other terrestrial maps. Therefor accurate position
              determination of the measurement sites is required. The GLOBE program will use
              positions derived from the Global Positioning System (GPS), which has great
              accuracy ( to within less than 100 meters) employing portable receivers
              presently costing well under $ 1000. This proposal to GLOBE PHASE II is
              concerned with the GPS needs of GLOBE. GPS receivers and associated equipment
              will be defined, procured, and bundled into kits with documentation for loan to
              participating schools. The  Principal Investigator (P.I.) and assisting
              graduate and undergraduate students will help plan the education program and
              generate teaching materials. The P.I. will participate in the teacher training
              workshops.
