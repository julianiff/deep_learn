Abstract    :
              9509738  Taylor    Parasitoids are insect species in which females lay eggs in
              or on other insects, which then are eaten by the parasitoid larvae.  In most
              species the hosts are attacked in immature stages and are killed before
              reaching reproductive maturity.  Many species of fly parasitoids, however,
              attack adult hosts, which often reproduce before being killed.  This project
              will describe such nonlethal parasitism by one such species, Trichopoda
              pennipes, on its host, the southern green stink bug.  Laboratory experiments
              and rearing of parasitized hosts from field collections will be used to
              describe the effects of parasitism on host mortality and reproduction and on
              the success of parasitoid reproduction, in relation to factors such as the age
              of the host when parasitized and the number of parasitoid eggs laid on it. 
              Preferences of parasitoids for hosts of different ages also will be determined.
               The probable effects of these processes on the population dynamics of the
              parasitoid-host system will be analyzed with mathematical models.   
              Parasitoids are important sources of pest control in agricultural and other
              ecological systems.  The host species to be used in these studies is an
              important agricultural pest worldwide, and the parasitoid specie has often been
              used as a biological control agent for it, though with limited success.  This
              research will lead to better understanding of factors, particularly non-lethal
              parasitism, affecting the ability of this and other parasitoids to control
              their hosts.  This knowledge should enhance the effectiveness of biological
              pest control efforts and thus reduce our dependence on chemical insecticides.
