              Abstract  ATM-9509504  Anderson, David M.  University of Colorado  Title:
              Extending the Baseline of Climate Variability Using                 Laminated
              Sediments from Semi-Isolated Marine Basins in          Southern Chile    This
              award supports the recovery and analysis of laminated marine  sediments
              spanning the last few thousand years in southern Chile.   Annually-resolved
              paleoclimate information from southern South  America is needed to understand
              the regional signal of global  warming, and also to understand the
              teleconnections between  tropical and mid-latitude regions of the southern
              hemisphere.   Proxy records of temperature and precipitation (related to the 
              southern westerly winds) derived from marine sediments can  substantially
              improve the inventory of baseline climate records in  this region where
              instrumental data are sparse.  Marine records  provide a valuable complement to
              terrestrial proxy records derived  from tree-rings and lake and bog sediments,
              and a direct proxy  (d18O) for rainfall driven by the southern westerly winds.
