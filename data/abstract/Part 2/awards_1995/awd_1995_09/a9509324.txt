Abstract    :
              9509324  BIELER  This award will support collection of DNA sequence data from
              representative members of "lower heterobranch gastropod (Mollusca: Gastropoda)
              lineages.  These molecular data will be combined with data, some previously
              collected, from morphological studies involving internal anatomy,
              ultrastructural features revealed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and
              histological information, as well as external and shell characteristics.  These
              organisms include several "primitive" groups for which the relationships remain
              unresolved.  Elucidation of their relationships will also shed light on the
              origins of slugs and land snails.  The relationships revealed will be of use in
              trying to understand the fossil record of these animals.  This study will
              contribute to our knowledge of the biodiversity of an amazing phylum of
              invertebrate animals.  Many of the members are marine, but others have made
              transitions to life on land and in fresh water.  Collectively, gastropods or
              snails, slugs and their relatives are of much importance to human life, as some
              are an important food source and others harbor parasites of both humans and
              domestic animals.
