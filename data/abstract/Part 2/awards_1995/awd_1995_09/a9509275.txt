Abstract    :
              Dr. Jeffrey I. Zink, Chemistry Department, University of California - Los  
              Angeles, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic  
              Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division for an investigation of the  
              electronic excited  states of metal-containing molecules. Detailed single  
              crystal polarized electronic absorption, emission, and resonance Raman  
              spectroscopic measurements will be made on volatile organometallic   compounds,
              which could be precursors for laser assisted chemical vapor   deposition, and
              molecules that well test theoretical predictions about   excited state
              couplings and non-totally symmetric modes. The results of   these experiments
              will be used to determine the geometries, distortions,   properties, and
              reactions of the metals in their excited states.   When a metal containing
              compound absorbs light energy, it becomes   `excited`. In the `excited state`
              many of the properties of the compound   change and, e.g., chemical reactions
              can occur that normally do not take   place. In this study the excited states
              of metal compounds will be   studied to establish theoretical methods to
              predict and rationalize   excited state behavior, and to uncover the pathways
              by which metal   compounds can be made to decompose into valuable advanced
              materials.
