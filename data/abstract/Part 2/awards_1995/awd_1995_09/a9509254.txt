Abstract    :
              J. F. O'Hanlon  9509254    Particle travel support will be provided to four
              invited speakers and four US graduate students to an interdisciplinary workshop
              on particle formation and transport in plasmas, particularly weak ionized
              plasmas.  The meeting will promote synergy between several research areas,
              including aerosols, astrophysics, particles in plasmas for materials synthesis
              an semiconductors manufacturing.  The workshop will be organized in
              collaboration with the NSF-sponsored Center for Microcontamination Control at
              the University of Arizona, and will involve participants from industry. 
              Research leaders in the respective field from other countries (including
              Australia, Russia, Japan, France, Germany, Spain, Switzerland)  will constitute
              about half of the participants at the meeting.  The workshop proceeding will be
              printed and distributed to those interested.  ***
