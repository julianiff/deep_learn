Abstract    :
              9509829  Cheer  This project is on research to provide a foundation for the 
              detailed understanding of the three-dimensional fluid  physics of pulsatile
              flows with valves and moving walls in  the region around the aortic valve and
              the downstream  ascending and descending aorta. Subsidiary objectives are:  (1)
              to produce a detailed map of shear stresses and analyze  their effect on
              suspended particles in the hart and large  vessels, and (2) to do detailed
              modeling of the flow pattern  at the ostia (opening) of the coronary arteries
              which supply  blood to the heart muscle.  ***
