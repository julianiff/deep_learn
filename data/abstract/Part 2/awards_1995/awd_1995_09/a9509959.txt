Abstract    :
              In this proposal funded jointly by the Divisions of Chemistry and   Materials
              Research, McCullough will synthesize and characterize novel   conducting
              organic polymers and oligomers designed to yield predictable,   oriented
              structures using self-assembly, ion-binding, and/or biomimetic   assembly
              methods.  The self-assembling, conducting systems are based on   oligomers and
              polymers of thiophenes or pyrroles with functionalized side   chains. 
              Information about self-assembly in electronic and photonic   oligomeric
              materials will result from study of the synthesized oligomers.    The
              electrical, structural, and non-linear optical properties of each of   these
              new oligomers and polymers will be examined in detail in order to   focus on
              strategies for the design and control of structures and   properties in
              advanced materials.   The research performed in this work is not only of
              fundamental interest,   but it also forms the basis for exciting new technology
              for the coming   century.  Among the electronic and photonic applications of
              the materials   to be examined in this project are optical modulators, imaging
              materials,   light-emitting diodes and displays, smart windows, and
              nanoelectronic and   optical devices.
