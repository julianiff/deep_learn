Abstract    :
              9509268  Spilhaus    The Proposed activities will encourage and promote
              development of  regional cooperation in global change research through the
              System  for Research, Analysis and Training (START), a joint mechanism of  the
              World Climate Research Programme (WCRP); the International  Geosphere-Biosphere
              Programme (IGBP); and the Human Dimensions (of  Global Environmental Change)
              Program (HDP).  The proposed  activities are addressed to development of a
              global network to  promote such research and development of regional data and 
              information systems in Asia and the Pacific and in Eastern Europe  and Africa. 
              Integrating scientific issues will be: land use  change; coastal zone processes
              and related land-ocean interaction;  terrestrial ecosystems; and impacts of
              climate change.  Activities  will include: development of regional cooperative
              research programs  and viable agendas for such research, initiated primarily
              through  scientific workshops and planning meetings; development of  integrated
              data bases and systems for exchange of data and  information, especially
              electronically; development of standards  and standard methods, technologies,
              and formats for collection,  processing and exchange of global change data; and
              promotion of  regional and national capacity building.
