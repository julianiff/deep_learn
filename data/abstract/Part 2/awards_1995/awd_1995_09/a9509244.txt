Abstract    :
              9509244  McKnight  Partial support is requested for a two-day workshop on
              Internet  economics that will convene technologists, economists, business 
              leaders and policy makers to discuss the Internet as an economic  system.  It
              will bring together researchers and practitioners  across disciplines to help
              understand Internet economics in order  to plan for the growth of this medium. 
                The goal of this workshop is to plan and develop a framework for 
              understanding the Internet as a self-sustaining economic system  through panels
              and facilitated discussions.
