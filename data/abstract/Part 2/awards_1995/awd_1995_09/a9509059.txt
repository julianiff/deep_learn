Abstract    :
              9509059   Langford   This is a Small Business Innovation Research Phase II award
              to support a project to develop and  demonstrate a two-way, low-cost airborne
              science data relay.  The company identified a need for a lightweight, low-cost,
              bi-directional communications link for science  aircraft.  Phase I of the
              project investigated atmospheric  science user requirements for data relay and
              mission control.  The feasibility of using low-Earth  orbit communications
              satellites to meet these requirements was demonstrated through ground  testing
              of a brassboard system.  In demonstrating this system, it was discovered that 
              straightforward data relay to the first visible satellite does not always
              provide minimum message  transmission time.  In order to ensure the most timely
              delivery of science and mission data, a "SmartLink" scheduler for use with the
              ORBCOMM system was developed.    Phase II will implement a real-time version of
              the scheduler, install the system into a UAV  communications package, and
              conduct over-the-horizon flight tests.   The SmartLink scheduler, integrated
              into ORBCOMM transceivers, will be used first for  unmanned scientific
              aircraft;  however, it also can provide a low-cost Internet link for manned 
              aircraft.  Any operation requiring low-cost, short latency, Internet
              communication with a remote  site will benefit from this product and is a
              potential customer.
