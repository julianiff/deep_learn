Abstract    :
                  AST 95-09919    Because of their great luminosity, quasars can be detected
              at enormous distances, i.e. high redshift. Surveys for high redshift quasars
              have already provided a number of new scientific insights. For example, it is
              now clear that the rapid rise in the density of quasars with increasing
              distance (decreasing age) halts somewhere between redshifts 2.0 and 3.5, and a
              recently completed survey has provided evidence that the space density of
              quasars declines at higher redshifts. Also, there is no significant change with
              redshift in the strengths of the metal emission lines, indicating that the
              quasar material has already been enriched by several generations of stellar
              evolution even at the largest known redshifts. Other surveys are now being
              carried out to measure the luminosity function of faint quasars via a
              small-area deep slitless survey, and to search for very high redshift quasars
              via two large-area surveys, using multicolor CCD images for 4.1 < z < 5.5, and
              with slitless spectra out to redshifts beyond 6. A catalog will be published
              for each  survey.  ***
