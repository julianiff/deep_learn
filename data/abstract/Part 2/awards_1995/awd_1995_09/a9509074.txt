Abstract    :
              9509074  DOEBLEY   Closely related species can differ from one another by traits
              that best adapt each to the specific environment that it inhabits.  How such
              adaptive traits evolved in nature is not well-understood.  Many evolutionary
              geneticists subscribe to the view that the evolution of new adaptations
              typically involves changes at many genes, each with a small effect on an
              organism's appearance, or phenotype.  Others have argued that one or two genes
              of large effect are sufficient to establish a new adaptation and that this is
              the more common mode of adaptive evolution in plants.  Empirical studies
              germane to this debate are relatively few and inconclusive.  The proposed
              research will investigate the genetics of adaptive evolution by analyzing the
              inheritance of  adaptive characters that distinguish natural species of the
              genus Zea.  The traits analyzed will include annual vs. perennial habit,
              rhizome formation, flowering date, degree of pigmentation in the leaf sheath,
              seed weight, and flower size and number.  The inheritance of these traits will
              be determined by mapping the individual genes that control these traits to
              their positions on the chromosomes.  By this means, it will be possible to
              determine the number of genes affecting each trait and the magnitudes of the
              effects of the individual genes.  Overall, this study will provide a detailed
              picture of the genetic control of adaptively important traits from which one
              can infer the genetic basis of adaptive evolution in Zea.  Because the genus
              Zea includes cultivated corn and because some of the traits to be studied are
              of potential agronomic importance, the proposed research can contribute to  our
              understanding and improvement of corn.
