Abstract    :
                A solution to an over determined linear system, where   there may  be  errors
              in both the data matrix and the target vector, is   required  in many 
              important applications in sciences and engineering.    Recently, a new
              technique  called Structured Total Least Norm  (STLN) has been developed   for
              obtaining the  solution that  preserves any affine structure, after the data  
              are perturbed to  account for the errors.  It also permits the error to be   
              minimized in various  norms.    The STLN algorithm is being investigated and  
              developed into an  efficient and practical solution method for many  
              applications.  Its  computational performance is being studied and a more  
              complete  convergence  theory is under development.  Significant algorithmic 
              and   improvements are being made in order to  efficiently handle   large-scale
              problems  and special structures.  A particular study is being   conducted to
              apply the STLN  method to  the model reduction by Hankel norm approximation  
              problem.  The  effect of different norms  are being explored.    The STLN  
              algorithm is being  extended to solve more general  problems where the
              structured   matrix is a  differentiable function  of parameters to be
              estimated, and   its performance is to  be  compared to other parameter
              estimation methods such as   Prony's  method.
