Abstract    :
                This is a one year project  proposed by Drs. Ray Herrmann  and William Back
              and Mr. Ivan Johnson, American Water  Resource Association (AWRA).  This
              proposal requests $10,000  for five representatives from five developing
              countries in  the East Asian and Pacific region to attend the American  Water
              Resource Association (AWRA) summer symposium on water  resources and
              environmental hazards.   Fresh water is an  important issue in the East Asia
              and Pacific countries,  particularly in many developing  East Asian countries
              where  there are high rates of population and economic growth.  The 
              involvement of scientists  from these countries is  important, since these
              scientists  have first hand of  information concerning problems in water
              quality and  quantity and ecosystem integrity.    These scientists will  also
              participate in special workshops to assess the need for  a network for
              scientists and policy makers from Oceania, the  Pacific Islands, and the
              Pacific Rim countries to develop a  prioritized research agenda relating to
              regional water  issues and to determine the scope of such a research agenda, 
              as well as to identify critical  water problems across the  region.    The
              modest cost to involve scientists from  developing countries is well justified
              since the potential  gain in advancing understanding of global water issues is 
              great.
