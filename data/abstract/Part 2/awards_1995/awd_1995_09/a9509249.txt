Abstract    :
              9509249  Kanatzidis    The  proposed  symposium  is  titled  "Synthesis 
              Reactivity  and  Properties  of  Non-Oxidic  Solids".   We  chose  this  topic 
              to  highlight  the  significance of these  materials  to  fundamental 
              chemistry   and  to  technology.   Although  the  chemistry   and  significance
               of  oxides is well known to the chemical  community  and well represented by a
              plethora of ACS and other symposia,  in  general  non-oxides  such as
              chalcogenides,  halides,  pnictides,  borides,  carbides and intermetallics
              have received  very  little  attention,  especially in ACS symposia.  These 
              materials  impact  both  our understanding of fundamental chemical science  and
               our  technological  progress in a major way.  Little  is  known  about  these
              materials, and an ACS symposium will help in projecting the  important  issues
              and problems in this area to a broad  chemistry  audience and particularly to
              students and young researchers.  The  proposed  symposium  is very timely given
              the  continuing  strong  interest in the properties of these compounds which
              include  non-  linear   optics   (chalcogenide,   pnictides,  
              superconductivity  (borides), rechargeable batteries (hydrides), oxygen storage
               and  transport (cyanides) and others.  Emphasis will be given  to  new 
              synthetic   techniques,  measurement  and  characterization   and  processing
              of non-oxidic solids.  %%%  To  the  best of our knowledge, this is the first
              symposium  that  focuses specifically on non-oxide solid state materials.  ***
