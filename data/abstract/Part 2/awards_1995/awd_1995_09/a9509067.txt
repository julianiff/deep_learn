              Imperfect Information Flow: Modeling Channels and Defaults in  Domain Theory   
              This work is an attempt to use techniques used in the semantics  of programming
              languages to unify some concepts in intelligent  systems modeling.  More
              specifically, it studies the flow of  information which admits errors but still
              allows useful  information to be transmitted.  In previous work, a theory of 
              such information flow, called default model theory , grounded in  domain
              theory, has been developed.  Default model theory allows  information used at
              one point in a computation to be overwritten  when new "strict" information
              becomes available, providing a  means of understanding default and nonmonotonic
              reasoning from  the perspective of information channels.  This work will also 
              investigate applications to natural language processing, logic  programming,
              and database handling.
