Abstract    :
              9509017  Spotila      The sex of a developing embryo is determined by the
              expression of specific gene sequences at defined times during embryogenesis. 
              In mammals, birds and some reptiles the initiating signal for the expression of
              genes that lead to maleness or femaleness is the presence of the Y chromosome
              (mammals) or the W chromosome (birds, some reptiles).  In other reptilian
              species, however, the sex of the developing embryo is determined by the
              incubation temperature during a critical time of gestation.  This proposal will
              use the common slider turtle (Trachemys scripta) a species that is not
              endangered, is readily obtainable, and is representative of many turtle species
              in that a higher incubation temperature (about 32 C) results in female
              hatchlings and a lower incubation temperature (about 26 C) results in male
              hatchlings, to investigate the phenomenon of temperature-dependent sex
              determination at the molecular level.  Specifically, eggs will be incubated in
              the laboratory at 26 C or 32 C and embryos will be sacrificed at about 2-3
              weeks of gestation, the time period that is critical for formation of gonadal
              tissue.  RNA will be isolated from gonadal tissue and analyzed for differences
              in the sequences expressed at the two temperatures by a technique called
              Differential Display Polymerase Chain Reaction.  RNA species that are expressed
              at 26 C, but not at 32 C may be involved in the male developmental pathway. 
              Conversely, RNA species found at 32 C, but not at 26 C may be involved in
              female-specific developmental processes.  It is the goal of this one-year
              project to compile a "catalogue" of gene sequences that are candidates for
              further analysis as critical factors in temperature-dependent sex
              determination.  Understanding of this ecological phenomenon is important not
              only for the conservation of endangered reptile species, but also for the
              insight that might be gained as to how sex-determining mechanisms function in
              general.  ***
