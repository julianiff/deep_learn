Abstract    :
              The International conferences on Fluid Properties and Phase Equilibria for
              chemical Process Design are held every three years, presently alternating
              between North America and Europe.  The first six conferences have produced
              highly desirable interactions between academic and industrial and government
              workers in this vital area for chemical process design and simulation.  The
              meetings have also become the most important gatherings for workers from all
              over the world; the Sixth Conference held in 1992 in Cortina d Ampezzo, Italy
              attracted 194 participants form 28 countries.  Each conference has produced
              important collections of papers in Proceedings volumes.  The Six conference
              provided almost 900 pages of reviews and new research when published in the
              international journal Fluid Phase Equilibria.  The Seventh Conference is
              scheduled for June 18-23 1995 in Snowmass/Aspen Colorado, USA with much of the
              same successful format as for the previous Conferences but including some
              significant enhancements.  The proposal requests funds for travel, meals and
              lodging for 25 needy US a cademic researchers to reach the conference site. 
              Those supported would include 12 invited presenters of papers with the rest
              being young research workers who would not be able to attend without such
              support.  No request is made for Meeting activity expenses, for organizing
              committee needs, or for non US
