Abstract    :
              9509139  Keeler   This research involves investigation of a series of unusual
              populations of the tallgrass prarie grass Andropogon gerardii (big bluestem).
              This work focuses on understanding the function, and genetic variation in
              natural populations, specifically intraspecific polypoidy (additional copies of
              the entire genome).   %%%  This study combines population biology and
              ecological genetics  in understanding ploidy variation, a significant challenge
              for botanists. Such a study also has more immediate importance to conservation
              since this species is part of a threatened ecosystem.   ***
