Abstract    :
              DEB-9509123  CLAY     The proposed research will investigate the advantages
              gained by a parasite when it manipulates the reproductive system of its host. 
              The fungus, Atkinsonella hypoxylon, infects the grass Danthonia spicata
              (poverty grass) throughout eastern North America.  The parasite prevents its
              host from mating with other plants and forces it to reproduce only by
              self-fertilization.  The fungus spreads contagiously by spores or by the
              infection of self-fertilized seeds.  The objectives of this research are to
              test the relative importance of these different mechanisms of fungal
              reproduction on fungal reproductive success and to determine the genetic
              changes that result from the parasite's manipulation of host reproduction.    
              The results of this research will reveal how the genetic identity of the host
              affects its susceptibility to parasitism.  This offers great promise in
              advancing our efforts in agronomy for the development of pest-resistant crops. 
              The mode of parasite transmission is also of great interest because it appears
              to play a central role in the development of less damaging host/parasite
              relationships.  Many significant human diseases have the same pattern of
              transmission.  By altering the primary mode of transmission of the parasite
              from contagious spread to transmission to host offspring, it may be possible to
              reduce the severity of parasite infections in human populations.
