Abstract    :
              9509286  Lively    Parasites can dramatically influence the behavior of their
              hosts.  Such behavioral changes can sometimes benefit the parasite by
              increasing its probability of being transmitted to another host.  Preliminary
              studies have demonstrated that a trematode parasite, Microphallus sp., causes
              of significant behavioral change in the freshwater snail, Potamopyrgus
              antipodarum.  This research will experimentally determine if the behavioral
              change is simply a byproduct of parasitism, or if it is an adaptive strategy on
              the part of the parasite to increase the likelihood that infected snails are
              eaten by the final host in the life cycle, ducks.  These ideas will be tested
              by determining the effect of food deprivation on the behavior of infected and
              uninfected snails, as well as determining the removal rates of infected snails
              from the population by waterfowl and predators that cannot serve as final hosts
              for the parasite.    This study will be the first to begin to examine the
              interaction of host and non-host predators in shaping host-parasite
              relationships. These types of studies are important because models of parasite
              spread in populations usually assume that transmission is a random event. 
              However, this clearly is not the case.  Since many trematode parasites of
              snails also infect humans and domestic livestock as a final host, an
              understanding how the parasite affects the behavior of intermediate hosts may
              lead to better control measures.
