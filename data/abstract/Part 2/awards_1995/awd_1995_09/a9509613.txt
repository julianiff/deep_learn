Abstract    :
              9509613  Rastetter  Multiple Resource Interactions and Ecosystem Function
              Terrestrial ecosystems perform many important functions including the cycling
              and sequestration of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and water, and the
              production of biomass and soil organic matter.  These functions are tightly
              constrained by (1) the nutritional requirements of plants and soil
              microorganisms, (2) the ability of plants and microorganisms to adapt to
              changes in their environment, (3) the amounts of various nutrients in the
              ecosystem, and (4) the rate at which these nutrients are supplied to or lost
              from the ecosystem.  This study will synthesize the effects of these various
              constraints on ecosystem function through the development mf a theoretical
              model that includes the interactions between ecosystem element cycles, the
              acclimation of vegetation and soil microorganisms to changes in the
              availability of these elements, and the changes in species composition
              resulting from competition for the elements.  The results will improve the
              understanding of both ecosystem biogeochemistry and community processes, should
              result in closer linkage between ecosystem and community ecology, will help to
              predict and interpret the responses of ecosystems and plant communities to
              changes in the environment, and will help explain why different ecosystems
              respond differently to changes in the environment.  ??
