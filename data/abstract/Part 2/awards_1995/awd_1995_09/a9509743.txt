Abstract    :
              9509743  Krotscheck  Theoretical research will be conducted on strongly 
              correlated many-body systems.  Existing models will be  applied to experiments
              and suggestions for new experiments  will be made.  In other areas where there
              are deficiencies  in existing theoretical methods, the appropriate theory will 
              be developed.  Problems to be addressed include excitations  of helium-four
              films and clusters; the description of  adsorbed helium-three films and
              droplets, and in particular  quasi-two-dimensional and layered electronic
              structures; and  the formulation and implementation of a theory of 
              multiparticle-multihole excitations analogous to the multi-  phonon theory for
              bosons.  %%%  This theoretical research will deal with the formalism and 
              applications of systems of many strongly interacting  particles.  Of particular
              interest are low temperature  systems such as liquid helium which exhibit
              quantum  properties.  Connection will be made to recent experiments.  ***
