Abstract    :
              Collaborative: Alternate States and Ecosystem Metabolism in Lakes: Interactions
              of Nutrients and DOC Some lakes are blue, but most are green or brown.  We have
              learned a great deal about eutrophication, the process that turns lakes green
              and leads to nuisance blooms of algae.  Dystrophy, the process that turns lakes
              brown, is less understood but has important interactions with fisheries, gas
              flow to and from lakes, and cycling of metals such as mercury.  This project
              will study the interactions of biogeochemical inputs and food web structure
              that control dystrophy and eutrophy in lakes.  We will quantify conditions that
              lead to change in lake ecosystem state, and assess responses of ecosystem
              production, respiration, gas exchange, and energy sources for fish production. 
              This research is a collaborative study by limnologists, microbial ecologists,
              biogeochemists and fish ecologists.  We will conduct a three year program of
              whole lake experiments and modeling studies to find the mechanisms, response
              rates, and constraints associated shifts from eutrophy to dystrophy and vi ce
              versa.
