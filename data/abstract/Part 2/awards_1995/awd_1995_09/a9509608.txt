Abstract    :
                  9509608  McHugh      Recycling polymers and copolymers is a technological
              problem that must be addressed if the amount of solid waste being landfilled in
              the United States is to be reduced.  The challenge is to develop technology
              that performs the recycling in an economic manner without the concomitant
              generation of solvent waste that would negate any environmental benefits.  Many
              researchers have suggested decomposing polymers into their building blocks
              using supercritical water.  a different scenario is suggested in this program
              where the copolymer is converted into an alternate structure that potentially
              has higher commercial value than the starting material.  The envisioned
              conversion process would use near-critical water rather than supercritical
              water which reduces the thermal energy requirements of the process.  The
              differences in the solubility characteristics of the various polymers and
              copolymers in the near-critical solution would facilitate separating one type
              of copolymer from another.    The successful development of this new
              conversion/recycling process to a great extent depends on a good understanding
              of these copolymers in the process solvent solution.  However, the focus of
              this proposed study is to determine the feasibility of these ideas rather than
              to develop an in-depth understanding of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the
              process.  Selected solubility and kinetics experiments will be performed to
              highlight the potential of this process.  The successful demonstration of the
              concepts for this new process would create the groundwork for the development
              of a more detailed proposal to determine the thermodynamic, kinetic, and
              separations variables that would insure the economic viability of the process.
