              Learning Bayesian Networks that Contain both Discrete and  Continuous Variables
                 Probabilistic belief networks are increasingly being used to  model belief
              in a great variety of domains in knowledge-based  systems.  Some of the most
              extensive work has been done in the  area of medical knowledge and beliefs, and
              this project  continues previous work in that domain.  One of the problems 
              that has continued to bedevil probabilistic network knowledge  bases, as well
              as other knowledge bases, is knowledge  acquisition.  The goal in this work is
              to enable the use of  medical and other types of databases and Bayesian
              learning  methods to develop probabilistic networks.  The particular type  of 
              probabilistic network structure being used here is called a  Bayesian belief
              network.  The method being investigated uses  two stages.   The first stage is
              a relatively generic technique  for learning the qualitative, structural
              relationships among  the model variables; and the second stage uses
              distribution-  specific techniques for quantifying the relationships among the 
              model variables.  The hypothesis, to be tested on a variety of  simulated and
              real-world databases, is that  this method will  produce more predictively
              accurate Bayesian belief network  models.
