Abstract    :
              9509596   Collett     Cloud chemistry models utilizing explicit treatments of
              cloud microphysics predict that cloud drop composition varies with drop size.
              Recent experimental observations confirm that large and small cloud drops
              typically have quite different chemical compositions. Chemical heterogeneity
              among cloud drop populations can influence removal rates for individual
              solutes, and can also enhance rates of sulfur oxidation relative to rates
              predicted from average cloud water properties. Clouds are major contributors to
              global atmospheric sulfate production. Developing an accurate picture of the
              atmospheric production of sulfate therefore requires an accurate understanding
              of the rate of sulfate production in real, chemically heterogeneous clouds.   
              The primary objective of this project is to characterize variations in cloud
              drop chemistry across the drop size spectrum and determine how much sulfate
              production in clouds is enhanced by chemical heterogeneity among cloud drop
              populations. Data will be collected through simultaneous measurements of the
              chemical composition of multiple drop size classes. Cloud water will be
              collected with two cloud collectors used in previous work (two-stage, and
              three-stage, respectively), as well as a new five-stage instrument to be
              constructed as part of this project. Major ions, pH, free and complexed sulfur
              (IV), oxidants, and catalysts will be measured and used to characterize sulfur
              oxidation rates as a function of drop size.  Measurements of the size-dependent
              aerosol composition and of soluble trace gases also will be made to determine
              the influence of particle and gas scavenging on the drop size-dependence of the
              cloud water composition.
