Abstract    :
              This award provides support for a conference entitled Fermat's Last Theorem to
              be held in August 1995 at Boston University. The conference will focus on two
              major topics: (1) Andrew Wiles' recent proof of the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil
              conjecture for semistable elliptic curves; and (2) the earlier works of Frey,
              Serre and Ribet showing that Wiles' Theorem would complete the proof of
              Fermat's Last Theorem. The conference is aimed primarily at advanced graduate
              students and recent PhD recipients, but it will also be valuable to more
              experienced mathematicians seeking to master the powerful tools used in the
              proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. In addition, about 80 high school students and
              undergraduates from Boston University's PROMYS program will join the more
              general conference activities, thereby enhancing these young people's
              experience in PROMYS and reinforcing that mathematics is a flourishing modern
              research activity.    The themes of the conference belong to the general
              mathematical area of Arithmetic Geometry. This ultramodern research area
              combines two of the oldest branches of mathematics: number theory and geometry.
              The new insights arising out of this combination are producing increasingly
              powerful tools to solve longstanding problems like Fermat's Last Theorem, which
              have resisted the strongest efforts of over three centuries of mathematicians.
              In addition, though Arithmetic Geometry is sometimes regarded as among the
              purest of pure mathematics, it has also been developing insightful new
              techniques leading to dramatic progress in such applied areas as
              error-correcting codes and cryptography.
