Abstract    :
              9509195  Zelditch  This research will extend studies of the ontogeny (the
              development of single individuals from egg to adult) of body form to be
              informative about phylogeny, and to provide information that was not available
              from comparisons of other body features. The proposed research will extend
              these studies of the ontogeny of body form, as part of an ongoing revision of
              piranha fishes.   %%%  The significance of the work is that it involves use of
              a novel morphometric method and  investigation of the strengths and weaknesses
              of this method and its utility to systematic biology. Specifically, the
              research will address general questions regarding the relationship between
              ontogeny and phylogeny. One general question concerns the potential constraints
              that ontogeny may impose on morphological evolution. A commonly invoked
              constraint is Odevelopmental integrationO the association among the parts of an
              ontogeny. One specific hypothesis is that developmentally integrated features
              will exhibit congruent phylogenetic patterns because, in effect, they are not
              independent characters. This has been an important issue in systematics and
              evolutionary morphology and will be examined in this research.  ***
