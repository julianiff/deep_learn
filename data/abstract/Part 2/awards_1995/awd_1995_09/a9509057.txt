Abstract    :
              9509057  KOEPFLER  RUI: The Role of Oyster Reefs in the Structure and Function
              of Tidal Creeks  Oyster reefs are present in great abundance in small tidal
              creek ecosystems of the coastal southeastern United States. Oyster reefs may
              strongly regulate the biological communities and the physical and chemical
              characteristics of these ecosystems. This project uses a multidisciplinary,
              integrated field and laboratory design to study the role of oyster reefs in
              tidal creeks. A rigorous statistical design is employed to determine biological
              and physical effects. This study investigates the consequences of the removal
              of oyster reefs, a process that has occurred on a larger scale by human
              influences in many areas of the world.
