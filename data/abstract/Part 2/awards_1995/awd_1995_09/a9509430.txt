Abstract    :
                    This action funds a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in  Biosciences
              Related to the Environment for 1995.  This  program of fellowships to
              individuals provides opportunities  for Fellows to gain additional scientific
              training beyond  the doctoral degree and to pursue innovative and imaginative 
              research into the fundamental mechanisms underlying the  interactions between
              organisms and their environment at the  molecular, cellular, organismal,
              population, community,  and/or ecosystem level in any area of biology supported
              by  the Directorate for Biological Sciences of the National  Science
              Foundation.  This program is designed to enable  selected scientists early in
              their careers to improve and  expand their research skills, to direct their
              research  efforts across traditional disciplinary lines, and to avail 
              themselves of unique research resources and facilitites,  including foreign
              locations.    The research and training plan supported by this fellowship  is
              entitled:  Constitutive freezing tolerant mutants in  Arabidopsis.
