Abstract    :
                          9509189  Auer  One group of plant hormones, the cytokinins,
              influence many  fundamental aspects of plant growth including shoot, root  and
              leaf development.  The active cytokinins in the plant  are delicately regulated
              by complex enzymatic metabolism  pathways which also control cytokinin
              transport, storage and  inactivation.  While single-gene plant mutants have
              been  used to study the biochemistry of other plant hormones, no  cytokinin
              metabolism mutants have been reported in higher  plants.  In this project,
              Arabidopsis thaliana cytokinin  metabolism mutants will be selected using a
              combination of  biochemical and visual screening procedures.  The cytokinin 
              metabolism mutants will be used in plant physiology,  biochemistry, plant
              development and genetic experimelts.  In  the future, this research will allow
              the genetic control of  cytokinins within plants and the modification of 
              agricultural crop plants to increase sustainable  productivity.
