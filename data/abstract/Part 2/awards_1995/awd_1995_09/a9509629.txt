Abstract    :
              The Office of Special Projects of the Chemistry Division and the Solid State
              Chemistry and Polymers Program of the Division of Materials Research in support
              of the Advanced Materials Processing Program are funding Dr. Seth Marder of the
              California Institute of Technology to organize and run three annual NSF
              Materials Chemistry Workshops.  These workshops provide an opportunity for
              informal discussion among scientists with diverse backgrounds emphasizing
              progress, research ideas, and directions in the growing area of materials
              chemistry. Attendance will be by application, including a one-page abstract of
              the research area to be discussed.  Selection of approximately 30 applicants
              will be based on merit by a committee chosen by the organizers which includes
              participants from the previous workshops.  Participants will be drawn from
              universities, industry, and government laboratories at all stages of careers
              and backgrounds.  Junior faculty, women, and underrepresented minorities will
              be strongly encouraged.  Two discussion leaders will be invited in addition to
              the thirty speaking participants.   Each participant will make a 30-minute
              presentation followed by a compulsory discussion period of at least 10 minutes.
                  The goals of the three-day weekend sessions will be to provide a format for
              lively discussion and to produce a document which provides a consensus of
              opinion for the future of materials chemistry education and research.  Such
              discussion will help identify new directions and opportunities for chemists and
              chemistry in NSF's Advanced Materials and Processing Program.
