Abstract    :
              Huete, Alfredo    In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global
              Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment Program (GLOBE) this
              project is designed to meet the GLOBE goals and objectives of linking
              scientists and schoolchildren in a global information network with the ultimate
              goal of better understanding the Earth's environment and changes that take
              place within it. This proposal to GLOBE PHASE II has as its primary intent to
              develop data collection, data analysis, related curricula and a computer
              interface with pre-college educational programs within the U.S. and abroad in
              the area of soil moisture measurements. Several important scientific issues
              regarding the aggregation, representation and utility of direct soil moisture
              measurements for the purpose of improving and validating satellite-derived and
              model-derived soil moisture will be addressed with the data collected through
              this effort. Soil moisture deserves special focus, because: it represents the
              temporal and spatial variable state  of the land/atmosphere interface, it is a
              critical factor in plant and animal productivity and because there is an
              overwhelming need for a widely distributed ground measurement network that only
              this kind of proposal can satisfy.
