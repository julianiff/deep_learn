Abstract    :
              9509348  Hershey  RUI: Landscape Control of Trophic Status in Arctic Alaskan
              Lakes  This project tests the importance of geomorphology in determining food
              web structure for lakes on the North Slope of Alaska. Lake outflow gradient,
              lake depth, and lake area are postulated to be important controls on the fish
              species composition of lakes in this region. The structure of the fish
              community is then predicted to play a major role in the structure of the entire
              food web of these lakes. The hypotheses will be tested with remote sensing
              data, synthetic aperature radar (SAR) for determining lake thawing rates, and
              field surveys. These remote lakes, unimpacted by fish species introductions by
              humans, allow a rigorous test of the interactions between geomorphology and
              food webs of lake ecosystems.
