Abstract    :
              9509826  Berenbaum    The interactions between the parsnip webworm, an
              introduced plant-feeding insect, and the wild parsnip, an introduced weed that
              serves as its principal host throughout its range, is one of very few natural
              systems in which estimates have been made of the ability of an insect to select
              for chemically based resistance in its hostplant.  To date, attention in this
              system has focused on the role of furanocoumarins, insecticidal compounds
              produced by the plant, in conferring resistance against the insect.  The focus
              of this proposal is to determine whether plant primary metabolites, which may
              serve as nutrients for insects, are under selection by insect herbivores.  The
              hypothesis that plant nutritional quality can evolve in response to insect
              herbivory has remained effectively untested for almost two decades.  This study
              is one of few to examine the consequences of variation in plant primary
              metabolites on insect resistance and as such can be used to evaluate that
              hypothesis and its implication for studies of plant/insect interactions.    In
              addition to its importance to basic studies, this project has implications for
              the management of crop-consuming pest species.  There is currently interest in
              developing novel mechanisms to reduce pest problems in agroecosystems and at
              the same time reduce chemical inputs to those systems.  Because humans do not
              feed exclusively on a single plant species, as do many phytophagous insects,
              selective breeding for altered nutrient levels in plants may lead to reductions
              in insect damage in the absence of chemical inputs, with little or no adverse
              impacts on human consumers.
