Abstract    :
              The central theme of this research is the development of a fuller  theoretical
              description of the behavior of memoryless-error-  function (or Bussgang) type
              blind equalization algorithms, in  particular CMA, as used in practice with
              finite-length, fractional  spacing, higher-order (non-constant modulus,
              non-uniformly  distributed) source constellations, (deterministic and
              stochastic)  correlated source time series, and modest channel noise.  The 
              initial target is the behavior of fractionally-spaced CMA with a  correlated
              (or periodic) source, which appears capable of causing  misbehavior in
              practice.  We plan to use analytical tools from  topologically based,
              algebraic-geometry (in particular Bernstein's  theorem, relaxation methods, and
              Morse theory) non typically  associated with the study of adaptive filters in
              addition to  averaging theory tools popular in adaptive systems analysis.  The 
              ultimate intent is to convert an expanded theory into situation  dependent
              design guidelines for stepsize, length, fractional-  spacing, initialization
              selection, and failure recovery tricks for  the use of CMA as a start-up scheme
              (with a subsequent switch to  decision-direction) for high data throughput
              applications.    We plan to translate our analytical advances on CMA to 
              fractionally-spaced realizations of other blind equalizer  algorithms of the
              memoryless error function class (including  refinements to CMA), for which
              actual operating data can be  obtained industrially as for CMA.  We also plan
              to use our behavior  insights into CMA to help provide fair comparisons on
              actual  operating data to competing schemes such as symbol-spaced decision 
              feedback equalizers and similar complexity algorithms based on  second-order
              correlation statistics of single-input, multiple-  output models of
              fractionally-spaced equalization.
