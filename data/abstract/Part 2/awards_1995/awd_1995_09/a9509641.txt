Abstract    :
              9509641  Harrison    This grant provides funds for operations and maintenance
              support  of the CAMECA ims-1270 high transmission, high resolution ion 
              microprobe at UCLA as a world class microanalysis facility.  This  is the first
              instrument of its kind in the U.S. and in the  generation of new instruments
              designed to analyze the isotopic  and elemental composition of terrestrial and
              planetary materials  at the micro-scale and has great potential to provide
              major  advances in our understanding of geochemical processes.  Support  will
              be in the amount of $600,000 over a three year period and  follows a two year
              grant which supported the initial  commissioning of this instrument and the
              development of  measurement routines for U-Th-Pb analyses of zircon and 
              monzanite.  It is expected that a significant user-base will be  established
              for these analyses by the end of this three-year  period.  Development of
              measurement techniques for the oxygen  isotopic composition in electrically
              insulating samples and  Thorium isotope systematics will continue and hopefully
              become  available to the isotope geochemical community.      ***
