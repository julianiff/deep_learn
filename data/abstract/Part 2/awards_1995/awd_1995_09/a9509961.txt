Abstract    :
              9509961  Salters       The study will determine the partition coefficients for
              U,  Th, Pb, Sm, Nd, Lu, Hf, and Ar for mantle minerals to better  constrain the
              melting process that yields mid-ocean ridge  volcanism.  The partitioning will
              be determined by analyses of  experimentally grown crystals and coexisting melt
              by ion  microprobe, and by isotope dilution analyses of naturally  occurring
              mineral-mineral pairs.  ***
