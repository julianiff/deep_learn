Abstract    :
              9509548  LANGLEY   The goal of this research is a quantitative understanding of
              the forces determining molecular genetic variation and divergence between
              species.  Such understanding of the effects of mutation, recombination, natural
              selection and genetic drift is fundamental to effective applications in
              agricultural, conservation and medical genetics.   The first project is a
              thorough and quantitative survey of DNA sequence variation at four genes near
              the tip of the X chromosome (where crossing over is much reduced) in four
              populations of Drosophila melanogaster.  Several currently viable hypotheses
              attempt to explain the consistently observed reduction of heterozygosity in
              these regions of the genome.  These models will be tested with the data from
              this survey.  The second experiment is a parallel survey in D. simulans that
              will provide a "replication" and allow a careful analysis of the relationship
              between variation and divergence.
