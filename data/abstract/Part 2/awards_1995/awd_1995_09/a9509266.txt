Abstract    :
              9509266  Ko       In nucleus-nucleus collisions at relativistic  velocities, a
              piece of matter with temperature and density  similar to that in the early
              universe after the Big Bang and  the interior of neutron stars can be created. 
              In this  proposal, we shall investigate the properties of this hot  dense
              matter using both effective Lagrangians and models  that are based on the
              quantum chrodynamics.  In particular,  hadron masses and couplings at finite
              densities and  temperatures will be studied since they are expected to be 
              significantly modified in a medium.  Including these medium  effects in the
              relativistic transport model allows a  realistic description of heavy ion
              collisions at energies  available from present accelerators.  The study of
              dilepton  production from these collisions will then provide direct 
              information on the properties of the hot dense matter due to  the relatively
              weak interactions of dileptons in matter.  The production of strange particles
              will also be  investigated as they offer another promising probe of the  hot
              dense matter as a result of strangeness conservation.  Our long range goal is
              to extend the relativistic transport  model to include the quark and gluon
              degrees of freedom so  that one can describe nuclear collisions at future 
              relativistic heavy ion colliders in which a quark-gluon  plasma is expected to
              be formed in the initial stage. the  proposed study makes it possible to
              identify the existence  of the quark-gluon plasma and to study its properties.
