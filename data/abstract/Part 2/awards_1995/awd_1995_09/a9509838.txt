Abstract    :
              9509838  Olvera de la Cruz    This project studies phase segregation in ternary
              polymer  blends.  Ternary mixtures can decompose into two or three  phases. 
              The investigator is studying the kinetics of the  separation process when the
              mixture is unstable against the  formation of two phases and stable,
              metastable, and/or  unstable to the formation of a third phase.  The work 
              extends preliminary work on symmetric ternary blends in two  dimensions into
              non-symmetric blends in three dimensions.  She will also investigate
              equilibrium interfacial profiles  between two phases in ternary systems.  %%% 
              Much of the current theoretical effort in understanding  polymer mixtures
              involves the process in which molecules  that were first completely mixed form
              structures in which  like polymers stay close together.  This happens, for 
              example, in reaction to a drop in temperature.  The precise  scales and shapes
              of the sometimes wormlike structure of  these separate phases, called the
              microstructure, is  responsible for many of the properties of these materials. 
              Practitioners seek the understanding of how to get the  particular
              microstructure that they believe will give the  desired properties.  This
              research fits into this field by  being the first to go beyond previous studies
              on binary  (twocomponent) blends to three-component (ternary) blends. 
              Practical systems are almost always composed of more than  two components, so
              this work is particularly relevant to  real materials.  ***
