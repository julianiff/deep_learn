Abstract    :
                This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh in the
              purchase of a cluster of SGI  Indigo workstations.  This equipment will enhance
              research in a number of areas including the  following:  (a) simulation of the
              properties of clusters and colloidal suspensions, (b) the  investigation of the
              dynamics of excited molecules in condensed phases, (c) the modeling of 
              electron transfer reactions in donor-bridge-acceptor compounds and proteins,
              (d) the use  of electronic structure calculations to characterize
              electronically excited states, and (e) to  study reactions of hydrogen on
              silicon surfaces, and the design of optical waveguides.  On  the instructional
              side, the proposed workstations will be used in several undergraduate and 
              graduate courses to introduce our students to modern methods in molecular
              modeling and  theoretical chemistry.    A workstation network of fast, modern
              computer workstations is a new way to satisfy the   computing needs of
              chemistry departments.  Such a "computer network" also serves as a  
              development environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides
              state-of-the-art  graphics and visualization facilities and supports research
              in state-or-the-art applications  of  parallel prmcessing.
