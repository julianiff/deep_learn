Abstract    :
              9509551  Gatesy   This research involves the evolution of milk casein genes. In
              this project, DNA sequence data bearing on the molecular origin of k-casein, a
              stabilizing component of the nutritional milk micelle will be collected and
              interpreted. Two major questions will be addressed: 1) Are casein genes useful
              for the reconstruction of evolutionary relationships among mammals, and 2)
              Where did caseins come from?.   %%%   Through phylogenetic analysis of DNA
              sequences from k-casein, g-fibrinogen, and b-casein (a calcium sensitive
              casein), a major physiological breakthrough can be explored from a molecular
              evolutionary perspective.   ***
