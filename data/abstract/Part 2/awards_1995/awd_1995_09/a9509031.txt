               $5,000 will be granted to U. S. University advanced  graduate students and
              young Ph.D. researchers to present  their research and participated in the 1995
              International  Conference on Plasma Sciences to be held at Madison,  Wisconsin
              from June 5-8, 1995.  It is anticipated that there  will be 450 attendees at
              the conference including a  substantial international contingent.  New areas
              such as advanced  plasma processing of materials,  new computational methods in
              simulating plasmas and electron  beams, advanced concepts in vacuum
              electronics, new topics  in controlled fusion and pulsed power and industrial 
              electronics will be given  priority.
