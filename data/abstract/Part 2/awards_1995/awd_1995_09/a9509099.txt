Abstract    :
                  9509099  Wedeen    the investigator will determine whether homologs of genes
              that  control development in an animal like the fruit fly, that generates  all
              of its segments simultaneously, can control development in an  animal like the
              leech, that adds segments progressively.  She will  examine the expression
              patterns of genes that are likely to be  involved in organizing body pattern in
              the leech embryo, Helobdella  triserialis.  The genes to be examined are
              homologs of the genes  engrailed, cubitus interruptus-Dominant, wingless and
              hedgehog that  are expressed in stripco in the embryo of the fruit fly,
              Drosophila  melanogaster, and have been shown in that insect to be required for
               normal development of embryonic segments.  The cells in the leech  embryo
              expressing these genes will be identified by their cell  lineage and will be
              ablated by laser to examine what role these  cells play in embryonic
              development.
