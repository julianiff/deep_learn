Abstract    :
              9509900  DEYOUNG  The general thrust of this proposal will be to examine the 
              behavior of nuclear matter as one moves from normal cold  conditions to highly
              excited conditions using the tool of heavy-  ion collisions.  Specifically we
              propose to measure: light  charged particle coincidences with intermediate mass
              fragments  (IMFs) to determine timescales at higher energies, angular 
              distributions of IMFs in coincidence with a heavy residue over a  range of
              energies, neutron-neutron correlation measurements at  lower energies, and
              coincidences between pre-equilibrium light  particles and heavy products at
              intermediate energies. We also  propose to continue a small effort directed
              towards development  of trigger algorithms and simulations for the STAR
              collaboration  at RHIC.  In addition to our own ambitious experimental program,
               we will also support collaborative effopts proposed by others,  such as the
              anticipated measurements of the spin dependence of  particle emission from
              compound systems, investigations of highly  excited systems that do not
              fragment and additional measurements  of excited nuclei which do disintegrate. 
              Undergraduate students  from Hope College will be involved in all aspects of
              these  proposed experiments, and included on the publications that will 
              result.***
