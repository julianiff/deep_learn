Abstract    :
                This action funds a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in  Biosciences Related
              to the Environment for 1995.  This  program of fellowships to individuals
              provides opportunities  for Fellows to gain additional scientific training
              beyond  the doctoral degree and to pursue innovative and imaginative  research
              into the fundamental mechanisms underlying the  interactions between organisms
              and their environment at the  molecular, cellular, organismal, population,
              community,  and/or ecosystem level in any area of biology supported by  the
              Directorate for Biological Sciences of the National  Science Foundation.  This
              program is designed to enable  selected scientists early in their careers to
              improve and  expand their research skills, to direct their research  efforts
              across traditional disciplinary lines, and to avail  themselves of unique
              research resources and facilitites,  including foreign locations.    The
              research and training plan supported by this fellowship  is entitled:
              Photperiodic control of Neuroendocrine  function.
