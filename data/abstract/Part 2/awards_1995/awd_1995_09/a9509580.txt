Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9509580    The objective of this effort is to relate the
              energetics of carbon-chlorine bond dissociation in hydrodechlorination to
              catalyst performance under industrially relevant conditions.  This is a
              collaborative effort combining surface-science measurements of reaction
              kinetics on palladium (111), done at Carnegie Mellon University, with reaction
              studies at atmospheric pressure catalyzed by supported palladium particles,
              performed at the University of Pittsburgh.  A common set of selectively
              fluorinated chloromethanes and chloroethanes serves to link the surface-science
              and catalytic investigations.  Both studies measure heats of adsorption,
              apparent activation energies, intrinsic activation energies, and rate
              constants.  Linear free-energy relationships are used to determine whether
              carbon-chlorine bond dissociation is homolytic or heterolytic, and predict the
              effects of modifiers.    This is a study of the conversion of
              chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) into hydroflourocarbons (HFCs).  The results are
              also applicable to the destruction of chlorocarbons at low temperature.  Thus
              the study has direct impact both on the manufacture of refrigerants and blowing
              agents and on the environmental management of cleaning agents.
