Abstract    :
              9509164  Yatani  The voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel is a multi-subunit membrane-
               spanning protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of a  variety of
              cell functions.  The long-term goal of this research is  to understand the
              physiological regulation of ion channels in the  cardiovascular system.  The
              identification of the mechanism  underlying sympathetic modulation of the
              cardiac L-type Ca2+  channel is a key step in achieving this goal.  Specific
              aims are:  (1) To establish an useful expression system in which the molecular 
              events which govern  AR/L-type Ca2+ channel interactions can be  deducted; (2)
              To define the relative contribution of  -adrenergic  subtypes ( 1AR and  2AR)
              to cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel regulation.   The receptor subtype-specific
              regulation (both direct and indirect  responses) will be compared in
              transfected cells; and (3) To  investigate, at the molecular level, the regions
              of the  AR which  are critical for subtype-specific interactions with the Ca2+ 
              channel.  %%%  The long-term goal of this research is to understand the 
              physiological regulation of ion channels in the cardiovascular  system.  The
              research will take advantage of the cloning of the  distinct beta-adrenergic
              receptor ( AR) subtypes and of the cardiac  Ca2+ channel, and examine directly
              the regulatory mechanisms of    AR on the Ca2+  channel at the molecular level.
               The results  obtained from this research will serve as an initial data base
              for  a more thorough study of the physiological regulation of ion  channels.
