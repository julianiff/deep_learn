Abstract    :
              9509539  Poolla         The objective of proposed research is to develop 
              computational tools that bridge the gap between classical system 
              identification and robust control, and to understand the  fundamental limits of
              system identification, particularly in the  context of feedback control.       
               The proposed research will make the connection between  control and
              identification more transparent, and allow users to  make intelligent decisions
              on identification methodologies,  experiment designs, and model validation . 
              The project will have  implications in connecting learning and information
              theory to  identification, in general Monte Carlo methods, and in adaptive 
              regulation of time-varying systems.         The topics include deterministic
              methods for model  validation, sample-data model validation, statistical
              methods for  model validation, methods for generating robust control 
              compatible uncertainty models from input-output data, and  determining
              fundamental limits of system identification imposed  by time-variation and
              noise.   ***
