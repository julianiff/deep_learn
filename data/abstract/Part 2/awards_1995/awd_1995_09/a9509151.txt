Abstract    :
              9509151  Hodge   This research proposes to examine the role of intraguild
              predation (predatory interactions between different species which use similar
              resources) in determining the population dynamics of several congeneric species
              of wolf spiders and their prey. The goals of the project are to characterize
              the life histories of these spiders, and determine whether they interact as
              competitots, predators, or both. This will be accomplished using field
              enclosures in which the relative densities of digfferent species will be
              manipulated to test competing hypotheses.  %%%   This research will contribute
              to our understanding of food-web dynamics. Knowlewdge of the effects of
              competitive and predatory interactions among spiders has relevance in the
              larger context of determining the relative roles of  top down  versus  bottom
              up  effects in structuring food webs.   ***
