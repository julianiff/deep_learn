Abstract    :
              Boltonia decurrens is on the Federal list of threatened plant species; and is
              currently  threatened in Illinois and endangered in Missouri.  Its endangered
              status is due to habitat loss  resulting from channelization of the Mississippi
              and Illinois Rivers.  Following a disastrous flood in  the American Midwest in
              1993, state and federal agencies are re-evaluating flood control policies, 
              including the effects they have on floodplain plant species.  The present
              project will enable us to  acquire knowledge concerning the habitat
              requirements of  B. decurrens, the effects of floodplain  hydrology on the
              species, and how new management practices can be implemented to reserve
              suitable  habit for it and other threatened floodplain species.  The project
              will yield the most complete  picture of an endangered species ever obtained,
              and result in a model that can be applied to other  species in similar
              environmental systems.  This knowledge will reduce the waste of valuable
              resources  by avoiding the  hit or miss  preservation efforts which result from
              conservation actions in the  absence of sound biological knowledge.
