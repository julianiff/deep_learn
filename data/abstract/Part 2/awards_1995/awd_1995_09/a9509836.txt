Abstract    :
              9509836  RITZWOLLER    This research is to use the normal modes of the earth at
              low  frequency (less than 12 mHZ) and long-wavelength (l less than 21)  to
              study the earth's mantle and core.  Data quantity has been  increased by an
              order of magnitude over previous studies, and  recent large deep events present
              normal modes for analysis that  have never before been clearly observed. 
              Concerning the mantle,  elastic constraints will be particularly useful for
              estimating  structures in the transition zone and the outer lower mantle where 
              current mantle models differ most appreciably and in providing  better
              information about the variations of Vs/Vp.  With respect to  the core, focus
              will be on modes sensitive to the anisotropic inner  core and the deep outer
              core.    ***
