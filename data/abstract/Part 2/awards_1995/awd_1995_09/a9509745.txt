Abstract    :
                  With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Grubbs of Caltech
              will develop  the methodology for preparing polymeric materials using metal
              catalysts.  These investigations  will include several metals (Ru, Mn, W, Ir
              and Os), a myriad of cyclic olefins with and without  functional substituents
              and an aqueous suspension for the reaction medium.  Success will benefit  the
              polymer industry significantly.    This project will develop new methodology
              for preparing polymers which will be beneficial to  industry and the materials
              field.  Such procedures will save valuable natural resources and will  be more
              environmentally friendly than existing processing.
