Abstract    :
              Wireless technology is gaining popularity very rapidly. Many predict a new
              emerging market where millions of mobile users will carry small,
              hand-heldterminals, capable of communicating over a wireless connection. Mobile
              users will mostly need location dependent information such as local yellow
              pages, traffic reports, shopping information, local directions, etc. Mobility,
              bandwidth and energy limitations are the main new factors which have to be
              taken under consideration in the design of wireless information services. Three
              basic modes of wireless information dissemination are defined: (1) publishing,
              (2) delta publishing, and (3) on demand. The publishing mode is the most energy
              efficient scheme as it does not require the clients to submit uplink requests
              to the Mobile Support Station (MSS) but just listen to the downlink stream of
              data periodically broadcast by the MSS on its downlink channel. However, data
              which is published has to be very carefully organized and multiplexed with the
              directory information. Tradeoffs between different dissemination modes are
              investigated, with the goal of developi ng energy efficient access methods from
              battery powered clients. Different caching strategies in the context of
              frequent client  disconnections are also investigated. Finally, the
              implementation of the above methods in the form of  prototypical wireless
              information server (kiosk) is provided.
