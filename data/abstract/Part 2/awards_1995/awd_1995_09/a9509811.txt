Abstract    :
                This award is made in the Organic Dynamics Program is support of Dr. J. Kerry
              Thomas'  continuing research on radiation-induced reactions in organized and
              constrained media.  Reactive  intermediates will be generated by photochemical
              or radiation excitation of pyrene or other  adsorbed species trapped in
              zeolites, silica, or a host of polymers such as polystyrene,  polyethylene,
              polymethyl methacrylate, polyacrylonitrile, polyvinyl chloride and polyvinyl 
              alcohol.  Depending on the system selected, electrons (e-), holes (h+),
              cations, cation-radicals,  anions, and/or free radicals will be generated, and
              their reactivity, motion, and energy-transfer  properties monitored by their
              fluorescence, phosphorescence, and absorption spectra.  These  techniques will
              reveal unique trapping sites for ions in solid media and will monitor migration
               of energy and charge in excited polymers, to soluble probe molecules.    The
              behavior of reactive intermediates in constrained media is relevant to
              heterogeneous catalysis  in the case of zeolites and silica, and to
              understanding the mechanism of light and radiation-  induced degradation of
              polymers.  The action of high-energy radiation on polymers relates to  the use
              of polymers in microelectronics and the use of radiation processing in
              nanolithography.
