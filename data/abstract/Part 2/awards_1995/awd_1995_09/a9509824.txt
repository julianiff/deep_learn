Abstract    :
              Trumbo, Craig  This doctoral dissertation research applies a `social
              amplification of risk` framework to understand cancer concerns held by
              residents near the Ames Laboratory at Iowa State University.  The laboratory
              ran a small research reactor up until 1965.  Members of the community around
              the laboratory now believe that they are part of a cancer cluster, possibly
              caused by the reactor -- a fear that has not been borne out by a recent
              epidemiological study.  Nonetheless, the concern remains.  The CO-PI intends to
              investigate the determinants of residents' concern in this instance using data
              gathered through interviews and focus groups with community members. 
              Particular attention will be paid to the relative contributions of
              psychological, sociological, and cultural factors in shaping the risk
              perceptions of residents around the laboratory. This project will add to
              scientific understanding of risk perception under field conditions and provide
              information that will aid in the efforts of risk communicators.    f8 Û-ª  þ
