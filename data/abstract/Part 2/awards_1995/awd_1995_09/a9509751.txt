Abstract    :
              9509751  Kerkhoven    This research will focus on the development of numerical
              simulation approaches suitable for the analysis and design of nanostructures. 
              The investigations will address quantum wire and quantum dot structures, with
              the goal to develop comprehensive physical and numerical models that can
              explain the results of measurements on experimental nanostructures, in a wide
              range of temperatures.  The work will also consider new structures based on
              modification of existing silicon technology scaled into the nanometer range.  A
              major effort will be in the area of 3-D models, to extend previous work to even
              more realistic situations, and improve the ability to treat extremely large
              numerical problems efficiently.  Among other problems of interest is the
              development of direct numerical approaches for the characterization of atomic
              cluster, like the writing tip of a Scanning Tunneling Microscope  (STM) in
              proximity of the surface of a nanostructure and 3-D solvers for the optical
              behavior of microstructure semiconductor lasers with surface emitting topology.
               For both applications,  the unique approaches that were developed earlier for
              the solution of large sparse eigenvalue problems for semiconductor structures,
              will be adapted and extended.
