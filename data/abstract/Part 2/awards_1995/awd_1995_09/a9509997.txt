Abstract    :
              9509997  Bond       Fast paced cycles of two to three thousand years recorded in
               the North Atlantic cores show apparently synchronous discharge of  icebergs
              from at least two sources on Iceland and the Gulf of St.  Lawrence and may be
              related to mechanisms originating in the  ocean/atmosphere system.  Each cycle
              also correlates with cold  pulses in Greenland ice cores and linked to Heinrich
              events.  The  PI's research will further investigate the role of ice sheets in 
              forcing rapid climate shifts.  If the 2 to 3 thousand-years  cycles persist
              through different glacial/interglacial periods  then they would imply that the
              oscillations operate independently  of large glaciers and originate in the
              atmosphere/ocean system.  ***
