              9509000 Huebner  Abstract      This project involves research in the development
              of statistical methods for stochastic partial differential equations. Two main
              problems are to be investigated. The first concerns the estimation of
              parameters occurring in hyperbolic stochastic partial differential equations,
              while the second concerns the construction of estimators for discretized
              versions of the equations with nonconstant parameters.     The results of this
              project can be applied to areas such as  economics, oceanography, physical
              chemistry, and engineering, where stochastic differential equations often
              represent complex physical systems with random perturbations. The parameters to
              be estimated play a critical role in the design of technological devices and
              are often not known with adequate accuracy.  It is desirable to optimize the
              performance of such devices--both from the standpoint of economy and
              ecology--for a better utilization of resources.
