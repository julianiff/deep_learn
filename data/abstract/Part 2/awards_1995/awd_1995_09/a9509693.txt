Abstract    :
              Marotz   In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global Learning
              and Observations to Benefit the Environment Program (GLOBE) this project is
              designed to meet the GLOBE goals and objectives of linking scientists and
              schoolchildren in a global information network with the ultimate goal of better
              understanding the Earth's environment and changes that take place within it.
              The project intends to conduct a series of progressively more complex
              experiments on global warming using meteorological, trace gas, and aerosol data
              collected by students at five schools arrayed across five different climate
              zones.    The Principal Investigators, Mentor Teachers and Students are linked
              in a structure that mimics the INTERNET in its design: the backbone of the net
              is based on climatic characteristics, and the individual schools represent
              nodes. Results, products, lessons, etc., will be disseminated along the
              INTERNET and on CD-ROM as well as on other media. International cooperation is
              built into the structure of the project.   Training workshops will be offered
              during the summer at the five school locations.   Program evaluation will
              involve students as a principal source.
