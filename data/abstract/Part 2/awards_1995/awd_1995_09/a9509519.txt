Abstract    :
              9509519  Richards   This research involves determination of the evolutionary
              relationships among a African family of treefrogs using molecular sequence
              data. This study will provide baseline data needed for a more comprehensive
              investigation of the evolutionary history of all Old World tree frogs. These
              frogs are distributed in Africa, Madagascar, the Seychelles, Sri Lanka and
              India, land masses with known geological histories. Analysis of the pattern of
              evolutionary relationship among these frogs will allow the testing of
              biogeogpaphic hypotheses concerning their origin and diversification.   %%%  
              This research will contribute to our understanding of the  systematics of Old
              World tree frogs. Prior studies based on morphology have been unable to resolve
              relationships among this group.
