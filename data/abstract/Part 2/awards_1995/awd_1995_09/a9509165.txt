Abstract    :
              IRI-9509165  Peter Haddawy  University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee  $78,038 - 12
              mos.    Practical Decision-Theoretic Planning    The desire to solve practical
              real-world planning problems places  conflicting demands on domain-independent
              planning systems.  The  representation used by the planner must be rich enough
              to capture  all the salient aspects of the application, but at the same time, 
              it must permit the use of efficient algorithms that will scale up  effectively
              to handle large problems.  In planning under  uncertainty, decision theory
              allows the consideration of  tradeoffs among partially satisfiable objectives. 
              But most of  the planning algorithms have either made unrealistic assumptions 
              or been too inefficient for application to large problems.  The  purpose of
              this research is to develop efficient methods by using  abstraction techniques
              which permit a planner to focus on  important aspects of a domain before
              considering details.  Methods of automatically generating abstractions are
              being  developed, along with methods of applying these to planning  problems in
              dynamic environments.  Decision-theoretic planners  are being extended ion
              their representational capabilities with  the goal of not sacrificing
              efficiency. Techniques for efficient  reasoning with probabilistic domain
              theories are being developed.  The tangible products are expected to be a
              theoretical framework  for efficient decision-theoretic planning, ore or more 
              implemented planning systems, a theoretical framework for  probabilistic domain
              modeling using probability logic, and an  implemented inference system for
              constructing Bayesian networks  from knowledge bases of probability logic
              sentences.
