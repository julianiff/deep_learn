                 The objective is to develop microvisualization methods to locate and
              identify precursor sites for pitting corrosion and other forms of localized
              corrosion.  These methods will be used to monitor the effectiveness of
              treatments to remove or passivate the sites and thereby mitigate local attack. 
              Scanned, gold-coated, optical fibers are employed to carry out combined
              photoelectrochemical and electrochemical microscopy (SPECM) to identify
              precursor sites on titanium and titanium alloys.  This technique has been
              successfully used to reveal precursor sites for high purity titanium.  The
              precursor sites are more highly electroactive than the surrounding surface, but
              the sites have lower photocurrent activity.  In order to extend the
              measurements to higher resolution, tapered optical fiber tips are used.  The
              ultimate resolution for the latter measurements is on the order of 10-20
              nanometers, as demonstrated by near-field optical microscopy.  Studies are
              performed in the 100-200 nanometer level as a first step before going to the
              10-20 nanometer range.  The confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) is used
              to obtain rapid photoelectrochemical images to complement the above studies. 
              CLSM is also used for fluorescence microscopy on aluminum alloys to locate
              copper-rich areas.  The latter are sites for cathodic reduction of oxygen, and
              their removal from the surface has been shown to improve the corrosion
              resistance and pitting resistance of aluminum alloys.  %%%  This project
              demonstrates the capability of fluorescence microscopy with the CLSM to monitor
              the surface treatment processes designed to remove cop per inclusions that
              cause pitting corrosion on aluminum.  The combination of the techniques will
              enable a study of nonuniform reactivity on metal surfaces over lateral
              dimensions from tens of nanometers to tens of micrometers and will extend
              understanding of the nature of pitting precursor sites on titanium and other
              metals.  ***   s  t      P  P
