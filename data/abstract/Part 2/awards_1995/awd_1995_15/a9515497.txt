Abstract    :
              INT 9515497  Porod      This U.S.-Hungary cooperative research project between
              Dr. Wolfgang Porod of the University of Notre Dame and Dr. Arpad Csurgay of the
              Technical University of Budapest will examine systems of microelectronic
              information processing that employ locally-interconnected architectures and
              cellular neural networks.  Efforts will focus on use of weakly-coupled quantum
              dot systems, with the intent of identifying system applications of novel
              nanoelectronic devices.  The researchers expect that their results will lead to
              matches in nanoelectronic device implementations with appropriate system
              architectures and computational tasks.  If successful, this research should
              yield new knowledge that will contribute to our ability to match compatible
              architectures for enhanced functionality.    This joint research project
              fulfills the program objective of advancing basic scientific knowledge by
              enabling leading experts in the Untied States and Eastern Europe to combine
              complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of mutual interest
              and competence.         ??
