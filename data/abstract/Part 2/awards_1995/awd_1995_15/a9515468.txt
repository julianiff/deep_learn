Abstract    :
                        9515468  Zirin      This award will support travel over a two year
              period to enable  Dr. Harold Zirin from the Department of Solar Astronomy at
              the   California Institute of Technology to conduct collaborative  research
              with Prof. Peter R. Wilson of the School of Mathematics  and Statistics of the
              University of Sydney.  The cooperative  research will focus on the study of
              solar polar magnetic fields.    The Sun's polar fields are important because
              they are the  dominant feature acting far from the sun in interplanetary space.
                The behavior of the solar polar magnetic fields is one of the  remarkable
              aspects of the sunspot cycle, and of great importance  to solar-terrestrial
              relations.  The project seeks to team up an  ongoing program of polar
              observations conducted at the Big Bear  Solar Observatory in the United States
              and an analysis program at  the University of Sydney where needed software has
              already been  developed.  The combination of investigators should result in new
               insights in the interpretation of the observational data already  collected. 
              The work in Australia is supported through the  Department of Industry, Science
              and Tourism (DIST).
