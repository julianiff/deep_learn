              This award provides funds to support travel and accommodation expenses for
              invited participants in a symposium on "The Scientific Nature of
              Geomorphology," part of the Binghamton Symposium Series (no connection with the
              university or the city), to be held in September 1996 in Champaign, Illinois. 
              The symposium will address the current absence of a strong, unifying,
              intellectual framework for the field of geomorphology.  At stake are issues
              such as the field's origin and self-identification as an earth science, while
              ascendant methods are those of physics and chemistry;  the division between
              "field" and "process" researchers; the general disdain for philosophy of
              science within the field;  and the extent to which philosophies of science
              underlying ecological studies can also inform geomorphology.  The symposium
              will gather people who have written and researched on these matters, and will
              result in a volume to be published by Wiley (production of the volume is not
              part of the budget request).    The symposium and volume could be a landmark in
              the self-conceptualization of a central component of physical geography.
