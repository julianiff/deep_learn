Abstract    :
              9515524  Shapero       A study of nuclear physics will be carried out that  will
              assess the field's status and plans for the future.  This study will be part of
              a larger survey of physics  entitled Physics in a New Era.  This report will
              follow the  previous decade study of physics by the National Research  Council
              of the National Academy of Science ten years ago.  The nuclear physics study
              will be carried out by a committee  of twelve physicists to be appointed by the
              NAS/NRC's Board  of Physics and Astronomy.  ***
