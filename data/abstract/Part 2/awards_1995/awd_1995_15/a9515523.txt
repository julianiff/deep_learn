Abstract    :
              INT 9515523  Sibeck      This U.S.-Czech research project between Dr. David
              Sibeck of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and Dr. Jana
              Safrankova of Charles University, Prague, will examine the processes by which
              solar wind mass, energy, and momentum flow through the magnetosphere and
              ionosphere.  The researchers intend to exchange data sets and correlate studies
              using simultaneous solar wind, magnetosheath, magnetospheric, and ionospheric
              observations taken from the Interball satellite, other space craft, and the
              ground.  Overall results, which will be made available over the Internet, are
              expected to contribute to our understanding of: 1) the manner by which
              processes within the foreshock modify solar wind features; 2) the
              characteristics and causes of magnetopause motion; and 3) the means by which
              variations in solar wind parameters trigger magnetospheric substorms.    This
              joint project in upper atmospheric research fulfills the program objective of
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States
              and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas
              of strong mutual interest and competence.   ??
