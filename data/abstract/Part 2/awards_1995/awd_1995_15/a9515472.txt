Abstract    :
              9515472  Bose  Description:  The International Workshop on  High-Temperature
              Superconductivity: Ten Years  After Its Discovery" will take place at the 
              University of Rajasthan, Jaipur, December 18-  22, 1996. Since its discovery in
              1986, high-  temperature superconductivity research has been  vigorous.  The
              co-organizers are Gautam Sen,  Florida International University and K.V. 
              Subbarao, Indian Institute of Technology,  Bombay.  The Deccan Trap giant lava
              formation  marked the end of the Mesozoic (Dinosaur) era  and the dawn of the
              Cenozoic (Mammal) era.   There is worldwide interest in studying the  origin of
              Deccan Trap lavas and the impact of  this major event on the earth's climate
              and  ecology.  The workshop will access the current  state of Deccan Trap
              research, identify  research priorities, and form working groups  for the
              appropriate research areas.    Scope:  The event is locally sponsored by the 
              Geological Society of India.  Indian  participants include the National
              Geophysical  Research Institute, the Physical Research  Laboratory, and the
              Geological Survey of India.   NSF will provide support for six key  U.S. 
              participants who are considered critical to the  success of the workshop. 
              Proceedings will be  published.   ***
