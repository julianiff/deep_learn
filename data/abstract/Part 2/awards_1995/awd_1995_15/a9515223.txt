Abstract    :
                 The East Coast Nerve Net is a small conference that encourages interaction
              among graduate students, post-doctoral scientists and faculty in an intensive
              weekend.  The conference utilizes the facilities of the Marine Biological
              Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, an outstanding institution for
              biological research, which provides an informal setting.  The presentations
              emphasize participation by young scientists who have not yet presented their
              work at major national or international meetings.  This award helps defray
              participant costs to encourage a few undergraduate students of
              under-represented groups to present their work in talk or poster form.     This
              conference participation will allow a few outstanding undergraduates to gain
              experience and information from their peers and mentors that will be important
              for their career development.
