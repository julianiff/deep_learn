Abstract    :
              Morris  9515226      All electrically excitable cells, such as those in the
              brain and  other organs, are constantly receiving chemical signals in the form 
              of neurotransmitters and hormones.  These chemical messengers  interact with
              specific proteins, called receptors, on the outer  surface of their target
              cells and through changes brought about by  the activation of these receptors,
              transmit their message into the  workings of the cell.  The studies proposed by
              Dr. Morris study one  such message system, the dopamine D2 receptor system. 
              Dopamine is  a small molecule which is crucial for brain communication and 
              organismal function, particularly movement.  Dr. Morris and his  colleagues are
              using sophisticated molecular biological techniques  to develop an easily
              accessible model system in which to study the  events that occur in a cell
              subsequent to dopamine binding to its  cognizant receptor.  This work will
              provide a detailed  understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms activated
              by a  neurotransmitter binding to its receptor and will have major 
              implications on revealing how the brain encodes chemical  information and its
              translation.
