Abstract    :
              INT 9515485  Shields      This U.S.-Hungary mathematics project between Paul C.
              Shields of the University of Toledo and Imre Csiszar and Katalin Marton of the
              Mathematical Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, will examine
              finite-alphabet processes in which both information theory and ergodic theory
              play a role.  The intent is to investigate theoretical possibilities of data
              compression and the performance of data compression algorithms for classes of
              processes.  The researchers also will study related structural problems of
              processes, including very weak Bernoulli processes by employing a "blowing-up"
              property for independent processes.  This joint effort will build upon the U.S.
              partner's strengths in ergodic theory and the Hungarian strengths in
              information theory and statistics.  Results are expected to enhance information
              theory applicable to multi-user processes and conditional measures.    This
              mathematics project in modern analysis fulfills the program objective of
              advancing basic scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the Untied
              States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research
              resources in areas of mutual interest and competence.    ??
