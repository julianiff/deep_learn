Abstract    :
                 One of the most pressing issues in understanding the sense of smell is to  
              understand the mechanisms that carry coded information from the nose into the  
              brain.  The peripheral nerve cells, or neurons, form functional contacts called
                synapses with central neurons.  The first synaptic relay occurs in anatomical
                clusters of cells called glomeruli, sharing this fundamental organization
              across a   wide phylogenetic range animals from lobsters, insects, snails, fish
              and humans.    These cell clusters of olfactory glomeruli, like the neural
              cartridges in vision and   cortical barrels in touch, are thought to play an
              important role in stimulus   recognition, but their role in central olfactory
              recognition remains unknown.  This   project uses physiological,
              pharmacological and immunocytochemical   techniques on the distinct
              morphological regions within the glomeruli in the   lobster as a model system. 
              Results will define the odor selectivity of glomeruli,   and determine the
              extent to which regional post-convergent processing within   and among
              glomeruli can shape the odor selectivity of a glomerulus.     This study will
              give new insight into neural integration of olfaction at the crucial   first
              stage of central processing, and will have an impact beyond simply  
              chemosensory neuroscience to brain function in general, to modeling of neural  
              networks, and to understanding how recognition of environmental stimuli is  
              integrated into behavior.
