Abstract    :
              9515029  Tauman    The series of annual Summer Institutes in Game Theory and
              Economics is designed to stimulate and disseminate new advances in research on
              game theory and its applications, and to make conceptual and methodological
              developments in game theory available to an expanding group of scientists in
              economics ald other disciplines.  Each year the month-long program of
              research-oriented conferences and workshops and an intensive course of
              instruction on a topic of major significance, complemented by a further period
              of informal research activities, will bring together a large international
              group of researchers - a mix of established scholars, junior faculty, and
              graduate students - whose interests represent a diverse array of theoretical
              and applied aspects of game theory.  The programs proposed for 1996-1998 are a
              continuation of the series of Summer Institutes held at Stony Brook in 1990 -
              1995, each of which attract more than 200 participants.  Formal activities
              include a five-day conference with plenary and parallel sessions, and invited
              and contributed papers; two weeks of workshops on selected themes; and one to
              two weeks of intensive instruction on selected topics.  he value of this format
              and approach is evidenced by the success of the previous Institutes.  In the
              summer of 1996 four activities are planned: a five day International
              Conference; a five day workshop on Mechanism Design; a five day workshop on
              Social Learning; and a one week intensive course in Repeated Games.      ??
