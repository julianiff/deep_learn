Abstract    :
              9515439  Mozaffar    Constitutional designs and electoral systems define the
              basic institutional framework of political life in a democracy.  Their choice
              is one of the most important decisions made in new democracies.  Their
              consequences for government stability and for peaceful management of political
              conflicts are important determinants of the survival of new democracies.   
              This investigation undertakes a comparative study of constitutional designs and
              electoral systems in the emerging democracies of  Sub-Saharan Africa.  The
              study addresses three related questions:  1) what are the basic institutional
              characteristics of constitutional designs and electoral systems in Africa's
              emerging democracies?  2)  What factors account for the choice of these
              constitutional designs and electoral systems?  3)  What are their consequences
              for conflict management, for government stability, and for democratic
              consolidation in Africa?    The investigation collects and analyzes data on the
              key institutional features of constitutional designs and electoral systems in
              all 48 African countries which have made, or are scheduled to make, the
              transition to democracy; and the results of presidential and legislative
              elections.  The first type of data are collected for three time period: 
              1945-circa 1965 (decolonization and early postindependence, and largely
              democratic, period); circa 1990 (largely authoritarian period, but also
              including varied democratic experiments); and the post-1990 redemocratization
              period.  The second type of data will be collected for the post-1990 period.   
              This award for Research at an Undergraduate Institution promises to
              considerably enhance our understanding of the topic.  The data set to be
              generated will be of assistance to other scholars interested in the requisites
              of democratic systems.  ***
