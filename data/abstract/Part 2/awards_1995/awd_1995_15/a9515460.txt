Abstract    :
              This award supports the outreach activities of the Merriam Program in Formal
              Theory.  The goal of this program is to create a unique environment for social
              science scholars that combines training and research opportunities in
              mathematical modeling.  NSF support is provided for the following communication
              bridging activities of the Merriam Program:  The Junior Master Classes and a
              conference on the empirical evaluation of mathematical models.  The Junior
              Master Class is an opportunity for young modeling scholars from across the U.S.
              to present their research before a panel of `masters ` or senior mathematical
              modelers from their research field.  The concentrated interaction of these
              seminars permits the participants to explore new modeling directions and leads
              to an enhanced understanding of the modeling process.  The conference on the
              empirical evaluation of mathematical models will bring together data-oriented
              and statistically-trained researchers and mathematical modelers from different
              modeling traditions to address the issue of what it means to gain confidence in
              a mathematical model and how this can be accomplished in the context of
              different types of models.
