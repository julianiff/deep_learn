Abstract    :
              9515061    Baxter    As science education takes center in district reform
              efforts, questions are raised about the impact on student learning, motivation,
              and beliefs about science.  This study attempts to address these questions
              trough a multiphase study integrating both large-scale survey data with
              in-depth descriptions of a sample of elementary classrooms.  Phase one of the
              study proposes to collect data on fourth, fifth, and sixth-grade students
              (prior knowledge, motivation, science understanding, beliefs about science, and
              perceptions of the classroom) and their teachers (perceptions of the classroom)
              in a multiethnic, urban school district recognized for its K-6 hands-on science
              program.  The intent is to examine the relationships among knowledge (prior and
              unit-specific, motivation and interest in science, epistemological beliefs, and
              perceptions of classroom climate for students varying on a number of personal
              characteristics (gender, ethnicity, socio-economic status) and learning
              contexts (science unit, classroom climate, grade level).
