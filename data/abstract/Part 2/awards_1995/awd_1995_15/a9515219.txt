Abstract    :
              Over the last two decades, a constant or growing level of direct  foreign
              investment relative to trade has been observed.  This  fact is at odds with the
              most simple minded theory of direct  investment which is based on the notion
              that firms invest to  avoid trade barriers.  Direct investment has been rising
              faster  than trade during an era in which trade barriers have decreased 
              steadily and dramatically.  Furthermore, the developed countries  are not only
              the major sources of direct investment, they are  also the major recipients. 
              Thus, direct investment is not  primarily a transfer of technology and skills
              from developed to  less developed countries.  Also, a country's multinationals
              are  often concentrated in a few industries, and those industry 
              specializations are not obviously explained by current  conditions.  While it
              is understood why some industries are more  multinationalized than others,
              there is little understanding of  how country characteristics determine and are
              determined by  multinational activity.  The focus of this research is on 
              explaining the causes behind the rapid growth of multinational  activity in an
              environment where trade has concurrently been  liberalized, and the causes for
              differences among countries in  the structure of outgoing investments.  This
              research is  important because it will shed light on a number of important 
              trade issues such as when multinationals transfer technology, do  they augment
              or replace learning that would have occurred in the  recipient country.
