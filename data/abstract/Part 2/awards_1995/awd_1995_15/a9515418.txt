Abstract    :
              9515418  Chupp  Experiments will be carried out using polarization observables
              to  study the nucleon structure and to probe the standard model of  particle
              physics.  The nucleon spin structure will be studied at  SLAC using deep
              inelastic electron scattering from polarized  targets of H, D, and 3He.  At
              MIT/Bates at lower energy  quasielastic electron scattering will be used to
              measure the  electric form factor of the neutron using polarized 3He.  These 
              data will also provide information on the structure of the 3He  nucleus.  As a
              test of the standard model the beta decay of  polarized neutrons will be
              studied at the NIST reactor to search  for time reversal invariance violations.
               All of these  experiments are of high scientific interest to the community. 
              In  these various activities the Michigan group will play an  especially
              important role in the developments and improvements in  the polarized targets,
              particularly those using optical pumping  techniques.  This development,
              carried out a Michigan, provides  excellent training and educational
              opportunities for the  students.  In addition to optical pumping has several
              applied  aspects, such as NMR imaging.  ***
