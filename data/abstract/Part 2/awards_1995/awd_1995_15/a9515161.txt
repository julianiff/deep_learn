Abstract    :
              A Unified Information-Value Approach to Sensitivity Analysis   Models of
              phenomena in physical and social science are quite often subject to sensitivity
              analyses in which analysts evaluate the effects (sensitivity) of the model to
              changes in parameter values.  As models become complex, however, such
              evaluations becomes cumbersome, time consuming and, at times, suspect õ have
              all the relevant combinations of parameter values been considered?  This
              research will examine the possibility of using the `expected value of perfect
              informationn on a parameter or group of parameters as a measure of problem
              sensitivity to those parameters õ a procedure which is both axiomatically sound
              and consistent with expected value maximization.  A retrospective analysis of
              standard sensitivity analyses will also be conducted to see how conclusions
              reached using such methods compare with those suggested by the `expected value
              of perfect informationn approach.
