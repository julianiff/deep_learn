Abstract    :
                  9515467  Wali      This award provides travel support for Dr. Kameshwar Wali
              from the   Physics Department at Syracuse University to conduct collaborative 
              research with Dr. Girish C. Joshi, University of Melbourne School  of Physics. 
              The work will focus on theoretical studies of  elementary particle physics.   
              This project will investigate models for unified theories of  elementary
              particle interactions within the framework of  noncommutative geometry and on
              mathematical objects such as  Octonians.  Noncommutative geometry, as outlined
              by  Prof. A. Connes, promises to be a suitable framework for quantizing  space,
              time and matter.  The investigators propose to study the  role of gravitational
              forces in the structure of magnetic  monopoles, particularly the nonabelian
              magnetic monopoles which  have an extended structure.  The work of Dr. Joshi in
              Australia is  supported through the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism
               (DIST).
