Abstract    :
              Lars J. Olson  University of Maryland - College Park  SBR-9515065    This
              research addresses questions about the management,  conservation, extinction
              and sustainability of natural and  environmental resources.  Many of the
              critical natural resource  and environmental issues facing society are those
              where the  resource stock or environmental amenity affects social welfare  and
              where the stock changes over time in response to human  decisions and other
              factors.  Examples include endangered  species, preservation, declining
              fisheries, and accumulating  pollutants such as those contributing to global
              warming and ozone  depletion.  This research will add a stock component to the 
              models which analyze conservation and stock issues.  The analysis  will use
              discrete time deterministic and stochastic dynamic  resource allocation models
              with non-concave growth or production  functions.  The research will advance
              understanding of the  economic and environmental conditions under which
              resource  conservation and sustainability can be expected to occur and it 
              explores policy alternatives for achieving these ends.
