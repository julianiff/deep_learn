Abstract    :
              A long standing issue of great importance in economics is how and  why money
              inluences economic activity.  There is a fairly good  understanding of what
              happens when the Federal Reserve Board  changes its policy by injecting more
              money into the economy.   However, what is not well understood is just how and
              why this  happens.  The models typically used to explain the monetary 
              transmission mechanism are generally thought to be flawed since  they rely on
              the assumption that individuals are irrational;  either in the way they form
              expectations about the future or in  the way that they react to profit
              opportunities in the labor  market.  The aim of this research is to explain the
              monetary  transmission mechanism without having to assume irrational  behavior
              on the part of economic agents.  A class of general  equilibrium models are
              developed in which agent's beliefs about  the future are capable of influencing
              what happens in the  present.  This research is important because it will shed
              light  on just how expectations are influenced by actions of the FED,  and,
              thus, provide a better understanding of the mechanism by  which monetary policy
              effects overall economic activity.
