Abstract    :
              9515252  Williamson    This grant provides renewed support for the annual
              Cliometric  Conferences.  This project supports the 1997, 1998, and 1999 
              Cliometric Conferences. The venue of the conference changes  annually. 
              Conference sites will be selected from a list of  several universities offering
              to host Cliometric Conferences.   The field of cliometrics evolved in the 1960s
              from research  interests in several fields; most notably economics, history,
              and  statistics, but drawing also on demography, political science,  and
              sociology.  Its focus has been on the application of economic  theory and
              quantitative analysis to a wide range of problems in  economic history.  The
              intent of the Cliometric Conference is  two-fold: to encourage new members of
              the profession and to  provide an opportunity for discussion and feedback on
              current  research in the field.  The record of previous Conferences  indicates
              that both goals have been met.  Of the 224 paper-  presenters at Cliometrics
              Conferences since 1985, 173, or 77  percent, presented but a single paper in
              that period.  At the  1995 conference, 75 percent of the presenters were
              first-time  presenters.  The practice of inviting a mix of new and  established
              scholars is considered extremely valuable by many  first-time attendees, who
              have discovered advisors, mentors and  research collaborators through these
              conferences.    At the same time, Cliometrics Conferences have served as a
              forum  for all major debates and developments in the field of economic  history
              and have consistently encouraged the development of new  and better data bases.
               A large number of important works in the  field were first presented at
              Cliometrics Conferences.  In the  six conferences held so far in the 1990s,
              three major topical  areas are emerging, accounting for about a third of the
              papers  selected.  First is the timing and extent of market integration  for
              labor, commodities, and all factors to accompany the  continuing interest in
              capital market integration.  Second is   quantitative study of the political
              economy of public finance and  of public spending.  Third is analysis of
              political economy in a  broader sense: of legal systems, of property rights,
              and politics  itself.
