Abstract    :
              INT 9515511  Vary        This U.S.-Slovak theoretical physics project between
              Dr. James Vary of the Iowa State University and Dr. Lubomir Martinovic of the
              Slovak Academy of Sciences' Institute of Physics will examine light-front
              quantization.  The goal of the team is to use a systematic and practical
              approach to the evaluation of the Hamiltonian framework in quantum field theory
              for analytical and numerical applications.    The researchers intend to focus
              their efforts on quantum chromodynamics (QCD), a strongly interacting field
              theory that can be compared with experiments in the non-perturbative regime. 
              Test applications will be developed to demonstrate concepts and illustrate
              utility.  Initial efforts will feature a 1+1 dimension problem and a second
              one, in 3+1 dimension, that will incorporate findings from the first.  This
              work should yield models for investigating specific formal and numerical issues
              in field theories.  Overall, results are expected to facilitate the
              construction of equations for effective Hamiltonian methods useful in study of
              high energy physics phenomenology.    This project combining nuclear theory and
              mathematical physics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
              knowledge by enabling experts in the Untied States and Eastern Europe to
              combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong
              mutual interest and competence.    ??
