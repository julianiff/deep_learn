Abstract    :
              The predicaments of post-colonialism launched a wave of immigrants across
              Europe;  the collapse of communism has swollen it.  These new "outsiders" raise
              a host of problems for governments across Europe.  That a number of these
              governments and societies are themselves under economic and political stress,
              for reasons independent of or only marginally related to the arrival of outside
              groups, only aggravates the problem.  Throughout Western Europe there is an
              unmistakable anger toward outsiders, sparking anti-migrant violence and
              swelling the popular appeal of new parties parading under quasi-fascist banners
              and draping themselves in racist, xenophobic sentiments.    This proposal seeks
              funding to continue an on-going collaborative research program on the
              consequences of prejudice for intergroup conflict.  The research will be
              conducted in the Netherlands and costs will be shared with European colleagues.
               The Netherlands offers an important site for this research because of, on the
              one hand, its egalitarian political culture and, on the other hand,  its
              history of colonialism.  Computer assisted experimental surveys of Dutch
              citizens will be used to gauge the possibilities for theoretical melding of
              situational perspectives on group conflict with dispositional perspectives.
              This project extends a series of studies conducted both in the United States
              and in Italy by the principal investigator and his European collaborators.
