Abstract    :
              9515521  Wong    This is a 24 month award proposed by Dr. George Wong, Old
              Dominion University  and  Professor Kon-Kee Liu, Taiwan National University. 
              This proposal requests supplemental  funds for travel to Taiwan to work with
              Taiwan oceanographers to collect samples to  determine iodine concentrations
              and their relationship with the dynamics of  the nitrogen  system in the East
              China Sea.  The Taiwan  National Science Council is providing the ship 
              support.  The primary research support for Dr. Wong is from a grant from  the
              Chemical  Oceanography Program (OCE-9301298), which  provides the cost for
              laboratory analyses. The  East China  Sea is a region with little hydrographic
              and process-  oriented data.  His  study may provide important data to address
              the question of why total iodine behaves  conservatively in the South Atlantic
              Bight but non- conservatively in the southeast China  Sea and whether iodine
              can be used as a tracer to understand the mixing process in  the  East China
              Sea.  The project is jointly supported by the  Taiwan National Science Council 
              and the NSF.
