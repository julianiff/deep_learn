Abstract    :
                This award supports a three-year collaborative research project between
              Professor Jeffrey H. Winicour, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University
              of Pittsburgh, and Professor Nigel T. Bishop, Department of Mathematics and
              Astronomy, University of South Africa (UNISA), Pretoria.  In addition, a junior
              investigator from the University of Durban-Westville, a historically
              disadvantaged institution in South Africa, will participate in the project, as
              well as a graduate student from the University of Pittsburgh.  The
              investigators will collaborate on research relevant to the Binary Black Hole
              `Grand Challenge,` whose objective is to calculate the gravitational radiation
              that is emitted during the in-spiral and coalescence of two black holes.  The
              problem can be divided into two parts:  (a) the strong-field region near the
              black holes, and (b) the outer region extending to infinity.  The work to be
              undertaken concerns part (b), as well as the interface between parts (a) and
              (b).  The proposed collaboration combines expertise in numerical computing and
              access to supercomputers in the United States, while the South African side
              offers special expertise in algebraic computing.  The international
              collaboration will also give new research opportunities to young researchers in
              both countries.
