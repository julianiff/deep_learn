Abstract    :
               This is an award under the Research Planning Grant program for women scientists
              and engineers.  It is a project to study the role of the domestic economy in
              economic development in fifteenth-century Tuscany, Italy.  Theories of
              development raise the question whether family-based agricultural production can
              support economic growth, and this study examines the hypothesis that a shift to
              sharecropping (agricultural production based on the domestic economy) was
              responsible for subsequent economic decline in Tuscany.  Only historical
              research can allow us to see the long-term consequences of major socio-economic
              decisions, and many areas of the developing world today face choices like those
              faced earlier by Tuscany.  %%%   In addition to the scientific gains to be
              achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a promising ymung
              researcher to prepare for a larger project, thereby contributing to the
              strengthening of the national resource of women scientists and engineers.
