Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks funding to examine the question of whether women in public
              office in the United States have had an impact on the direction of public
              policy during the past 25 years.  Previous work comparing the behavior of male
              and female state representatives has established that women legislators are
              different than their male counterparts but it has not determined whether women
              make a difference.  To demonstrate such an impact this study examines whether
              (1) policy change has occurred over time and (2) that change would not have
              occurred but for the increasing presence and/or efforts of women in state
              government.      Trends over time and across states in the introduction,
              consideration, and passage of legislation devoted to "women's issues" will be
              the focus of attention.  Data on all representatives and their legislative
              activities in 25 state legislatures between 1973 and 1993 will be collected.  A
              simultaneous equation system is used to model state legislative policy making
              and will be tested against the pooled-cross-sectional time series data set of
              state policy activity.  The study hopes to resolve differences between the
              effects of descriptive representation of women and substantive representation
              of women,  The model on which the project will draw such conclusions should
              also be easily applied to the study of political representation of other
              social, political and economic groups.
