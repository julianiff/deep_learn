Abstract    :
               This is a study of intercountry income inequality.  Nations vary greatly in the
              average incomes of their citizens, by a factor of about 100 worldwide, and this
              intercountry inequality is the major component of world income inequality,
              significantly more important than inequality within nations.  This study has
              three related objectives.  First, it will construct trends in intercountry
              inequality since mid-century based on two measures of national income (one
              based on exchange rates, the other based on purchasing power parity) and on
              three measures of inequality (the Gini coefficient, Theil's index, and the
              squared coefficient of variation).  Second, it will decompose trends in
              intercountry inequality into the part due to changing income ratios and the
              part due to nations' changing shares of the world population.  Third, it will
              estimate each nation's contribution to total intercountry inequality at each
              measurement point at five-year intervals.  %%%   This research will make it
              possible to determine the characteristics of nations that have increased or
              decreased their contribution to intercountry inequality over time.  Thus this
              dataset will provide the foundation for a quantitative scientific literature on
              the underlying causes of change in what is the major component of world
              inequality: inequality between nations.
