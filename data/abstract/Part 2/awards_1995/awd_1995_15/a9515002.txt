Abstract    :
              9515002  De Leon       When nerve cells grow they must add new cell membrane. 
              This process requires mechanisms in the cell that carry the lipid molecules
              neccessary to build the membranes.  In this study a specific protein that binds
              fatty acid has been isolated and  it is now proposed to determine whether  it
              is involved in the mechanisms that enable the nerve cell to extend processes.  
              This work will help to understand the process of nerve growth and regeneration.
