Abstract    :
                This dissertation enhancement grant provides partial support for a U.S.
              graduate student, Stephen A. McCord, working under the guidance of Dr. Geoffrey
              Schladow, of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the
              University of California-Davis, to perform field studies and develop computer
              simulations for controlled degassing of Lake Nyos in Cameroon.  Mr. McCord will
              visit Lake Nyos to collect samples and record data on internal wave activity
              and fine scale temperature and conductivity structures, which will then be used
              to model the dynamics of Lake Nyos.  It is intended to model the use of  in
              situ lake remediation techniques to safely lower the gas concentrations, which
              have been increasing since the last outgassing in 1986, and to predict the
              resulting water quality changes due to artificial mixing.  Further, the
              proposed model may be used in a wide variety of lakes and reservoirs to address
              water quality and management issues.  Staff members of the Automation and
              Control Laboratory at the University of Yaounde will collaborate with Mr.
              McCord on this project.   This study will make an important contribution to the
              understanding of the science of lake hydrodynamics, especially the  chemical
              and physical factors affecting lake stability.  The grant will also provide
              support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent
              research career.
