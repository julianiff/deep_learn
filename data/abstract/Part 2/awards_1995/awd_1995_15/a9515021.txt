Abstract    :
              9515021  Artuso       This Career Advancement Award supports a program to 
              design and produce read out electronics for a particle-  physics detector.  The
              devices developed will be used in the  CLEO detector in a research program to
              study the properties  of B mesons.  The P.I. will enhance her competence in 
              microelectronics techniques to improve her ability to make  important
              contributions in future experiments.  ***
