Abstract    :
              This project develops three groups of mover-stayer models for the analysis of
              event-history data.  Mover-stayer models employ a pair of regressions:  an
              `S-regression` for the proportion of stayers, where stayers are a latent
              population of `people` with zero risk of having the event, and an
              `M-regression` for the conditional rate of having the event among movers, where
              movers are a latent population of people with nonzero risk of having the event.
               Mover-stayer models provide information that cannot be obtained from the
              results of conventional hazard rate models.  This research further develops
              mover-stayer models by:  (1) extending general mover-stayer models to permit
              the use of time-varying predictors (2) developing mover-stayer models
              specifically designed for the analysis of diffusion processes (such as
              diffusion of information, diseases, or innovation) to identify whether a
              predictor of a higher rate of diffusion implies either more rapid diffusion, or
              a larger number of people who are affected by the diffusion event, or both; (3)
              developing mover-stayer models for event-history data with some missing
              information.  Applications of these new methodological tools to analyses of
              first marriages and remarriages, drug-use progression, and residential mobility
              will provide important new substantive insights.
