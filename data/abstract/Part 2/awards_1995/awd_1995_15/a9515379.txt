Abstract    :
              This award to the University of South Alabama supports an anthropological study
              of local participation in social movements that oppose polluting industries and
              other environmental hazards.  Using ethnographic as well as survey research
              methods in impacted communities and in activist groups, the researchers will
              examine how a cross-section of the region's residents perceive hazardous waste 
              and involve themselves in environmental rights movements.  Through ethnographic
              methods of in depth questioning and participant observation the project will
              seek to explain why environmental activism has been successful in some
              situations and never attempted in others.  The relation of the use of local
              rhetoric about environmental racism and the civil rights movement will be
              examined, as will the relation of property ownership and source of income to
              perceptions of risk from hazardous environmental materials.  This research is
              important theories of popular social mov 
em 
ents have often lacked the
              in-depth information on motives, understanding and values that is available
              through ethnography.  Industrial and rural development have all too often been
              accompanied by environmental degradation.  By advancing our understanding of
              how local communities organize themselves to defend their environment, this
              project will provide valuable knowledge to industrial and environmental
              planners.
