Abstract    :
              9515347  Rothenberg    This project investigates theoretically and empirically
              the nature of the interactions that govern the relationship between politicians
              and organizations.  Theoretically, the researchers develop a dynamic framework
              that specifies how the motivations on each side impact each other given the
              institutional structure under which groups and politicians transact their
              business.  Empirically, they test hypotheses derived from this game theoretic
              perspective using an extensive data set and more general econometric techniques
              than previously employed in the relevant literature.  The results permit the
              researchers to draw inferences about the interplay of interest group
              motivations and whether the institutional framework that structures the
              connections between external organizational actors and elected politicians
              makes long-term alliances a realistic possibility.    This research promises to
              substantially enhance our understanding of the topic.  ***
