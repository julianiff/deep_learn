Abstract    :
              9515527  Barnett       In this proposal Professor Barnett requests support for 
              participation of his group at Johns Hopkins University in  the CDF experiment
              at Fermilab.  The upgraded CDF detector  is planned to have superior tracking
              and vertex detection,  leading to a new capability for heavy quark physics.
