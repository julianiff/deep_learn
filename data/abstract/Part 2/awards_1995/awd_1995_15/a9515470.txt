Abstract    :
              INT 9515470  Rajagopal      The primary objective of this U.S.-Czech research
              project between K. R. Rajagopal of the University of Pittsburgh and Jan
              Kratochvil of the Czech Technical University is to develop a unified theory and
              coherent model that can explain a range of inelastic phenomena in solid
              materials.  Specifically, the researchers intend to address the details of
              microstructure and their impact on the evolution of mechanical properties in a
              body, which may possess more than one stress-free configuration.  In the
              process, the researchers plan to incorporate in this theory their experimental
              observations concerning: 1) dislocation structures and non-local effects due to
              such dislocation structures; 2) "fading memory" for stress based on a "path
              length" measure in strain space; and 3) maximized dissipation.   Their findings
              should contribute to our understanding of the basic physical properties of
              mechanics and yield results that can benefit current technology where
              inelasticity in materials such as metals or polymers presents persistent
              manufacturing and infrastructural problems.    This mechanical engineering
              research project fulfills the program of objective of advancing basic
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and
              Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in
              areas of mutual interest and competence.           ??
