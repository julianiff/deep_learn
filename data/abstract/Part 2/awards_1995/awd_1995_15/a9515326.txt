Abstract    :
                This award supports a cooperative research project between Professor Theodore
              R. Tauchert, Department of Engineering Mechanics, University of Kentucky, and
              Professors V. E. Verijenko and S. Adali, Department of Mechanical Engineering,
              University of Natal, Durban, South Africa.  The investigators will study the
              development and application of an improved and generalized `higher-order`
              theory for the structural analysis of laminated plates and shells, one that
              accounts for nonlinear material characteristics, thermal and piezoelectric
              behaviors, and large deformations and dynamic effects.  The anticipated results
              will help ensure the safe operation of modern laminated structures, including
              `smart` structural systems of the future.    The research project is the result
              of a planning visit undertaken by the PI in 1995.  Costs for the South African
              portion of the research are being borne by the South Africa Foundation for
              Research Development.  The PI plans to take a graduate student or postdoctoral
              fellow with him to South Africa.  During the course of the project, eight
              graduate students and postdoctoral fellows from South Africa will participate
              in the research.
