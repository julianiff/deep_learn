Abstract    :
                  9515449  Tissue      This award provides partial travel support, over a
              duration of   two years, to assist two American investigators, Dr. David Tissue
               of the Department of Biological Sciences at Texas Tech University  and Dr.
              Devin Griffin from the Desert Research Institute in Reno,  Nevada, to conduct
              collaborative research in New Zealand with  Dr. David Whitehead at the
              Canterbury Agricultural and Science  Center of the New Zealand Government's
              Landcare Research Institute.   The primary emphasis of the collaboration will
              be on determining  potential mechanisms that regulate the effect of elevated
              carbon  dioxide and nitrogen on leaf carbon balance, including those  involving
              photosynthetic enzymes and mitochondrial biogenesis.     The cooperative
              research will study these mechanisms at a field  site in California on
              Ponderosa pine, the most widely distributed  conifer in North America, and in
              New Zealand on Monterey pine, the  most extensively planted and economically
              important tree in that  country.  The American investigators bring to the study
              expertise  in physiology and biochemistry, while access to the trees and an 
              elevated carbon dioxide open-top chamber facility available in  Christchurch,
              contributes to this collaborative study.  Funding in  New Zealand is provided
              through the Ministry of Research, Science  and Technology.
