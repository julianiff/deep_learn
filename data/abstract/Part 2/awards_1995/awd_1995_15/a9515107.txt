Abstract    :
                The purpose of this project is to determine how international  productivity
              differences and increasing returns to scale models  can explain patterns of
              international trade.  The first phase of  the project involves developing a
              detailed database of the world  trading environment that would contain data on
              bilateral trade  flows, production by industry, resource endowments, and 
              input-output relationships for 54 industries in 75 countries over  the period
              1963-1992.  This is an ambitious data gathering  exercise, but is fully
              implementable and will be made publicly  available.  The second phase of the
              project will identify models  of trade that are most appropriate for the
              purpose of  understanding the role of productivity and human capital for U.S. 
              economic success.  Without such information it is impossible to  design
              informed public policy, be it pro-active or  noninterventionist.  By providing
              this information, the results  of this research should aid policy-makers in
              building a stronger  economy, both within the United States and globally.
