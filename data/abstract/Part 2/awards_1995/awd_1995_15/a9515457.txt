Abstract    :
                   9515457  Vignale      This award supports the participation of twelve
              American   researchers at a workshop entitled "Electron Density Functional 
              Theory: Recent Progress and New Directions" to be held in  Brisbane, Australia
              between July 15 and 19, 1996.  The American  organizer for this workshop is Dr.
              Giovanni Vignale of the  Department of Physics, University of Missouri -
              Columbia.  The Australian organizer is Dr. John Dobson of the Faculty of 
              Science and Technology at Griffith University, Nathan,  Queensland.    Electron
              Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a theoretical /  computational tool used by
              solid state physicists and engineers  to predict materials properties and to
              model electronic and  optical devices.  Chemists and biologists also use DFT
              for  molecular modelling.  The objectives of the workshop are to  acquaint
              energy transfer researchers with the current state of  theoretical and
              experimental knowledge in dealing with large and  small molecular systems, to
              identify experiments and theoretical  developments which may have the greatest
              impact on advancing  knowledge about large molecular vibrational energy
              transfer, and  to foster further collaboration and communication between 
              American and Australian investigators in this research area.  A  few selected
              participants will come from Canada, France and  Germany.         Australian
              support for this workshop is provided through the  Australian Department of
              Industry, Science and Tourism (DIST)  under the U.S.-Australia Cooperative
              Science Program.
