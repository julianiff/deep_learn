Abstract    :
              The primary purpose of this research is to investigate empirically the impact of
              recent federal reform initiatives legislated by Title I of the Elementary and
              Secondary Education Act on the narrowing of the achievement gap between
              educationally at-risk students and their more advantaged peers.  These reform
              initiatives have encouraged schools to:  reconcile fragmentation between their
              Title I and regular services; foster effective school decision-making and
              organizational structure; develop effective parent involvement activities, and;
              promote stronger school-community partnerships.  This project makes use of the
              comprehensive, Congressionally mandated Prospects data files, which consist of
              standardized reading and math achievement scores for a
              nationally-representative sample of nearly 40,000 students, and detailed
              information regarding the students themselves, and their schools, classrooms,
              and families.  The investigators' analyses will generate national estimates of
              the extent and intensity of these reform activities, and will produce
              empirically-based paradigms for the improvement of federal Title I programs and
              the schools that serve at-risk students.  This information will guide
              stakeholders from all levels of the educational system to develop policies and
              activities that promote equitable educational outcomes.
