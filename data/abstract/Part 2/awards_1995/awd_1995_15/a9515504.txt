Abstract    :
              INT 9515504  De Long        The primary objective of this U.S.-Czech research
              project between Dr. Lance De Long of the University of Kentucky and Dr.
              Vladimir Sechovsky of Charles University, Prague, is to examine the effects of
              high pressure and magnetic field on electronic structure, magnetic anisotropy
              and electrical transport in Uranium containing compounds.  Contributions to the
              work will emphasize high-pressure measurements on the U.S. side involving
              special vibrating reed and torque techniques and, on the Czech side, high
              quality single crystal sample preparation and structural characterization. 
              Results are expected to improve our ability to study such intermetallic
              materials across the localization boundary.  In the course of this work, the
              researchers also intend to construct a refined high field vibrating
              magnetometer located at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in
              Tallahassee, Florida.    This joint research project in condensed matter
              physics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
              enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe  to combine
              complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and
              competence.        ??
