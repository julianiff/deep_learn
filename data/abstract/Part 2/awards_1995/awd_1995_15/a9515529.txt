Abstract    :
              The focus of this research project is to study the role of electron  spin in
              electron transfer at electrode surfaces.  Professor  Klebanoff, who is doing
              the research under a Small Grant for  Exploratory Research (SGER) sponsored by
              the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry Program, is working to determine if
              electron spin effects  can be measured.  A uniformly magnetized nickel
              single-crystal  electrode serves as a spin polarized source and acceptor of 
              electrons.  The reduction of a paramagnetic transition metal  complex ion in
              acidic solution proceeds with an oscillatory  magnetization of the electrode. 
              Using lock-in amplifier  technology, the reduction current is examined for an
              alternating  current component at the frequency of the magnetization.  An
              understanding of the mechanisms by which electrons are  transferred between
              species in solution and electrically conducting  solids is of both fundamental
              and technological importance.  In  this project, Professor Klebanoff is
              investigating  the role of  electron spin as a possible new probe for the study
              of electrolytic  processes.  Such a new probe might impact on the practical 
              development of batteries and fuel cells as energy sources.
