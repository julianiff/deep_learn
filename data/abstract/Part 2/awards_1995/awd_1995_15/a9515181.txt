Abstract    :
              9515181  Ludwig  The proposal is a GOALI effort with a focus on real-time,
              in-situ studies of silicide kinetics in submicron silicon device structure. 
              The proposed research will concentrate on the study of Ti and Co interface
              reactions with heavily-doped silicon substrates.  Studies will be directed
              towards growth kinetics with different geometrical arrays and shape
              combinations.  Experiments will be performed with in-situ, time-resolved, x-ray
              scattering measurements, to study the silicide transformation kinetics under
              rapid thermal annealing conditions on patterned submircron device structures. 
              The results of this study should lead to a fundamental understanding of
              silicide formation, which is an essential technology for the microelectronics.
