Abstract    :
              9515306  Townsend    This project employs theory, field work and econometrics to
               examine how credit and insurance systems work both in theory and  in actual
              economies.  The economies include poor high risk  villages in India's semi-arid
              tropics, using the standard data  set gathered by the International Crops
              Research of the Semi-Arid  Tropics (ICRISAT) and one designed by the
              investigator.  The same  approach will be used to study the entire national
              economy of  Thailand, a growing economy with wide disparities in levels and 
              growth rates of income, using the household-level data of the  Thai
              Socio-Economic Survey (SES) gathered by the National  Statistical Office (NSO)
              of Thailand, using multiple years of  village-level surveys conducted by the
              Community Development  Department (CDD), and using data to be gathered in field
              research  and in a larger more standard survey.  The work is extended to  begin
              to consider the economy of the United States, analyzing  business and household
              data gathered in the Hispanic community of  Little Village in Chicago.    The
              significance of the research is two-fold.  First, because the  project employs
              theory, field research and econometrics, it has  the potential of making a
              contribution to each of these areas.   Second, theory and data will be used to
              try to understand formal,  informal, market and programmed credit-insurance
              systems in order  to see whether or not there might be some scope for
              improvement.
