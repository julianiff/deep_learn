Abstract    :
              9515076  Ellison    This project consists of the development of game-theoretic
              models  and empirical analysis of the way in which individuals, firms,  and
              societies learn in particular situations.  These projects  will try to provide
              a more general understanding of how  "conventions" for behavior in a society
              arise by discussing when  evolution in economic models occur quickly, to
              explore whether  equilibria of game-theoretic models which require players to
              use  mixed strategies can be justified as the outcome of a process of  learning
              in a large heterogeneous environment, and to describe  how the need to allocate
              analytical resources may affect the  structure of hierarchies in firms.  In
              addition several empirical  studies are undertaken in order to improve
              understanding of the  industries and behaviors in question and more broadly to
              assess  the relevance of recent theoretical work.  These studies explore  the
              riskiness of mutual funds' portfolios, the location decisions  of manufacturing
              plants, and the behavior of pharmaceutical firms  at patent expiration.
