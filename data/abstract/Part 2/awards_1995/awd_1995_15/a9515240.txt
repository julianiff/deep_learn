Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the amplification and shaping  of quantum
              initiation noise by spontaneously initiated  Stokes Raman scattering (SRS) in
              an optical fiber.  Both  experimental measurements and numerical modeling will
              be  performed.  Attention will be directed to determining how  the initially
              large scale fluctuations evolve as well as to  the temporal formation and
              shaping of the first Stokes pulse  by the nonlinear gain.  The conditions of
              sustained  nonlinear interactions.  The educational component of this  program
              will provide the students at this undergraduate  institution with both basic
              knowledge through their research  as well as practical training because of the
              importance of  SRS in optical signal processing.
