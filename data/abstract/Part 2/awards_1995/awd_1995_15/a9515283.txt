Abstract    :
              Organizations continue to increase their investments in information technology
              (IT) as a means of achieving higher levels of performance because their
              executives see these investments as a way to counter the impact of global
              competition.  IT is seen as a means to create business value through:
              automation - substituting capital for high cost labor thereby improving
              productivity and reducing cost structures; informatization - reducing cycle
              times for new product introduction; and transformation - improving business
              processes in general through redesign using IT capabilities.  The continually
              higher IT costs and the lack of empirical evidence about payoffs have resulted
              in questions by researchers and senior executives about the final payoffs from
              IT.  Some recent studies have demonstrated a positive return on IT investments,
              while others have not, and so significant questions remain. There are a large
              number of organizational variables that mediate the payoff from IT, which are
              omitted in microeconomic analyses, and that are important to understand for
              better IT management.  Behavioral analyses indicate that organizational
              performance depends on the choice of a firm's strategy as well as its
              execution, and that IT contributes primarily to the latter though a set of
              organization-IT linkages.  This research tests an explanatory model of these
              linkages and assesses the contribution of IT to business value.  The research
              is funded under the Joint NSF/Private Sector Initiative with the cooperating
              organization, Computer Sciences Corporation Research and Advisory Services.
