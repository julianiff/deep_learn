Abstract    :
              9515328  Hu       The Faddeev equations are used to study the general problem 
              of three interacting Coulomb particles of arbitrary mass.  The  methodology
              employed is to solve the resultant, coupled equations  using a spline basis. 
              Of particular interest are those three  body systems involving muons.  ***
