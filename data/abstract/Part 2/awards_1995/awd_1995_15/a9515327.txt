Abstract    :
              Typical research on violence is concerned with identifying the characteristics
              and predictors of why certain people are more disposed to violence than others.
               However,  these studies do not address the specific conditions that channel
              such dispositions into violent events.  This study addresses this gap in
              violence research through examining the situational contexts in which violence
              events occur and the interactive social processes or exchanges that lead to
              criminal violence.  Analyses will be conducted of the process by which a
              decision is made to commit a gun-related crime in order to better understand
              the use of guns by young males.   This project  includes interviews with 80
              respondents from three New York City (South Bronx) and East New York (Brooklyn)
              neighborhoods with high rates of homicide among young males 16-22 years of age.
                Samples include young males recently released on weapons charges and males
              from the neighborhood (who have used guns or been victims of gun assaults but
              were not involved in the criminal justice system).   Interviews with
              respondents will examine the dynamics of gun events, including reconstruction
              of dialogues of events which culminated in gunshots, and the aftermath of these
              events.  This research will contribute to the development of a framework for
              analyzing the process of  events that lead to acts of  gun violence with
              implications for the development of  frameworks to study patterns of
              interaction that lead to other forms of interpersonal violence.  This framework
              represents a distinct departure from commonly used deterministic models and can
              be extended and modified to examine different selection processes involved in
              violent events.
