Abstract    :
              Authorship is central to the recognition and reward system of science, yet the
              meaning of authorship has changed profoundly as science has changed from the
              avocation of individuals to a professional occupation characterized by
              increasing collaboration.  Indeed, in some fields, such as experimental
              high-energy physics or fusion research, papers may be routinely authored by
              dozens of researchers.    The goal of this conference is to analyze patterns of
              change in scientific authorship by examining different institutional
              structures, disciplinary practices, genres of scientific literature,
              socio-political contexts, techniques of communication, and patterns of
              organization and responsibility.  It is important and timely, as authorship
              lies at the core of contemporary concerns about intellectual property and
              scientific misconduct.  Further, the advent of electronic publishing will pose
              a further challenge to conventional notions of authorship.  The proposed
              conference would draw together leading scholars in science studies to present
              papers on various facets of this topic and to participate in extensive, open
              discussion of emerging issues.  The conference has already attracted partial
              support from the Mellon Foundation and from the host institution, Harvard
              University.
