Abstract    :
              SBR - 9515075  Box-Steffensmeier      This project investigates strategic
              position taking in legislative assemblies by studying the timing of choices
              that representatives make in the U.S. Senate and House.  This study is
              important for three reasons: it adds information on the context and sequence of
              decision making; it more closely approximates members' strategic
              considerations; and the process becomes the focus of analysis rather than the
              final result.  Research into the timing of legislator vote choices should
              provide insight into theoretical questions on the strategic behavior of
              legislators, institutional constraints on  members, and strategies of interest
              group influence.  The project examines five case studies including the
              congressional vote on NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement called
              "the most important vote on Capitol Hill since the Berlin Wall came down".   
              The project also has an important methodological component.  It will develop
              and apply a split population hazards model.  This model will allow researchers
              to estimate separately the effects of the determinants of vote choice from the
              determinants of the timing of vote choice.    * * *
