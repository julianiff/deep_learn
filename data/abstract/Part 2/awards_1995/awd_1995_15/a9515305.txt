Abstract    :
              This research is part of  multi-stage program seeking to develop new methods in
              risk analysis building on multiobjective trade-off analysis of vehicle-safety
              interventions for evaluating changes in future vehicle design.  In Phase I of
              this effort, fault-tree models for accident causation and consequence were
              developed that use historical accident databases to analyze the potential
              effectiveness of vehicle safety features.  Phase II integrated the `100
              Crashes` scenarios (a data-driven catalog of severe accident types), accident
              statistics from Michigan, and expert assessment of safety technologies to
              demonstrate a trade-off analysis of the benefits and costs of 15 prospective
              vehicle safety features.  This funding supports Phase III, and adapts the fault
              trees for event-occurrence rates that are based on travel exposure, applies
              them to crash scenarios of automated urban interstates, and assesses the
              performance benefits of vehicle-safety technologies in order to reduce the
              losses of lives and property on automated highway systems.  This research is
              funded under the Joint NSF/Private Sector Initiative with the continued strong
              collaboration of senior scientists from General Motors.
