Abstract    :
              The successful exercise of democracy requires the full and effective utilization
              of human capital.  One aspect of human capital utilization is the extent to
              which citizens use one another as sources of information and guidance in making
              political decisions.  This research project will examine the dynamic structure
              of social communication during a presidential campaign focusing on the
              structure and composition of social networks for political communication, the
              factors affecting how these networks change during the campaign, and the
              circumstances under which communications are influential.  Patterns of
              political communication will be investigated in two urban areas -- Indianapolis
              and St. Louis.  Interviews will be conducted over a period of one year with
              respondents and a subset of those with whom they share their political views. 
              Respondents will be geo-coded to examine the spatial location of networks. 
              Media coverage of issues and the campaign will also be coded to capture the
              elite discussion of the campaign as context for the social networks.   * * *
