Abstract    :
              9515510  Benenson    This U.S.-Brazil collaborative research project combines 6 
              U.S. nuclear physicists from Michigan State University, led  by Walter
              Benenson, with 6 Brazilian collaborators from the  University of Sao Paulo
              (Alex Szanto de Toledo), Federal  Univ. of Rio de Janeiro (Carlos Bertulani),
              and the Federal  Fluminense University (Nelson Carlin) to conduct 4 different 
              collections of experiments. The four ambitious measurements  involving
              radioactive nuclear beams are: coulomb  disassociation of halo nuclei;
              astrophysical measurements of  levels near the proton drip line and reaction
              rates of  unstable nuclei; total cross section measurements as a  function of
              mass and energy for several exotic nuclei; and  measurements of the nuclear
              temperature of fragments from  the 14N + 12C reaction.  The first three
              experiments will be  conducted at National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory
               (NSCL) at MSU and the last one at the University of Sao  Paulo's Pelletron
              facility.    The projected series of tests will make excellent use of the 
              lower-energy facilities in Sao Paulo, where more beam time  is available than
              would be possible in the US laboratories.  The interactions produced by a group
              of leading nuclear  physicists in the two countries should benefit the 
              scientific community in both the U.S. and Brazil. Students  and post doctoral
              researchers will also travel to Brazil as  part of the research effort.  ***
