Abstract    :
                This award supports the travel of 12 Americans to a U.S.-Western Europe
              workshop on iterative methods at CERFACS in Toulouse, France, June 11-14, 1996.
               This is one of four workshops associated with the International Linear Algebra
              Year.  The organizers are Gene H. Golub of Stanford University and Iain Spencer
              Duff of the CERFACS Parallel Algorithm Group and Rutherford Appleton
              Laboratory.  The workshop brings together scientists from academe (including
              graduate students and postdoctoral researchers), government and industry.  They
              will collaborate on practical and theoretical problems on key topics in linear
              algebra.  The workshop on iterative methods will emphasize Krylov methods for
              unsymmetric problems, domain decomposition methods, multigrid methods and
              parallel computing.  The objective is to develop faster and more robust
              iterative solvers for large-scale computer simulations.
