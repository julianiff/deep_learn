Abstract    :
              Arik M. Levinson  University of Wisconsin  SBR-959515057    This research will
              use detailed data to analyze  interjurisdictional hazardous waste shipments in
              the United  States.  The conclusions of this research will have implications 
              for policies affecting national and international transport of  hazardous
              wastes.  The research will look at the impact of  hazardous waste disposal
              taxes.  Preliminary results indicate  that such taxes may be encouraging more
              on-site disposal of  hazardous waste.  It will also consider other factors that
               determine the transportation of hazardous waste.  These include  industrial
              composition, hazardous waste capacity, state taxes and  regulations, transport
              cost, geographic concentration of waste  generators, scale economies of waste
              disposal, and demographic  factors such as population density, income,
              education, race and  local activism.  The effect of hazardous waste regulations
              on  industries that generate waste will be examined.  Finally, the  economic
              and environmental effects of the Supreme Court's  interpretation of the
              commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution  will be examined.
