Abstract    :
              9515513  Shane    This conference, which is sponsored by the Federation of
              Societies for Experimental Biology, concerns many aspects of folate, B-12, and
              one-carbon metabolism.  A variety of researchers will come together to present
              their work and discuss it with others in the field.  Participation of young
              investigators is particularly encouraged.  ***
