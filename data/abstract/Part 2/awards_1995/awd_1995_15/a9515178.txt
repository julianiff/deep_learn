Abstract    :
              9515178  Soto    The goal of this project is to convene an interdisciplinary
              group of scientists from North and South America in order to advance our
              understanding of the biogeochemical linkages between forests and aquatic
              ecosystems (Phase I), and to develop a research proposal (Phase II) to address
              specific questions about the impacts of land use on downstream ecosystems. 
              Such questions cross traditional disciplinary boundaries and require the
              integration of information from several research groups through new cooperative
              arrangements.  The primary focus will be on the temperate rain forests of the
              Americas, presently occupying analogous climatic and topographic gradients
              along the western coasts of North and South America.  In these two regions many
              geologic, climatic, and biological patterns are mirror images of one another,
              they provide a unique setting for comparative studies.
