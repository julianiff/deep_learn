Abstract    :
              Weiner, Daniel  West Virginia U.   This project employs the digital technologies
              of geographic information systems (GIS) to carry out research on land and
              agrarian reform in South Africa's Eastern Transvaal Central Lowveld.  The
              research employs a methodology whereby regional political ecology is integrated
              into the GIS production process.  Land use, resource access, property rights,
              and local knowledge, as well as, other socio-economic and environmental data
              are analyzed within a common framework in order to assess current and future
              land use patterns as historical products of a set of production relations and
              socio-environmental histories.  The research offers an innovative blending of
              technology and theory and enhances the analytical capabilities of regional
              political ecology.  Within South Africa, the project will contribute to a
              deeper understanding of the rural reconstruction process by incorporating the
              differentiated knowledge of local communities into the GIS production process.
