Abstract    :
              9515216  Goldin    This project examines the rise of secondary schools -- the
              most  important educational advance for much of the 20th century, and  the
              economic consequences of rapid educational change --  including productivity
              and wage-structure shifts.  It addresses  why education increased and what role
              was played by the public  sector.  Questions studied include: Did the wage
              structure always  widen with new technologies, and how did it respond to
              increased  supplied of educated labor?  Did secondary schools diffuse evenly 
              across the states or did some embrace the movement decades  earlier?  Did the
              areas with more progressive education reap  returns from their public-sector
              investments because local spill-  over effects were greater in the past?  What
              was the growth of  the educational stock and how did it impact economic growth
              over  the past century?  A theme running through the project is the  importance
              of egalitarianism in expanding education and its  reinforcing nature in society
              and the economy.    Of special interest is the new educational-flow data that
              will be  created by this project.  The 1940 census was the first to  inquire
              about the education of Americans, but the responses of  the older cohorts have
              been questioned for some time.  This  project creates corrected estimates of
              the human capital stock by  building them up from the flow data and then using
              them to revise  some well-know estimates of the role of human capital in
              economic  growth.  Preliminary work suggests that these new data series are 
              often vastly different from those derived from the 1940 census  and this
              indicates that education's role in economic growth may  have been larger than
              previously thought.
