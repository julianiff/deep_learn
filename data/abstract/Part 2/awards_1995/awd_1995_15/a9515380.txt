Abstract    :
              Abstract  OPP-9515380  Hamilton    Major declines in fish stocks in the North
              Atlantic region are having extensive impacts on northern communities.  This
              three-year comparative environmental sociological and anthropological study
              examines how communities are responding to these environmental changes.  The
              research design involves the collection and multivariate analysis of
              statistical data on fishing communities in Newfoundland, Greenland, Iceland and
              Norway accompanied by more detailed qualitative case studies on single
              communities in Iceland, Newfoundland and northern Norway.  The objectives are
              to examine exactly how people are being impacted, and what households,
              communities, governments and other institutions are doing to adapt to these
              changes.  of particular interest are concerns about sustainability, and how
              these vary by generation, gender, family, community, culture, levels of human
              and social capital, and political context.  Finally, various adaptive responses
              that increase or reduce the resource base will be examined.  The project is an
              important contribution to research on environmental policy, economic change,
              social change and global change.
