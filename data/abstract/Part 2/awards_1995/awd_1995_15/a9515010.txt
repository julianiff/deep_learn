Abstract    :
              One of the newest developments in American business is the use of  employee
              involvement (EI) programs-- by which we mean a diverse  set of personnel and
              management practices such as self-directed  work teams, total quality
              management, or quality circles, and the  like that give workers more authority
              at workplaces.  Existing  studies of EI have not addressed whether these
              practices enhance  organizational performance save in particular sectors,
              whether  any performance gain is do to organizational change or human  capital
              enhancement, or the benefits that flow to workers from  EI. They have raised
              questions as to whether unions increase the  effectiveness of EI programs, why
              some establishments have EI and  others do not, and most critically, about the
              set of new  practices that firms must adopt for EI programs to succeed, and 
              what those practices might be.    To address these questions a series of 20
              case investigations of  establishments, including some paired comparisons of 
              establishments with EI programs and those without, and of  establishments where
              these programs have failed will be  undertaken.  In addition, a new data on
              employee involvement  programs in several hundred establishments will be
              developed;  examine the relationship between EI programs and productivity 
              using longitudinal data from the LRD Survey of Manufacturers  files of the
              Census.  Finally, employee outcomes using the  Workplace Representation and
              Participation Survey will examined.  The study will provide valuable
              information to business, labor,  and government on the importance of employee
              participation in the  creation and maintenance of high performance workplaces.
