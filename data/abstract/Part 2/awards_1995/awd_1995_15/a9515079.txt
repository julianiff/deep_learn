Abstract    :
              Most member states of the United Nations are not democratic.  Developments over
              the past decade have shown, however,  that undemocratic regimes are
              increasingly unstable.  The collapse of Communism offers an extraordinary
              opportunity to study the process of change from authoritarian to democratic
              regime.  Democratic transitions are occurring simultaneously in more than a
              dozen Central and Eastern European countries.  And, unlike transitions
              elsewhere, democratization is occurring simultaneously with the transition from
              non-market to market economy.  Every one of the democratizing regimes faces
              major problems that threaten the establishment and maintenance of their
              representative institutions.      This project investigates the evolution of
              political support for new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe. A pooled,
              time series data set will be created from a series of 46 New Democracies
              Barometer surveys conducted over the past five years in the nations of
              Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Belarus
              and Ukraine.  This data set will allow the testing of political-cultural,
              economic, and social theories of mass support for (or rejection of) democratic
              regimes.
