Abstract    :
              Kevin Lang  Boston University  SBR-9515052    The research will combine elements
              of human capital and labor  market segmentation models by looking at how human
              capital  affects unemployment.  Workers search for jobs and employers  search
              for employees.  In the first research project factors such  as experience and
              seniority affect wages, turnover and  unemployment.  A possible extension to
              the basic research would  look at how education affects wages and employment. 
              A second  project incorporates working conditions into the model.  It 
              considers whether differences in worker tastes or preferences can  account for
              wage differentials and whether wage differentials can  be viewed as
              compensating workers for taking jobs with less  desirable working conditions. 
              A third project addresses the  importance of state labor market history on
              current state labor  market conditions.  It investigates whether economic booms
              have  lasting effects or whether labor market conditions are influenced  only
              by more recent experience.
