Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed research is to explore two central  and related
              topics in monetary economics.  First, how is our view  of the transmission
              mechanism between monetary policy and real  economic activity affected by the
              monetary policy rule that is  presumed to be in place?  Second, how do
              alternative monetary  policy rules affect the behavior of the private economy? 
                To conduct this line of inquiry, the principal investigator will  use a set
              of recently developed tools that make it  straightforward to study alternative
              monetary policy rules in  dynamic models with rational expectations and
              forward-looking  consumption, investment, labor supply and price-setting 
              decisions.  The analytical framework is a singular linear  difference system
              under rational expectations; theoretical  characterization of this system and
              computational methods for its  solution have been developed by the principal
              investigator in  recent collaborative research.    Specific rules to be studied
              include interest rate and money  stock rules for monetary policy, with
              particular attention  devoted to how these alternative specifications influence
              the  evaluation of models of the transmission mechanism between  monetary
              policy and the real economy.  Particular attention will  be devoted to
              conditions under which pure interest rate rules can  actually be implemented. 
              In addition, the research will also  undertake evaluation of an inflation
              targeting regime.
