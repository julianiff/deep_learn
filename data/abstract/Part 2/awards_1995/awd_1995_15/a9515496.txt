Abstract    :
              INT 9515496  Rovner      This U.S.-Hungary cooperative project between Dr. Irwin
              Rovner of North Carolina State University and Dr. Ferenc Gyulai of the
              Hungarian Institute of Archaeology will lay groundwork for an atuomated,
              morphometric seed atlas featuring seeds of Europe.  The primary quantitative
              parameters of morphometry employed by the researchers will include measurements
              of several shape factors, topographical features, and size measurement. The
              intent is to produce a reference with greater precision than available in
              conventional sources.  This morphometric analysis of European seed populations
              will employ an interactive, computer assisted image analysis system which
              possesses capabilities for classification and identification.    Initial
              efforts for the atlas will draw upon a major seed reference collection from the
              Hungarian Museum of Agriculture that represents between 15,000 and 20,000 taxa.
               The collection includes modern seed populations as well as many archaeological
              seed collections derived from sites encompassing a seven-to-eight thousand year
              sequence from Neolithic through Medieval periods.  These Hungarian collections
              will be transferred for computer image analysis to North Carolina State
              University where additional controlled studies of factors affecting seed
              morphology will be conducted.  In addition to the benefit of access to an
              automated reference for the extensive European collection, results are expected
              to produce a reference tool that may be broadly used for seed identification
              and analysis in many areas of basic research as well as environmental and
              commercial applications.    This project in systematic plant biology fulfills
              the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in
              the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and share
              research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
