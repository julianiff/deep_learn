Abstract    :
               This is the Korean part of a larger research project on cross-cultural
              variations in labor markets and social stratification that will also collect
              data in Taiwan and Japan.  This is a multi-society, public-use survey on work,
              family, social networks, and civil society.  During this initial round of what
              is anticipated to be a periodically repeated survey, the emphasis is on work
              and human capital.  The project is a comparative "natural experiment" examining
              how labor market and social stratification patterns differ in a subset of three
              nations that have followed quite different strategies for economic development.
               In the Korean phase of this work, a large survey will be administered to a
              randmm sample of about 2,000 people aged 25-59, evenly split between males and
              females.  %%%   Standard theories of labor markets, stratification and human
              capital have been developed in Western countries, and some important findings
              of research done in the United States may simply be artifacts of American
              history.  Thus it is essential to conduct comparative research in developed
              nations with very different backgrounds, and this research in Asia will
              illuminate much about the real dynamics of development in America as well as
              providing important information about three of America's chief trading
              partners.  The project's principal goal is to produce a high-quality,
              public-use data set that can be utilized broadly by social science researchers
              in the United States, East Asia, and other countries, thus creating a unique
              opportunity to test hypotheses and contribute to social scientific theory with
              data from one of the most dynamic regions of the world.
