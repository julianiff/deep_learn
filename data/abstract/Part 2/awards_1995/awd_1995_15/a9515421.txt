Abstract    :
              9515421  Kalai    This project studies issues in rational interactive social 
              learning.  This includes learning in long term strategic  interaction, e.g.,
              firms engaged in market competition, and in  recurring short interactions,
              e.g., real estate transactions  involving different buyer-seller pairs.  It
              develops further  theoretical results and applies the theoretical findings to 
              specific problems in economics.  The theoretical developments  include the
              following subjects: (1) asymptotic accuracy of  forecasts as captured by
              notions of merging; (2) testing forecast  performance using past realization as
              done by notions of  calibration; (3) relationships between merging and
              calibration;  and (4) economic and game-theoretic calibrated forecasts.  The 
              applications include the following issues: (1) how long-term  learning affects
              classical models of industrial organization,  e.g., pricing, bargaining and
              auctions; (2) how social learning  can be guided to bring about social
              efficiency;  (3) developing  long-term implementation schemes; and (4)
              developing tests that  enable experimentalist to determine, based only on
              observed past  realizations, whether a long-run or recurring equilibrium is 
              being played.
