Abstract    :
                This award supports a one-year collaborative research project between Dr.
              Diana Beattie, Department of Biochemistry, West Virginia University, and Dr.
              Job Kiaira, Department of Biochemistry, University of Nairobi, in Kenya.    The
              investigators will collaborate on research to clarify the mechanism by which
              mitochondrial biogenesis in the protozoan Trypanosoma brucei is regulated.  The
              investigators will establish the time course of the appearance of different
              segments of the electron transfer chain during the differentiation from long,
              slender mammalian bloodstream forms into procyclic insect forms and examine the
              products of mitochondrial protein synthesis during differentiation.  The
              proposed collaboration combines the  expertise in mitochondrial biogenesis in
              the United States with the Kenyan expertise in the development of trypanosomes.
               T. brucei is the causative agent of trypanosomiasis in cattle.  This study
              will contribute important new insights into the understanding of the electron
              transport chain and its regulation during differentiation.
