Abstract    :
              95-15235    Research on homicide proliferated during the 1980's and 90's but
              social scientists still lack a fundamental understanding of the socioeconomic
              factors that shape Latino homicide.  This Research Planning Grant proposal
              addresses this shortcoming through the collection of data that will enable the
              investigator to examine the relationship between poverty and economic
              inequality and Latino homicide in Miami, Florida between 1989-1993.  Data
              (i.e., date, time, location of homicide event and age, gender, race/ethnicity
              of offender and victim) from the Miami Police Department homicide files will be
              supplemented by US Census income, poverty, educational and population data. 
              This study will test a series of hypotheses related to economic correlates of
              homicide using localized measures (by census tracts) to predict variations in
              homicide rates.  Using census tracts as the level of  the analysis is far more
              sophisticated than most similar work that relies on measures that aggregate
              data at the city or state level.  This data set will be unique in criminology
              and will provide the basis for future comparative efforts with Latino
              subpopulations in other geographic areas.
