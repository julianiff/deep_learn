Abstract    :
              9515330  Johnson    The  neuromuscular junction is a critical relay point in the
               flow  of  information  from the central  nervous  system  to  muscles in all
              vertebrate animals.   Motor neurons ending at  these junctions release the
              neurotransmitter, acetylcholine,  which  diffuses a short distance to interact
              with  molecular  receptor  molecules,  the  acetylcholine  receptors.   These 
              critical   receptors  are  channel  pores  that  open   when  activated  by
              acetylcholine, thereby initiating the  cascade  of events that leads to muscle
              contraction.  Through funding  of  this grant experiments are carried out to
              determine  the  detailed structure of  acetylcholine receptors, which can be 
              obtained  in  large quantities from the electric  ray.   The  approach  is that
              of quantitative fluorescence spectroscopy,  a  unique  technique  for  studying
              structural  features  of  intact  acetylcholine receptor molecules.   The 
              experiments  are  meant  to  delineate  the  specific  binding  sites  of 
              inhibitors  substances and thus to enhance the understanding  of  how  these 
              bindine  sites change as  the  acetylcholine  receptor pore opens and closes.  
               This   study   should   significantly  contribute   to   the  development of a
              molecular understanding of the  actions  of  chemicals on the acetylcholine
              receptor.  Such understanding  will  provide  insights into how this 
              critically  important  protein  functions  at  a  molecular  level.   Concepts 
              and  experimental  approaches  developed  in  the  study  of  the 
              acetylcholine receptor will be applicable to the vast  array  of other
              neurotransmitter and hormone receptors found in all  animals.
