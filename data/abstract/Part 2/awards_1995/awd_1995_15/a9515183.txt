Abstract    :
               This is a study of inter-ethnic attitudes, residential segregation, and labor
              market discrimination.  It will analyze data collected by the 1993-1994 Los
              Angeles Survey of Urban Inequality, which was expressly designed to link
              inter-ethnic attitudes and beliefs to labor market outcomes and to processes of
              racial residential segregation.  This survey involved large samples of the
              non-Hispanic white (N = 863), African American (N = 1119), Latino (N = 988) and
              Asian American (N = 1055) adult populations of Los Angeles County.  The
              substantive core of the survey was three-fold: (1) development of a detailed
              portrait of the human capital attributes and labor market behaviors of
              individuals; (2) mapping the residential integration relevant knowledge,
              intentions, and preferences of respondents; and (3) understanding general
              patterns of inter-ethnic attitudes and beliefs.  The research to be done draws
              systematically on measures of the degree of ethnic identity, inter-ethnic
              stereotypes, perceptions of group zero-sum competition, personal and collective
              perceptions of racial and gender-based discrimination, folk explanations of
              inter-ethnic economic inequality, and views on affirmative action.  These
              measures will be used to map the meanings that characterize self-understanding
              and inter-ethnic relations for the black, white, Asian, and Latino residents of
              one of the most ethnically diverse cities of the world.  Then the research will
              explore how these views affect and are affected by labor market factors and
              racial residential segregation.  %%%   The scientific aim of this research is
              to understand the social psychological processes that may reinforce or reduce
              urban ethnic inequality and the associated inter-ethnic tensions.  It will
              examine the complex series of interconnections among labor market processes,
              racial residential segregation, and inter-ethnic attitudes that undergird
              modern ethnic inequality.  Success in this research will help policy makers
              understand the causes of persistent urban po verty, especially as experienced
              by segments of the African American, Latino, and Asian American communities.
