Abstract    :
              9515490  Lubatti       In this proposal Professor Lubatti requests support for 
              participation of his group at the University of Washington  to participate in
              R&D leading to the eventual construction  of a muon detector system for ATLAS,
              a detector proposed for  the Large Hadron Collider facility at CERN.  ***
