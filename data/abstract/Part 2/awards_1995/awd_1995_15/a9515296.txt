Abstract    :
              One of the most valuable recent theoretical developments in economics has been
              the focus on transactions costs as determinative of economic institutions. 
              This award to an economic anthropologist at Catholic University will support a
              study of the 20th century development of groundwater irrigation systems in
              Northern Spain.  Using transactions cost concepts from the `new institutional
              economics` as well as from schema theory in cognitive science, the project will
              try to explain why farmers selected certain forms of property rights and
              irrigation systems over others that were locally available.  The methods
              include archival data, ethnography and the compilation of a Geographic
              Information System for the area.  This research is important because it will
              provide a fundamental advance in our knowledge of how economic institutions are
              selected in specific situations.  The combination of theory and concepts from
              diverse fields like transactions costs economics and cognitive science will
              advance knowledge in both areas.  The knowledge that the project will create
              about property rights arrangements will be of practical relevance to regional
              water use planners in anticipating extraction rates of ground water.  As a
              human dimensions of global change research project the knowledge created will
              advance our understanding of how people adapt their cultural and economic
              institutions to changes in ground-water resources available to sustain
              agriculture.
