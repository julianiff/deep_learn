Abstract    :
              Electron impact studies are used to probe the three-body  problems of Auger and
              direct double ionization and electron  correlation in atoms.  The apparatus is
              a sophisticated  electron spectrometer which allows coincidence measurements 
              which are multiply differential in angle and energy.  A  modification of the
              current apparatus is proposed which  would considerably extend the range of the
              spectrometer  without major cost.  The information obtained will  substantially
              enhance our knowledge of the mechanism for  double ionization in atoms.
