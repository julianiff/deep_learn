Abstract    :
                      9515459  Holomuzki      This award will support the travel of Dr. Joseph
              Holomuzki  of the Division of Natural Sciences, Transylvania University in 
              Lexington, Kentucky, to enable him to conduct collaborative  research with
              Barry Biggs from the Freshwater Division of the  National Institute of Water
              and Atmospheric Research (NIWAR),  located in Christchurch, New Zealand.  The
              goal of this research  is to document the role of native and non-native fishes
              as  community organizers in New Zealand streams.  Specifically the  work seeks
              to determine whether native and non-native fishes  differ in their abilities to
              withstand scouring floods and to  examine the effects of these fishes on
              post-flood recovery  patterns of stream communities.    Interest in how biotic
              (trophic interactions) and abiotic  (flooding) forces interrelate to organize
              communities is  of current importance in studies of stream ecology.  The 
              effect of introduced trout on New Zealand stream communities is  little known. 
              The American investigator brings to the study his  expertise in biotic dynamics
              and interactions; the New Zealand   researcher has extensive background in
              abiotic factors.  This  study brings together the complementary skills of the 
              collaborating scientists.  The research in New Zealand is  supported through
              the Ministry of Research, Science and  Technology.
