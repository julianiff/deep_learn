Abstract    :
              Consideration of Alternative Hypotheses in Judgments Under Uncertainty  Consider
              a situation where a patient has illness A or she has illness B   f  there are
              two mutually exclusive and exhaustive hypotheses.  Given some evidence for
              illness A (e.g., a test result) a physician might then consider, or be asked,
              how confident knowing this result makes him or her that illness A is the
              problem.  One way to think about how to respond to this question is to compare
              how the evidence reflects on illness A in comparison with illness B.  An
              alternative is to consider how the evidence reflects on A versus against A
              (ignoring B or considering only how the evidence reflects on B versus not B). 
              How competing alternative hypotheses are represented mentally (as dependent or
              independent) will clearly influence evaluations of confidence.  This CAREER
              proposal, involves conducting  a number of experiments to:   Further refine and
              substantiate the idea that the way hypothesis testing is framed influences
              evaluated confidence  Extend the application of this theory of hypothesis
              testing to explain other apparent anomalies in judgment  Extend the model of
              hypothesis testing to more than two alternatives.
