Abstract    :
                9528144  Soles   This interagency transfer of funds is to support activities
              of the US Man and the Biosphere Program (MAB) which is part of the world-wide
              MAB Program. Overall, MAB promotes the study of the interrelationships of the
              Earth's human and natural systems. MAB has an integrated, interdisciplinary,
              problem-focused research approach.     The mission of the US MAB Program is to
              foster harmonious relationships between humans and the biosphere through
              domestic and international cooperation and interdisciplinary research,
              education, biosphere reserves, and information exchange. A National Committee
              established in 1974 by the Department of State and composed of representatives
              from supporting federal agencies and state and private institutions guides the
              development of the national research, education, and training activities.
