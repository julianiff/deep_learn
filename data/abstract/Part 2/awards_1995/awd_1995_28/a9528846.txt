Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help   the
              Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry of the University of   Maryland
              College Park purchase a new 400 MHz NMR spectrometer and to   upgrade an
              existing 500 MHz NMR spectrometer.  The projects that will use   the new
              equipment include:  Synthesis of bioactive substances, chemistry   and biology
              of the trichothecene antibiotic complex, mechanistic   enzymology, metallated
              zintl ions, biological macrocompounds, and peptide   glycosylation.  Nuclear
              Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool   available to
              chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.    It is used to
              identify unknown substances, characterize specific   arrangements of atoms
              within molecules, and study the dynamics of   interactions between molecules in
              solution.  Access to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to
              chemists who are carrying out frontier   research.  The results from these NMR
              studies are useful in areas such as   polymers and catalysis and in biology.
