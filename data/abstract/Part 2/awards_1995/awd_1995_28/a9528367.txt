Abstract    :
              95-28367  Mateo, Mario    Dr. Mateo will systematically search for and study
              eclipsing  binaries in globular clusters.  There are four goals of the 
              project:  (1) Measure the binary frequency in a wide range of  cluster
              environments to determine how it varies with age, cluster  concentration and
              metallicity.  (2) Study the frequency of  eclipsing binaries among blue
              stragglers in a number of clusters  to distinguish between collisional vs.
              merger origin for blue  stragglers.  (3) Derive absolute cluster distances
              without  intermediate steps.  (4) Obtain masses of Pop II stars from  radial
              velocity curves of both components to test the absolute  age scale for globular
              clusters.  The data for these studies will  be based on a large scale
              photometric survey of globular clusters  designed to  search for eclipsing
              binaries with periods of less than 5-10  days.  Follow up spectroscopic
              observations will be made on 4-m  class telescopes.  ***
