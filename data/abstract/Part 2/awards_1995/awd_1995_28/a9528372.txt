Abstract    :
              AST 9528372    Collaborative Project: Independently Determined Distances to the 
              Magellanic Clouds.    Dr. Thomas Barnes at the University of Texas and Dr.
              Thomas  Moffett at Purdue University expect to complete the determination  of
              distances to the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds using a  technique that is
              independent of the standard extragalactic  distance methods.  Distances are
              currently obtained using the  Cepheid Period-Luminosity relation, the RR Lyrae
              mean absolute  magnitude, and main-sequence fitting techniques.  These standard
               methods disagree and lead to uncertain distance scales.  Drs.  Barnes and
              Moffett will use the visual surface brightness  technique to determine
              distances to the Magellanic Clouds with  the intent of improving the distance
              measures to these two key  galaxies.
