Abstract    :
                  Charles Kalina  NCR-9528211    NSF is a major participant in the Federal
              High Performance and  Computing Program (HPCC), along with several other
              Agencies.   HPCC's goal is to accelerate the rapid development of future 
              generations of high performance computers and networks and to bring  the
              results of the program into widespread research, educational,  commercial and
              general public use.  The National Coordinating  Office (hosted by the National
              Library of Medicine) coordinates the  programs of the participating agencies,
              and serves as a liaison to  a variety of parties ranging from the Congress,
              through academia  and industry, to the general public and the Executive Branch.
                 This award provides the National Library of Medicine with support  for the
              Foundation's share of National Coordinating Office  responsibilities connected
              with the HPCC program.
