Abstract    :
              This project will continue investigating excitation cross section  measurements
              of molecular oxygen by electron impact.  Previously,  the PI studied the
              Schumann-Runge continuum, and longest and second  bands.  Under this proposal,
              the pseudo-continuum region will be  studied.  This program will determine
              absolute electron impact  cross sections for all the important electronic
              transitions of  molecular oxygen in the pseudo-continuum region.  Differential 
              cross sections for excitation of the identifiable electronic states  in this
              region will be measured by a crossed-beam method.***
