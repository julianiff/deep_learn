Abstract    :
                9528965  McCALL     This research is a theoretical investigation of the
              non-linear  elastic properties of rocks.  The central construct of this 
              paradigm for the description of the elastic properties of  consolidated
              materials is the Preisach-Mayergoyz space, the  pressure space in which a
              density of microscopic mechanical units  is tracked as a function of the
              characteristic pressures at which  cracks are opened or closed.  This theory
              can be used to predict  the stress-strain equation of state (with hysteresis
              and discrete  memory), the ratio of static to dynamic modulus, and the
              amplitude  of second harmonic generation within a sample.  A successful theory 
              of nonlinear elastic behavior in rock (and other consolidated  materials) will
              provide a necessary tool for turning nonlinear  experimental investigation into
              quantitative measures of rock  properties.  Non-linear elastic behavior of
              rocks is an important  component of theories of the state of rock prior to
              earthquake  rupture.  This research is a component of the National Earthquake 
              Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
