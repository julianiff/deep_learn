Abstract    :
              9528488  Dravid    The connection between the interface structure  and dynamic 
              properties of in-situ interphase interfaces in directionally  solidified
              eutectics (DSEs) is sought__at all length scales,  from micrometers to less
              than nanometers.  Previous work has  shown that DSEs form excellent model
              systems and permit  analysis of interfacial relation and visualization of the 
              atomic structure in three dimensions.  The proposed research  will evaluate the
              atomistic relaxation and determine the  atomic structure of DSE interfaces in
              oxide-oxide and metal  oxide systems.  The dynamics of crack/slip interactions
              with  interfaces and crack-tip atomic structure will be examined  using
              transmission and scanning electron microscopy and  atomic force microscopy. 
              %%%  The proposed research is expected to provide significant  clues, if not
              completely solve, the complex interplay among  all aspects of interface
              structure__at all length  scales__and dynamic properties that are driven by 
              interfacial phenomena. ***
