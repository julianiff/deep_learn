Abstract    :
              ***  95-28553  INRAD, Inc.     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
              Phase II project addresses a narrowband, widely tunable infrared light source
              of wavelengths in the 3-12 micron region.  This spectral region is rich in
              molecular signatures, but there are no commercial laser light sources that are
              both powerful and broadly tunable in the region.  Phase I produced a
              narrowband, widely tunable optical parametric oscillator (OPO) based on zinc
              germanium diphosphide.  Phase II will construct a higher power, narrower
              bandwidth, more widely tunable prototype source.  Improvement will be sought in
              coatings, the extraction of energy from the OPO, and amplification in an
              optical parametric amplifier (OPA).  Pump laser requirements will be studied
              for a practical OPO/OPA system.  A prototype system will be constructed that
              generates a few millijoules per pulse of tunable, long-wavelength infrared
              light in a low divergence beam with a narrow spectral bandwidth.    Tunable
              laser radiation in the 3-12 micron range will be important in studies of
              molecular species in environmental research and atmospheric remote sensing that
              use mobile LIDAR systems.***
