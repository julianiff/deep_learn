Abstract    :
                Valencia Community College requests support from NSF for connection to ICI. 
              This grant will be used to help six campuses get access to the Internet.  The
              six sites are East Branch Campus, Osceola Branch Campus, West (Main) Campus,
              Downtown Center, McCoy Center, and West Park Campus.  ICI, a midlevel network
              in Florida, will provide operations management and information services and it
              will give the college access to the Internet, a collection of interoperable
              networks connecting most research and education organizations in the United
              States.  The Valencia Community College campuses need the Internet connections
              to be able to access information resources throughout the state, the nation and
              the world.  The connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of the
              Valencia Community College system as well as the community in general.
