Abstract    :
              9528621  Ehrenfeld   In this research, systems models will be developed that
              simulate the evolutionary, learning characteristics of typical loop-closing
              structures.  Loop-closing structures in industrial ecology are those that
              incorporate materials recycling as well as product reuse and remanufacturing to
              minimize the demands on the complete ecosystem.  This work aims to build on
              individual product- or process-focused research to develop a better description
              of the dynamic evolutionary behavior of the larger socio-technical-ecological
              system.  Organizational and cultural norms and preferences need to be
              considered to determine critical information linkages as well as primary
              economic and material flows.  Two cases will be developed:  aluminum use in
              automobiles; and alternate materials choices for durable products and
              components.     Modeling of complex interactions among economic, institutional,
              and contextual variables could improve understanding of the nature of
              industrial ecological systems.  This understanding could enable a
              transformation of traditional industrial processes to loop-closing processes in
              which all components are environmentally conscious of the entire system.  More
              effective design, strategic, and policy choices in manufacturing could result.
