Abstract    :
              9528345  Thouless  This is a proposal to continue work on two fundamental 
              problems in materials theory, quantum Hall effect and  superconductivity.  The
              specific problems here are all  derived from the topological symmetry derived 
              conservation laws and the corresponding quantum  numbers. The questions that
              need to be addressed,  include the location where the current is generated in 
              a Hall device and in a superfluid or a superconductor,  the question of the
              mass density of a vortex and  whether the Magnus force on  a vortex is finite
              or  zero.  In addition there will be exploration of some  aspects of quantum
              chaos, for example the notion of a  distance between two states in quantum
              mechanics.  %%%  Much of the metrological work (measumenent of  fundamental
              constants to high precision, or high  precision measurements of voltage and
              resistance)  involve use of topological quantum numbers.  These  quantum
              numbers are found in a variety of diverse  situations and yet there are deep
              underlying  similarities.  The fundamental properties associated  with the
              topological quantum numbers are the subject of  this study.  The applications
              include the stability of  superconductor or a superfluid and more specifically 
              the detailed dynamics of the vortices.  A comprehensive  review, in the form of
              lecture notes and reprints of  classical papers on the subject of topological
              quantum  numbers will be prepared.
