Abstract    :
              This research investigates the generation of manufacturing tests for highly 
              sequential VLSI circuits.  The approach is based on combining the best features
               of deterministic and simulation based techniques.  Deterministic techniques
              are  mainly used to (1) identify untestable and redundant faults and (2) to
              correct  the direction of the simulation based search.  Simulation based test
              vector  generation examines a set of test vectors to determine a new test
              sequence to  detect some faults.  This process, while accurate and fast,
              generates longer than  necessary test vectors.  The technique being explored is
              detecting and correcting  the genetic search, using deterministic ATPG.  This
              process involves an intricate  exploration of the power of a switch-level logic
              and fault simulator in an  combination with a genetic algorithm and the
              deterministic ATPG during the test  generation process.  The technique is being
              applied to design problems such as,  circuit partitioning, initial test set
              finding, and circuit initialization-  structure to determine performance and
              quality of generated test sets.
