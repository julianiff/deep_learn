Abstract    :
              Use of database systems for non-traditional applications has prompted the 
              development of new transaction models whose semantics vary from the traditional
              model, as well as from each other. This project is concerned with the
              development of  a framework for supporting various transaction models in an
              extensible manner. ECA (event-condition-action) rules are defined at the system
              level, in contrast to the  ECA rules currently supported at the application
              level. The rules apply to significant operations of a transaction and/or data
              structures and are used to support both  traditional and extended transaction
              models.  Formalization of the interaction among various transaction models
              allows the use of  different transaction models by different applications on
              the same database management system (DBMS). The results of this project will
              further enhance  the use  of database systems  -- for new classes of
              applications (e.g., workflow and enterprise modeling) that cannot be currently
              supported directly by traditional DBMSs.
