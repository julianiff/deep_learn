Abstract    :
              9528429  Martin    Monodisperse conductive polymer nanowires and tubules can be 
              prepared by synthesizing the desired polymer within the  pores of nanoporous
              filtration membranes.  The primary  objective of this proposal is to use the
              template method to  investigate the effects of molecular and supermolecular 
              structure on electronic conduction in conductive polymers.  Specifically,
              measurements of the temperature and pressure  dependence of conductivity, the
              field dependence of  conductivity, and the temperature and pressure dependence
              of  the magnetoresistence, photoconductivity, and Hall effect  will be used to
              explore how structure affects hopping  distance, localization length, and
              density of states at the  Fermi level in template-synthesized electronically 
              conductive polymers.  %%%  The largest impediment to a thorough understanding
              of  electronic conduction in conductive polymers is the  inability to prepare
              samples whose properties can be  reproducibly and predictably controlled. 
              Template-synthesis  allows for this type of structural control and thus
              provides  a unique opportunity to explore the fundamentals of  electronic
              conduction in these materials.  ***
