Abstract    :
              This proposal will support the operation of the University of New Hampshire's
              meteor radar for three years to:  (1) continuously monitor the dynamics of the
              mesosphere and lower thermosphere at midlatitudes, and (2) support analysis of
              the data to produce scientific results relevant to spectral content, ranging
              from mean and planetary winds to tides and short period gravity waves.  Wind
              studies will include investigations of temporal and spatial variability of the
              planetary and tidal components through intersite comparisons (with the
              Mesosphere-Lower Thermosphere radar group), mesosphere-thermosphere propagation
              studies of the tidal components through coordinated measurements with the
              Millstone IS radar, nonlinear interactions between wind components, and
              continued climatological studies of the wind field.
