Abstract    :
              This is a companion project with Software Capitalization  Program Award
              CCR-95-28215, `` Fast Randomized Algorithms  for Optimization and Other
              Applications of Geometric Random  Walks''.  Both of these linked awards are
              part of the PI's  continuing long term project, started under CCR-92-08597, 
              ``Random Walks, Parametric Integer Programming''.  Under  this previous grant,
              CCR-92-08597, random walk algorithms to  sample from a wide class of
              multivariate probability  distributions were developed.    The goals of this
              project include:            (a) The study of some algorithmic applications of 
              the random walk technique, including (a1) producing and  using random samples
              given a convex set, (a2) investigating  the rapid generation and use of
              contingency tables, and (a3)  exploring geometric and efficiency questions
              arising in the  estimation of volumes of convex sets, the original  motivation
              for random walks;            (b) The study of some fundamental questions that 
              arise in computational learning theory related to convex  sets, including
              (b1)``synthesizing'' a convex set given  random samples, (b2) generating
              algorithms and determining  the complexity of certain multi-dimensional convex
              sets  given samples from them, both when the learning is  ``distribution-free''
              (in the sense of Valiant) and when the  samples are drawn from an uniform
              distribution on the convex  set.  ***
