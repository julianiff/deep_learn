              Abstract  ATM-9528148  Stahle, David W.  University of Arkansas  Title: Select
              Tree-ring Chronologies for Large-scale Paleoclimate          Reconstruction   
              Annual ring-width chronologies derived from ancient trees present 
              exactly-dated, strongly-replicated archives of environmental  history, and
              provide one of the premier quantitative records of  interannual to decadal
              climate variability during the Holocene.   Select tree-ring chronologies from
              northern Mexico and the southern  USA reflect both regional climate variations
              and changes in large-  scale atmospheric circulation.  This award supports
              research  designed to develop a widely distributed array of long tree-ring 
              chronologies in subtropical North America that are sensitive to the  El
              Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific/North America  (PNA)
              circulation pattern.  Selected locations where the most ENSO  or PNA-sensitive
              chronologies occur will be revisited to sample  additional ancient trees,
              historic timbers in nearby buildings, or  well-preserved subfossil wood in
              order to compile the longest  possible proxies of past circulation.  This
              project will also  intensify the effort to develop the first climate and ENSO- 
              sensitive tree-ring chronologies in tropical East Africa.  The  proposed ENSO
              and PNA reconstruction should provide unique insight  into the long-term
              variability of ENSO and/or its teleconnections;  the possible link between ENSO
              and global average temperature  during the Medieval Warm Period, Little Ice
              Age, and 20th century  warming; and the possible coupling/decoupling between
              ENSO and PNA  in forcing climate anomalies over North America.
