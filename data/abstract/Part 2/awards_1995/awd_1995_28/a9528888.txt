Abstract    :
                9528888  Vernon-Gerstenfeld      This is an award to support a project the
              objective of which is  to determine the progress toward the application of two
              concepts  for management of wastewater treatment residues and to identify 
              further research needed to address issues that have precluded  their more
              widespread adoption in environmental engineering  practice.  The concepts to be
              studied include use of ionizing  radiation for disinfection of residuals and
              the use of these  residuals in production of ceramic building materials.   This
               project, as was the prior one in 1988, will be conducted through  the
              Worcester Polytechnic Institute's Washington Project Center.    Since the prior
              study in 1988, there has been a strong movement  toward recycling of used
              materials to minimize impact of their  processing and disposal on environmental
              quality.  Three  undergraduate students will assist the Principal Investigator
              on  this project to fulfill the requirement of their having conducted  an
              Interactive Qualifying Project that links science, engineering  and technology
              to societal needs and concerns.  Results are  expected to assist in providing a
              basis for determination of  research needs and thus be useful for program
              planning purposes.
