Abstract    :
              9528581  Beck  This research is a collaboration between the University of
              Arizona and Carnegie Institute of Washington to accelerate the use of data
              recorded by a temporary array which, by luck, was installed directly over the
              1994 Bolivian great deep earthquake.  This magnitude 8.3 event occurred at a
              depth of 636 km, was the largest earthquake in the world since 1977 and the
              largest deep earthquake ever recorded.  Data from this origin of deep
              seismicity and the structure of one of the  most seismically active areas in
              the world.  This grant will support the construction of an event data base for
              the mainshock and 42 of the largest aftershocks that will immediately be made
              available to the general scientific community through the on-line IRIS data
              center.  Funding will also augment an intensive research program in the
              analysis of these close-in station recordings.  This grant is supported under
              the Small Grants for Exploratory Research Program and also is a component of
              the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
