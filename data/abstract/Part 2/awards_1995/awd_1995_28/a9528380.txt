Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9528380    Flow visualization and heat transfer studies of
              gas-liquid-solid fluidization at pressure up to 22 MPa and temperature up to
              200( C will be conducted.  The effect of changing the pressure and temperature
              in three-phase fluidized beds will be investigated.  An experimental apparatus
              has been built to enable PIV visualization and thermal transport experiments. 
              Bubble motion, coalescence and break-up processes will be analyzed based on the
              measurements.  Regime transitions, incipient fluidization, phase holdups and
              bed expansion/contraction phenomena will be determined for the fluidization
              system.  The local heat transfer characteristics in three-phase flow will be
              measured using a microfoil heal flow sensor.  This project is proposed to be
              conducted in collaboration with four industrial units (Shell Development Co.,
              Amoco Oil Co., Hydrocarbon Research Inc., and Exxon R&D Co.), under the Grant
              Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) initiative.    The
              project will lead to new knowledge for three-phase flow, with application to
              design and operation of hydrocarbon processing in fluidized bed reactors of
              relevance in oil industry.  ***
