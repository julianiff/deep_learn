Abstract    :
                This is a companion project with CCR-95-28973 (entitled  ``Optimization and
              Learning over Convex Sets'') and is an  award under the Software Capitalization
              Program.   The  project's goal is to upgrade and update software that had  been
              produced.  These upgrades and updates are based on  algorithms developed under
              support of CCR-92-08597. The  software is for executing random walks that
              produce a sample  from certain multi-variate probability distributions.  An 
              update of the software involves simply changing the ``number  of steps''
              parameter in the random walk. Applications of  this discrete probabilistic
              software (i) to contingency  tables and (ii) to the membership oracles for
              optimization  over convex sets, are investigated.    With good planned
              dissemination (for example, on the world  wide-web)and well thought-out
              testing, other applications of  this software are anticipated.      ***
