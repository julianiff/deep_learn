Abstract    :
              9528481  Lodge  Polymer mixtures - blends, copolymers, and combinations  thereof
              - are an increasingly important source of superior  macromolecular materials. 
              Four specific project areas are  identified.  The first concerns the underlying
              timescale for  segmental rearrangements, which impacts all dynamic  properties
              through the monomeric friction factor.  A second  project will examine tracer
              diffusion in weakly-segregated  copolymers and blends.    The third thrust
              emphasizes more  strongly-segregated structures, namely block copolymers in 
              the ordered state, and the tracer diffusion of copolymers,  homopolymers, and
              small molecule probes therein.  The final  area of interest is the role of
              solvent concentration and  quality in determining the morphologies adopted by
              block  copolymers.  Particular emphasis will be placed on 
              continuously-variable solvent selectivity, to be achieved in  part via mixed
              solvent.  %%%  This research will lead to fundamental understanding of 
              structures and interactions of polymer chains in mixtures of  polymers and
              copolymers with extensions on processability  and property optimization.  ***
