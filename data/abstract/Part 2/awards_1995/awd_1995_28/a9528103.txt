Abstract    :
              9528103  Binder  The IETF is a part of the successful evolution of the Internet
              and  its fundamental role in the evolving National Information  Infrastructure.
               The IETF activities are an outgrowth of efforts  started by the US Government
              during the late 1970s to manage the  evolution of the Internet.  Under a
              Cooperative Agreement with the  National Science Foundation, the Corporation
              for National Research  Initiatives created and provided a functioning IETF
              Secretariat,  and has been helping to organize and support these activities
              which  involve thousands of individual participants and contributors from  the
              US and abroad.    To ensure the continued evolution of the Internet and its 
              contribution to the emerging NII, CNRI proposes to provide the IETF 
              Secretariat for a period of three years.  The continuation of the  Secretariat
              with US Government funding will provide stability and  continuity to the IETF
              during important transitions of the Internet  involving significant
              architectural change and increased commercial  activity.    CNRI also proposes
              to create a Planning Group, inclose consultation  with the Government and the
              IESG (IETF Steering Group), to develop  a plan for generating long-term IETF
              Secretariat funding.
