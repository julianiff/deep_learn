Abstract    :
              9528057  Luco  This project uses the extensive seismic response data recorded 
              within the Hualien, Taiwan, 1/4-scale model of a nuclear  containment structure
              to validate a set of mathematical models  and computer codes. These
              mathematical models and computer codes  are used to calculate the seismic
              response of important  structures when the effects of the interaction between
              the  structure and the surrounding soil are significant.    The Hualien
              experiment is being conducted by a consortium of  organizations including the
              Electric Power Research Institute  (EPRI) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
              (NRC) in the U.S.  and institutions from Taiwan, Japan, Korea and France. The
              first  task of the project is to predict the seismic response of the 
              containment model on the basis of ground motions recorded on the  free-field
              ground surface away from the structure. In a second  task, the predictions are
              compared with the observations to  obtain an overall assessment of the current
              capability to model  the seismic response of structures partially embedded in
              soils,  when soil-structure interaction effects are important. Finally, 
              identification techniques are used to infer from the recorded  data some of the
              characteristics of the structure and the soil.  ***
