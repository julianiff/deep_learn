Abstract    :
              Landolt, Arlo  95-28177    Dr. Landolt will complete a career long work on
              photometric  standard star sequences.  The goals of this effort are to 
              establish UBVRI sequences approaching the 21st magnitude at the  celestial 
              equator, to establish UBVRI sequences at the +45 deg declination  zone, to
              refine some previously observed sequences, to compare  the CCDphot and
              photoelectric data for some of the +45 deg  sequences, and to monitor and
              reduce the results for the  secondary program objects as time and resources
              permit.  ***
