Abstract    :
              9528207  Mathine  This proposal is for the development and integration of an
              infrared  detector that is integrated with CMOS technology for detection of 
              low light levels with high bit rates.  Specifically, this proposal  will
              address, the detector design, the integration process, and the  amplifier
              design.  This technology will be developed to accommodate  detection in the
              near infrared (= 0.85 um) or (1.3 um - 1.55 um)  light.  This proposal will
              perform the prototyping in the A1GaAs  system (= 0.85 um).  ***
