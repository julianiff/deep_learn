Abstract    :
                                            ABSTRACT    9528497  ROUNDS    This Memorandum of
              Agreement (MOA) has been established between  the NSF/OPP and NASA Ames
              Research Center, NASA Science Internet,  as a collaboration vehicle intended to
              capture data and related  telecommunications supported previously under a
              separate MOA with  NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C.  The predecessor MOA was
               established in support of collaboration between NASA and NSF for  developing
              jointly managed projects to explore the analog between  space exploration and
              research and Antarctic science and  research.    A continual growth in
              telecommunications and data networking  projects has occurred under the
              original MOA to the degree that  both agencies agreed to develop a new
              framework of interaction  tailored specifically for this function.    The
              accompanying Task Completion Summary represents the first  funding for specific
              tasks originated under the old MOA  framework:              (a)  Continuation
              of INTELSAT satellite            telecommunications services, Internet
              services, and on-            demand compressed video services for McMurdo
              Station                   $516,000              (b)  Provision of electronic
              news gathering microwave            transmission system and fiber optic
              video/audio            transmission cable system in support of the NSF-NASA    
                     distance learning project, "Live From Antarctica"                  
              $48,000    These products and services have been provided by NASA on a cost 
              reimbursable basis by NSF.    The full requested amount of $562,000 is
              recommended for award to  NASA in reimbursement of FY95 funds expended in
              support of NSF  activities of the United States Antarctic Program.  ***
