Abstract    :
              At present there are large computer programs capable of  representing
              mathematical proofs (such as NuPrl) and large  computer programs capable of
              symbolic computation (such as  Macsyma), and many theorem-proving programs that
              try to find  proofs.  But these three capabilities are nowhere present  in the
              same system.  In this project, a single system  smoothly integrating symbolic
              computation and representation  of mathematical proofs will be built, and
              supplemented  with proof-finding algorithms.  A prototype version has  already
              been able to generate automatically an epsilon-delta  proof of the continuity
              of f(x) = x^3.  The system to be  built will be able to generate many other
              epsilon-delta  proofs and other more complicated proofs in analysis.  ***
