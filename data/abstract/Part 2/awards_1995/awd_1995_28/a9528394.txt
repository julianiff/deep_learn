Abstract    :
              Cordes, James  95-28394    Dr. Cordes will address a wide range of topics which
              concern  neutron stars and their uses for probing the interstellar medium. 
              Specifically, he will improve the Talyor-Cordes distance model,  construct a
              model radio pulsar beam to determine pulsar  parameters and distances, search
              150 pulsars for the presence of  planets and asteroids by analyzing their pulse
              timing, study the  initial velocity distribution of pulsars, search for new
              pulsars,  and continue to analyze white  dwarf companions of new millisecond
              pulsars looking for pulsar  wind nebulae.  ***
