Abstract    :
              9528034  Narsimhan  This conference will provide  forum to help determine future
               research directions for the field of food process engineering.   Many
              important technological advances are occurring in the  biophysical
              understanding of foods. This conference will help to  consider these advances
              by combining engineering fundamentals  with the basic principles of food
              science.  This will be  accomplished by inviting leading researchers in
              different areas,  including both industry and academia.  The program includes 
              sessions on: (1) the physical chemistry of foods, covering the  topics of
              emulsions and foams, protein adsorption,  physical/chemical properties, and
              moisture relations in foods;  (2) transport processes and unit operations,
              covering the topics  of rheology, frying/dehydration, extrusion, thermal and
              non-  thermal processing, and separations/packaging; and (3) innovative  food
              manufacturing processes, covering the topics of pilot plants  and scale-up,
              research in food engineering, innovative concepts  in food processing and
              manufacturing processes, and engineering  issues in food manufacture. 
              Participation at this conference  will be international and will include food
              engineers, food  scientists, chemical and biochemical engineers, food chemists,
               and food microbiologists.  ***
