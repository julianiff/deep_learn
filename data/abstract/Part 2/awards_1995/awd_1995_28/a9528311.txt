Abstract    :
                    The goal of this proposal is to initiate a study of plant  resistance to
              aphids in a system consisting of tomato  (Lycopersicon esculentum) and the
              potato aphid (Macrosiphum  euphorbiae).  Dr. Williamson has recently described
              a tomato  gene, Meul, that confers resistance to potato aphid.  Meul  is
              tightly linked to Mi, a single, dominant locus that is  present in some tomato
              lines and mediates resistance to root-  knot nematodes.  Mi-mediated nematode
              resistance is  associated with a localized necrosis in the root within 24 
              hours of penetration by the nematode.  The mechanism of Meul-  mediated
              resistance to aphids has not yet been studied in  detail.  Preliminary
              observations, and comparison to the  nematode resistance, suggest that specific
              recognition of  the aphid by the plant is involved in the initial step of a 
              signal transduction cascade that leads to localized necrosis  and production of
              defense compounds.  This would represent  the first example of this mechanism
              of plant resistance to  an insect.  This proposal seeks to establish the
              groundwork  for a future proposal on characterizing the recognition  mechanism
              and signal transduction pathway of plant response  to aphid.
