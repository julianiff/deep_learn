Abstract    :
              Fisher, George  95-28474    Dr. Fisher will study how magnetic flux emerges from
              the solar  interior, where it is generated, to the surface, where it is 
              observed.  Theoretical models of flux emergence based on the flux  tube
              paradigm have been tremendously successful in explaining  many properties of
              active region magnetic fields.  These models  will be improved in three ways --
              first, to improve the treatment  of the velocity field on rising flux to
              include turbulent and  meridional flows; second, to include twists in emerging
              fields to  account for certain strange active regions and flaring; third, to 
              include fragmentation of rising flux and more carefully treat  submerging flux.
