Abstract    :
              Multigrid Methods are efficient algorithms used for solving a variety of
              problems.  Previous development of multigrid software by the PI was rather
              specific.  In this project a broader approach and design will be used.  The PI
              will implement a general object-oriented multigrid toolbar with the following
              features: Versatile and fast access data structure; OOP and literate
              programming philosophy; differential equation and variational inequality
              formulations; graphical user interface; and will solve some non-standard target
              problems.      The toolbox will be used for the development of multigrid
              methods for the following non-standard problems: Small wavelength-(indefinite
              system) Helmholtz equations: variational inequalities and eigenvalue problems. 
              These problems are hard from the multigrid point of view.  The PI will design
              parallel algorithms for the new methods and for other problems which may rise.
