Abstract    :
              This is a collaborative effort among three universities (Columbia, Rochester,
              and Pittsburgh) to construct, evaluate, and disseminate a package of Corpus
              Analysis Resources for Discourse (CARD).  The goal is to provide the means for
              a large-scale, robust analysis of language use, both within and across distinct
              types of discourse corpora.  The three components of CARD are a Discourse
              Annotation Language (DAL) to encode information pertaining to language use
              directly within discourse corpora; reliability measures of the degree of
              variability in DAL annotations; and a library of DAL-annotated corpora, varying
              in modality, number of participants, domain, and communicative task.  DAL
              follows the Text Encoding Initiative guidelines and is implemented in Standard
              Generalized Markup Language to facilitate common authoring and editing
              utilities.  DAL is a modular language with five layers of linguistic
              representation: morpho-syntactic, prosodic, anaphoric, lexical, and segmental.
