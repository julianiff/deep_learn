Abstract    :
              Chi Ho Mak is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational  
              Chemistry Program to continue his research in path integral theory of  
              electron transport in chemical and biological systems.  Feynman path   integral
              theory is applied in conjunction with Quantum Monte Carlo   techniques to the
              study of the mechanisms for electron transport in a   number of molecular
              electronic systems.  The influence of the chemical   environment on the motions
              of the electron is examined in relation to the   quantum mechanical features of
              electron transfer reactions.  Various   aspects of tunneling, coherence,
              quantum interference and electron   correlation will be studied, and an effort
              will be made to understand the   crossover region between adiabatic and
              nonadiabatic barrier crossings.    Applications include studies of charge
              separation rate in the bacterial   photosynthetic reaction center, a
              potentially useful molecular quantum   interference device, and quantum
              conductance of one-dimensional molecular   wires.  The understanding of
              long-range transport of electrons in molecular   systems is of fundamental
              theoretical importance.  It is also one of the   key objectives in a rapidly
              growing area which has become known as   molecular electronics.  Molecular
              electronics involves the control of   electron flows in molecules through the
              use of external signals.  Work in   this area may eventually lead to electronic
              devices with miniaturization   on the order of molecular dimensions.
