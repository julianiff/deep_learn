Abstract    :
              9528579  Eagar   This small grant for exploratory research will investigate the
              equipment and control system needed for rapid solid freeform fabrication (SFF)
              of fully dense metal  components.  A nozzle deposits layers of metals in their
              mushy state.  The nozzle position and orientation are computer controlled,
              allowing the freeform shape to be built-up.  Using lead-tin alloys, this
              technique produces non-porous, fully dense freeform structures. When this
              approach is used with higher melting point alloys like those used for dies and
              molds, this becomes a viable rapid prototyping process to produce tooling. 
              Exploratory research issues are: the suitability of higher melting point alloys
              like  6061 and  443  aluminum, models for heat transfer between the SFF surface
              and injection molded polymer materials, and surface coatings for molding
              applications.  Other issues are controlling the position and orientation of the
              nozzle, and providing smooth motion and temperature control to achieve
              controlled material properties.  This research will lead to a viable rapid
              prototyping process that can quickly produce tooling for short to medium runs
              of  injection molded or die cast products.   ***
