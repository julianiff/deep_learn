Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the  
              Chemistry Division, Coe will study aqueous cluster ions using a novel   merged
              cation-anion fast beam apparatus.  Water and aqueous solvation   will be
              examined through the reaction of mass-selected beams of   oppositely charged
              cluster ions.  Recombination rate constants are   measured as a function of
              cluster size and center-of-mass collision   energy to reveal the effect of
              clustering solvent molecules.  Several new   experiments are proposed in order
              to examine larger cluster size and   determine the effect of solvent number. 
              Reactions of charged species in solution lie at the heart of many   chemical
              reactions, but very little hard information has been available   about the
              detailed role of the solvent in influencing the course of a   chemical
              reaction.  Prof. Coe will address this question by studying   molecular-scale
              species known as clusters, which consist of solvent   molecules attached to a
              central species which has an electrical charge.    Using a unique experimental
              apparatus he can determine, for example, how   many solvent molecules there
              must be around the central species in order   to keep positively charged
              materials from reacting immediately with   negatively charged species.  This
              will help to answer the more general   question of how many  molecules are
              needed to define what chemists mean   by a solution of one substance in
              another.
