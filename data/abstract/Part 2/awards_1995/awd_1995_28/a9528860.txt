Abstract    :
              AST-9528860  Martha Haynes  Terry Herter    Kinematics, Dynamics and Star
              Formation in Galaxy Disks and Their  Implication on Distance Indicators.   
              Drs. Haynes and Herter will continue a study of the properties of  disk
              galaxies and the implications of the derived properties on  distance
              indicators.  The work covers four basic areas.  They  will complete a
              comprehensive study of spiral galaxies which  includes over 500 neutral
              hydrogen spectra and I band images and  350 optical rotation curves in 11
              clusters of galaxies in the  local universe.  They will investigate the
              detailed distribution  and kinematics of stars and gas within a sample of non- 
              interacting, spiral galaxies in the local supercluster with radio  and optical
              observations.  They will continue an investigation of  the star formation
              process in the disks of spiral and irregular  galaxies through optical and
              radio-wavelength observations.  And  they will continue to study starburst
              galaxies using infrared and  optical observations.
