Abstract    :
              9528079  Vaina   This project is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research.  The
              feasibility of new approaches to vision applied to recognition problems of use
              to the visually impaired is investigated.  These approaches combine coarse,
              easily obtainable, visual data with novel adaptive learning algorithms to
              recognize features such as moving objects and terrain irregularities.  The
              results of this research project will be feasibility study as to the robustness
              and practicality of this approach in developing a "magic hat" - an aid to the
              visually impaired consisting of a sensor and computation ring that would be
              worn by users as a hat and which adaptively warn the user of hazards.  ***
