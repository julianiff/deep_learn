Abstract    :
              With the support of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Prof.   Charles
              S. Johnson of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill   will pursue a
              number of research objectives:  1) he will expand the   capabilities of
              Diffusion Order Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy   (DOSY), so that it
              can be used to study systems with very small diffusion   coefficients.  This
              will require very large magnetic field gradients, and   Johnson plans on
              exploiting the large fringe fields of the   superconducting magnet for the
              pulsed field gradient NMR.   2) He plans   on measuring molecular weight
              distributions of fluoropolymers in   supercritical carbon dioxide, an
              environmentally benign solvent; this   will require the design of a high
              pressure instrument.  3) Johnson will   develop heteronuclear DOSY, and 4) he
              will make improvements on   electrophoretic NMR techniques using Mobility
              Ordered 2-dimensional NMR   spectroscopy, or MOSY.    DOSY and electrophoretic
              NMR allow the measurement of molecular diffusion   coefficients as a function
              of the chemical shifts of the various species   present in a mixture.  This new
              work will extend considerably the range   of diffusion coefficients which can
              be measured, while also providing   better sensitivity and resolution. 
              Supercritical carbon dioxide is a   viable replacement for aqueous and organic
              solvent systems, especially   the ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons.   The
              research effort in   fluoropolymers in supercritical fluids should prove
              critical to   furthering the basic understanding of the chemistry and dynamics
              of these   solution systems.
