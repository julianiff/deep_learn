Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of new methods for the  
              stereoselective formation of a carbon-heteroatom and a carbon-carbon bond   in
              a single process.  The methodology will exploit diazo compounds that   possess
              an alpha-electron withdrawing group as one carbon dipoles in ring   forming
              reactions.   The preparation of tetrahydrofurans,   tetrahydropyrans, oxetanes,
              azacyclics and carbocycles will be carried   out and the new methodology will
              be showcased by the preparation of   shodamycin and the E-ring of lonomycin. 
              Both of these systems show   important biological activity.  With this award,
              the Synthetic Organic   Program is supporting the research of Dr. Steven R.
              Angle of the   Department of Chemistry at the University of California,
              Riverside.    Professor Angle will focus his work on developing new methods for
                ring-forming reactions.  The products of these reactions are oxygen  
              heterocycles, nitrogen heterocycles and carbocycles, all of which can   occur
              in compounds having interesting and important biological   properties.
