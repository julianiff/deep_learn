Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9528412    This is an extension of the earlier development of a
              nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic method for determining Hammett
              acidity functions for real catalysts.  The main thrust is the application of
              the method to solid "acids", a class of materials to which the Hammett acidity 
              concept does not apply.  A parameter named "relative protonating ability" is
              defined and used for acid "strength" comparisons; it is determined  by
              protonation of indicators at stoichiometric ratios to the acid sites or
              molecules.  Both traditional solid acids as well as materials formed by surface
              treatment of solids are studied, including heteropolymetallates, sulfated metal
              oxides, and zeolites.  To expand  the measureable acidity range, fluorinated
              alkenones and aromatic hydrocarbons are studied as possible indicators.  The
              dependence of protonation on temperature is studied from -80( C to 200( C.  The
              acid strengths are correlated with catalytic activity for well-studied
              reactions such as isomerizations of olefins or paraffins.    Solid acids are
              being used with increasing frequency in industrial processes because of their
              perceived environmental advantages.  However, adequate objective measures of
              their acid strength are not available.  In addition, there is controversy about
              how acidity in solids should be defined.  These issues are addressed in this
              project.    This project is supported jointly by the Divisions of Chemical and
              Transport   Systems and of Chemistry.  ***
