Abstract    :
              9528422  Samson    This grant provides $150,000 as partial salary  support for a
              laboratory technician over a three  year period.  Specifically, the technician
              will be  responsible for the day-to-day management,  operation and maintenance
              of a thermal ionization  mass spectrometer (TIMS) and an X-ray fluorescence 
              spectrometer (XRF) for the Earth Sciences  Department at Syracuse University. 
              This proposal  is a Phase I technician support proposal under the  EAR/IF
              program.  The addition of a lab technician  at Syracuse will allow these
              facilities to be  opened up to a wider regional community of users  and allow
              these PI's to enhance their scientific  productivity in research areas such as
              the  tectonic investigation and geochemical  characterization of slates in the
              southern  Appalachians utilizing Uranium-Lead geochronologic  techniques to
              establish the timing of orogenic  events and Neodymium isotopic analyses to
              yield  insights into the petrogenesis of these terranes.  ***
