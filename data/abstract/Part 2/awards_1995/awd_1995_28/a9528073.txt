Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT  Harritt, McCartney, Bodenhorn  OPP-9528073.      This small
              grant for exploratory research is intended to bring the PIs together with the
              Alaska Native Whaling Commission and the North Slope Borough History, Language
              and Culture Commission for purposes of research planning and coordination. The
              focus will be on prehistoric and contemporary whaling practices and cultures.
              Among the primary questions to be addressed are the environmental contexts
              within which whaling originated and developed, the varied importance of whaling
              through time, oral traditions, gender roles, and ceremonialism. This
              combination of scientific expertise with Native interests has great potentials
              and is in keeping with the goal of creating research partnerships with native
              peoples.   ??
