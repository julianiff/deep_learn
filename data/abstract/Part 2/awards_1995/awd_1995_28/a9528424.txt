Abstract    :
              Tohline  95-28424    Dr. Tohline will study stellar formation using the
              gravitational  hydrodynamics code developed previously.  Specifically, he will 
              address three problems -- to map out the critical states at which  protostellar
              accretion disks become dynamically unstable to  gravitational fragmentation, to
              examine the dynamical stability  of ellipsoidal or dumbbell-shaped equilibrium
              structures with  nontrivial internal motions, and to examine the evolution of 
              warped HI galaxy disks to determine the extent to which the disk  settling
              process is connected to the global process of star  formation.  ***
