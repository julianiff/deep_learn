Abstract    :
              Geometric drawings give rise to many interesting and important  problems which
              are the extensions, generalizations, or the dual  forms of the well known
              planar crossing problem.  A k-crossing in  a geometric drawing is defined to be
              a set of k edges which  pairwise cross in the drawing.  An interesting problem
              here is to  generate geometric drawings with small number of k-crossings, for 
              a given graph and a given k>1.  Another important problem is the  crossing
              clique problem, in which the objective is to generate  geometric drawings so
              that the largest clique of crossings (the  largest k so that the drawing has a
              k-crossing) is small.  This  problem is closely related to the page number
              problem and has  nice applications to the theory of VLSI.  The dual concept to
              a k-  crossing is a k-disjoint set: Given a geometric drawing of the G,  a
              k-disjoint set is a set of k edges which are pairwise non-  crossing in the
              drawing.  The concept of k-disjoint sets gives  rise to problems which are
              similar to those of k-crossings, in a  dual setting.  It is the goal of this
              investigation to study k-  crossings, k-disjoint sets, and the crossing clique
              problem.  The  aim is to develop algorithms which can generate solutions whose 
              quality can be guaranteed and/or to develop general structural  results in a
              form which could be applicable to a broad class of  graphs.  ***
