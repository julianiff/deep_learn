Abstract    :
              9528484  Ribe    This grant provides $117,378 as one-half support  of the costs
              of computer upgrades and purchase of  a new high-end IBM RISC 6000 workstation
              for use  in this group's computationally intensive research  in geodynamics,
              modeling of active tectonics,  seismic imaging of the crust, and theoretical 
              seismology and paleoclimatology.  More  specifically, the upgrades will allow
              this group  to develop more realistic and complex 3-D models  for,
              visualization of mantle plume-lithosphere  interactions, mixing at the
              interfaces of mantle  convection cells and seismic propagation through  the
              earth's crust as well as to develop geographic  information system databases
              and regional-scale  models for studies in active tectonics.  ***
