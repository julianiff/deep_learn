Abstract    :
              9528840  Threlkeld  Plant and animal communities are often influenced by
              material flows or organism movements from adjacent habitats, although the
              extent of influence on neighboring communities is poorly known.  In aquatic
              systems, these neighborhood influences are mediated through water circulation,
              sedimentation, resuspension, or the life history movements of key consumer or
              prey species.  Although the size frequency distribution of organisms in natural
              communities has been used to understand trophic interactions in individual
              communities, the proposed research will investigate the extent to which size
              structure changes in adjacent habitats are related to each other, which might
              suggest important inter-habitat linkages.  The proposed research will use a
              28-pond experiment to examine the link between communities in bottom and open
              water habitats by evaluating if experimentally-induced changes in size
              structure in one habitat result in similar or complementary community size
              structure changes in the adjacent habitat.  A broad array of nutrient and
              consumer treatment combinations known to influence size distributions of
              biomass and particulate phosphorus in one of the two habitats will be used to
              measure how communities in adjacent habitats are linked.  Because heterogeneity
              is common in the spatial arrangement of habitats, it follows that processes
              organizing the community of one habitat may influence those of adjacent
              habitats, even beyond edge effects which are often present and well documented.
               The proposed pond experiment is the first aquatic study to evaluate directly
              if and to what extent size structure changes in one habitat are related to
              those in adjacent habitats, providing evidence of community linkage in aquatic
              systems and a means for evaluating landscape level patterns in other systems.
