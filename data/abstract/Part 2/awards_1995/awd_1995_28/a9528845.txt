Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS 95-28845  WALLACE  MARYLAND    This proposal seeks to understand
              the physics of turbulent energy dissipation in the atmospheric surface layer,
              especially near the ground. The unique abilities of a 12-sensor hot-wire probe
              to measure the velocity vector and the velocity gradient tensor components in
              the surface layer will be exploited. From these measurements, the turbulent
              dissipation rate can be calculated using conditional analysis and joint
              probability density analysis. These measurements can significantly aid in the
              ability to model turbulence by two-equation modeling and Large Eddy Simulation.
