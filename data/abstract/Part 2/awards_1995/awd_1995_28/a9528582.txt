Abstract    :
              9528582  Silver   This research is a collaboration between the University of
              Arizona and Carnegie Institute of Washington to accelerate the use of data
              recorded by a temporary array which, by luck, was installed directly over the
              1994 Bolivian great deep earthquake.  This magnitude 8.3 event occurred at a
              depth of 636 km, was the largest earthquake in the world since 1977 and the
              largest deep earthquake ever recorded.  Data from this event is valuable for
              addressing many questions including the origin of deep seismicity and the
              structure of one of the most seismically active areas in the world.  This grant
              will support the construction of an event data base for the mainshock and 42 
              of the largest aftershocks that will immediately be made available to the
              largest aftershocks that will immediately be made available to the general
              scientific community through the on-line IRIS data center.  Funding will also
              augment an intensive research program in the analysis of these close-in station
              recordings.  This grant is supported under the Small Grants for Exploratory
              Research Program and also is a component of the Nation Earthquake Hazard
              Reduction Program.
