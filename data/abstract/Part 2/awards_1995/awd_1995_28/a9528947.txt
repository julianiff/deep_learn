Abstract    :
              9528947  Morrison         This grant provides $80,000 as one-half of the  total
              costs of two-years salary support for a  stable isotope laboratory technician. 
              This Phase  II technician support award follows the successful  completion of a
              three-year Phase I award and after  its expiration, the technician's position
              will be  supported by the University of Southern California  for an additional
              three years at the 50% level.  The technician will be responsible for the 
              maintenance and operation of a gas-source stable  isotope ratio mass
              spectrometer and extraction  lines and will assist with the training of 
              graduate and undergraduate students and develop  new laboratory techniques. 
              Further technical  assistance at this laboratory will allow the PI to  continue
              research addressing problems concerning  crustal fluid flow, depth of
              penetration and  fluid/wall rock interaction.  ***
