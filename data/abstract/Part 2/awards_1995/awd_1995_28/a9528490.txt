Abstract    :
              9528490  Mendoza    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
              project explores a new concept for fabrication of passive and active integrated
              optic devices in glasses.  The approach is direct photolithographic writing of
              integrated optic devices onto photoactive sol-gel glasses.  Phase II will
              develop and characterize simple integrated optic structures such as 1x2 and 2x2
              splitters and directional couplers for use in passive optical telecommunication
              networks.  Both single-mode and multimode couplers will be fabricated with a
              wide range of splitting and coupling ratios and losses on the order of 0.1
              dB/cm.  In addition, methods will be developed for automated coupling of
              input/output (IO) chips to signal-carrying optical fibers using laser fusion. 
              IO chips connected to optical fibers will be encapsulated in polymer resin
              packages to protect the devices from mechanical and environmental damage. 
              Finally, Alpha-test prototypes will be distributed to industrial laboratories
              for feedback and guidance in Phase III commercializtion.    Potential
              commercial applications of the sol-gel process are expected in passive optic
              telecommunication networks, telephony, cable television, video distribution
              loops, high-bandwidth digital communication, analog signal transmission,
              sensors, environmental monitoring, and medical dianosis.
