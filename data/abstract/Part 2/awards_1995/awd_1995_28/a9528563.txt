Abstract    :
              95-28563  Saar, Steven    Dr. Saar plans to address the analysis and
              interpretation of  stellar magnetic observations through three parallel
              efforts.  The first is a detailed analysis of existing data from over 200  GKM
              dwarf stars, determining the magnetic field strengths and  filling factors (or
              upper limits).  The second is to make new  infrared observations of field
              strengths and filling factors for  M dwarf and active subgiant stars.  The
              third is to study flux  tube emergence in a variety of stellar atmospheres and
              compare  the solutions with the surface distribution and magnitude of  magnetic
              fields found in the first two parts of this project.  ***
