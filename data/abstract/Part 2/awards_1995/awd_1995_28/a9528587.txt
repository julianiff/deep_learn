Abstract    :
              This is the initial funding of a 36-month cooperative agreement to fund the
              Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC).  Under this funding, the LDC will create new
              databases and improve infrastructure to continue and improve its work of
              creating, publishing and distributing data for research on human language
              technology.  Improved speech and text data resources will be created in three
              areas: multilingual speech, multilingual and parallel text, and human-computer
              interaction.  The LDC will publish and distribute these resources using the
              same approach of the many databases already in its catalogue.  In addition, the
              LDC proposes to provide improved Internet-based access for its members to
              essentially its entire archive of data, except where license agreements stand
              in the way.  This access would encompass both WWW-based search and retrieval of
              modestly sized pieces of the data, and also (on an experimental basis)
              wide-area remote file mounting for access to entire databases.  Significant LDC
              cost-sharing is proposed for all of these activities, including the donation of
              time and facilities as well as the expenditure of case for equipment, license
              fees and additional needed labor.
