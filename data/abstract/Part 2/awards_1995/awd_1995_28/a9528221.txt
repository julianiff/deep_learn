Abstract    :
                9528221    Support was requested for a Neodymium: YAG laser for particle
              imaging velocimetry.  With the addition of the laser, the PIs will have a
              system for vizualizing and measuring instantaneous velocity fields in a variety
              of applications.  Projects which will benefit from the PIV system involve heat
              transfer and fluid flow in advanced gas turbine disk cavities, in gas turbine
              centrifugal compressor backface cavities, and in subcooled boiling.  The grant
              was supported under the Research Equipment Grant Program.
