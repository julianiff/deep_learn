Abstract    :
              9528574    Richardson    In this project, PIs will study the Benguela Current as
              it flows northward through the South Atlantic   and across the equator. 
              Specific objectives are to measure the flow of Intermediate Water that is  
              carried into the South Atlantic by the Benguela-Agulhas system, and to trace
              its extension   northwestward.   RAFOS floats are designed to float at a given
              depth in the ocean, and to   communicate with moored sound sources in a way
              that gives their location periodically from which   velocities at that depth
              may be inferred.  Thirty such floats will be deployed and tracked   downstream
              of the Benguela Current at the level of the Intermediate Water (about 700
              meters), and   in several Agulhas eddies to estimate their contribution to the
              transport.  The work will be carried   out in collaboration with South African
              (Conductivity Temperature Depth (CTD) surveys) and German   scientists (18
              additional floats and two additional sound sources).  The observations are
              expected to   provide a visualization of the flow field and velocity statistics
              which will be applied to developing and   validating models of the thermohaline
              circulation of the ocean.
