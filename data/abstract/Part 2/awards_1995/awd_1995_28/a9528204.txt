Abstract    :
              9528204  Heeger  In light-emitting electrochemical cells, a p-n junction diode
              is created  in-situ through simultaneous p-type and e-type electrochemical
              doping on  opposite sides, respectively, of a thin film of conjugated polymer
              which  contains added electrolyte to provide the necessary counterions for
              doping.  Light-emitting devices based on conjugated polymers have been
              fabricated  which operate by the proposed electrochemical oxidation reduction 
              mechanism. Blue, green, and orange emission have been obtained with turn-on 
              voltage close to the bandgap of the emissive material. This proposal  outlines
              a focused program of basic scientific research on the chemistry, 
              electrochemistry, physics and device physics of Polymer Light-Emitting 
              Electrochemical Cells. The proposed research will probe the p-n junction 
              created in-situ with the goal of determining the width and profile of the 
              junction as a function of applied voltage; the proposed research will 
              characterize the electrical properties of the p-n junction created in-situ 
              (using current vs voltage and capacitance vs voltage measurements); and, 
              finally, the proposed research will investigate the stability of the p-n 
              junctions created in-situ.  ***
