              Title: Implementation of a Pilot Global Geocryological Database at        
              WDC-A Glaciology    This is a one year grant to rescue, recover, archive and 
              disseminate permafrost data that was collected in the former Soviet  Union but
              is in danger of getting lost permanently.  The project is  guided by criteria
              for priority databases established by the IPA  working group on permafrost data
              and information.  This data is  very valuable for climate research.
