Abstract    :
              9528535  Scalettar  This grant contains a two pronged (analytical and numerical)
               study of interplay between disorder and strong correlations  in quantum and
              classical phase transitions.  The research  covers a broad range of topics,
              including boson and fermion  Hubbard models, the dynamics of vortices in high
              temperature  superconductors, quantum spin glasses, possible "supersolid" 
              phases in Fermi and Bose systems and whether a Bose system  can remain normal
              at zero temperature  due to quantum  fluctuations..  In the course of this
              work, there is also a  plan to develop new computational tools, e.g. .
              applications  of the maximum entropy method to the dynamical response of 
              random systems.  %%%  The project is a combined effort by two researchers with 
              complementary talents, one has a strong background in the  mathematical
              analysis and the other is well known for his  work using high performance
              computers.  They have chosen to  apply their combined talents to a wide range
              of problems in  Materials Theory: phase transition between a superconductor 
              and an insulator, Current-voltage characteristics of  superconductors and 
              properties of  Bose condensation as  influenced by a variety of perturbations. 
              Our understanding  of superfluids and superconductivity in copper oxides will 
              be main beneficiaries of this research.  ***
