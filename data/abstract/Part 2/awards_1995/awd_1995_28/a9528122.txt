Abstract    :
              Abstract  9528122  Bieber  This project uses neutron monitors to measure the
              flux of low energy cosmic rays arriving at the top of the atmosphere to:
              Increase the understanding of the acceleration and transport of solar cosmic
              rays; to identify the mechanisms underlying transient cosmic ray variations; to
              determine the causes of solar variations; to describe the nature of turbulence
              in the solar wind; and to derive information on large-scale structure in the
              plasma which permeates the solar system.  This research will be using detectors
              at South Pole, McMurdo and on the USCG icebreaker which comes to McMurdo each
              year.  The ship allows a latitudinal survey of cosmic ray fluxes.  ***
