Abstract    :
              9528844  Gelbke  Research in heavy ion nuclear physics will be carried out at
              the  Michigan State University Superconducting Cyclotron Facility  (MSU/NSCL). 
              The NSCL is a national user facility , with research  being carried out by
              faculty, staff, postdocs, and students from  MSU, from other universities in
              the US and abroad, from US  national laboratories, from other federal agencies,
              and from  industry.  Proposals are made to the NSCL for use of the  available
              accelerator beam time and for other specialized  resources needed to carry out
              the experiment.  All proposals are  reviewed by a national program advisory
              committee, which in turn  makes recommendations to award beam time or to
              decline these  proposals.  The NSCl operation staff provides about 4000 hours o
               accelerator beam time per year.  ***
