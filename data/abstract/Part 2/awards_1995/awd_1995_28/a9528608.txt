Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a Small Grant for Exploratory  Research (SGER) to
              Hamilton to investigate a step feature which  has been observed in satellite
              imagery near the Williams Field  skiway on the McMurdo Ice Shelf, near McMurdo
              Station,  Antarctica.  This study has severe urgency and therefore is 
              appropriate for an SGER award since there is a concern that the  step feature
              may be a precursor to ice shelf breakup, which would  have drastic implications
              to the United States Antarctic Program  (USAP).  This can be considered
              "quick-response research"...on an  "unanticipated event" and therefore falls
              under the guidelines in  the Grant Proposal Guide for SGERs.   Field studies
              will involve  precision GPS surveys to obtain surface velocities and strain 
              rates and the results will be used to test if the step results  from rifting
              near the ice shelf terminus or has some other  origin.  This work will provide
              a baseline against which to  monitor the future behavior of the ice shelf.
