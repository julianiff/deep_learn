              Social Aspects of Digital Libraries    The Digital Libraries research has
              brought together  researchers from computer science, communications, library 
              and information science, psychology, linguistics, and from  the disciplines in
              which digital libraries are being  created, including the sciences, social
              sciences, arts, and  humanities.  Digital Libraries are a prime example of
              large  societal problems that bring human & technological resources  to bear on
              their solutions.    Many social aspects of digital libraries need to be 
              addressed, as we come to undertand the full range of issues  they encompass. 
              This research workshop will focus on two  social problems that are urgent in
              developing the National  and Global Information Infrastructures:          
              Information Needs: Identifying real information    needs and developing digital
                 libraries to mee those    needs.           End User Searching And Filtering:
              Designing digital    libraries in which it is possible    to find the right   
              information in a glut of information.    These two problems have been chosen
              because they are urgent,  enough research exists to frame them but not enough
              to solve  them, and the work on these problems is scattered across  multiple
              disciplines that need to be brought to form a  research community.
