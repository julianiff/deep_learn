Abstract    :
              9528796  Soni  The 5th International Conference on Numerical Grid Generation in
              Computational Fluid Dynamics and related Fields is organized by the National
              Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Computational field
              Simulation and the Aerospace Engineering department both at Mississippi State
              University.  This international interdisciplinary conference provides a joint
              forum where mathematicians, scientists, and engineers from academia, industry,
              and federal laboratories can communicate (exchange/assimilate) research ideas,
              new algorithmic and software developments, and applications involving grid
              generation strategies pertinent to a wide range of practical problems arising
              in Computational Field Simulation.  the primary objective of the conference is
              to optimally fulfill the aforestated mission; but, at the same time to promote
              research and education in mathematical, computational, and engineering analysis
              of grid generation pertinent to Computational Field Simulations (CFS) and
              provide graduate students and young Ph. Ds an opportunity to present their
              work, meet researchers, and learn of recent developments in the
              interdisciplinary area of grid generation.
