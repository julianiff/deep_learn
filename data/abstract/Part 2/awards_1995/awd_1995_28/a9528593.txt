Abstract    :
              The PI will study, through remote sensing, various disturbances in the polar
              upper atmosphere over the Cusp Auroral Observatory in Longyearbyen, Svalbard. 
              This research will address two aeronomic problems:  (1) the effects of charged
              particles on thermospheric composition and thermodynamics, and (2) the effects
              of planetary, tidal and gravity waves on the middle atmosphere and lower
              thermosphere density and temperature.  The unique location of Longyearbyen
              permits monitoring optical signatures of upper atmospheric disturbances
              triggered by the magnetospheric particles precipitating in the cusp, LLBL, and
              poleward boundary of the night sector of the auroral oval, as well as in the
              polar cap region.  Large differences in the average energy of the particles
              precipitating in these regions lead to optical emissions from distinctly
              different heights.  Absolute intensities of the emissions will provide the
              necessary database for quantitative assessment of upper atmospheric
              disturbances.  Such data constitute the input needed for detailed numerical
              auroral model calculations to derive thermospheric temperatures and constituent
              densities at different heights.  Finally, the proposed measurements can
              determine the dynamical and chemical processes that convert the effects of
              zonally symmetric non-migrating tides in the polar middle atmosphere and lower
              thermosphere.
