Abstract    :
              With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Streitwieser at   the
              University of California-Berkeley is to continue his studies on the   reaction
              dynamics of polar organometallic reagents. Through experimental   as well as
              theoretical chemistry, a more thorough understanding of the   factors governing
              the aggregation of these complexes and their relative   reactivities will be
              garnered. One of the major questions still   confounding investigators in this
              area is the state of reagent   aggregation versus reactivity. This proposal
              addresses this issue. Since   these reagents are ubiquitous in organic
              synthesis, an understanding that   allows scientists to predict the reactivity
              with regard to   chemoselectivity and stereoselectivity would have significant
              impact on   the use.  Synthetic organic chemistry which is responsible for new
              methodologies   and actual preparations of physiologically active compounds
              relies   heavily on specific reagents to effect certain organic
              transformations.   Some of these reagents are complex and have a variety of
              forms. Since the   exact form affects the efficiency of its reactivity, it is
              important to   understand the factors influencing these reagents. This proposed
              effort   will address these issues with regard to polar organometallic
              reagents.
