Abstract    :
              9528547  Warner  This is a collaborative study of deep and bottom water
              formation in  the southern sector of the Indian Ocean, as   part of the World
              Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Indian Ocean  Expedition (IOE).  Six PIs
              from six   institutions will complete the final segment of the WOCE 
              Hydrographic Program Line, S-4, along 60 degrees   South from about 20 degrees
              East to about 120 degrees East.  The  program is designed to detect subtle  
              differences across the Kerguelen Plateau, an important hydrographic  boundary
              for bottom waters.  In addition   to hydrography, the section will include
              standard tracer  measurements, as well as CFCs, Helium, Tritium, and  
              Carbon-14, all to WOCE standards.  In addition to the zonal line,  two
              excursions to the shelf at about 54   degrees East and 96 degrees East will be
              made to investigate the  Antarctic Slope Front and its associated   westward
              current.  Expendable current moorings will also be  deployed at several
              locations to measure, for one   year, the current along the slope and on the
              flanks of the  Kerguelen Plateau.
