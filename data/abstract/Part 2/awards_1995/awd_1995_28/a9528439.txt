Abstract    :
              9528439  Ezekiel    Massachusetts Institute of Technology  "Improving Access to
              High Quality Network-Based Education and Training"  This project was requested
              and funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).  NSF is handling
              the award because of its interest in this and related projects, some
              joint-funded with ARPA.  The award supports an 18 month project to investigate
              seamless delivery of high-quality interactive multimedia programing using
              CD-ROM (local) and server (network) content over a wide spectrum of bandwidths.
               In addition to two prmtotypical programs being developed, deliverables include
              client and  server software, research reports, publications and tutorials and
              colloquia.    Most of the effort will be performed by Dartmouth College and
              Medical School under a subcontract to MIT.  MIT is the prime on two related
              awards and is coordinating the entire effort.  The University of Georgia is
              providing assessment of learning outcomes under a subcontract to Dartmouth.
