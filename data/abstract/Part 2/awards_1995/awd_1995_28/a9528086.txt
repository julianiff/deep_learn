Abstract    :
              9528086   Houston     This project will contribute to the understanding of ozone
              photodissociation and formation processes in the upper atmosphere. Several new
              mechanisms for additional ozone production in this region have been suggested
              recently. One of them involves the production of vibrationally excited oxygen
              molecules from the photodissociation of ozone, which could react with ground
              state oxygen molecules to form ozone. The first step of this process,
              production of vibrationally excited oxygen, has been demonstrated by the PI in
              earlier work. The second step, ozone formation, has not been unambiguously
              identified, however, there is indirect evidence from recent work.   In this
              project, the technique of product imaging will be used in concert with laser
              photodissociation. In the imaging technique, a "snap-shot" of the
              three-dimensional velocity distribution of a state-selected reaction product is
              produced. From this, the internal energy distribution of the molecular oxygen
              fragment can be deduced. The objectives of this project are: (1) determine the
              wavelength dependence of the production of  triplet oxygen in the vibrational
              states above the energetic threshold (v=26) for ozone formation via reaction
              with another oxygen molecule, (2) investigate the product distributions in the
              singlet dissociation channel.
