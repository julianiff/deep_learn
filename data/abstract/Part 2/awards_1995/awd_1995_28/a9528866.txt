Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9528866  John Foss  Michigan State University    A Workshop: 
              Fluid Flows/Fundamental Automotive Issues will be held at Michigan State
              University on August 20-22, 1995.    The topical focus areas are:   1) external
              aerodynamics,   2) under-hood cooling,   3) climate control flows, and   4)
              induction/exhaust system flows.    The specific objectives are delineating the:
                1) basic research efforts which should be pursued to contribute to the pre-
              competitive knowledge base in each of the four topical areas, and   2)
              operating procedures which will permit useful interactions between academic r
              researchers and industrial colleagues.    A general objective of the workshop: 
              to bring together members of the industrial and the academic communities to
              explore common interests, will be met by its organizational structure. 
              Specifically, the designated co-chairs for the four breakout sessions will be
              selected from these two communities, and the general attendees will be invited
              from the two communities.  There are, built into the program, formal and
              informal opportunities to effect the contacts that can be expected to lead to
              appropriate cooperative efforts.    Joint support has been arranged from the
              Chrysler Corporation, Ford Motor Company, and General Motors Corporation.  In
              addition, The Automotive Research Initiative of Michigan State University will
              contribute to the support of the workshop.
