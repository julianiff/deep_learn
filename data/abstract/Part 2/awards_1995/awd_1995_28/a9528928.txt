Abstract    :
              9528928  Bowman    Microstructural design of ceramics  with microstructures 
              inspired by nature is the key to ongoing research on  hierarchical
              microstructure systems for mechanical or  electronic applications.  The
              proposed project is focused on  preferred orientation and anisotropy effects on
              processing  and properties of ceramics.  The combined processing and  property
              analysis of textured silicon nitrides provides a  quantified correlation of
              orientation to anisotropy.   In  this project, deliberately  textured materials
              will be  studied to provide understanding of the mechanisms producing  the
              texturing and the effect the texturing will have on the  resultant mechanical
              and electrical properties.  %%%  The goal of the proposed research is to
              develop an  understanding of how texturing that occurs in actual  components
              and how that texturing can be used to optimize  the properties.  ***
