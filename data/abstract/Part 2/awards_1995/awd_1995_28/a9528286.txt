Abstract    :
              9528286  Grassman    Notre Dame College: Connection to the Internet     Notre
              Dame College of Ohio requests support from NSF for connection to the Ohio
              Academic Resources Network (OARnet).  OARnet, a midlevel network in the state
              of Ohio, will provide operations management and information services and it
              will give  the campus access to the Internet, a collection of interoperable
              networks that connect most research and education organizations in the United
              States.    The campus needs the Internet connections to be able to access
              information resources throughout the state, the nation and the world.  The
              connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of the Notre Dame College
              campus as well as the community in general.
