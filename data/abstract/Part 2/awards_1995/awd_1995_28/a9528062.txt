              Abstract  ATM-9528062  Johnson, Thomas C.  University of Minnesota  Title: IDEAL
              Studies on the Paleolimnology and Paleoclimate of Lake  Victoria: fossil
              invertebrate assemblages as proxies for climatic  and anthropogenic change   
              The IDEAL initiative is a multinational effort to study the  limnology, modern
              and past ecology, and paleoclimatology of the  large lakes of East Africa. 
              Undisturbed recovery of an in situ  sediment profile is a prerequisite for
              successful paleolimnological  study. This award supports the development of
              deep-water freeze-  coring technology to meet the sampling challenges presented
              by  tropical lakes, in particular deep productive lakes where fine 
              stratigraphy can become disrupted in unfrozen core samples by post-  recovery
              degassing of sedimentary methane.  The device will be used  to collect cores of
              recent sediments in profundal and sublittoral  areas of Lake Victoria, visited
              during the IDEAL 1996 field  campaign.  Fitted with a well-constrained
              210Pb-chronology, these  undisturbed sedimentary archives will permit
              reconstruction of Lake  Victoria's 19th- and 20th century history at the finest
              temporal  resolution possible.  Study of the freeze-core samples will focus  on
              natural and anthropogenic changes in species composition of  benthic and
              planktonic invertebrate communities, for which  currently no long-term data are
              available.  Analysis of fossil  invertebrates in long piston-core records from
              Lake Victoria  collected by IDEAL will produce valuable independent information
              on  the lake's late Quaternary history and help constrain paleoclimatic 
              interpretations based on sedimentology and stable-isotope  geochemistry.
