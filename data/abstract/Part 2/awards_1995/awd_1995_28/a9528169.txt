Abstract    :
              95-28169  Honeycutt, R. Kent    Dr. Honeycutt's objective is to understand some
              of the known and  newly-discovered changes that occur in cataclysmic variable
              stars  (CVs) on time scales of  weeks to years.  CVs emit most of their  light
              from an accretion disk surrounding the white dwarf.  Accretion disks occur in a
              wide range of astronomical situations,  including proto-planetary systems,
              quasars, and stellar black  hole candidates as well as x-ray sources containing
              neutron  stars.  The unusual  long-term changes in the brightness and in the
              spectrum of CVs  are likely to be due to accretion disk instabilities and/or
              the  accretion process itself.  Other changes may be due to stellar  activity
              cycles on the mass-losing component of the binary  system, analogous to the
              solar sunspot cycle.  ***
