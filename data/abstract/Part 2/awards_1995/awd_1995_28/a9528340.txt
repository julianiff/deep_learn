Abstract    :
              AST  95-28340  PI:  Marc Davis         Studies of Large Scale Structure in the
              Universe         This proposal has three parts, all concerned with the large
              scale structure (LSS) of the universe. The first part is to complete a
              comparison of an IRAS-derived local gravity field to the observed peculiar
              velocity field. This will help evaluate the distribution of dark matter in the
              "local" environment. The second part is to support Keck observations relating
              to LSS. The emphasis is on small projects during the remainder of the Keck
              instrumentation "shakedown", such as trying for redshifts of very faint
              galaxies and to obtain K-band imaging in fields with very deep HST imaging, but
              software development for the DEIMOS spectrograph is also planned. DEIMOS should
              be completed in 1998. Finally, the PI intends to continue development of n-body
              LSS simulations. In particular, use of GRAPE, a computer board hardwired to
              optimize such calculation, is expected to provide a factor of 5 improvement in
              mass resolution, compared to previous simulations.
