Abstract    :
              Paczynski, Bohdan  95-28096    Dr. Paczynski will study detached, eclipsing,
              double-line  spectroscopic binaries, which are the primary source of 
              information about stellar masses, luminosities, radii and  effective
              temperatures.  They can also be used to determine  distances to about one
              percent accuracy; distances to several  globular clusters and at least four
              nearby galaxies will be  determined this way, based on observations of member
              binaries.  ***
