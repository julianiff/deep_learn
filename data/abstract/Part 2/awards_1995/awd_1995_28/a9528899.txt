Abstract    :
              Kirshner, Robert  95-28899    Dr. Kirshner will continue his program to study
              supernovae -- to  gather observations of the  brightness, color and spectra of
              supernovae.  The goals are to  understand how stars explode, to assess the
              supernova  contribution to the heavy element abundance of galaxies and to  use
              supernova explosions as tools for measuring the size and the  age of the
              universe.  ***
