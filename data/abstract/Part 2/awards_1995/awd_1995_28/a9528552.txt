Abstract    :
              King   9528552    Carbon monoxide (CO) plays a major role in atmospheric
              chemistry. Through a series of reactions, CO can contribute to the formation of
              tropospheric ozone, which poses a serious health concern on a regional   scale.
               While anthropogenic sources of CO are reasonably well understood, relatively
              little is known about natural CO sources and sinks. Wetlands have been
              discounted as CO sources on the basis of sediment CO   concentrations. 
              However, plant leaves and stems produce significant amounts of CO when
              illuminated by the sun.  Because of their large amounts of plant biomass,
              wetlands are likely strong net CO sources.  Our work will determine the extent
              and controls of CO emission from wetlands, and contrast the behavior of CO with
              that of methane, another important atmospheric trace gas for which wetlands are
              a primary global source.  Our work will also examine links between CO
              production and increased ultraviolet (UV) irradiation due to stratospheric
              ozone depletion.
