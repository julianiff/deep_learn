Abstract    :
              This research explores the relationships between models used to refine the
              system  design, to assess the real-time behavior of the system, and to assess
              the fault  tolerance.  these relationships are being combined to develop tools
              for system-  level modeling with dependability analysis of the design.  The
              approach builds  on two recently developed tools, ADEPT (Advanced Design
              Environment Prototype  Tool) and DREDD (Dependability and Risk Evaluation using
              Decision Diagrams).   Advanced techniques for dependability analysis of
              embedded computer systems are  being put into the ADEPT design environment. 
              There, a dynamic fault tree model  is automatically generated from the ADEPT
              system design model.  The fault tree  models uses a combination of Markov
              techniques, combinatorial approaches and  binary decision diagrams.  It can
              model permanent and transient hardware faults,  unrelated and related software,
              automatic recovery and reconfiguration  management, sequence dependencies and
              other dynamic behavior.
