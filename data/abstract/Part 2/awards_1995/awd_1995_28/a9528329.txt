Abstract    :
              9528329  Mitchell    MOREnet Expansion Phase 10     The University of
              Missouri-Columbia requests support from NSF to connect the National College
              institutional network to MOREnet.  MOREnet, a midlevel network in the state of
              Missouri, will provide operations management and information services and it 
              will give the campus access to the Internet, a collection of interoperable
              networks that connect most research and education organizations in the United
              States.  The campus needs the Internet connection to be able to access
              information resources throughout the state, the nation and the world.  The
              connection will benefit the faculty, staff students  of the National College
              campus as well as the community in general.
