Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   Program
              will help the Department of Chemistry at Colorado State   University purchase
              an electrospray probe and associated liquid   chromatography sample
              introduction accessories for a Fisons/VG Quattro-SQ   mass spectrometer, which
              will be used in research.  The research activity   to be supported includes:(1)
              mechanisms of DNA crosslinking by the   anti-tumor antibiotics, (2) mechanistic
              studies of nucleic acid damage,   (3) the association between polyelectrolytes
              and lyotropic liquid   crystals, (4) characterization of iridoid and other
              glycosides isolated   from medicinal plants, (5) the synthesis and physical
              studies of   so-called supramolecular assemblies, (6) identification of the
              fragile   polychalcogenide anions in solution, and (7) the characterization and
                estimation of purity of fluorinated carborane anions.  Mass Spectrometry (MS)
              is a technique used to probe intimate structural   details and to obtain the
              molecular compositions of a vast array of   organic, bioorganic and
              organometallic molecules.  The addition of the   technique of electrospray
              extends the range of MS to protein and nucleic   acid molecular weights far
              beyond those accessible by any other   technique.  The use of electrospray
              ionization in combination with high   resolution provides the latest techniques
              available in mass spectrometry.    It affords the chemist one of the most
              powerful tools available for the   characterization of compounds.  The
              acquisition of this capability in   mass spectrometry is essential for the
              prosecution of frontier research   in many fields of chemistry.
