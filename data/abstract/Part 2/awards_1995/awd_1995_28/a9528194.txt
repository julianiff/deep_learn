Abstract    :
              This is a research planning grant developing modeling and simulation aigorithms 
              to assess system performance and to recreate events so as to interpret cause- 
              effect relationships.  The research planning activities focus on investigating 
              the potential for developing accurate, general purpose modeling techniques that
               include compressing multiple experiments (variations of effects on the model) 
              while allowing internal observation to expose the perturbations that caused the
               outcome.  The grant resources are being used to contact other researchers 
              involved in related efforts; and to investigate issures involved in expanding 
              existing concurrent algorithms to areas beyond digital logic modeling and 
              experimentation.
