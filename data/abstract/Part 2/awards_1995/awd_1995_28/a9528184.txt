Abstract    :
              NCR-9528184  George Whitehead      Bellcore, Tektronix, the Joint
              Interoperability Test Command  (JITC), and the University of Pennsylvania will
              implement an ATM  Interoperability Testbed to develop tools, procedures, and 
              standards that promote interoperability among   Asynchronous Transfer Mode
              (ATM) products.  The project will focus  on three key areas of ATM technology
              and include relevant research  and development of interoperability testing
              systems. These areas  are 1) ATM signaling Interoperability, 2) ATM traffic
              management  interoperability, and 3) higher-layer protocol interoperability. 
              These areas are chosen because standards for signaling, traffic  management and
              higher layer protocol interoperability.
