Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  OPP-9528936  Chagnon/Ziker      This dissertation research project
              will test the proposition that Siberian peoples are becoming more integrated
              with the Russian and global market economy. Although microeconomic theory and
              ethnographic reports support this hypothesis for many regions, there is reason
              to question it for the Siberian north. Since the dissolution of the Soviet
              Union, native people across Siberia are instituting "family and clan" farms.
              They are replacing the State Farm economy and may represent greater autonomy on
              the part of native people. The project will generate both quantitative and
              qualitative data from household surveys, interviews and participant observation
              in the community of Ust Avan. These data will be used to analyze and compare
              family/clan farms with the State Farm system, modes of exchange, patterns of
              land and resource use and ethnicity.
