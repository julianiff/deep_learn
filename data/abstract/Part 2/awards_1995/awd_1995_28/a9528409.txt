Abstract    :
              Dr. Thomas B. Rauchfuss of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign   will
              design and synthesize a variety of molecular and solid-state metal   sulfide
              compounds.  The four specific areas of study include   metal-centered
              reactivity in M4S3 clusters and osmium- and iron-sulfides,   examining
              structure/reactivity trends in M3S4 clusters, development of   new routes to
              dimers and polymers containing metal clusters, and   manipulating the stability
              and stoichiometry of newly discoverd C60-S-Fe   adducts.  A basic premise of
              the cluster work is that reactive entities   are best prepared by subtle means
              compatible with the preservation of   highly reactive sites, and patterns
              delineated in this study are expected   to provide a context for correlating a
              significant body of molecular and   solid state chemistry.  Dr. Rauchfuss will
              also explore new hybrid   bio-organometallic materials and new carbon sulfides
              derived from C60   which bridge the interface between inorganic and
              organometallic sulfide   chemistry.  The overall goal of this research is a
              molecular-level understanding of   the synthesis, reactivity, and structure of
              metal sulfides.  The   information obtained from this work provides an
              underpinning for new   catalytic technologies, new materials, and most
              importantly, the   discovery of unexpected new chemical phenomena.  The work is
              motivated by   the broad relevance of metal sulfide systems and the chemsitry
              of   elemental sulfur to such materials. Furthermore, the work is expected to  
              lead to the discovery of new chemical phenomena related to materials used   to
              clean fossil fuels, to transform atmospheric nitrogen into life-giving  
              ammonia, and to capture and transfer energy from the sun.
