Abstract    :
              95-28227  Terndrup, Donald    Dr. Terndrup's project is a combination of both
              observation and  theory to discern the relative importance of core/envelope 
              interactions, disk/envelope locking and angular momentum loss  through winds,
              which can be disentangled by observations which  measure rotation over a large
              range of mass and age.  The yield  should be a large data base on rotation
              periods and rotation  speeds for low mass stars in several clusters with ages
              1-100  Myr.  Measures of Li abundances will also be obtained, as a  measure of
              the amount of mixing in the outer stellar envelopes  and how that mixing
              depends on rotation.  Theoretically, the project will continue and expand
              current  efforts to include the effects of disks, winds, and magnetic  fields
              in models of stellar evolution.  ***
