Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  9528109  Wells    A request has been made for funds to help defray
              registration charges and transportation costs for seven leading US combustion
              researchers who will give invited talks at a Symposium On The Formation And
              Control Of Combustion Generated Pollution.  This symposium is part of the 1995
              International Chemical Congress of Pacific Basin Societies to be held on 17-22
              December 1995 in Honolulu, Hawaii.    The aim this conference is to bring
              together experts from the Pacific Basin Countries to discuss many of the issues
              arising from combustion generated pollution.  Specific sessions will deal with:
              (1) Fundamentals of pollution generation and destruction, (2) Laboratory and
              field measurements and (3) Novel control strategies.
