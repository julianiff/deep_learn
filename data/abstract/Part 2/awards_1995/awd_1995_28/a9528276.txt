Abstract    :
              9528276  Cogger  Cornell University requests funding for research and
              development in  the area of ATM over low-cost media.  In particular, they will 
              explore "Cells in Frames," the transport of ATM over ethernet  media.  Initial
              investigations made them confident that the concept  is workable and would be
              highly beneficial.  With industry  partners, Cornell will develop a prototype
              network, large enough  for a significant demonstration, which will include low
              cost CIF  access devices and diverse end system environments.  They will test 
              its effectiveness and develop prototype applications.
