Abstract    :
              9528255   Lamb     Atmospheric aerosol strongly affects many processes in the
              atmosphere, including cloud formation, chemical transformations, radiation
              balance, and climate. The chemical nature and microphysical behavior of these
              particles depend in turn on the temperature and composition of the surrounding
              air. The sulfuric acid particles found in the upper troposphere and lower
              stratosphere are very hygroscopic and tend to absorb ambient water vapor and
              soluble trace gases because of the low temperatures prevailing there. Detailed
              information on the microphysics and chemistry of aerosols can be obtained from
              laboratory studies.     The overall objective of this research is to determine
              how representative aerosol particles respond to varying environmental
              conditions. Laboratory experiments with micron-size sulfuric acid particles
              levitated electrodynamically in an environmental chamber will be conducted over
              broad ranges of temperature and humidity in the presence of controlled
              concentrations of a soluble trace gas, such as nitric acid or hydrochloric
              acid. The experimental system, developed during prior research, is configured
              as a wall-less flow reactor, mimicking atmospheric conditions. Data from these
              experiments will yield new insights into aerosol-atmosphere interactions and
              serve to verify various gas-particle interaction models needed to parameterize
              aerosol effects in large-scale atmospheric models.
