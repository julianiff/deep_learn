Abstract    :
              9528313  Cummings  The proposed research project will analyze an existing and 
              unique international database, the Carnegie Survey of the  Professoriate, to
              compare the status of women faculty in  science and engineering within 14
              countries (the United  States, England, Germany, the Netherlands, Russia,
              Sweden,  Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Brazil, Chile, Mexico,  Israel, and
              Australia).  This international database is  currently underutilized.  A few
              individual country analyses  have been conducted, but no comparisons across
              countries  have been made.  The proposed analysis of characteristics of 
              institutions and national factors which influence women in  pursuing careers in
              science and engineering faculty is of  significant interest to NSF and science
              policymakers.
