Abstract    :
              With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Rotello of the  
              University of Massachusetts-Amherst will investigate non-covalent bonding  
              factors that influence the redox properties of flavoenzymes. For this  
              investigation the principal investigator has prepared artificial binding  
              sites which mimic the natural sites, but allow him to quantify the   individual
              factors that are believed to affect the redox properties. The   two major
              factors which are considered important are hydrogen bonding and   pi stacking.
              Preliminary evidence suggests that the project will be   successful. 
              Understanding the details of enzymatic processes will provide scientists   with
              the knowledge to modify paradigms and procedures for improved   therapeutic
              drug efficacy. This project from a young investigator, if   successful, will
              provide needed information on how flavoenzymes function.   Since these enzymes
              are essential physiological moieties, this research   has significant potential
              in the health related domain. These results may   be useful to a broader scope
              of redox systems that are germane to organic   materials and electronic
              devices.
