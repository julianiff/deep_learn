Abstract    :
              This research program investigates an advanced video compression approach for 
              applications such as multimedia, video on networks, video conferencing, and
              video  on demand.  It is a novel combination of object-based coding usually
              used for  very low rates and 3-D subband/wavelet waveform-based coding, usually
              reserved  for higher rates.    In this method, the motion field is first
              segmented into objects which make up  the image frame, and move at different
              velocities.  The boundaries of these  objects are coded using a type of contour
              coding which preserves the shape of the  edge.  This contour coding is
              performed as an update on the object boundaries  found for the previous frame. 
              Finally the interior of these space-time objects  is coded using the waveform
              coding method based on motion compensated 3-D subband  filtering.  The overall
              goal is an efficient unified set of video compression  algorithms scalable from
              video phone up to HDTV.
