Abstract    :
              With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Heasley at   Point
              Loma Nazarene College will investigate the mechanisms associated   with the
              halogenation of humic acids. In this study, various phenols will   be used as
              models for humic acids. Phenolic residues are known to be   building blocks of
              humic acids. This problem presents itself because it   is common practice to
              purify drinking water supplies by halogenation.   With regard to humic acids,
              which are present in nearly all water   supplies, halogenation yields toxic
              products rather than the desired   non-toxic products. This research is
              intended to elaborate the mechanisms   of this process so as to facilitate
              methodologies to counter the   undesirable reaction.  All to often procedures
              implemented to take care of one problem create   problems in another sector
              which compromise the entire methodology. In   this case, drinking water is
              purified with the oxidant,  halogen. While   this is effective for destroying
              many toxic contaminants, it converts   other substances such as humic acids to
              toxins. In this research, the   undesired reaction will be investigated with
              the goal of averting the   toxic product formation during the drinking water
              purification procedure.   This investigation has potential significant impact
              on an environmentally   sensitive health issue.
