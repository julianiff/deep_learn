Abstract    :
              9528605  Luh       International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC) is 
              composed of 46 National Member Organizations, each one  representing the
              technical societies concerned with automatic  control in its own country.  IFAC
              sponsors many conferences, but  the most important is the triennial World
              Congress.  The 12th  such IFAC World Congress was held July 19-23, l993 in
              Sydney,  Australia.  The 13th will be held in San Francisco, California,  June
              30-July 5, 1996.  The conference in San Francisco is  expected to have a very
              high level of attendance from all over  the world.  It will be a particularly
              good forum for the exchange  of ideas among U.S. and non-U.S. researchers.     
                 This proposal is for a Block Travel Grant from the National  Science
              Foundation to support graduate students from U.S.  universities to attend the
              13th IFAC World Congress.  This will  provide an excellent opportunities for
              them to interact with the  world leading researchers in automatic control,
              learn the latest  technical trend, and be well prepared for their future
              career.  ***
