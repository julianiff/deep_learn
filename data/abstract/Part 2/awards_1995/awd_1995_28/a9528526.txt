Abstract    :
              Proposal Number: IBN-9528526  Principal Investigator:  Day, Richard N.     
              Cells respond to environmental and developmental stimuli through  changes in
              intracellular signaling pathways that lead to an altered  pattern of gene
              expression.  Monitoring of these processes as they  occur in living cells is a
              major challenge for biological research.   Dr. Day and his colleagues propose
              to use a neuronal cell line  which synthesize and secrete
              gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)  as a model system to develop a combined
              approach to simultaneously  monitor gene expression, intracellular calcium and
              electrical  activity in single living cells with temporal resolution.  These 
              studies are appropriate for a Small Grant for Exploratory Research  because of
              the high risk associated with establishing the  technology to ascertain all of
              these cellular parameters from a  single cell and the significant impact of
              these studies to  biological research.  If these experiments are successful,
              new  understanding will be forthcoming about the mechanisms used by  cells to
              transmit signals from the cell surface to the nucleus.    An additional impact
              of this research will be, if successful, the  method used for these studies
              will be applicable to the study of  virtually any eukaryotic cell system
              providing unique temporal  linkage of membrane and nuclear events.  The
              tpansfer of this  technology to the organismal level will permit this
              investigator to  examine cells in their natural surrounding without
              compromising  their integrity, but permitting their unambiguous identification.
