Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   of
              the Chemistry Division, Cynthia Jameson will study the dynamics of   gases
              interacting with zeolites using 129Xe NMR spectroscopy, ab initio  
              calculations of chemical shifts, and computer simulations.  The project   will
              look at elementary processes at surfaces, such as adsorption and   diffusion,
              in order to gain a microscopic understanding of the sometimes   complicated
              surface chemistry.  The current effort will extend both   simulations and
              experiments to more complex systems.    %%%  Microporous solids, such as
              zeolites, are widely used for a large number   of applications, including
              heterogeneous catalysis, separations, oil   recovery, and other industrial
              processes.  Industrial processes which   involve adsorption from gas streams
              with multiple components depend on   the separation of these components through
              competitive adsorption on the   catalytic surfaces.  The results of this
              research project will aid in   understanding these sorts of applied systems.
