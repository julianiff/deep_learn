Abstract    :
              ***  9528167  Cheng       This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              project is designed to help solve a major problem for the oyster industry along
              the mid-Atlantic seaboard of the United States.  Since 1957, oysters in the
              Delaware and Chesapeake Bays have suffered mass moralities due to lethal
              diseases caused by two protistan parasites, Haplosporidium nelsoni (MSX) and
              Perkinsus marinus (Dermo).  Based on the results of Phase I research, it now
              appears fairly certain that a yet uncharacterized saccharide, designated as
              lathyrose, that occurs on the surfaces of a high  percentage of hemocytes of
              oysters, Crassostrea virginica, from certain areas along the Atlantic  coast of
              the U.S. and along the Gulf of Mexico coast may serve as a molecular marker for
               innate resistance to Haplosporidium nelsoni (MSX).  Lathyrose-positive
              hemocytes will  agglutinate when presented with the Lathyrose odoratus lectin. 
              Phase II research will survey for the presence of lathyrose in large samples of
              oysters ( > 400) from Maine to the Gulf coast. This survey is designed to
              accurately determine whether there is a high degree of correlation between the
              occurrence of lathyrose and absence of MSX.  If this phenomenon is successfully
              established, then trays of lathyrose-positive oysters will be transplanted to
              Inlet Creek, Sullivan's Island, Charleston County, South Carolina, where about
              28% of the native oysters harbor MSX.  This will be done to field test the
              resistance of lathyrose-positive oysters to MSX.  Phase II research will then
              make genetic crosses to develop strains of lathyrose-positive oysters resistant
              to MSX and develop (and eventually market) simple diagnostic kit to identify
              oysters resistant to MSX.  ***
