Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Edward L. Cussler  University of Minnesota  CTS-9528755      This
              project, a joint effort of the University of Minnesota and the Deluxe
              Corporation, aims at continuing development of lithographic inks with
              dramatically reduced environmental impact.  While these inks were invented and
              are being commercialized by Deluxe, their basic science and their extensions to
              other products are obscure.    This project will supply that basic science. 
              The key is understanding the thermodynamics and transport phenomena of the
              ink's resins.  These are organic polymers of moderate molecular weight with
              pendant carboxylic acid side chains.  The resins are lipophilic when acidic but
              emulsifying agentq when basic.  As a result, the are successful in printing but
              can be washed with water at high pH.  They suggest similar, pollution
              preventing strategies for machine oils, vanishes, and solvents for
              microelectronics.
