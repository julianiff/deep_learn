Abstract    :
              This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
              the University of Kentucky.  The topic is to describe how recently developed
              indigenous peasant social movements in highland Peru facilitate the economic
              survival of households in light of the severe constraints of rural poverty. 
              The student will conduct a case study of one rural township near the city of
              Cajamarca, involving the administration of a baseline questionnaire to a sample
              of 80 households, participant observation in local economic, social and
              political activities, in-depth analysis of the function of the communal
              institutions, and a set of intensive life histories.  The fundamental questions
              to be asked involve how these rural Indians have organized to defend their
              social and communal interests in two organizations, the rondas campesinas,
              (defence-self-help groups) and the clubs de madres (mothers' clubs), and the
              answers will come through analysis of household-level variations in economic
              activities, social organizations and various aspects of cultural capital.  This
              research is important because it will advance our understanding of a
              fundamental process occurring in the world today, the struggle for
              self-determination by poor, disadvantaged peasant communities through new
              organizations in local civil society.  Case studies such as this will give
              planners and development specialists information about how local communities
              self-organize under varying social and economic constraints; information which
              will be useful to developing new programs of aid to facilitate peaceful
              democratic institutions.
