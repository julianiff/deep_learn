Abstract    :
              9528815   Schlesinger   This research on mineral processing will assess the
              interaction of molten slags, mattes, and copper metal with potential
              replacement refractories for the "mag-chrome" materials currently used in
              nearly all primary and secondary copper production furnaces.  Spent mag-chrome
              refractories have been labeled as hazardous wastes and no metals industry is
              currently as dependent on them as the operators of copper smelter, converters,
              and fire-refining furnaces.  Two potential replacement systems have been
              identified:  "mag-doloma" refractories from the magnesia-calcia system, and
              "mag-spinel" or "alumina-spinel" compositions from the magnesia-alumina system.
               Process mineralogy techniques will be used to examine the actual mechanisms of
              attack of replacement refractories by the molten phases employed in the
              production of copper metal, both from primary ores and scrap.  By establishing
              a working relationship with an Extractive Metallurgy Research Center in
              Australia, optimal use of the US University's strengths in process mineralogy
              and refractories research, and the Australian expertise in melt chemistry and
              high-temperature thermodynamics can be realized.    Iron, copper, and aluminum
              are major primary metals manufactured all over the world.  Refractories
              containing chromium are used heavily in both iron and copper production. 
              However, chromium poses a disposal problem for used refractories.  This
              international research effort has the potential to eliminate one more hazardous
              "landfill" problem.
