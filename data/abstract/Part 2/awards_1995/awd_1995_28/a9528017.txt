Abstract    :
              9528017 Giblin    Collaborative: Carbon and Electron Acceptor Cycling in Lake
              and Estuarine Sediments     The decomposition of organic matter in sediments is
              an important process which returns nutrients to the overlying water and
              controls the amount of carbon buried in the worlds oceans and lakes. Bacteria
              living in sediments degrade organic matter using a variety of oxidants in
              addition to molecular oxygen.  These alternative oxidants include sulfate,
              nitrate, and the oxides of iron and manganese.  It is now clear that these
              alternative oxidants are intensively recycled near the sediment-water interface
              and that the amount of decomposition being directly carried out using oxygen is
              smaller than previously believed. This has important implications for our
              ability to model the carbon budgets of aquatic ecosystems and other sediment
              processes, such as the release of contaminants.  The PI's will 1) examine the
              factors controlling the use of alternative oxidants, 2) determine how the age
              and type of organic matter influences oxidant recycling, and 3) determine
              whether the presence of alternative oxidants increases total organic matter
              decomposition.
