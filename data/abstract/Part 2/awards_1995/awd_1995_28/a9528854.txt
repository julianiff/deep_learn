              "Ultrafast carrier transport, screening and space-charge field formation in
              semiconductors"    ABSTRACT    Comprehensive studies of carrier dynamics and
              space-charge formation in semiconductor structures will be performed. Future
              photonic and electronics systems, and interconnects between the two, will rely
              on and be limited by the ability to control carrier transport over micron and
              nanometer sized dimensions and by an understanding of the space-charge
              formation, screening and changes in optical properties that accompany such
              transport.  Five interrelated research tasks will form the main body of the
              research (1) measurement of time-resolved Stokes parameters for the four-wave
              mixing signal to study exciton-exciton interactions and carrier scattering in
              multiple quantum wells; (2) development of sensitive new techniques to measure
              coherent plasma oscillations which results from ballistic transport.  These
              measurements are expected to provide information about transport/scattering
              processes which cannot be obtained in any other way; (3) measurement of the per
              volt electro-optic and per carrier nonlinear optical responses of "stacked
              SEEDs" electro-optic modulator structures; (4) investigation of the transport,
              screening and electro-optic response of strained piezo-electric multiple
              quantum wells; and (5) use of ultrafast techniques to measure/quantify the
              dynamics of photogenerated carriers, space-charge field formation and the
              tunneling times in optically switched resonant tunneling diodes.
