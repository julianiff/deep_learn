Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9528897    Chemistry and chemical reactions involving
              microparticles levitated in an electrodynamic balance will be investigated. 
              The research has five components:  (a) Measurements of the thermophoretic
              forces on nonspherical particles over a wide range of Knudsen numbers ranging
              from continuum to free molecular domain; (b) Raman spectroscopic studies of
              sorption reactions by slurry droplets; (c) Chemical reactions of
              multicomponents droplets by decomvolution of Raman spectra; (d) Development of
              technique an device to study rapid chemical reactions and composition changes
              with pulsed lasers; (e) Measurements of chemical reactions associated with
              atmospheric aerosols, particularly in the stratospheric ozone destruction zone.
               An attempt will be made to study an assembly of droplets/particles suspended
              in the electrodynamics balance.    The fundamental investigations planned in
              this project have relevance to atmospheric aerosol studies associated with
              ozone depletion, and nanoparticles generation for advanced materials.  ***
