Abstract    :
              95-28945  Tayal, Swaraj    Dr. Tayal will carry out accurate and comprehensive
              calculations  of oscillator strengths, photoionization and electron collisional
               excitation cross sections of S, Fe, Ni and Cu atoms and ions.  These atomic
              data are required for a quantitative analysis of  stellar spectra, especially
              those observed in the ultraviolet.  These studies also will provide further
              physical insight into the  basic aspects of atomic structure and collisional
              processes.  ***
