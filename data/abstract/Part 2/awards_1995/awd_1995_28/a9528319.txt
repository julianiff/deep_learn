Abstract    :
              This project involves the dissertation research of an  anthropology student from
              the University of Michigan.  The study  tries to explain variations in
              fertility levels in a developing  country--Brazil-- through the impact of
              variations in television  exposure.  Previous studies have suggested that the
              medium has a  `contraceptive effect`, separate from other changes linked to 
              industrialization and urbanization, through the exposure of  viewers to new
              ideas, values, and behaviors.  The study will  examine the hypothesis that the
              degree of television exposure  affects lifetime fertility and will also focus
              on the link  between TV viewing and attitudes about contraception, the 
              perceived value of children, and notions of ideal family size.  The methods
              include qualitative ethnographic information through  participant-observation
              and intensive interviews, and  quantitative data from a survey of 250-300 women
              in Arembepe,  Bahia, as well as 50-80 women in a more rural community with less
               television availability.  The data will be linked to a study on  this subject
              in the region a decade ago.  This project is important because it will shed
              light on the role  that television may play in lowering fertility levels in 
              developing countries, and will elucidate the link between  demographic shifts
              and the exposure to new ideas and information.  Advances in our knowledge about
              the causes of family size are  important for planners concerned about world
              population growth.
