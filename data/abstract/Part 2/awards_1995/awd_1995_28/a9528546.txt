Abstract    :
              9528546  Key  This is a collaborative study of deep and bottom water formation
              in  the southern sector of the Indian Ocean, as   part of the World Ocean
              Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Indian Ocean  Expedition (IOE).  Six PIs from six
                institutions will complete the final segment of the WOCE  Hydrographic
              Program Line, S-4, along 60 degrees   South from about 20 degrees East to about
              120 degrees East.  The  program is designed to detect subtle   differences
              across the Kerguelen Plateau, an important hydrographic  boundary for bottom
              waters.  In addition   to hydrography, the section will include standard tracer
               measurements, as well as CFCs, Helium, Tritium, and   Carbon-14, all to WOCE
              standards.  In addition to the zonal line,  two excursions to the shelf at
              about 54   degrees East and 96 degrees East will be made to investigate the 
              Antarctic Slope Front and its associated   westward current.  Expendable
              current moorings will also be  deployed at several locations to measure, for
              one   year, the current along the slope and on the flanks of the  Kerguelen
              Plateau.
