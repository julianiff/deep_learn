Abstract    :
              9528555  Belfiore  The overall objective of this research investigation is to 
              identify and characterize new combinations of polymeric  ligands and
              transition-metal salts that exhibit attractive  macroscopic physical properties
              based on molecular  engineering design principles.  Previous research has 
              demonstrated that transition-metal salts produce dramatic  changes in the
              thermal and mechanical properties of selected  rubbery and glassy polymers. 
              This technology represents the  "next step" in the search for strongly
              interacting "blends"  and complexes.  Ultimately, one seeks to identify
              transition-  metal compatibilizers for immiscible polymer-polymer blends  in an
              effrort to produce materials with tailored properties.  Miscibility occurs when
              the metal center coordinates to  ligands in the two dissimilar polymers.  %%% 
              The methodology to transform immiscible polymer-polymer  blends into compatible
              ternary mixtures via small amounts of  a transition-metal salt is a very
              promising new research  area for industrial applications where synergistic 
              macroscopic physical properties are desired in the final  product.  ***
