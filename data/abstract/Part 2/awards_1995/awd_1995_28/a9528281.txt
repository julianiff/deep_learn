Abstract    :
              9528281  Lindeman    "Enabling Faculty Development in Indiana Extending the
              Advantages of the Internet"    Indiana University requests support from NSF for
              two connections to the Internet through the INDnet regional network.  One
              connection will serve Martin University in Indianapolis and the other
              connection will serve Ivy Tech College at Logansport.  INDnet is a regional
              network located in the state of Indiana that will provide operations and
              network information services.  It will provide Martin University and Ivy Tech
              College with a connection to the Internet, a collection of interoperable
              networks that connect most research and education organizations in the United
              States.  The institutions need the Internet connections to be able to access
              information resources throughout the state, the nation and the world.  The
              connections will benefit the students, faculty and staff of Martin University
              and Ivy Tech College.
