Abstract    :
              9528025  MILLER   The island of New Guinea has a complex geologic history.  It
              apparently has been formed over time by the northern edge of the Australian
              continental mass enlarging as it collided with elements of southward migrating
              island arcs.  This repeating process of slow tectonic crashing of land masses
              has formed upthrusts of mountain ranges on New Guinea.  Present day plants and
              animals endemic to these ranges and adjacent island arcs include amazing
              biodiversity, much of it undescribed, and provide information for biogeographic
              analyses that divulge the geologic history of the timing and pattern of these
              land mass movements.  This award provides continuing support for a project
              involving the aquatic Hemiptera (true bugs) (Insecta: Hemiptera) of New Guinea
              and adjacent island arcs as a key group for investigating the biogeographic
              consequences of such island arc migration and accretion.  Support from a prior
              NSF award has resulted in excellent productivity with 27 genera (11 new and in
              five families) having been analyzed completely and 2 others in part.  This
              award will support further analysis of 13 additional genera in eight families. 
              Distributional data for these taxa will be utilized in biogeographic analyses
              to enhance knowledge of the zoogeography of this fascinating region.      This
              project will contribute to our knowledge of the biodiversity of New Guinea. 
              Specifically, new insect taxa will be described and their relationships studied
              for understanding of the historical biogeography of New Guinea and related
              island arcs.  Aquatic insect studies are especially important because these
              organisms are important indicator taxa for monitoring water quality.
