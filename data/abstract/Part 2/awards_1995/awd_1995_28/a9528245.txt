Abstract    :
              The Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics (CATS) is  concerned with
              issues involving and affecting the statistical  sciences, statistics education,
              and uses of statistics.  The  Committee occupies a pivotal position in the
              statistical  community, providing expertise in methodology and policy 
              formulation.  Members of CATS are appointed by the Chairman of  the National
              Research Council.  This project is for core funding  for CATS.  CATS activities
              supported exclusively by core funding  are: one CATS meeting, CATS
              participation in the annual Board on  Mathematical Sciences Department Chairs
              Colloquium, the  initiation and administration of all CATS projects, and 
              continuous oversight of all CATS-related activities.  These  include giving
              recommendations on research directions to federal  agencies and reports on
              education in the statistical sciences,  interaction of the statistical sciences
              with other areas, the  health of the statistical sciences, and emerging
              research  directions.
