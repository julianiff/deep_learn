Abstract    :
              Delzell  DMS 95-28094    This awards supports the special year in real algebraic
              geometry to be hosted jointly by Louisiana State University and Southern
              University. Emphasis will be placed on the study of the algebra and logic of
              ordered structures.    This research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one
              of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to the point
              where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that have stood for
              centuries. Originally, it treated figures defined in the plane by the simplest
              of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from
              algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively
              used in those fields.  Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields as
              diverse as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding theory
              and robotics.
