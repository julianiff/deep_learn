Abstract    :
              9528392    Body size of animals is controlled by adjustments in cell size and
              cell number.  We know relatively little   about mechanisms that regulate cell
              size and cell division to yield an animal of a particular size.  This  
              research seeks to understand the relative importance of changes in cell size
              and cell number during   evolutionary changes in body size, and to identify the
              genes that control such changes.  It will focus on   Drosophila because they
              exhibit a wide range of sizes and because of the extensive data that exist on
              their   genetics and developmental biology.  Measurements of cell size and
              number during development of   imaginal discs will identify the developmental
              steps that lead to changes in body size.  A comparative   analysis will
              identify the pattern of evolution of body size differences, and a hybridization
              study will seek   to map the genes that control body size.  The results will
              increase our understanding of the factors that   control body size, and the
              mechanisms that lead to changes in cell size and body size of animals.
