Abstract    :
              95-28256  McCray    Dr. McCray will continue to develop theoretical tools for 
              analyzing the spectra of supernovae.  This analysis is  particularly valuable
              during the nebular phase, a few months  after the initial outburst, when the
              supernova debris has thinned  enough to observe all the newly-synthesized 
              elements created in the explosion.  The spectrum is decoded using  a
              theoretical model of spectrum formation.  This project will  concentrate on two
              specific projects.  The first is to complete  the development of comprehensive
              models to describe the evolution  of the spectrum of  SN1987A, especially the
              transfer and fluorescence of the  ultraviolet radiation.  The second is to
              develop theoretical  models for the nebular spectra of Type Ia supernovae. 
              There are  indications that this might be a reliable method for calibrating 
              the true luminosity of such sources, thus providing standard  candles with
              which distances to galaxies can be determined.  ***
