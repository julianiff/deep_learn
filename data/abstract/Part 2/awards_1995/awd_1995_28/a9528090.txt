Abstract    :
              In this project funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry program of the
              Chemistry Division, Brooks will study electron donor-electron acceptor systems
              in a crossed molecular-beam machine under conditions in which the energy and
              orientation of the acceptor species are controlled.  Energetic donor atoms will
              be crossed with molecules which have been oriented using electrostatic fields. 
              Ions produced by electron transfer will be mass analyzed using coincidence
              time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS), and threshold energies for formation
              of various ions will be measured.  Such data will provide information about
              electron affinities and bond dissociation energies, and will help explain how
              electrons are transferred between chemical species.  The transfer of an
              electron from one atom or molecule to another initiates a wide variety of
              chemical reactions, from those occurring in electrolytic cells to
              photosynthesis and combustion.  Although the rates of many of these reactions
              correlate well with other data using a theory developed by Nobel-prize winning
              chemist Rudolph Marcus, direct information about the electron transfer itself
              is missing.  This project will help illuminate the nature of the pathway an
              electron takes when undergoing these types of reactive transfers.
