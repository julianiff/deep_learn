Abstract    :
              9528463  Hartman   The goal of this research is to explore methodologies for
              creating an Internet-based virtual manufacturing enterprise that would link the
              U. S. and Russia.  The primary research effort focuses on investigating the
              means to develop a preliminary architecture, physical network, hardware,
              software and interface for the system, and to build a prototype.  Several pilot
              projects in virtual manufacturing will build on existing U. S.- Russian
              manufacturing research collaborations to implement a proof-of-concept
              demonstration of the technical capabilities of the network.       The work
              explores novel concepts in virtual manufacturing by linking two very different
              manufacturing systems in a proof-of-concept testbed.  If successful, the
              results could be used as a model for the development of a more general virtual
              enterprise network that could be used jointly by manufacturers widely separated
              by distance, language and culture.
