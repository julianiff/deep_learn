Abstract    :
              Gehrz, Robert  95-28336    Classical novae and luminous evolved (post main
              sequence) stars  are important sources of processed material that is recycled
              to  the interstellar medium (ISM) in circumstellar outflows during  stellar
              evolution.  Quantitative information about the dust and  gas ejected in these
              outflows is necessary to provide fundamental  constraints on models of Galactic
              chemical evolution.  Infrared  (IR) photometry and spectroscopy are
              particularly powerful tools  for  evaluating the abundances of both solid and
              gaseous phases of  circumstellar material.  IR  spectrophotometry, imaging and
              polarimetry can be used to deduce  the physical characteristics of the
              circumstellar outflows and of  the grains that form within them.  A three year
              extension is  planned to the University of Minnesota IR group's program to 
              study circumstellar dust and gas through IR observations of  the  temporal
              development of classical nova explosions and the  transient activity of
              luminous IR variable stars.  The studies  will characterize the nucleation  and
              growth of astrophysical dust grains in circumstellar  outflows, asses the
              contributions of  solid and gas-phase matter that novae and IR variable stars
              make  to the ISM, and provide information about the stages of stellar 
              evolution that preceded the mass loss process.  Successful  fulfillment of many
              of the program objectives requires prompt  observations of sudden, transient
              activity at many wavelengths.  The study will build upon previous observations
              and will  benefit from their capabilities to obtain timely, remote and 
              simultaneous multi-wavelength observations of transient events  with telescopes
              in Minnesota, Wyoming and Arizona.  ***
