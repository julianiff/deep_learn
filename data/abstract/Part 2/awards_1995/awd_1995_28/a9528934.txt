Abstract    :
              9528934  Wickland  The purpose of this interagency transfer is to provide
              funding, along with other federal agencies, to the Ecological Society of
              America in support of the Sustainable Biosphere Initiative Project Office. The
              funds will be used to help support a collaborative effort between federal
              agencies and the academic community to develop a hierarchical classification of
              the vegetation of North America. This classification will be derived through a
              series of workshops. The goal of this effort is to derive a classification that
              can be used by all federal agencies.
