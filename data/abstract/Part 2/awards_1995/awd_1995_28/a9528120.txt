Abstract    :
              9528120  Gilbert  Invasions of exotic ant species such as the red imported fire
              ant (Solenopsis invicta) occur frequently and often threaten the integrity of
              natural ecosystems in introduced ranges.  Yet, the underlying ecological
              mechanisms that allow some invasions to succeed and others not have not been
              studied quantitatively.  The research in this proposal is a collaborative
              effort between Brazilian and U.S. ecologists designed to test several
              hypotheses concerning the mechanisms of competitive dominance and invasion
              success of the red imported fire ant.  Replicate plots will be established at
              three sites within the native range of S. invicta in southern Brazil. 
              Experiments in these plots will assess the ability of S. invicta to dominate
              co-occurring ant species aggressively, both in the presence and absence of
              parasitic flies specialized on S. invicta.  This will be the first time that
              the interactions between the red imported fire ant and other ant species have
              been examined in the native range of S. invicta.  This study also will be the
              first time that the relative impact and synergistic interaction of competition
              and parasitism have been examined experimentally in ant communities  This study
              will have immediate applied value.  It will form the groundwork for future
              studies of the relative success of other invasive ant species in their native
              and introduced ranges.  Moreover, the results of this study will provide a
              foundation for the development of effective biological control of the red
              imported fire ant in the southeastern United States, an area where it is having
              a devastating effect on biodiversity.
