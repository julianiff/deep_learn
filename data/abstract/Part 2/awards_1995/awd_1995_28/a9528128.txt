Abstract    :
              9528128  Abelson    "Partial Support for the ACM Sixth Conference on Computers,
              Freedom, and Privacy"    This award helps underwrite speaker travel and
              publication of proceedings for this conference to be held Cambridge MA in
              March, 1996.  The conference is interdisciplinary, and addresses the potential
              effects on society and individual freedom and privacy resulting from the use of
              computers, data banks, computer networks, and communications systems.  NSF has
              provided partial support for the last four annual conferences.
