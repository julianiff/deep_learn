Abstract    :
              Alofs/Abstract           The objective of this research is the design of a cloud
               chamber/low velocity wind tunnel to simulate thermodynamic  conditions in
              cirrus clouds.  This will be accomplished, in part,  through numerical
              simulations of the air flow in sample  configurations of possible devices
              designed to eliminate or  suppress undesirable turbulence.
