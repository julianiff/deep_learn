Abstract    :
                9528002  Singh   The International Conference on Beam Processing of Advanced
              Materials will cover the latest research activities around the world with both
              invited and contributed presentations.  The conference will include speakers
              from under-developed countries.  Advanced materials processing by laser, ion
              beam, electron beam, microwave, radio frequency and plasma will be covered at
              this symposium, which is organized by the American Society of Metals.
