Abstract    :
              The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program is supporting Prof. Veronica   Vaida
              of the University of Colorado at Boulder to develop an ultraviolet  
              time-resolved fourier-transform spectrometer (TRFTS).  She will   investigate
              three systems:  a) photofragmentation of radicals of   atmospheric importance,
              such as the chlorine dioxide, chlorine nitrate   and nitrate radicals, b)
              vibrational quenching rates of various   oxygen-containing radicals with
              oxygen, nitrogen or argon, and c)   photoreactivity of complexes, in which
              TRFTS will be used to monitor   changes in the products, quantum yields, and
              photofragment internal   energies when ozone-, sulfur dioxide- or chlorine
              dioxide-water complexes   are photolysed.   The experimental technique as
              developed and exploited   in this endeavor will combine time resolved fourier
              transform   spectroscopy with ultraviolet absorption detection of
              photoproducts.     Light initiated chemical reactions are prevalent in the
              atmosphere.    These studies will address fundamental questions about
              reactivity of   radicals and their complexes, with the quantitative rigor
              necessary for   inclusion of such reactions in atmospheric models.
