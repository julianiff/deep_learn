Abstract    :
                   This award is in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research  mode.  The
              central idea of this research is to explore ways to  reduce the complexity and
              force and torque requirements of a  robotic mechanism by designing the
              environment to minimize the  physical forces that must be overcome in a
              manipulation task.   Thus, for example, for two dimensional manipulation,
              moving  friction can be greatly reduced by use of an air table on which the 
              manipulanda are placed.  Reducing the forces should yield great  gains in
              simplicity of required manipulation mechanisms, which can  be made much
              lighter, and which should have far less nonlinearity  in their action (due to
              motor loads, hysteresis, backlash, etc.).   This initial year of exploration
              will be confined to manipulation  in planar workspaces.  Ultimately, the basic
              idea should lead to  new mechanisms that can be used in low-force, low-torque,
              or low-  gravity applications.
