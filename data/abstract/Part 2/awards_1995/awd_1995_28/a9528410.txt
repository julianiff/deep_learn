Abstract    :
              This award supports movement of the Technology, Education, and Commercialization
              (TEC)  program, which the proposers have been developing for some time, from
              pilot projects to broader  implementation.  This program provides intense,
              entrepreneurial education that results in broad  product development skills and
              a market orientation to graduates seeking employment in industrial 
              organizations or interested in starting new businesses.  Six TEC teams,
              composed of a total of  approximately 45 graduate and post-graduate engineers
              and scientists, are being assembled on a  staggered schedule.  Each team is
              pursuing an intensive 12-month course of study that includes  technology
              evaluation, business plan development, and analysis of commercialization
              options.  In  addition, the proposers are developing and offering a new
              graduate course serving approximately 50  students dealing with high technology
              transfer; conducting fmur research  projects to study various  aspects of the
              program; conducting evaluation projects; and transferring components of the
              program  to  other educational sites.  The proposers  are seeking additional
              support from the private sector to  enable them to move a select few of the TEC
              teams  technology projects forward for transfer, spin-off,  licensing, or
              whatever is most appropriate.  While some technology transfer is likely to
              occur, this  outcome is clearly of second order importance.
