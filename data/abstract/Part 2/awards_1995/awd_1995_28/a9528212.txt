Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support Dr. Lupo will travel to Mikumi National
              Park in Tanzania to assess the feasibility of a long term research project. She
              will also meet with relevant government officials in Dar Es Salaam to discuss
              the procedure to receive a research permit and will establish contacts with
              scientists at the University of Dar es Salaam. Dr. Lupo is an archaeologist who
              is interested in the subsistence strategies of prehistoric peoples and wishes
              to determine the extent to which such groups, at different points in time,
              followed patterns predicted by optimum foraging theory. She has focused on
              utilization of fauna since bones of prey animals are often preserved in
              archaeological sites. Early in her work she learned that one must determine the
              nutritional value of different body parts from different species of animals and
              she has collected such data for small and medium sized species in Kenya. It has
              not been possible however to collect information for larger counterparts and
              the Mikumi reserve offers an opportunity to do so.  This research is important
              for several reasons. It will offer new insight into interactions between human
              groups and their environment and how this relationship developed over time. It
              will provide data of interest to many archaeologists and will assist in
              advancing the career of a promising young scientist.
