Abstract    :
              9528939  Picardal    This is an award to support preliminary work on biological 
              processes for degradation of polychlorinated biphenyls.  The  investigator
              plans on developing appropriate analytical  procedures, isolating cultures of
              organisms capable of  biologically degrading these compounds and finally to
              conduct  studies on the anaerobic dehalogenation capacity of sludges  derived
              from treatment of domestic wastewater, sediments and  soils.    The proposal
              leading to this award was submitted in response to  NSF 94-147, Research
              Planning Grants and Career Advancement  Awards for Minority Scientists and
              Engineers.  Results are  expected to provide information that can be used in
              determining  the feasibility of the process to be studied and the basis for a 
              more comprehensive research project that would determine  conditions and
              engineering design parameters for a biologically  based process to remove
              polychlorinated biphenyls from  contaminated soils and sediments and from
              sludges derived from  treatment of municipal and industrial wastewater.
