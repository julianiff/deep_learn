Abstract    :
              STONE, James  95-28299    Dr. Stone will conduct a theoretical study of
              magnetohydrodynamic  instabilities in accretion disks and the nature of
              magnetosphere-  disk interactions using 2- and 3-dimensional model codes 
              developed by Stone and his collaborators.  Angular momentum  transport and the
              evolution of magnetic instabilities in  protostars, cataclysmic variable stars
              and X-ray sources are the  focuses of the numerical models to be produced.  ***
