Abstract    :
              9528855  Smith    This project will analyze side-scan sonar (TOBI) DATA from
              eight  segments of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between the Atlantic and Kane 
              fracture Zones in order to document the small-scale (10-100m)  morphology of
              volcanic features. Maps will be compared with those  of fault distribution to
              identify changes in pattern of volcanic  construction and the relationship of
              volcanism and faulting.
