Abstract    :
                             This action funds a facilitation award for an NSF  Minority
              Postdoctoral Fellow who has a           physical disability thus requiring the
              assistance  of a technician. The research and training           plan supported
              under the fellowship will use the  nematode C. elegans to identify          
              mutations that suppress the induction of late onset  neurodegeneration by cell
              death. This           work requires rearing the organism and manipulating  it
              in ways that are beyond Mr.           Royal's ability. The technician will
              perform the  laboratory work for the experiments           designed and
              interpreted by Mr. Royal, working in  concert with the sponsoring scientist.
