              Carolina State University  UNIDATA:  Equipment for UNIDATA-Supported Teaching
              and Research in  Meteorology.    Funds will provide the necessary hardware that
              shall permit North  Carolina State University (NCSU) continued participation in
              the  Internet Data Distribution (IDD) system.  This allows access to new  data
              including model simulations, GOES-8, and local sensor input.   The upgraded
              equipment allows access to meteorological information  for ongoing research and
              educational programs.
