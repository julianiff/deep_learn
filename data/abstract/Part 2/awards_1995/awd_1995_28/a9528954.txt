Abstract    :
              9528954  Meltzer      This grant provides partial support for the costs  of
              acquiring hardware and software to upgrade the  Lehigh seismology laboratory. 
              Specifically, a new  IBM 3CT RS/6000 workstation with mass storage  system,
              Power MAC 9500, color plotter, OMEGA 3-D  imaging software for  analysis of
              seismic data,  and other peripherals will be purchased for use in  the PI's
              research using high resolution seismic  reflection and refraction data for
              interpreting  upper crustal structure.  Powerful new  workstations with an
              abundance of memory and data  storage capabilities are required to begin to 
              analyze seismic data three dimensionally.  3-D  seismic data processing will be
              immediately useful  to the PI's current research which includes  analyses of
              the crustal structure around the  Mendocino Triple Junction where a transition 
              occurs from subduction to transform tectonics and  studies of crustal faulting
              during active  orogenesis in the northwest Himalayas.  It will  also provide
              new insight into the structure of the  uppermost crust for studies of
              environmental and  societal significance such as fluid migration  along shallow
              faults and high resolution  stratigraphy.  ***
