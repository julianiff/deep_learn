Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the  
              Chemistry Division, Kinsey will study the dynamics of molecular  
              photodissociation both experimentally and theoretically.  In the   experimental
              studies Dissociative Resonance Raman Spectroscopy (DRRS)   will be used to
              probe transient processes involved in the photochemical   decomposition of
              small molecules by detecting the weak emissions from   vibrationally excited
              states.  Light from many vibrational levels will be   accumulated using a newly
              constructed instrument in order to obtain a   complete description of the
              dissociation.  Mathematical functions called   wavelets will be employed to
              model photodissociation processes   efficiently.  Theoretical studies will aid
              in interpreting the   experimental Raman data, which will be inverted
              mathematically to   determine the potential energy surface directly. 
              Photochemical decompositions are among the most fundamental and important   of
              chemical processes.  For example, a detailed elucidation of how   sunlight
              leads to ozone decomposition is essential if we hope to alter   the
              environmental consequences of ozone layer depletion.  The early   stages of
              such photochemical reactions are very difficult to study in the   laboratory
              since they are over in less time than light takes to travel   0.001 inches. 
              Prof. Kinsey's studies of photochemical decomposition will   provide powerful
              new tools for gaining insight into reactions which occur   on such a fast
              timescale.
