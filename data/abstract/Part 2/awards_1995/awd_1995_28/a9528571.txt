Abstract    :
              An understanding of spatial patterns of density requires information on factors
              that influence habitat selection.  This project involves a large experiment
              designed to test several hypotheses regarding the effects of food availability,
              risk of predation, interspecific competition, and density on movement and
              performance of two species of voles in relation to habitat type.  Clusters of
              large experimental pens will be established that differ in plant cover and food
              availability.  Predators will be able to enter and leave the pens at will. 
              Data collected will document movements between pens and the body growth,
              survival, and reproduction of voles that reside in each pen.      Voles play an
              important role in grassland and tundra ecosystems.  They provide a major food
              source for a wide variety of predatory mammals, birds, and snakes.  At high
              densities voles can have a substantial impact on the structure and composition
              of vegetation.  The results of this experiment will not only provide insight
              into the link between habitat selection and spatial patterns of density of
              animals in general, but also produce valuable information for application to
              issues of conservation and management of grassland ecosystems.
