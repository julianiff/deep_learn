              Intelligent Controll of an Autonomous Flying Vehicle    Intelligent Control of
              an Autonomous Flying Vehicle  This award  funds a one-year research planning
              grant.  The goal of this  research project is to explore research problems in
              intelligent  contrml and robotics.  For this purpose, a completely autonomous 
              flying robot will ultimately be built which can carry out simple  tasks within
              its environment.  The issues under investigation  include developing a
              theoretical framework for the interface  between the two levels of controllers,
              incorporating a learning  algorithm within the task planner to improve its
              performance as  it becomes more experienced in its environment, and integrating
               the sensor data with the different controllers to achieve  automatic obstacle
              avoidance while insuring that the goal is  reached.  The extra degrees of
              freedom of a flying robot both  increase its maneuverability and make it more
              difficult to  control.  In contrast to a terrestrial-based robot, a helicopter 
              must always be under automatic control.  It can never stop in  place, evaluate
              its current surroundings, compute a new path, and  then continue its mission. 
              It is not statically stable, and the  dynamic stabilization problem is known to
              be hard.  If these  difficulties can be overcome through intelligent control,
              the  result will be a highly-flexible, extremely maneuverable  autonomous
              system.
