Abstract    :
                    EEC-9528068  Noble    This award provides funding for a "TIE" project
              involving two NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers (I/UCRCs) -
              the Center for Separations Using Thin Films at the University of Colorado,
              Boulder and the Measurement and Control Engineering Center at the University of
              Tennessee.  Zeolite membranes will be prepared and used to improve the ability
              to analyze multicomponent process streams by process mass spectrometry. 
              Membranes will be used to induce component separation based on selective size,
              shape, or sorptive differences and/or distinctive time dependence based on
              relative permeation rates as an aid to mass spectral deconvolution.  Membrane
              properties for optimum mass spectrometric response will be assessed.  Membranes
              tailored to this response for a given application will be prepared at the
              Boulder Center and tested in Knoxville.  Applications guidance for evolution of
              the combined technologies will be drawn from problems posed by industrial
              members of the Centers.  Testing of derived methodologies in member
              installations will be included as a regular part of effectiveness testing.
