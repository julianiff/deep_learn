Abstract    :
              9528436  Sastry  This is a proposal to hold a workshop in Washington, DC for two
               and a half days from Monday, November 13th to Wednesday, November  15th, 1995
              on "Architectures for Control and Learning in Natural  and Artificial Systems:
              from Molecules to Ecosystems".  The main  goal of this workshop, with
              approximately 50 participants is to  organize how the Biosystems Analysis and
              Control (BAC) Initiative  might be expanded from its current form in a way so
              as to address  the challenges and uses of new technological and conceptual
              tools  for biological systems over a range of scales:  from molecules to 
              eco-systems.  The format of the workshop is to have some invited 
              presentations, with smaller break out groups to generate ideas  and reports on
              the first two days.  On day three, we will discuss  the reports to arrive at a
              consensus of how biology and  engineering can cross-fertilize each other in the
              area of  "Architectures for Control and Learning".  We hope to be able to 
              collate the material into a report by March 1996.  Sastry and  Full will act as
              co-chairpersons of this workshop.  They will  also act as the organizing
              committee in concert with the program  appropriate program directors of
              programs in the Biology and  Engineering Directorates of NSF.   ***
