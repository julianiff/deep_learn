Abstract    :
              This award, in the Organic Dynamics Program of the Chemistry Division,   will
              allow Prof. Piotr Kaszynski of Vanderbilt University to synthesize   and
              investigate liquid crystals which have the unusual feature of also   being
              stable free radicals.  This leads to the ability to `tune`   electrical and
              magnetic properties either by controlling the nature of   the liquid crystal by
              structural variation or by controlling the nature   of the free radical.  The
              structures to be studied are based on the   thioaminyl radical fragment. 
              Computational methods for prediction of   properties are used in the selection
              of specific preparative targets and   in refinement of such choices. Both the
              ultimate target  materials and   the model non-liquid crystal free radicals,
              prepared in the course of   developing synthetic methodology,  will be studied
              electrochemically, by   epr, and by X-ray spectroscopy when appropriate. It is
              intended that new   materials with unusual electrical and magnetic properties
              will result.  This work involves the preparation of new materials in which two 
               attractive structural features are combined. Liquid crystalline molecules  
              respond to small electrical signals and to temperature variation and are   used
              as displays, thermosensors, and otherwise. Stable free radicals   possess
              unusual electrical and magnetic properties intrinsically.  This   work combines
              them to produce, characterize, and study a unique class of   substances, and
              perhaps ultimately to develop novel devices containing   them.
