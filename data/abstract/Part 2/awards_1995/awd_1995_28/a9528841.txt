Abstract    :
              9528841  Nelson    Since the late 1800s, the primary election has endured as the
              predominant method of nominating candidates for federal office in the United
              States.  Each state has the constitutional authority to decide its own election
              rules, resulting in primary election dates that span a seven month period.  Not
              all candidates have the same time to campaign for the general election.    This
              investigation explores the connection between the primary election and the
              results of the general election in races for U.S. House of Representatives from
              1988-1994.  The central questions are:  do candidates who are confronted with a
              divisive primary late in the election season face a tougher battle than their
              counterparts who face divisive primaries early in the election season?  Does
              the late primary disadvantage challengers even more than they are already
              impaired or does it help them by increasing their name recognition when votes
              are paying more attention?  Do late primaries hinder a challenger's ability to
              raise money and could they alter a candidate's campaign strategy?    Employing
              a variety of research methods such as multiple regression analyses and
              semi-structured interviews, this dissertation refocuses the study of
              congressional elections by expanding  the scope of study to include a
              comprehensive, institutional analysis of primary elections.  ***
