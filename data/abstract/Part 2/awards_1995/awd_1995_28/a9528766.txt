Abstract    :
              SBR-9528766  Richard Florida  Carnegie Mellon University    This award, through
              NSF's Environmentally Conscious Manufacturing initiative, will support research
              into the relationships among three innovations in manufacturing systems: 
              continuous quality improvements, lean or low-inventory production, and
              reduction or elimination of waste/ by-products. The research is guided by the
              research literatures on quality, lean production, and "green" production.  In
              addition, the research investigates the influence of local characteristics on
              innovation adoption or non-adoption, working from the thesis that localized
              networks of information, labor, and regulation (public and private) provide an
              important source of industrial innovation.  Based on the results of a
              recently-completed survey of manufacturers, the project will support the
              development of intensive case studies of a set of facilities and their
              management, competitive structure, and localized regulation.  The results of
              the research should have relevance to the fields of geography, regional
              development, and industrial innovation.
