Abstract    :
              9528028   Deshler     In this project, vertical profiles of aerosols will be
              measured using a balloon-borne instrument at altitudes up to 30 km. These
              measurements will be part of a balloon campaign supported primarily by the
              European Union. Over two years, simultaneous vertical profiles of several trace
              gases, ozone, water vapor, several reactive radicals containing nitrogen and
              halogen, and aerosols will be measured at tropical, Northern mid-latitude, and
              Northern high latitude flights.    These measurements will be used collectively
              to investigate the importance of transport and photochemistry in controlling
              the radical distribution. Specific dynamic information will be sought
              concerning the time constants of transport across the tropopause at the
              equator, from the tropopause up to 30 km, across the sub-tropical jet, and
              across the edge of the polar vortex. Information will be obtained concerning
              the dehydration mechanisms at the pole and at the equator, the size
              distribution of volcanic aerosol and polar stratospheric clouds, and the
              average ozone reduction and denitrification in the Arctic vortex in winter.
