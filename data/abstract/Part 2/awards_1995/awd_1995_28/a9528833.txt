Abstract    :
              This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry  
              program addresses the synthesis and reactivity of organometallic   compounds of
              alkaline-earth elements (calcium, strontium, and barium)   with metal-carbon
              bonds. Bulky cyclopentadienyl groups are used to   prevent decomposition of
              these highly reactive compounds, which allows   for the study of their
              structures and reactivities with gaseous oxides   and sulfides, including
              carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and carbon   disulfide.  These studies, in a
              relatively neglected area, will provide a   fundamental understanding of the
              basis for the structures and   reactivities of these compounds as well as a
              foundation for the   development of applications in organic, polymer, and
              materials chemistry.  Compounds of alkaline-earth elements (calcium, strontium,
              and barium)   with metal-carbon bonds will be synthesized.  The organic
              substituents   are designed to prevent the decomposition of these otherwise
              highly   reactive species, thus providing the opportunity to study their  
              reactivity toward oxygen and oxygen-containing molecules such as carbon  
              monoxide, carbon dioxide, and carbon disulfide.  These compounds have  
              potential for use in organic, polymer, and materials chemistry
