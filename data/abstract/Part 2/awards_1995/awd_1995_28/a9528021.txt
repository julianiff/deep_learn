Abstract    :
              9528021  Dalton  Newly developed techniques of femtosecond and picosecond 
              nonlinear optical spectrosocopy (including phase-mismatch  spectroscopy) are
              used to define the contributions made to  the optical nonlinearity of
              pi-electron materials by  electronic and nuclear dynamical processes activated
              by  photoexcitation.  This information is used to optimize the  performance
              (and define the operational limitations) of  devices fabricated from these
              newly synthesized pi-electron  chromophores.  Buried channel nonlinear optical
              waveguides  are fabricated in these polymers by a variety of of  techniques
              including photochemical processing and reactive  ion etching.  A novel
              multi-color photolithography technique  is proposed to solve problems of
              coupling narrow dimension  electro-optic modulator waveguides to larger
              dimension fiber  optic cables.  %%%  By systematically optimizing chromophore 
              hyperpolarizability, chromophore number density in the  polymer lattice,
              chromophore ordering, and the glass  transition temperature of the final
              polymer lattice, it is  anticipated by polymeric materials exhibiting
              electro-optic  coefficients in excess of 50 pm/V and characterized by long 
              term thermal stabilities at temperatures in excess of 125  degrees celsius can
              be prepared and processed into  appropriate integrated polymer/semiconductor 
              photonic/electronic devices.  Such materials would represent  a significant
              advance over currently available materials for  low frequency modulation
              applications.  ***
