Abstract    :
              This is the first year funding of a two-year continuing award.  The objective is
              to provide textual corpora to use in developing and evaluating automatic
              methods to identify intended senses of polysemous English words, and to make
              these resources generally available.  1000 English words (nouns, verbs,
              adjectives, adverbs) that have multiple meanings and occur frequently in
              printed materials have been selected.  Corpora of written English will be
              searched for occurrences of these words, which will then be classified by hand
              according to the word's meaning in each context.  The result will be a set of
              files for each word, one file for each attested meaning; the sizes of these
              files will indicate the relative frequency of occurrence of different senses of
              these words.  Such files can be used to develop automatic methods of word-sense
              identification, and will make it possible to standardize the evaluation of
              automatic word-sense identification systems and to evaluate progress in this
              branch of natural language processing.  Better methods of automatic word-sense
              identification will facilitate language processing in various applications:
              information retrieval, machine translation, computer-assisted instruction, and
              elsewhere.
