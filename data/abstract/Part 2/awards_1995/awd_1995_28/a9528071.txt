Abstract    :
              9528071  Halpin -Healy  This project involves scaling properties in random media
               involving interplay between thermal fluctuations and  disorder induced
              roughening.  The specific problems are  directed polymers in random media
              (DPRM) and impurity-pinned  domain walls in magnets.  The global optimization
              problem in  DPRM is similar in exhibiting an ultrametric tree structure  to the
              problems in river basin deltas, capillary blood  vessel networks and neuronal
              arrays in the brain. A Cole-  Hopf transformation of the DPRM relates it to
              dynamic  scaling problem in noisy Burgers equation, the latter  relevant to the
              statistical mechanical properties of a far-  from-equilibrium driven lattice
              gas.  %%%  This project is to study the common properties of a variety  of
              problems by (a) focusing on the problem of directed  polymers in a random media
              and (b) demonstrating the  mathematical equivalence between this problem and
              others  such as river basin deltas, capillary blood vessel networks  and
              neuronal arrays in the brain.  ***
