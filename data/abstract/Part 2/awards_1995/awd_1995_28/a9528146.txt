Abstract    :
              The investigators will advance the state of ionospheric tomography by:  (1)
              refining the "weighted, damped, least-squares" (WDLS) technique for
              tomographically inverting total electron content (TEC) records, (2) formalizing
              partition of over- and under-determined image parameters estimated by the WDLS
              technique, (3) constraining plasma density estimated in image cells to
              nonnegative values, and (4) generalizing the WDLS technique to permit
              systematic augmentation of TEC data with plasma-density measurements from any
              external source.
