Abstract    :
              The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Prof. J. D. McDonald   of
              the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana in his investigations   on
              reaction dynamics.  Specifically, Prof. McDonald will use a pump-probe  
              technique to study the dynamics of bimolecular chemical reactions on a  
              picosecond timescale.  Reactants are van der Waals adducts formed in a   cooled
              molecular beam, and intermediates and/or products will be detected   using
              either time-of-flight mass spectrometry or laser-induced   fluorescence.  In
              addition, reaction processes will be modeled by   classical trajectory
              calculations or statistical theories.  Typical   reactions to be investigated
              include rearrangements or decomposition of   adducts formed by addition of
              chlorine or oxygen atoms to unsaturated   hydrocarbon molecules.    The results
              of this work are of great value to the understanding and   modeling of
              reactions which are important in combustion processes and in   the chemistry of
              the atmosphere.  Oxygen atom reactions are very   important in both these
              complex systems, and chlorine atoms are important   in the upper atmosphere.
