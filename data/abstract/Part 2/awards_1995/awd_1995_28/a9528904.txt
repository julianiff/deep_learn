Abstract    :
              According to conventional wisdom in comparative politics, proportional
              representation systems are more fair than majoritarian systems due to the more
              direct relationship between votes and seats in the legislature.  But clearly
              not all groups of voters get the outcomes they seek.   Prior work has not
              determined how proportion representation  affects which groups of voters get
              the outcomes they want.  If small parties are able to influence the policy
              agenda to an extent disproportionate to their parliamentary representation, the
              assumption of fairness of proportional representation must be questioned.  This
              research examines how small political parties effectively influence policy
              decision making and policy outcomes in parliamentary systems of government. 
              This work highlights the importance of electoral institutions for policy
              outcomes.    Israeli religious parties are examined as a case study of the
              importance of small parties in proportional representation systems.  Archival
              materials (party manifestos, media coverage, legislative records) will be used
              to map a chronology of party strategies and activities.  Qualitative
              assessments of these strategies and tactics will be conducted through
              interviews and surveys of party elites.  * * *
