Abstract    :
              Abstract  9528559  Morse  This project, which is a renewal of an ongoing effort,
              makes use of the ice sheet at South Pole to build a large detector of very high
              energy astrophysical neutrinos.  The detector is being constructed between
              1,400 and 2,100 meters below the surface by melting holes into the ice with a
              hot water drill and then freezing in long stings of widely space
              photomultiplier tubes.  On the rare occasions when very penetrating upward
              going neutrinos, which have passed through the bulk of the Earth, interact in
              the ice, producing charged particles, the Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector
              Array (AMANDA), detects the resulting flash of light, from which the energy and
              direction of flight of the original neutrino can be deduced.  The present
              detector has eight string in place, and this award will provide the manpower
              necessary to expand AMANDA to 20 strings and to analyze the resulting data.    
               AMANDA is a collaboration of the University of Wisconsin (this award), the
              Universities of California at Berkeley and Irvine, the Universities of
              Stockholm and Uppsula (Sweden), and DESY (Germany).  The institutions other
              than Wisconsin are funded through different channels.  The hardware for the new
              equipment has already been provided for by a FY95 NSF Academic Research
              Infrastructure award and by the foreign funding agencies.  ***
