Abstract    :
              This starter grant award to Ohio State University will support the   research of
              Professor Christopher M. Hadad.  The theme of the research is   gas phase
              studies of reactive intermediates by a combined approach of   experiment with
              theory.  The fundamental reactions of radicals in the gas   phase will be
              studied using a variable temperate flowing   afterglow-neutral flow reactor. 
              The hybrid system allows the generation   of radicals via flash vacuum
              pyrolytic methods followed by examination of   the chemistry with neutral
              reagents.  The experimental information is   supplemented by computational
              studies -- ab initio molecular orbital   calculations to provide insight into
              transition state structures and   possible mechanistic alternatives.  This
              research will advance the fundamental understanding of radical   reactions
              relevant to combustion and atmospheric chemistry.  Such   knowledge is
              important to the efficient use of fuel resources and for   maintaining the
              environment.
