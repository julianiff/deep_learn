Abstract    :
              9528602  Holt   As the tide of environmental change rises inexorably around us,
              it is becoming increasingly urgent to understand the capacity of species to
              respond.  An inspection of the fossil record suggests that species vary widely
              in their abilities to adapt to changed circumstances.  Some species seem to
              adapt very readily to change, whereas others are quite conservative in their
              basic "ecological niches" (i.e., the environmental conditions in which
              populations of a species can persist without repeated immigration or
              introductions of new individuals from external sources).  The aim of this
              research project is to develop a conceptual framework for interpreting both
              conservatism and rapid change in species' niches, combining a contemporary
              understanding of genetic change in populations with an understanding of the
              determinants of change in population size.   The basic approach taken is to use
              mathematical and computer analyses which combine ecology (controls on
              population size) and genetics (controls on the genetic makeup of populations)
              to examine how species respond both genetically and numerically to different
              kinds of variation in their environments.  For example, climate change can lead
              to either an altered environment  across the entire range of a species, or
              possibly just part of its range, in a short period of time.  We thus consider a
              range of scenarios that incorporate both environmental change in time and
              variations across geographic locations.  Findings from this research will
              address significant fundamental problems in biology--why some species adapt
              readily and others more slowly (or not at all) in the face of environmental
              change.  The research has implications for important applied problems, such as
              the design of conservation plans and understanding genetic responses of pest
              organisms to control programs.
