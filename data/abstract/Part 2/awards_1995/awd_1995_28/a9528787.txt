Abstract    :
              9528787  Macdougall           This grant provides $301,000 as partial support of
               the costs of acquiring a new thermal ionization  mass spectrometer (TIMS) with
              high abundance  sensitivity, multiple collectors and negative ion 
              capabilities.  Scripps Institute of Oceanography  will provide 40% of the total
              equipment  acquisition costs.   This instrument will allow  these investigators
              to continue there present work  is applied isotope geochemistry as well as
              expand  into systems which require the mass resolution and  negative ion
              capabilities for which their current  single collector TIMS is not suitable. 
              These  increased capabilities include, Re/Os isotope  systematics of marine
              sediments which have  implications for paleotectonics, climate,  weathering and
              oceanic hydrothermal activity, and  U/Th series isotopes in igneous rocks,
              which can  be used to gain insight into the time scales and  processes of magma
              genesis and transport as well  as the chemical composition of source materials 
              for mid-ocean ridge basalts, island arc andesites  and rocks from other
              tectonic settings.  ***
