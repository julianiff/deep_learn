Abstract    :
              Braun, Douglas  95-28249    Dr. Braun's project is a combination of both
              observation and  theory to determine and interpret the characteristics of
              acoustic  scattering and absorption by solar active regions.  The  measurements
              include a database consisting of recent high quality  solar observations
              carried out at the geographic South Pole in  1990 and 1994 and on Kitt Peak. 
              To be determined are the  complete acoustic scattering properties for a wide
              variety of  active regions with different surface  morphology and at different
              stages of their evolution.  The  theoretical effort will be to model acoustic
              scattering by  sunspot flux tubes, improving on the PI's present model with a 
              more realistic treatment of the effects of the magnetic fields in  the sunspot
              scatterer.  Finally, using both theoretical modeling  and observations, the
              scattering signatures produced by  completely submerged inhomogeneities will be
              explored.  ***
