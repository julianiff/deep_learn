Abstract    :
              9520375  Schmitt  A compilation of the ocean water cycle will be assembled from
              the  modern evaporation, precipitation and river discharge data sets,  making
              use of new insights into how the ocean transports  freshwater.  The composite
              global description of the ocean water  budget will be compared with the output
              of operational forecast  models, new satellite precipitation products, and
              oceanic  freshwater flux divergence estimates to help refine the climatology 
              and identify areas where new measurements are particularly needed.   This study
              will also explore the dynamical and thermodynamical  consequences of surface
              freshwater fluxes on circulation and mixing  in the ocean.
