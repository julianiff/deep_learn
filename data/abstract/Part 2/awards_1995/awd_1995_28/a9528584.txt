Abstract    :
              9528584  Blumenthal  This project will convene an interdisciplinary workshop to 
              explore key determinants of the impacts of computing and  communications,
              identify the routes by which these new  technologies influence our work and
              lives, and determine  critical next research steps for building
              interdisciplinary  understanding of the social and economic impacts of 
              computing and communications.  To expedite and focus  discussions at the
              workshop, at least two background papers  will be prepared that would (1) array
              relevant technology  trends and pose issues and (2) summarize what existing 
              evidence does or does not say about the routes, nature, and  distribution of
              impacts.  There will also be a workshop  report.  ***
