Abstract    :
              This Accomplishment-Based Renewal will support continued study of  mantle
              heterogeneities and the interaction of mantle plumes with  mid-ocean ridges and
              continental lithosphere.  A newly-purchased  Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass
              Spectrometer will be used to  provide complete trace-element characterization,
              including Pb, Nd  and Sr isotope series, on a large suite of existing samples. 
              Six  key questions will be addressed on:  the nature of the Mid-ocean  ridge
              basalt source depleted in incompatible elements, the cause of  young isochrons
              in plume-influenced Mid-ocean ridge basalt, cause  of geochemical anomalies in
              the South Atlantic, and the source of  the Iceland plume.
