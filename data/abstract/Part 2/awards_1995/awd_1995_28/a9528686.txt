Abstract    :
              9528686  Shehar   Carbonaceous materials, because of their resistance to molten
              salt and high temperature conductivity, are used as electrode and cell lining
              materials in commercial molten salt electrolysis cells.  An important
              industrial application is in Hall-Heroult cells used to produce aluminum. 
              These materials can cause pollution and health problems because of the
              evolution of sulfur dioxide and other materials when the carbon sources and
              binders are baked during fabrication or in use as electrodes or cell liners for
              bauxite conversion, where they can evolve fluorine or cyanide.  This research
              will investigate micropyretic synthesis as a way to avoid much of the pollution
              during electrode fabrication.   The process involves the use of an exothermic
              chemical reaction to simultaneously synthesize and sinter the desired part. 
              Because of their superior microstructure, these materials can reduce the
              oxidation rate for electrodes and cell walls during operation in a cell.   The
              work will investigate the fundamental nature of the micropyretic microstructure
              of the carbonaceous materials, new micropyretic sources and ways to increase
              the flexural strength, and to quantify the environmental impact of micropyretic
              electrodes and linings in Hall-Heroult cells.     The impact of the research
              will be avoidance of sulfur dioxide emissions during electrode fabrication, a
              key part of the aluminum conversion cell, and reduced rates of emissions during
              the operation of these cells.  ***
