Abstract    :
              9528155  Freeman   This proposal examines the ability of wind-pollinated plants
              to respond to pollen deprivation in an evolutionary adaptive manner, and to
              determine if maternal parents, subject to delayed pollination, influence their
              progeny's sex ratio and male reproductive potential.  There is a increasing
              evidence that wind-pollinated plants can determine if they have been pollinated
               and respond to delays in pollination in a manner that increases the likelihood
              of their being pollinated by increasing either the number or length of their
              stigmas (i.e., increasing the total pollen capture surface area).  The delay in
              pollination is also reported to influence progeny sex ratio, and enhance the
              production of stamens by the male progeny in cultivated spinach.    We propose
              to examine the impact of delayed pollination and inadequate pollination on
              characteristics of both the maternal parent (the number of pistillate flowers,
              and stigma length)  and their progeny (sex ratio, and fitness) using Atriplex
              powellii (an annual) and A. garrettii (a short lived perennial).  Both species
              are wind pollinated, and grow in the cold deserts of  North America.  From a
              theoretical perspective the studies will add to our understanding of  factors
              that influence sex ratios, and the ability of plants to respond to dynamic
              aspects of their environment.  From a practical perspective the experiments
              will provide useful information about the reproductive biology of
              wind-pollinated plants under conditions of reduced population density.
