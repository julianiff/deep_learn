Abstract    :
              9528113  Agnew    This grant provides partial support for the costs  of
              constructing a second, semi-portable, laser-  based, long-baseline strainmeter
              to make  measurements of tidal strains orthogonal to an  existing strainmeter
              situated at the southern  termination of the San Andreas fault system.  These
              measurements would be used in an attempt to  model the 3-D elastic
              inhomogeneities and  inelastic responses that are important in  determining the
              mechanical behavior of earthquake  prone regions.  The use of two instruments 
              provides a novel approach to measuring crustal  strain near faults.  ***
