Abstract    :
              This starter grant award to the University of Tennessee will support the  
              research of Professor Robert J. Hinde.  The theme of the research is  
              computational studies of hydrogen chloride adsorption on water clusters.    The
              project employs molecular dynamics computer simulation techniques to   study
              the atomic-scale dynamical processes involved in the adsorption of   HCl
              molecules at the surface of small water clusters.  This system   represents a
              model for the adsorption of HCl molecules at the surface of   macroscopic ice
              particles, such as those found in polar stratospheric   clouds.  In contrast to
              earlier theoretical work, this project models   both the water and HCl
              molecules in a way that permits the molecules to   dissociate into their
              component ions.  Adsorption of HCl on polar stratospheric cloud particles is a
              key first   step in the chain of events leading to depletion of stratospheric
              ozone   above Antartica.  This research will provide a better understanding of 
               the rate and mechanism of the initial step in the ozone depletion cycle.
