Abstract    :
              Golimowski  95-28236    Dr. Golimowski will continue his search for brown dwarf 
              companions to nearby low mass stars, i.e. those within 20 parsecs  of the Sun
              with high galactic latitude and large proper motion.  The survey uses the
              Adaptive Optics Coronograph from Johns  Hopkins University with the Palomar
              Observatory 60-inch  telescope.  The three year study will concentrate on stars
              which  are estimated to be less than one billion years old, since theory 
              indicates brown dwarfs cool and dim rapidly with age.  ***
