Abstract    :
              The   project's   objectives   are:    1)   development   of  "SignStream,"  a 
              database tool for analysis  of  linguistic  data  captured on video;  2) use of
              SignStream for  creation  of  a  large  database  of  utterances  from 
              American  Sign  Language,   consisting   of  raw  video   and   fine-grained 
              linguistic  transcription;  3) development of an interactive  format   for 
              linking  electronic  documents  to  SignStream  databases  (allowing  direct
              access  from  texts  to  video,  encoded data, and SignStream tools). 
              SignStream provides  a  single  computing  environment for  manipulating  video
               and  transcribing  utterances by entering linguistic  information  in 
              multiple fields and linking this to specific video frame  sequences,  
              resulting   in  a  fine-grained,   multi-level,  temporally calibrated
              transcription.  Information  from  the  various  fields  is  aligned visually
              on screen  to  reflect  temporal relations.  The goal is to make SignStream and
               the  databases   and   interactive   document   tools   developed  accessible 
              to the general research community.  There  is  a  pressing  need  for such
              tools, for linguistic  research  on  signed  languages (which has to date been 
              hampered  by  the  inaccessibility  of data for inspection,  and  the  lack  of
               tools  for  scientific  analysis thereof)  as  well  as  for  related
              disciplines relying on analysis of video data.
