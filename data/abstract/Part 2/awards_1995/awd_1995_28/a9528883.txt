Abstract    :
              9528883  Fang    This award supports the management of the International 
              Symposium on  Environmental Geotechnology to be held in San Diego,  California,
              on June  10-12, 1996.  The Symposium's intent is to cover both basic  concepts
              and  field applications in a well-balanced presentation.  The  purpose of this 
              symposium is also to promote a significant educational  purpose.  All 
              educators and their students will have an opportunity to  joint with  practical
              engineers to discuss the highly interdisciplinary  matters  presented by
              environmental geotechnology.  Two unique panel  discussions are  planned:  1)
              Geotechnology:  the next generation, and 2)  From practice back  to theory. 
              Short courses, workshops, and exhibition  displays are also  planned to advance
              the concept of environmental technology  and provide a  forum for idea exchange
