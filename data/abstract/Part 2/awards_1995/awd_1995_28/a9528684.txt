Abstract    :
              9528684  Lavernia   Products fabricated directly to net shape save energy by
              minimizing or eliminating the disposal problems associated with scrap.  A new
              net shape manufacturing process that uses reactive spray deposition to produce
              a fine grain structure, ductile, high strength material that can be
              superplastic formed into useful products will be investigated.   The grain
              refinement may produce superior products with enhanced properties.  The
              research combines computational and experimental investigations of aluminum
              alloys, low carbon steel, and magnesium alloys.  Experimental work will use
              reactive spray deposition using liquid-gas and liquid-solid reactions as the
              first step in refining grain sizes below the superplastic limit.  Models will
              be developed for reactive atomization and deposition, and droplet-particle
              interactions.  Experiments and analytical measurements will define the
              relationship between grain size and spray deposition conditions, with
              additional experiments to characterize the superplastic behavior of these
              materials.     If successful, the project will reduce energy and waste material
              in fabricating products, with large potential energy savings in the fabrication
              of aluminum products.   ***
