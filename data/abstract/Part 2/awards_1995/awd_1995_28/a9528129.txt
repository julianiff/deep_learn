                                        Abstract                          AST- 9528129   
              Funds from this grant will be used to replace and upgrade  components which
              limit the sensitivity of the Infrared  Optical Telescope Array (IOTA).  These
              components include  the infrared beam-combining optics, the infrared detectors,
               the autoguiders and the data-collection computers.  With  these improvements
              the interferometer should be able to  detect objects 10-20 times fainter than
              the present limit.  In addition, by employing infrared autoguiders, it will be 
              possible to observe true infrared sources with no visible  counterparts.  These
              changes will enable, for the first time  with a near-infrared interferometer,
              the observations of  heavily enshrouded evolved stars, Wolf-Rayet stars, 
              planetary nebulae, emission-line stars, sources in giant  molecular clouds and
              T Tauri stars.  With an angular  resolution of 0.012 arcseconds at a wavelength
              of 2.2  micrometers the interferometer can detect structures the  size of
              Jupiter's orbit at the distance of the Orion star-  forming regions.
