Abstract    :
              Professor John Weeks is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and  
              Computational Chemistry Program to study the theory of inhomogeneous and  
              confined fluids.  Weeks will use a novel and physically suggestive method   for
              treating nonuniform fluids that combines, in a self-consistent way, a   mean
              field treatment of the attractive forces with a potentially exact   treatment
              of the repulsive force correlations.   The method yields a   nonuniform
              repulsive force reference fluid whose structure approximates   that of the full
              system.  A second major theme of the research   generalizes the work by David
              Chandler on a Gaussian field theory for   density fluctuations in liquids,
              where excluded volume effects are taken   into account.  This allows a new and
              physically motivated way of deriving   important classes of integral equations.
               Proposed applications include   wetting and drying effects at walls,
              adsorption in slit pores and   nanotubes, polymers, and the free liquid-vapor
              interface.  Both   analytical theory and computer simulations will be employed
              in this   research.  Experiments have shown that both the static and dynamic
              properties of   nonuniform fluids, particularly when confined in small pores or
              slits,   differ dramatically from those of uniform systems.  New theoretical
              ideas   are needed to help make sense of these surprising results that impact
              on   a number of basic research areas in chemistry, physics, and fluid  
              mechanics.  In addition, these ideas could have practical applications to  
              materials processing operations involving lubrication, friction and wear.
