Abstract    :
              Arons, Jonathan  95-28271    Dr. Arons plans to investigate the mechanisms of
              emission  and transfer of radio radiation from rotation powered  pulsars,
              carried out in such a manner as to yield results  which can be tested by past,
              current and forthcoming  observations, then subsequently used to probe the
              physical  characteristics of these sources of low entropy power to the 
              surrounding medium.  The first investigation will be a study  of the "core"
              radio emission, with attention primarily  focused on the hypothesis that this
              component comes from  maser emission formed within the pair creation zone just 
              above a pulsar's polar cap.  The second area of study will  be into the physics
              of the "conal" component of pulsar radio  emission, to be studied as a
              manifestation of the shearing,  counterstreaming flow in the boundary layer
              between the  closed and open field lines.  The final area of study will  be an
              investigation of the transfer of polarized radio  radiation through the
              cyclotron resonant regions in the  outer magnetosphere, in an attempt to
              account for the origin  of elliptically polarized radio emission from pulsar 
              magnetospheres and to use these data to probe the plasma and  field
              configuration in the region where the rotational  energy loss is developed.
