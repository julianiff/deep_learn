Abstract    :
              9528208  Winter    This U.S.-Mexico Program award will support a planning visit 
              by Dr. Joseph C. Winter of the University of New Mexico to  work with Professor
              Raul Mendez Lugo of Instituto Nacional  de Antropologia y Historia (INAH) and
              Professor Bruce Benz  of the Universidad de Guadalajara (UdeG) study the
              Huichol  Indians of the Sierra Madre Occidental.    The Huichol Indians are one
              of the most intact, culturally  conservative indigenous groups in all of North
              America, who  live under a traditional agricultural system.  This project  will
              investigate four topics:  1) the origins and  development of prehistoric
              Huichol agriculture; 2) the  changing nature of contemporary Huichol
              agriculture; 3) the  expression of Huichol agriculture in art, mythology, and 
              social organization; and 4) the transmission of Huichol  agriculture through
              traditional education.  The PIs will  visit the main villages of two of the
              three traditional  Huichol communidades and meet with comunidad governors and 
              other members of the group.  ***
