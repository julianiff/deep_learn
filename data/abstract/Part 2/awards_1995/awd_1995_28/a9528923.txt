Abstract    :
              Professor Stuart A. Rice is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and  
              Computational Chemistry Program to continue his studies of quasi-two  
              dimensional systems.  Rice will use a combination of theory and   experiment to
              perform studies of: 1) polymer spheres and dimers in very   thin cells or
              adsorbed on liquid surfaces; 2) Langmuir monolayers; and 3)   the liquid-vapor
              interfaces of mixtures of metals.   Experimental   techniques to be employed
              include evanescent wave dynamic light   scattering, digital video microscopy,
              and  grazing incidence X-ray   diffraction and X-ray reflectivity.  Simulations
              will involve the use of   Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo techniques as well
              as Car-Parinello   theory.   Very little is known about the structure of the
              interface between two   immiscible phases.  Many chemical and biological
              phenomena depend on the   nature of this interface.  For example, the interface
              between long chain   amphiphiles and water is a model for biological membranes
              found in the   cell wall. Rice is using a combination of theoretical and
              experimental   methods that have only recently become available to explore the
              detailed   structure of these phase boundaries and the factors that influence
              their   structure.
