Abstract    :
              Wheeler, J. Craig  95-28110    Dr. Wheeler will use a combination of photometry
              and  spectroscopy, including polarimetry, to better understand the  progenitor
              evolution, the explosion mechanism and the use of  supernovae as cosmological
              probes.  A particular topic of  exploration will be Type Ic supernovae which
              seem to be devoid of  most of their hydrogen and helium envelopes, a critical
              clue to  their progenitor evolution.  Some of these events have rather  shallow
              light curves resembling other  events like SN 1993J with rather different
              spectral evolution and  some have steeper light curves.  This may give clues to
              the  nature of the collapse, clumping, mixing, and explosion of these  events. 
              Also to be continued is the program of supernova  polarimetry, which promises
              critical information concerning the  nature of the ejecta and of the
              circumstellar environment.  Preliminary results are that Type Ia supernovae are
              unpolarized,  implying a nearly spherical ejecta and very little circumstellar 
              scattering, but that Type II, and perhaps all collapse  events, have finite
              polarization, implying substantial  asymmetries in the ejecta or circumstellar
              matter.  Finally, the  observational program includes three supernova search
              programs,  one a visual search for nearby bright supernovae with the newly 
              dedicated Supernova Search Telescope, one at redshifts of Z about  0.1 to
              determine possible galaxy evolution effects, and one deep  survey at Z about 1
              to constrain cosmological models.    The observing program will be complemented
              with coordinated  theoretical investigations.  These will include
              multi-dimensional  models of thermonuclear explosions, including deflagration
              flames  and detonation structure and stability and gravitational collapse  with
              multi-dimensional and multi-energy group neutrino transport.  Also computed
              will be the spectral evolution of models to compare  with observations.  Of
              special interest is the spectral evolution  of models  that reproduce the
              dispersion of light curve  speed, color and  maximum brightness associated with
              Type Ia supernovae.  ***
