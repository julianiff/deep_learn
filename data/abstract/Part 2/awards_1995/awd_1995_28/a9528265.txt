Abstract    :
              This renewal award is made in the Organic Dynamics Program in support of the
              research of Dr. Marye Anne Fox.  The structure, chemical properties,
              photoreactivity, and new routes for the generation of stable radicals,
              biradicals, radical ions and carbenes will be investigated.  Structure will be
              established by a comparison of solution phase and solid state NMR spectroscopy,
              by electrochemical techniques, and by transient and steady state photochemical
              probes for excited state reactivity.  The effect of structure on the efficiency
              of photoinduced electron transfer and whether novel photoreactivity can be
              initiated by long wavelength visible or infared light will be explored.  The
              effect of phase and local environment on selective partitioning among competing
              reaction pathways from a common excited state will be studied.  This work will
              focus on understanding differences in typical photochemical behavior elicited
              by constraining a photoactive molecule within a size-constrained zeolite,
              within a self-assembled monolayer, within molecular solids, and in
              supercritical fluids.  Progress in understanding the key reactions organic
              chemistry depends on the knowledge of the properties, stabilities and
              structures of reactive intermediates.  Such knowledge is required for
              understanding the efficient utilization of light-adsorptive organic dyes in
              mechanistic chemistry, for the design of molecular conductors, semiconductors,
              and magnets, in the synthesis of surface-modified catalysts, and as a vehicle
              for understanding aggregation effects in controlling chemical reactivity.  f8
