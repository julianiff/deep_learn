Abstract    :
              9528882  Moehle  This project provides support to  initiate, develop and
              implement a  cooperative US-Japan workshop to  study the Kobe earthquake of 
              January 1995.  The Great Hanshin,  i.e. Kobe earthquake struck the  area
              surrounding the city of Kobe  Japan on 17 January 1995.  The  epicenter of this
              moment magnitude  6.9 event was about 20 km southwest  of downtown Kobe. 
              Roughly 40-km  strike-slip rupture extended  directly under the city.  The
              event  left more than 5000 people dead,  with tens of thousands of  structures
              destroyed by ground  shaking and subsequent fire.  Parallels have been drawn to
               possible scenarios for urban  earthquakes in the United States.  The Great
              Hanshin earthquake  therefore offers an opportunity for  the United States to
              learn and  become better prepared for future  earthquakes.    A systematic
              exchange with Japanese  researchers, engineers, and  planners is desirable so
              that  counterparts in the United States  can best learn the lessons of this 
              earthquake as they  apply to the  United States.  This project is to  open that
              dialogue by conducting a  seminar in Japan and a follow-up  workshop in the
              United States.  These activities will include  presentations of findings
              related  to this earthquake, identification  of  research needs, and in-depth 
              discussions on how to take  advantage of the data made  available to the
              research community  in the United States.  The reports  will include a
              recommended research  agenda for such subjects as  structural design,
              repair/retrofit,  seismic reconstruction,  preparedness and emergency 
              responses, etc.  These  recommendations will form the basis  for future funding
              priorities for  cooperative research with Japan by  the National Science
              Foundation and  other funding agencies in the  United States.  ***
