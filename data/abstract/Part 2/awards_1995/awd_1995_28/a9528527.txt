Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    EEC-9528527  Mathur    The use of a model of a virtual
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) as a tool to develop,
              operate, and manage a Center can dramatically impact the way all parties to a
              Center interact with it.  The initial model of the I/UCRC for Software
              Engineering (SERC) called VSERC is presently accessible on the world wide-web
              through NETSCAPE.    This award provides funding for a project to improve the
              robustness of VSERC to site configuration errors; improve access control;
              develop a parameterized version of VSERC (capable of modification to suit other
              NSF Centers);  and test the implementation of VSERC for another NSF Center.   
              Researcher from four universities (Purdue University, University of Florida,
              University of West Florida, and University of Oregon) will perform this
              research.
