Abstract    :
              9528966  Taylor  The potential for cytoplasmic hyperparasites to influence the
              dynamics of plant-pathogen interactions will be the focus of this collaborative
              research project. The theoretical portion of the research has three o`jectives:
              (1) to identify conditions that allow the hyperparasite to invade a pathogen
              population, (2) to generate predictions on the effects that hyperparasite
              invasion has on plant-pathogen population dynamics, and (3) to generate
              predictions on long-term evolutionary dynamics of the
              plant-pathogen-hyperparasite system. Empirical studies will examine the
              chestnut blight system involving the American chestnut, the fungal parasite of
              chestnut, and a double stranded (ds) RNA hyperparasite of the fungus. One
              experiment will test predictions for the distribution of dsRNAs within chestnut
              populations, and the diversity of vegetative compatibility groups with and
              among fungal populations. A second study will evaluate the genetic interaction
              between the fungus and dsRNA in determining pathogen virulence. The relation
              between pathogen virulence and disease transmission rates will be evaluated in
              a third experiment. This work will determine the influence of hyperparasite
              infection on the relationship between virulence and transmission rate. The last
              experiment will test model predictions on the relative transmission rates of
              dsRNA-free and dsRNA-infected lines that allow dsRNAs to invade fungal
              populations.
