Abstract    :
              9528953  Palffy-Muhoray    Support for this conference on Dynamica and Defects
              in  Liquid Crystals will make possible the full participation of  young
              researchers and established scientists working in the  field of liquid
              crystals.  The conference aims to establish  the current state-of-understanding
              of dynamics and defects  in liquid crystals by relating recent theoretical 
              developments and experimental results.  The relevance of the  results for the
              new generation of liquid crystal displays  will be determined, and key
              outstanding problems and future  research directions will be emphasized.  %%% 
              This conference will bring together scientists working in an  area of
              considerable national importance.  Materials areas  related to liquid crystals
              for displays is of high priority,  and this group will address
              interdisciplinary problems that  range from fundamental science to
              manufacturing issues.  ***
