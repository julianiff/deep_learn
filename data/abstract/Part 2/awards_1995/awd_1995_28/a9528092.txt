Abstract    :
              9528092  Pelcovits  This is a renewal proposal of a grant that was originally 
              funded under the program Computational Approaches to Real  Materials (CARM).
              The work involves a  study of the  equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of
              the nematic  liquid crystals using large scale computation. Previously 
              developed (under CARM) sequential and parallel molecular  dynamics (using
              Gay-Berne potentials) codes will be run on  workstations and massively parallel
              machines respectively.  The specific objectives include the dynamics of
              nematics  after rapid quenches, with special emphasis on the behavior  of
              topological defects and the response of nematics to  electric fields.  %%% 
              Liquid crystals are used in flat panel displays and  electronic and photonic
              devices.  The present grant is to  study, using large scale computation,  the
              relationship  between the microscopic molecular properties and the  material 
              response of the nematic liquid crystals.  The work  follows the earlier
              development of the molecular dynamics  codes supported by a CARM grant. The
              present work will help  elucidate the relationship between the microscopic 
              properties of nematics and their  macroscopic response to  rapid cooling and to
              applied electric fields.  ***
