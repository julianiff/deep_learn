Abstract    :
              Floudas - Abstract - 9528150    Significant effort has been expended toward
              theoretical and algorithmic studies of optimization algorithms and their
              computational testing in applications that arise in process synthesis, design
              and control.  Recent interest in global optimization and its application to
              chemical engineering problems is due to the fact that: (1) a large number of
              process synthesis, design, and control problems are global optimization
              problems; (2) existing local nonlinear optimization approaches may either fail
              to obtain a feasible solution or are trapped to a local optimum solution which
              may differ in value from the global solution; and (3) the global optimum
              solution may have a very different physical interpretation when it is compared
              to local solutions (e.g. in phase equilibrium a local solution may provide
              incorrect prediction of types of phases at equilibrium, as well as the
              components' composition in each phase).    The primary objective of this
              research is to develop theoretical, algorithmic and computational techniques
              for global optimization problems that arise in a variety of chemical
              engineering design and synthesis problems, as well as molecular conformation
              problems that arise in computational chemistry and biology.  These advances
              will complement efforts in the rigorous mathematical modeling of chemical
              process systems and aid the search in the design of molecules, peptides, and
              proteins.  The PI plans to investigate (i) the extension of his recently
              developed global optimization approach, aBB, to general constrained nonlinear
              optimization problems and mixed-integer nonlinear problems which are employed
              in process synthesis; (ii) the development of a new global optimization based
              approach for the determination of all solutions of certain classes of
              nonlinearly constrained systems of equations which has important applications
              in process systems that exhibit multiple steady states (e.g., reactors,
              distillation columns); (iii) the parameter estimation problems of nonlin ear
              models; (iv) the bilevel nonlinear optimization problems that arise in the
              analysis of process systems under uncertainty: (v) the three-dimensional
              structure prediction of oligopeptides, peptides, and proteins; and (vi) the
              development of a distributed computing framework for the aBB global
              optimization approach and the development of computational tools for (i)
              through (v).
