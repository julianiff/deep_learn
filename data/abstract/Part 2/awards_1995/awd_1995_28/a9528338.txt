Abstract    :
              Buchler, J. Robert  95-28338    Dr. Buchler will continue research on pulsating
              variable  stars in three areas.  The first is a study  of the interaction of
              two vibrational modes to explain the  irregular pulsations of stars such as  W
              Virginis, +the second is a survey of Cepheid pulsation  properties as a
              function of global  parameters, and the third is a study of the non-radial 
              pulsation of white dwarfs and delta Scuti  stars.  ***
