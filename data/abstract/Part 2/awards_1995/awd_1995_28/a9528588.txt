Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry  
              program provides continued support to research by Dr. Thomas P. Onak of   the
              Chemistry Department, California State University at Los Angeles,   concerning
              the chemistry of cage compounds of carbon and boron, called   carboranes.  The
              reactions that will be investigated are: (a) selective,   progressive, cage
              opening with nucleophiles such as fluoride ion, amines,   phosphine, and
              hydride ion; (b) the syntheses of new carboranes; (c) the   syntheses of new
              substituted carboranes that exhibit different modes of   bonding and structure;
              (d) the influence of a variety of attached groups   on the mechanism of
              rearrangement of substituted carboranes; (e)   equilibration studies involving
              isomeric substituted carboranes to assess   cage stabilizing and destabilizing
              influences of various substituents;   (f) a study of net front-side cage
              displacement reactions; (g) the   examination and delineation of products from
              the reaction of diborane   with nido carborane anions; (h) the applicaton of
              MP-NMR computational   methods, including IGLO, GIAO, and FPT, for the
              comparison of predicted   NMR structural assignments to experimental data. 
              Carboranes form large molecular structures with unusual bonding and  
              structural characteristics.  Insight about the behavior of such clusters   is
              potentially applicable to other large molecular structures, including   those
              found in electronic materials.  Attention will  be paid to   developing a
              theoretical framework for interpreting the experimental   results.  The work
              will be carried out primarily by undergraduate students
