Abstract    :
              Abstract  Charalampopoulos  9528598    The objectives of the proposed research
              is to study the effects of chemical composition, temperature and/or
              microstructure on the refractive indices of soot.  The proposed studies involve
              both ex-situ and in-situ measurements.  In the ex-situ studies particles will
              be collected from premixed propane/oxygen and acetylene/oxygen flames and
              formed into smooth pellets.  These pellets will be analyzed for their
              carbon/hydrogen ratios and from ellipsometric measurements their refractive
              indices will be determined in the wavelength range 0.30 - 10 mm and for the
              temperature range 25 to 2500C.  By correcting for voidage effects, the
              refractive indices of the particles which constitute the pellet surfaces will
              be determined.  In-situ studies on the same flames, consisting of scattering,
              extinction and polarization measurements, will be used to obtain particle
              diameters, number of primary particles/agglomerate, number of agglomerates and
              the refractive indices of the primary particles.  Aggregates of known
              configuration and refractive indices will be added to a CO/Air diffusion flame
              in order to test the experimental and data inversion approaches.  Through this
              investigation the PI hopes to be able to account for the non-sphericity of the
              soot particles, test the methodology of the in-situ studies using
              straight-chain agglomerates, compare refractive indices obtained by the in-situ
              and ex-situ methods, and identify the critical parameters in determining soot
              refractive indices.
