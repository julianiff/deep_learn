Abstract    :
              9528411  Cole    This award supports the participation of U.S. scientists in an
              international science and implementation workshop for the new Annual Records of
              Tropical Systems (ARTS) initiative.  ARTS is a task of Past Global Changes
              (PAGES), a core project of the IGBP.  The goal of ARTS is to expand our
              knowledge of the behavior of the tropical ocean-atmosphere, with
              seasonal-annual resolution, over periods of years to centuries.  This research
              will enhance our understanding of the global climate variability and should
              ultimately lead to greater predictability of the climate system.  The proposed
              workshop will help to set scientific priorities, coordinate ongoing research,
              define new avenues of research, and catalyze international collaboration in the
              pursuit of ARTS objectives.  Participants will include experts in several
              paleoclimatology disciplines as well as climatologists versed in tropical
              ocean-atmosphere interactions.  Products of the workshop will include a written
              science and implementation plan for publication by PAGES as well as a series of
              prospectuses for specific science projects to be carried out as part of ARTS. 
              Scientists from the U.S., Indonesia, France, Australia, Canada, China, and
              Japan are expected to participate.
