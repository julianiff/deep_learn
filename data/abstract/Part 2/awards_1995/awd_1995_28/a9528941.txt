Abstract    :
              Abstract  CTS-9528941  Varma      The proposed research focuses on the
              fundamental aspects of the SHS processes involved in the formation of
              intermetallic compounds.  In order to utilize this technique effectively, and
              to control the process, a fundamental knowledge of combustion synthesis
              mechanisms involving the evolution of non-equilibrium initial products toward
              the final product is of critical importance.  The two major objectives of the
              proposed work are: (1) the analysis of the initial product structure formation,
              and (2) the measurement of the effective and detailed kinetics of the formation
              of intermetallics in a combustion regime.  The approach involves obtaining a
              clear understanding of the evolution of product structure from when the product
              first appears to when the final product is formed by the post combustion
              processes.  Four basic initial product formation mechanisms are presented for
              gasless combustion synthesis.  By varying the experimental conditions such as
              green density, particle size, initial temperature, cooling rate, etc., and from
              the initial product structure, the PI hopes to determine the appropriate
              conditions for each of the formation mechanisms.  A variety of experimental
              techniques will be used in the proposed research.  These include combustion
              wave quenching, modified particle-foil technique, time resolved X-ray
              diffraction (TRXRD), new method of microscopic high speed video recording and a
              novel experimental apparatus for monitoring the kinetics of admixed gas
              evolution and ionization in the reaction zone.
