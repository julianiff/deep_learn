Abstract    :
              Thomas, John  95-28398    Dr. Thomas plans a concerted program of research on
              dynamo  theory, concentrating in three areas -- dynamo generation of  magnetic
              fields in white dwarfs, dynamo generation of magnetic  fields in the giant
              planets, and the aperiodicity and chaos in  nonlinear stellar dynamos.  In
              addition, he will investigate the  solar dynamo as a benchmark for all three of
              the aforementioned  studies.  ***
