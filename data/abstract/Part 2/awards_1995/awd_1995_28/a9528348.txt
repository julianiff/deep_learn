Abstract    :
              Theories of primate social structure argue that patterns of food availability
              have a profound  impact on social organization.  For instance, if food
              resources are dispersed in small, scattered  clumps, competition among
              group-living individuals will increase and limit the number of animals  that
              can feed and move together; this will constrain group size.  This study aims to
              gather data to  test such ideas, particularly the proposition that food may be
              a limiting factor only at times of  seasonal food shortages.  The study
              species, the mona monkey, occurs in a range of forest  habitats in West Africa,
              but has never been the subject of a long-term field study.  Studies of  related
              species suggest that much of its diet is ripe fruit and insects, food items
              likely to fluctuate  greatly in their seasonal abundance.   Research on the
              behavior of the mona monkey, and on the ecology of its habitat, will take place
               in the Lama Forest of Benin, which has a long dry season.  Lama is the largest
              surviving remnant  of the original dry forest vegetation of the Dahomey Gap, an
              area thought to have played a major  role in the evolution of West African
              mammal species.  This research will contribute to the better  conservation of
              this threatened ecosystem.
