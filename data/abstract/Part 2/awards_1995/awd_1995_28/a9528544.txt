Abstract    :
              9528544  DePaolo      This award is part of a multi-disciplinary project to
              drill a 4.5  km hole into the eastern flank of Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii. 
              The  primary purpose of the drill hole is to acquire a continuous  physical and
              geochemical record of the growth of a major intraplate  hotspot volcano.  The
              PIs are most interested in using this record  to constrain the dynamics and
              nature of mantle plumes and other  mantle processes; in addition, the sample
              set provided by the  borehole will also be very valuable to other communities
              of  investigators such as volcanology and paleomagnetism, and the study  of the
              fluids flowing from the borehole will provide information  about shield-volcano
              hydrogeology.  ***
