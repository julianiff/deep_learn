Abstract    :
              Dr. Bruce E. Bursten, Department of Chemistry, Ohio State University, is  
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of   the
              Chemistry Division for experimental and theoretical studies of the  
              photochemistry of dinuclear organometallic compounds (DOC). The project   aims
              at defining the photochemistry of this class of complexes and   involves
              exploratory photochemistry, spectroscopic investigations of the   intermediates
              formed during the photochemical reactions, and theoretical   studies of DOC
              complexes and photochemically generated DOC intermediates.   The compounds
              chosen for study contain two metal atoms bonded to one   another through small
              organic groups. These complexes will allow an   exploration of the competition
              between metal-metal and metal-ligand bond   breaking reactions, of the
              chemistry that can occur at two metal centers,   and of a wide variety of
              metal-ligand bonding modes.  When a chemical compound is exposed to light it is
              often activated and   undergoes what are termed photochemical reactions.
              Exceedingly important   examples include photosynthesis and the chemistry of
              vision. The   photochemical properties of organic compounds are well documented
              and   understood. In contrast, detailed knowledge of the factors that control  
              inorganic photochemistry has not yet emerged. The detailed investigations   to
              be carried   out in this study are designed to help fill this void and   will
              ultimately allow DOC compounds to be tailored for specific   photochemical
              activity.
