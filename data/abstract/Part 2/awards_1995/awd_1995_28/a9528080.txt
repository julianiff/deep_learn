Abstract    :
              Smith  95-28080    Dr. Smith will complete the survey of variable stars in the
              Draco  dwarf spheroidal galaxy which was initiated by Baade and Swope  almost
              40 years ago.  New CCD observations will provide accurate  multicolor
              lightcurves which will place the variables in the HR  diagram and, together
              with follow-up spectroscopic observations,  test the existence of a
              metallicity-luminosity relation in that  system.  Intensive series of
              photometric observations of  multiperiodic RR Lyrae stars will provide the
              observational base  needed to test theories of that poorly understood
              phenomenon.  RR Lyrae variables in M14, M15 and M53 also will be studied.  ***
