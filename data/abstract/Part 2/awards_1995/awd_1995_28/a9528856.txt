Abstract    :
                  Renewed funding is provided to continue development and install an  undersea
              observatory that is connected to shore-based laboratories  via a fiber-optic
              cable.  The Hawaii Undersea Geo-Observatory  (HUGO) integrates marine
              fiberoptic cable and submersible  technologies to prmvide the ocean science
              community with an  unmanned laboratory on the ocean floor at the summit of
              Loihi  seamount.  Loihi, an active submarine volcano, is located about 35  km
              southeast of the Island of Hawaii.  Its shallow summit (about  1000m below sea
              level), exciting geology, earthquakes, frequent  volcanic activity, and
              proximity to land make it an ideal site to  install a permanent geo-laboratory,
              and begin real-time monitoring  of processes occurring at the ocean floor.     
              The modular observatory has the potential to house more than 100  experiments
              from every ocean science discipline, supplying  experiments with electrical
              power, command capability, and  real-time continuous data transmission to
              shore.  Once installed,  scientists will be able to study submarine volcanic,
              biological,  and oceanographic processes continuously.  HUGO data will also be 
              used by the U.S. Geological Survey Hawaiian Volcano Observatory in  their
              studies of Hawaiian volcanoes, and by the Pacific Tsunami  Warning Center in
              characterization of tsunamis from distant  earthquakes.    HUGO earthquake and
              acoustic data will be made available to local  schools for teaching and
              projects, and sub-sets will be presented  on the INTERNET.  Initial experiments
              will include a broad band  hydrophone sampled at 42 KHz, which will be
              sensitive to biological  and other noises over a wide range of audio
              frequencies.    The use of cables to connect seafloor observatories and 
              experimental sites to shore is a strong area of interest for  several factions
              of the ocean science community.  What is learned  from this project will have
              applications for future cable  installations as well.
