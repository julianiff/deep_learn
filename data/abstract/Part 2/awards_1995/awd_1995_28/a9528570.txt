Abstract    :
              9528570  Slattery      This research project will utilize analytical chemical 
              techniques to evaluate the importance of secondary  metabolites and steroids in
              the reproduction of 3 species of  soft corals from Guam.  This project builds
              on ongoing  research which has identified and examined the importance of 
              secondary metabolites, organic extracts, and morphological  defenses in soft
              coral predator deterrence.  This project  will extract, isolate, and determine
              the structures of new  secondary metabolites in adult colonies and their eggs. 
              Temporal changes in concentrations of these compounds will  be correlated with
              reproductive indices to assess the role  of the compounds in maturation and
              spawning.  Standard  bioassays will be conducted to guide isolation of
              bioactive  compounds and to determine the importance of isolated  natural
              products in egg release, sperm chemotaxis, and  feeding deterrence.  Novel
              compounds identified in this  project will expand upon a growing database of
              metabolites  that can be used as chemotaxonomic markers and will be 
              incorporated into existing pharmacological programs.  Additionally, this
              project will contribute significant in  sights into the reproductive biology
              and chemical ecology of  the common soft corrals on the shallow reefs
              surrounding  Guam.  ***
