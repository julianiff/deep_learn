Abstract    :
              IBN-9511349 and 9528213  Blanchard, D. C.  and McEwen, Bruce    Social stress is
              a common and enduring feature of life with  important behavioral and
              physiological effects.  A  multidisciplinary research collaboration between the
              Laboratory of  Behavioral Neurobiology at the University of Hawaii and the 
              Laboratory of Neuroendocrinology at Rockefeller University is aimed  at
              description and analysis of these effects.  Previous work  indicates that
              single, two-week stress periods can produce  increased defensive behavior and
              decreased social and reproductive  behavior; higher levels of stress hormones
              and impairment of  mechanisms that normally limit stress hormone action; and 
              widespread changes in brain neurochemical systems.  Although these  changes are
              beginning to provide insights into the dynamics of the  physiological and
              behavioral response to chronic social stress,  completed studies have measured
              only a single time point in the  process.  The proposed program will
              investigate the development of  stress-related behavioral and physiological
              changes over time, and  will determine the persistence of stress effects
              following single  or multiple periods of chronic social stress.  In addition, 
              individual differences will be examined as determinants of  responsivity to
              social stress.  The proposed program will thus draw  upon the different
              approaches and expertise of these two research  groups to provide a uniquely
              comprehensive description and analysis  of the effects of social stress in an
              ecologically appropriate  situation.
