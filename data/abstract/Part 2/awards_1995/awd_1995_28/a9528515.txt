              ABSTRACT     The Second International Forum of Particulate Technology is
              organized by  the Particle Technology Forum (PTF) of American Institute of
              Chemical Engineers. This biennial meeting will take place in conjunction with
              the 5th World Congress of Chemical Engineering in San Diego, CA, July 14-18,
              1996. This workshop will focus on the needs of particulate technology in
              various fields including environment, energy, food, agriculture, pharmaceutics,
              and biotechnology.  Technical sessions will cover  topics such as storage and
              conveying, particle formation, dispersion of powders in liquids and gases,
              classification and separation, mixing, size reduction, agglomeration, rheology
              and multiphase flow, and fluidization.  Both oral and poster presentations will
               allow interactions between U.S.  scientists and  leading international experts
              from more than 25 countries.  The participants will have the opportunity to
              share recent results and discuss potential collaboration between industry,
              academia, professional societies  and government agencies.  The research
              opportunities in various areas of particulate technology will be documented in
              the conference proceedings.            Syed Qutubuddin
