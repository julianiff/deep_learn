Abstract    :
              9528606  Mishra  In recent years, vacuum microelectronic devices (VMDs) have
              become of great interest in the fields such as high speed, high power devices
              and flat panel displays, because of they combine the advantages of both vacuum
              tubes and modern semiconductor devices.  The key to the success of vacuum
              microelectronics is the fabrication of the solid-state electron emitters
              (SSEEs).  For applicatimn in flat panel displays, it is required that SSEEs
              should be stable and generate uniform electron emission with high efficiency
              and moderate current density.  On the other hand, for applications in medium RF
              power amplifiers and high power RF sources, SSEEs should be very reliable and
              generate electron emission with high current density.  Two types of  SSEEs,
              field emitters 1 and planar emitters 2,3 have been reported in the past with
              some success.  Field emitters, due to its intrinsic nature, have very high
              emission efficiency and attracted much attention in the field of flat panel
              displays.  Much progress has been made in recent years in the development of
              field emitters arrays (FEAs) 4, owing to the fast advance of modern
              semiconductor technologies.  In this proposal, we propose a GaN based field
              emitter and its arrays with an unique fabrication process based on reactive ion
              etching (RIE) and selective regrowth of GaN point or wedge emitters.  ***
