Abstract    :
              9528615  Ishii   This project develops a method to evaluate the environmental
              impact of  electromechanical products by focusing on modularity,
              material/process selection, and retirement specification.  The method will
              address the entire product line (families) and product changes over time
              (generations).  The project focuses on identifying the data and formulae
              necessary to evaluate reusability/recyclability.  The pertinent factors
              include:  (1) technology life-cycle of embedded functions;   (2) demand for
              reuse as service parts;  (3) value of recycle materials versus the reprocessing
              cost;  (4) destructive or non-destructive disassembly;  and (5) trade-off with
              manufacturing and service costs.  Industrial collaborators will provide
              validation examples in developing the method.    If successful, the project
              will produce an Internet accessible tool that simulates the product retirement
              process, identifies cost-drivers, and improves the life-cycle design.  The tool
              will enhance the recyclability and reusability of products, while reducing
              life-cycle costs and improving quality.  The method should reduce solid waste
              and extend the life of resources by addressing not only individual products but
              their families across product line and generations over time.  The project will
              contribute to engineering education through a graduate course on Design for
              Manufacturability delivered to over twenty companies through Stanford
              Instructional Television Network.
