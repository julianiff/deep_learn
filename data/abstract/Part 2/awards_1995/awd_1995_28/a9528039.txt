Abstract    :
              Manteuffel  9528039         The researcher and his colleagues organize a
              conference  devoted to iterative methods for the solution of linear and 
              nonlinear systems of equations.  Particular themes are  nonsymmetric linear
              systems, globally convergent algorithms for  nonlinear systems, algorithms of
              optimal order of work, and  applications on multiprocessor computer
              architectures.       The mathematical description of real-world problems leads 
              inevitably to equations to solve.  Many times the equations are  nonlinear
              ones, arising because the underlying problem is  nonlinear.  Often, however,
              the original problem is linear and  the mathematical equations are too.  Such
              problems arise in all  areas of science and technology, and are of special
              interest in  biology, materials, environmental studies, and manufacturing.   
              Progress in these areas requires solution of more comprehensive  modeling
              equations, or more accurate solution of existing models.  In either case, these
              needs increase the size of the equations or  their nonlinearity.  The
              conference addresses advances in  algorithms to deal with the bigger size of
              the equations,  nonlinearities, the amount of time and work needed to get a 
              solution, and the possible use of multiprocessor computers.
