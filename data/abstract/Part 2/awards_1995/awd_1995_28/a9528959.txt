Abstract    :
              This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program   of the
              Chemistry Division, is directed toward achieving a fundamental   understanding
              of catalytic reactions at solid surfaces.  Solid state   Nuclear Magnetic
              Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy used in situ  is the   principal instrumentation
              involved. Among the catalytic materials to be   investigated are zeolites,
              metal halides and metal oxides.  Theoretical   modeling via computer will
              provide guidance and confirmation in the   interpretation of experimental NMR
              results.  Transient approaches will be   used to determine the identity and
              structure of short-lived reaction   intermediates.  In addition,
              photodissociation processes in confining   media are to be studied.  This
              research will increase our understanding of how chemical reactions   promoted
              by catalysts take place.  Catalytic materials play a very   important role in
              the production of chemical products in such   technologically significant areas
              as the petroleum, lubricants, and   pharmaceutical industries.   Catalysts are
              used for many reasons and   significant among them are energy efficiency and a
              more positive   environmental impact.  The type of spectroscopy (NMR) employed
              in this   work is well suited to study the way catalytic reactions occur at
              solid   materials such as zeolites and metal oxides.
