Abstract    :
              Baker/Abstract          The objectives of this research are two fold:  (1) to 
              examine the growth and evaporation of individual ice crystals,  suspended by
              means of a new electromechanical balance, at various  temperatures (0 to -60
              degrees Celsius) and pressures (down to  100mb);  (2) to measure scattering
              phase functions over a wide  range of angles using a suitable laser.  The
              results should be  applicable to the physics of cirrus clouds.
