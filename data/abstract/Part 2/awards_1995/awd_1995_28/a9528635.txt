Abstract    :
              9528635   Szekely     During smelting of ferrous and non-ferrous metals, ionic
              melts such as slags, fluxes or mattes react with gases and metals.  These
              reactions are electrochemical in nature involving charge transfer between ionic
              an electronic species and are often diffusion limited in the slag phase.  Since
              slags, fluxes and mattes are primarily ionic melts, the diffusion process is
              controlled by the slower moving electronic species.  The objective of this
              research is to enhance the slag-metal reaction by using a plasma to provide an
              electronic pathway in the slag and assess the magnitude of its impact on
              processing ferrous melts in terms of lowering iron oxide (FeO) content and
              volume of the slag, and increasing yield, refractory life and recovery of
              alloying elements.  Preliminary results indicate a potential reduction of ten
              fold in the percent of FeO needed for decarburization of iron-carbon melt.   
              Annual world production and consumption of metals is close to 750 million tons,
              of which iron is ninety-five percent.  Extraction, smelting, refining and
              reclaiming processes associated with metals produce large quantities of both
              hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and thus have a significant impact on the
              environment.  This project could revolutionize steelmaking by dramatically
              reducing both the volume and the iron content of the slag that must be disposed
              of.  It could also open other opportunities in the removal of copper and zinc
              from ferrous scraps and in the matte smelting of copper,  which would also have
              a major economic and environmental impact.
