Abstract    :
              AST 9528536  PI:  Hyron Spinrad    The Early Phases of Galactic Evolution.   
              Dr. Spinrad will continue a study of the optical properties of  distant radio
              galaxies using the Keck 10-m telescopes.  He is  using radio galaxies to
              efficiently find very distant galaxies.  These sources permit an important
              study of the evolution of  galaxies and their relationship to quasi-stellar
              objects.  Dr.  Spinrad is also investigating the alignment effect of 
              optical/infrared continuum emission with radio jets/lobes.  Also  he is using
              the radio galaxies to identify the most distant  clusters of galaxies to study
              their evolution and history of star  formation.
