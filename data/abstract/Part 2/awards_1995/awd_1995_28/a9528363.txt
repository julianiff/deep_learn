Abstract    :
              9528363  Johnson  We propose a research program in the active control of
              acoustic  noise (and related problems) using adaptive identification and 
              control methodologies.  The motivating applications are the control  of
              acoustic noise in a one dimensional or duct noise scenario (e.g.  heating,
              ventilation and air conditioning or HVAC applications) as  well as the control
              of noise in a three dimensional or enclosure  scenario (e.g. automobile or
              helicopter interiors).  Open problems  to be addressed in this research program
              concern (a) the systematic  stability analysis of adaptive techniques used in
              the presence of  intrinsic feedback loops which are caused in these
              applications by  acoustic feedback and not by the usual closed loop control 
              configurations assumed in adaptive control theory and (b) the  development and
              efficient implementation of adaptive filters  especially in the MIMO enclosure
              problem.  The research program  will clarify the pertinent aspects of adaptive
              control theory and  practice and thus allow the systematic application of
              adaptive  techniques.  The research program will be conducted in  collaboration
              with and will utilize experimental facilities of the  United Technologies
              Research Center in East Hartford, CT. It is  expected that the
              multidisciplinary team thus assembled by this  collaboration will allow for
              wide-ranging and practical research  results to be achieved and broadly
              disseminated thus making  contributions to both education and commercial
              interests.  ***
