Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT      EEC-9528718  Beattie      Environmental concerns have made it
              necessary to develop technologies that will permit wide-spread environmental
              biomonitoring-microbial population dynamics during biodegredation of industrial
              or municipal wastes, biological effects of exposure to toxic chemicals in the
              environment, and the presence of beneficial and pathogenic microorganisms in
              soil, water, air, food, and agricultural products.      This award provides
              funding for a planning meeting that will study the potential for obtaining
              enough industrial support for the University of Texas Medical Branch at
              Galveston to become an additional university research site of the University of
              Tennessee's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Measurement and
              Control.    The expanded research agenda will address the biological aspects of
              analytical instruments, process control, ecosystem surveillance, environmental
              monitoring and micro-system technologies.
