Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9528220    Funding is requested for developing a new method to
              transfer of  knowledge and technology between university and industry by
              establishing a Virtual Technology market on Internet, with application in the
              area of particulate and multiphase flow research.  The research will include
              investigation of user needs, development of system design and implementation,
              system of maintenance, data collection and analysis.    If successful, the
              proposed project will have a significant impact on developing the communication
              between academe and industry in the area of particulate and multiphase systems,
              and establishing a system that will continue to operate after the life of the
              NSF award.  ***
