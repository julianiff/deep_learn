Abstract    :
              This project involves the Ph.D. research of an anthropologist at the University
              of Washington-Seattle.  The focus is to understand the impact of the closeness
              of parental ties between divorced fathers and their children on the father's
              provision of resources to the child.  A sample of 60 divorced men in the
              Seattle area, half with joint custody of children and half without, will be
              studied.  A standard instrument for assessing parental attachment, defined as
              an innate tendency to form close relationships, will be administered.  The
              researcher hypothesizes that men with high attachment scores--who are evaluated
              as tending to form close relationships with others-- will tend to give more
              resources to their children, both economic and in terms of time spent, and that
              time spent with children before the divorce will be related to attachment
              scores.    This research is important because the children of divorced parents
              tend to suffer deprivations of economic and social resources.   Understanding
              the causes of the propensity of divorced men to spend resources on their
              children will be valuable for planners and social decision makers who must
              design programs to protect and improve the position of children of divorced
              parents.
