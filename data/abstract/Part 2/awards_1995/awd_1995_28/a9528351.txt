Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT   9528351       This proposal focuses on thermal diffusion in
              disordered materials at short time scales.  Experiments using the pump-probe
              optical technique to measure transient surface temperature will be used to
              assess the utility of fractal models  in understanding the thermal transport
              phenomena. Potential application is to high frequency electronic devices and to
              the characterization of new amorphous, polycrystalline and nanostructured
              materials.
