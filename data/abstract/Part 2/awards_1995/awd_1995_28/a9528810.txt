Abstract    :
              9528810  Messina  We propose to hold a ten-day summer workshop to explore the
              applications and algorithms requirements for PetaFLOPS-scale computing.  The
              workshop will take place at Bodega Bay, Sonoma County, California, on August
              14-23, 1995.  The focus will be on innovative applications and algorithms for
              PetaFLOPS systems.    The goal of the summer workshop is to develop detailed
              case studies (complete with performance models, software and hardware
              requirement s, and descriptions of open problems) for a number of applications
              areas, including nontraditional applications that may be enabled by PetaFLOPS
              systems.
