Abstract    :
              Anthropologists have argued that the front-to-back flattening of the chest of
              humans and apes  (i.e. hominoids) increases the range of arm movement at the
              shoulder so that they can reach out  in all directions. This is supposedly
              essential for swinging from branch to branch hand-over hand,  like most living
              apes (and presumably, our ape-like ancestors). However, this arm-swinging 
              hypothesis of hominoid anatomy has recently been challenged by other
              hypotheses, which argue  that the special shape of the hominoid chest evolved
              for slow climbing (which also requires  reaching out in all directions) or for
              climbing on vertical tree trunks. Unfortunately, the function of  the flattened
              chest in hominoids, like the functions of many other shoulder anatomical
              features,  cannot be clarified because of a complete lack of data on shoulder
              mobility in primates. This  study will videographically measure the range of
              arm movement in 3 dimensions, on sedated  animals and on preparations of bones
              and ligaments, in order to compare the range of arm  movement in animals with
              chests of different shapes. This study will also measure chest shape  using
              x-rays of primate species with different locomotor behaviors, in order to
              examine the  relationship between locomotor behavior and chest shape. The
              results of the proposed research  will provide much-needed mobility data for
              evaluating numerous hypotheses in the study of the  functional and evolutionary
              anatomy of human and primate shoulders.
