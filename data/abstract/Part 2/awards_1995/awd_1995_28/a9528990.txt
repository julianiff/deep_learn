Abstract    :
                The goal of this project is to increase effectiveness of human-computer
              communication by improving the quality of automatically generated speech. Using
              the known linguistic structure that is a by-product of text generation, the
              research investigates both utterance-level and dialog-level control of prosody
              (i.e. phrasing, emphasis and intonation) i  n a commercial synthesizer.  The
              approach -- development of statistical models of the mapping between meaning
              and prosodic structure -- is novel in its emphasis on automatic learning
              algorithms associated with the aim of portability to different task
              domains/generators.  The research involves: collection and automatic prosodic
              labeling of `acted`   speech in target task domains; use of generated
              syntactic, semantic and discourse annotation to drive prosodic control modules;
              investigation of the role of prosody in computer initiative, e.g. in
              clarification or error correction subdialogs; and development of evaluation
              protocols for assessing speech generation quality and its impact on
              human-computer interaction.  The research will benefit existing spoken language
              interfaces by providing higher quality speech output and more flexibility for
              response generation, but it will also open up applications for human-computer
              interaction where a visual display is not available, e.g. in small devices, in
              telephone-based computer access or for persons who are visually impaired.
