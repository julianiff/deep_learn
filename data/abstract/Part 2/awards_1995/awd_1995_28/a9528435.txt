Abstract    :
              95-28435  Kulkarni    Dr. Kulkarni's research program includes the application
              of  supercomputers to pulsar searches and an aggressive multi-  wavelength
              observational program, emphasizing radio observations  followed by ground-based
              optical and IR, as well as X-ray  observations from satellites.  The
              observational thrusts are:  sensitive searches for pulsars in supernova
              remnants, large blind  searches with sensitivity to sub-millisecond pulsars,
              targeted  observations of promising pulsar candidates identified by  continuum
              radio observations, deep searches of globular clusters  for millisecond
              pulsars, sensitive optical/IR observations of  binary pulsar systems, multi- 
              wavelength studies of soft gamma-ray repeaters. and attempts to  detect radio
              emission from gamma-ray burst sources.  ***
