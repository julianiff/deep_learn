Abstract    :
                  9528471  Plumb     This project represents an ongoing collaboration between
              Drs. Alan Plumb of MIT (under this award) and Dr. Lorenzo Polvani of Columbia
              University (ATM-9527315) concerning the dynamics of nonlinear atmospheric waves
              and vortices, with particular emphasis on applications to the stratosphere.  In
              this work, a number of tools have been employed.  Initially, the techniques of
              contour dynamics was used to study, at very high resolution, the
              characteristics of Rossby wave breaking under a variety of circumstances.  The
              principal investigators then used a global, pseudospectral, shallow water model
              to look at the two-dimensional dynamics of nonlinear waves in the presence of
              nonconservative processes as well as a "contour advection" technique (a
              Lagrangian, high resolution, contour-following approach to depict transport in
              known flows.  To extend these results, the PIs will examine the
              three-dimensional aspects of the interaction between Rossby waves and the
              stratospheric polar vortex using a multi-layer, pseudospectral, primitive
              equation model.  They also will investigate various aspects of the tropospheric
              circulation related to Rossby wave dynamics - including atmospheric blocking
              and interactions between the Hadley circulation and midlatitude planetary
              waves.    ***
