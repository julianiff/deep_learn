Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CMS-9528055  Mani  "Partial Support of the U.S. National Committee for
               Rock Mechanics"    This award to the National Academy of Sciences is for 
              support of the  activities of the U.S. National Committee for Rock Mechanics 
              (USNC/RM),  operating under the Board on Earth Sciences and Resources, 
              National  Research Council, during the one-year period from September  1, 1995
              through  August 31, 1996.  The USNC/RM represents the United States  in the 
              International Society for Rock Mechanics, and conducts  symposia in the U.S. 
              and North America to offer a venue for researchers in the  national groups 
              from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico to present and discuss  their work.  The 
              USNC/RM also provides a forum for meetings with federal  agencies and other 
              organizations to keep abreast of developments in the field  and to identify 
              issues of national significance that may merit independent  inquiry to serve 
              the needs of the government.
