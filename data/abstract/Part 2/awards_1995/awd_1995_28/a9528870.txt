Abstract    :
              The goal of this interdisciplinary workshop is to discuss state-of-the-art and
              future research directions in workflow and process automation involving
              information systems. There is significant recent commercial activity on
              developing workflow tools as well as significant interest in this topic in
              several fields of computer science. However, the current commercial systems are
              not poised to exploit even much higher market potential for workflow technology
              that can support information processing applications within and across
              enterprises. Guided by an interdisciplinary program committee, the workshop
              provides a forum for identifying synergy among experts working on the topics of
              workflow and process automation in information and database systems,
              distributed computing, and software engineering (including computer supported
              cooperative work, software process modeling, component-based software
              development, and business process reengineering).  The workshop is expected to
              cover state-of-the-art  in current research and technology, real-world
              application requirements, existing and emerging standards, and ba sed on these
              project the future research and development directions. Workshop results will
              be made broadly available through an NSF report, ACM-SIG/IEEECS-TC
              publications, and by electronic means. The report will identify the
              complementary technical issues that are being studied or should be further
              researched, to enhance information systems that can incorporate intra- and
              inter-organizational workflows to support information processes in a variety of
              enterprises in an effective and efficient manner.
