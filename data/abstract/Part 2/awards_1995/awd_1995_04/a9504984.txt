Abstract    :
               9504984  Williams    This award supports a 12-month Japan Society for the
              Promotion of  Science Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Eric Williams of the 
              Mathematics Department, University of Minnesota  Minneapolis, Minnesota. This
              fellowship opportunity will enable  Dr. Williams to begin a collaborative
              research effort with  Professor Minoru Takahashi of the Institute of Solid
              State  Physics (ISSP) at the University of Tokyo.  The researchers  propose to
              study integrable many body quantum mechanical systems,  in particular those for
              which the individual particle numbers are  not conserved. The 12-month visit by
              Dr. Williams will help him  to establish a personal and professional link with
              a leading  researcher in Japan.    As a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Williams will
              have the opportunity  to interact with researchers at the University of Tokyo,
              as well  as contributing to the understanding of integrable systems and 
              physics. Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of the  Program in
              its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge  through an international
              collaboration.  ***
