Abstract    :
              9504074  Gandhi  This research will compare several methods of parallelizing the
              EM FDTD code for large-scale man moll studies.  Heterogeneous workstation
              clusters will be used to study code portability, efficiency, and scalability. 
              This will be compared to use of High Performance Fortran (HPF) and also
              massively parallel machines.  Visualization of the large-scale output data and
              subgridding of the FDTD lattice will also be parallelized.  With the
              high-resolution model made possible by the parallel code, coupling of power
              lines to the pineal and pituitary glands, which may be implicated in EM
              biointeraction, will be studied.  Next-generation cellular telephones at 1900
              MHz will be examined, and a library of impulse responses will be developed,
              allowing analysis of coupling of the body to any waveform up to 3 GHz.
