Abstract    :
              9504102  Molian   The feasibility of a novel femtosecond pulsed excimer laser 
              processing technique for precision machining of chemical vapor deposition
              (CVD)-diamond films  will be investigated.  Femtosecond pulsed laser ablation
              of diamond  is expected to be significantly different from that of currently 
              practiced nanosecond or longer-pulsed laser ablation because of its  capability
              to provide extreme intensities and larger absorption  depth/thermal diffusion
              distance ratios.  Femtosecond lasers can  offer an entirely new spectrum of
              laser-diamond interactions that  can alter dynamics of ablation products
              (energy and mass  distribution), nature of particle emission (ionized, neutral,
              etc.)  and associated phenomena namely plasma formation and shock  propagation.
               Consequently, there will be a greater degree of  atomization of material to be
              removed, reduced thermal component  of ablation, absence of clusters and
              particulates on the machined  surfaced, and less probability for the
              transformation of diamond to  graphite.  Such effects ultimately lead the
              proposed machining  technique to be a high precision, contamination-free, time 
              efficient procedure for craggy CVD-diamond films that requires low  bulk
              temperature during machining.   It is anticipated that this novel laser
              processing scheme will not  only refine the existing laser-processing
              techniques but also  surpass all other diamond micromachining techniques and, 
              additionally, generate new applications in other areas of research  such as
              deposition of thin films.
