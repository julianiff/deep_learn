Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    9504402  Thevanayagam    The prime objectives of this workshop are
              to:  review  historical development; assess current state of practice;  discuss
              potential future innovative applications; and,  identify technology transfer
              opportunities and research  needs in order to accelerate and implement vacuum 
              consolidation technology in engineering practice in the  United States and
              abroad.  The results of the workshop will  significantly accelerate the rate at
              which this technology  is implemented in practice, bringing about a more rapid 
              realization of the productivity gains and reduced  environmental impacts
              offered by vacuum consolidation  technology.  Current challenges faced by port
              authorities in  the U.S. and abroad offer a test bed opportunity and will 
              enable preparation of successful feasibility pilot programs  to evaluate this
              technology under various site conditions.  It is anticipated that different
              design approaches could be  tested and shared with the participants of the
              workshop at a  later stage.  ***
