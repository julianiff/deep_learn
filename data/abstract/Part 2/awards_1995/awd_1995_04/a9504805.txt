Abstract    :
              Dr. Erik J. Sorensen  has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research   Fellowship
              in Chemistry.  Dr. Sorensen received his doctoral degree from   the University
              of California at San Diego under the supervision of   Professor K. C. Nicolaou.
               Dr. Sorensen will continue research at the   Sloan-Kettering Institute under
              the sponsorship of Professor Samuel   Danishefsky of Columbia University and
              the Sloan-Kettering Institute.    His postdoctoral research will target the
              total synthesis of biologically   active natural products; in particular, the
              solid phase synthesis of   oligosaccharides and glycopeptides.  Successful
              synthesis strategies   combined with mechanistic studies increase our
              understanding of issues   relevant to structural biology.  The Postdoctoral
              Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as   an important
              infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge   and experience of
              new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in   contemporary chemical
              research and teaching.
