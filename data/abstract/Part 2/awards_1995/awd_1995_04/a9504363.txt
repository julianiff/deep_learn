Abstract    :
                This research addresses issues of image registration, texture image 
              segmentation, and quantification of minor differences between  texture
              patterns, for example in medical images. The premise behind  the outlined
              algorithms is that 2-D image registration cannot  counteraffect 3-D positioning
              differences. The problem of precise  image registration is surmounted by
              comparing regions, in a manner  similar to analysis done by medical experts.
              The criteria for  region identification include location and intensity 
              characteristics. The selection procedure is divided into: (i)  selection of
              control points in two images (external markers and/or  selected internal points
              that have unique characteristics) to  determine locations of centers of regions
              to be compared, and (ii)  determination of region extent by image segmentation,
              thus ensuring  that the comparison is carried out between statistically 
              homogeneous regions. Hierarchical region splitting is proposed as  a means of
              achieving region size sensitive to subtle intensity  changes. Both intensity
              statistics and texture measurements are  included in region comparison
              procedure and decision making about  a region status.  The results of these
              basic investigations should  be valuable in attacking the problem of early
              breast cancer  detection based on comparison of different screenings of the
              same  patient.
