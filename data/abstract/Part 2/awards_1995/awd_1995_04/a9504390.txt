Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT  HUMPHREY  CTS-9504390  UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA    The flow through a
              helical coil has long been the principal paradigm for investigating
              laminarization phenomena. Placing a straight pipe downstream of a helical coil
              wherein the flow has been laminarized allows a well-posed investigation of
              retransition phenomena. This proposal seeks to investigate such a flow using
              laser-Doppler velocimery, to obtain the velocity data necessary for developing
              and testing, in parallel with the experiment, a direct numerical simulation
              approach aimed at predicting laminarization and retransition phenomena in
              general, and in coiled and straight pipes in particular. In many industrial
              chemical applications, the formation of hot spots inside reactors, and of
              polluting byproducts with their attendant negative environmental impact, is the
              outcome of non-uniform mixing. It is especially important to maintain good
              mixing, and to avoid the tendency towards laminarization which invariably
              arises in regions of reduced fluid motion. Hence, this study has the potential
              to aid in our understanding of mixing processes and ultimately in the control
              of such processes which would permit the reduction of unwanted side products.
