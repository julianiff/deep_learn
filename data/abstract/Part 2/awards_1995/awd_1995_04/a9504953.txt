              To: thaler@nsf.gov Subject: Re: Proposal DMS-9504953 Mime-Version: 1.0  Dear
              Dr. Thaler:        Thank you for your message concerning the partial funding of
              my  proposal  DMS-9504953.          Homotopy algorithms for solving sparse
              polynomial systems           Recently, it has been proved that modeling the
              sparse structure of a  polynomial system by its Newton polytopes leads to a
              major computational  breakthrough in solving polynomial systems by homotopy
              methods. The PI?s "random product homotopy" approach proposed in the project
              intends to construct a start system for the homotopy in random product form
              with its Newton polytopes  containing those of the target system. On the other
              hand, the "polyhedral  homotopy" based on an elegant formula for computing the
              mixed volume can find all zeros of a polynomial system by following much fewer,
              in most occasions  the exact amount of, homotopy curves.             Polynomial
              Systems occur everywhere in Mathematics, Science and  Technology. Very small
              systems are easily solved by hand, but larger systems cannot reliably be so
              solved, if at all. The project aims to implement a portable solver using the
              latest in polynomial system solving algorithms and  capable of being
              incorporated into applications programs. Research will be  carried out to
              advance the state of the art and our understanding of polynomial  systems;
              additionally, various application areas will be studied, such as  kinematics,
              control theory, geometric modelling, and biochemistry in  which problems
              reducible to polynomial system solving arise.
