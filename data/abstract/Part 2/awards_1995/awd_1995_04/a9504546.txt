Abstract    :
              9504546  Wheat            Cold sea water circulates deep into the ocean crust,
              is  heated, exchanges chemical constituents with the crust, and then  emerges
              as heated hydrothermal water.  This process has a  profound effect on the
              composition of the ocean crust and sea  water.  Presently much attention is
              focused on the hydrothermal  water exiting from hot vents at ridge crests, but
              a large  proportion of the water exits through sediments on the ridge  flanks. 
              The proponents argue that the physical, chemical, and  mineralogical
              characteristics of the ridge flank environment has  been characterized much
              better than the ridge crest environment  because the flanks are much more
              accessible by drilling than  ridge crests.  The research plan is to understand
              the fluid flow  up from basalt basement through the sediment by porous flow and
               diffusion, and to determine what are the chemical changes in the  fluid and
              the chemical and mineralogical changes in the  sediments.  This will be done as
              a pilot study with existing  computer models that will generate chemical
              profiles based on  boundary conditions of temperature, fluid flow, and initial 
              physical conditions of the sediment.  Results will be compared to  chemical
              profiles found in four sedimented areas.  ***
