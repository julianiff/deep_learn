Abstract    :
              9504537  Liverance    This award supports a 12-month Japan Society for the 
              Promotion of Science Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Eric  Liverance of the
              Mathematics Department at the University of  Southern California.  This
              fellowship opportunity will  enable Dr. Liverance to begin a collaborative
              research  effort with Dr. Tetsuji Shioda of the Mathematics Department  at
              Rikkyo University.  The investigators propose to study  possible applications
              of  Dr. Shioda's work on Mordell-Weil lattices of elliptic  surfaces. The main
              research question is he size of the  Galois representation associated to the
              Mordell-Weil  lattice,  and possible applications to elliptic curves.    As a
              postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Liverance will have the  opportunity to become
              familiar with research techniques and  methodology invented essentially
              single-handedly by Dr.  Shioda for the elliptic surfaces. Therefore, this
              proposal  fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and  transfer
              of scientific knowledge through an international  collaboration.  ***
