Abstract    :
              Simon  9504456     Two related topics of research are proposed: singularities of
              energy minimizing maps and curvature flows. Simon pioneered analytic techniques
              for studying the top-dimensional singular set of an energy minimizing map, for
              which he recently won the Bocher prize. In addition to continuing this research
              - which could lead to a resolution of the important conjecture asserting that
              minimizers of energy are stratified manifolds - several problems on curvature
              flows are proposed.    Proposed curvature flow problems model a wide range of
              phenomena, such as the dynamics of soap films, immiscible fluids and crystal
              growth, and lie in the area of nonlinear parabolic partial differential
              equations.
