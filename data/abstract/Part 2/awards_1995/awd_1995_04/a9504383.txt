Abstract    :
              9504383  Taylor  This project is on research to improve the bioremediation of 
              halogenated compounds by increasing the expression and activity  of the soluble
              methane monooxygenase (sMMO) enzyme in  methanotrophic bacteria.  The strategy
              is to culture wild-type  and mutant strains of bacteria in various copper,
              nitrogen, and  oxygen environments, while monitoring sMMO and nitrogenase 
              expression and activity.  The co-oxidation rates of a variety of  environmental
              pollutants will be quantified for selected strains,  with attention to the
              influence of nitrogen limitation.  These  pollutants include halogenated
              ethanes, halomethanes and selected  pesticides.  Finally, the expression and
              activity patterns will  be related to the environmental conditions by a model
              which will  be used to develop reactor designs.  ***
