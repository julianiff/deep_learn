Abstract    :
              9504441  Schoen     Several projects in the area of harmonic mappings and their
              applications, and the mathematical theory of general relativity are proposed.
              The proposer has recently investigated harmonic maps into non-locally compact
              spaces and found new applications of harmonic mapping theory. Schoen is also
              well-known for his proof with Yau of the positive mass conjecture in general
              relativity.    One of the proposed problems is the so called Penrose conjecture
              which has to do with the mass of a space-time with a black hole, and the
              proposed research seeks a rigorous mathematical resolution of this conjecture.
