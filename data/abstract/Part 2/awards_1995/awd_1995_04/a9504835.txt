Abstract    :
              9504835  Haas    This is an award to support research the objective of which is
              to  determine the efficacy of and optimal conditions for the use of a  process
              known as electroporation as a direct inactivating agent  or as a promoter of
              inactivation for microbial contaminants of  water.  The electroporation process
              as applied to inactivation of  microorganisms suspended in a fluid involves
              subjecting the  suspension to brief high-density voltage pulses produced by the
               decaying discharges from a resistance-capacitance electrical  circuit.  The
              investigator plans on conducting this research on a  laboratory scale using
              cysts of Giardia muris and oocysts of  Cryptosporidium parvum.  The
              investigator plans on studying the  effects of electroporation alone and as a
              potential promoter of  inactivation in the presence of other disinfectants such
              as  ozone, monochloramine and free chlorine.    Results of this research are
              expected to identify conditions  under which electroporation can be used alone
              as a process for  disinfection of water that has been contaminated by organisms
               exemplified by those to be studied in this project.  Positive  results in that
              respect would provide the basis for the potential  use of this process in
              environmental engineering practice with  special emphasis on disinfection of
              drinking water.  In addition,  results are expected to provide insights into
              the structure and  physiological properties of cysts and oocysts of potential
              use in  basic microbiological or medical research.
