              Aggressive Approaches to Sequential Design      Abstract:    This research is
              concerned with the design and analysis of sequential  designs for experiments. 
              Features of particular emphasis are i) obtaining  optimal designs and exact
              analyses through new computer algorithms and use  of high performance machines;
               ii) generating practical designs which protect  against problems such as
              selection bias or time trends;  iii) flexibility in  design, allowing
              researchers to realistically represent their goals and  resource constraints. 
              These techniques are applicable to a wide range of  applications, but
              particular attention will be paid to clinical trials,  and industrial testing
              (particularly in reliability testing, using sequential  approaches to reduce
              costs and/or time).  Both Bayesian and frequentist  models will be considered. 
                This research explores the design and analysis of sequential designs of 
              experiments, in which decisions adapt or change as information arising from 
              the experiment accrues.  Using new computer algorithms and high performance 
              computers, new designs  are developed for problems in areas such as clinical
              trials     and industrial testing .
