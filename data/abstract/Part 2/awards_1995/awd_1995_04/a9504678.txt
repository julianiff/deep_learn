Abstract    :
              Dr. Geoffrey W. Coates  has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research  
              Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Coates received his doctoral degree from  
              Stanford University under the supervision of Professor Robert Waymouth.    Dr.
              Coates will continue research at the California Institute of   Technology under
              the sponsorship of Professor Robert Grubbs.  His   postdoctoral research will
              target applications of chiral olefin   metathesis catalysts in organic
              chemistry.  In particular, he will   concentrate on the development of chiral
              ruthenium-based carbene   complexes and their application as catalysts for
              asymmetric synthesis.    The development of new organometallic reagents and
              catalysts is important   to the synthesis of new molecules of biological
              importance such as   optically active helical complexes.  The Postdoctoral
              Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as   an important
              infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge   and experience of
              new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in   contemporary chemical
              research and teaching.
