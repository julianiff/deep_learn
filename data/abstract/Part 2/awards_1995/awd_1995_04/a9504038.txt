Abstract    :
                The numerical solution of the large, sparse, symmetric   problem is required
              by many scientific and engineering   applications, such as  electronic
              structure calculations.  Iterative methods, the   only means of meeting  these
              demands, are faced with two challenges.  The first   involves degenerate or 
              pathologically close eigenvalues, and the second involves   matrices of very
              large  size that may not stored.  Parallel computing and   preconditioning are
              powerful  ways for improving the performance of iterative methods.    This
              proposal has  three major goals.  First, to extend the parallel  
              preconditioned eigenvalue methods that  are used in atomic structure
              calculations to the complex  molecular structure calculations in solid state
              physics.    Second, to extend the existing  eigenvalue codes to solve for large
              number of eigenvalues of  very large matrices.  Third, to explore further the  
              eigenvalue preconditioning,  with application to molecular structure matrices
              resulting   from finite  difference/element discretization techniques.   
              Preconditioning for large  matrices that cannot be stored are also being
              examined.    Finally, work on domain  decomposition preconditioners is
              continued on both the   application and on arbitrary matrices.  Domain
              partitioning   ideas is being tested  in combination with a coarse solve
              correction on a properly   chosen small system.  The aggregation/disaggregation
              technique is being   investigated for creating the small system.
