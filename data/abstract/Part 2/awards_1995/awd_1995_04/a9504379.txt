              Title:   Statistical Theory and Methodology'      ABSTRACT:               The 
              main research areas  investigated under this award  include:   (1) Exact
              methods for large, sparse contingency tables based  on Markov Chain Monte Carlo
              techniques; (2) Improvements on the  accuracy  of classical normal and
              Edgeworth expansions, based on Stein's  method;  (3) The use of specially
              designed exponential families for  density estimation  and empirical Bayes
              situations; (4) The application of  bootstrap-based techniques  for confidence
              intervals, likelihood analysis, and  bias-correction; and (5)  Length and
              volume calculations based on Hotelling's tube formula  for routine  use in
              simultaneous testing situations.            The long-term goal of this research
              is  the development  of  promising theoretical ideas into methodologies of
              direct value to  applied  statisticians and their scientific clients. This form
              of  technology transfer  aims to take advantage of current developments in the
              range and  power of  new statistical methodology. The ideas here fall into the
              general  category  of "computer-intensive methods", which are methods that take
               advantage  of modern computer power to free statistical analysis from the 
              bounds of  classical mathematical tractability. The research does not banish 
              mathematics, but uses mathematics to produce statistical tools  that can work 
              automatically on a wide variety of problems. The  computer-intensive part 
              comes in at the level of the statistical consumer, where  computation is 
              substituted for the usual normal theory approximations and  routine but
              difficult  mathematical computations.
