Abstract    :
              9504941  Michael       Water is a minor constituent of the Earth's mantle but it
               has a strong effect on the melting of the mantle.  Cl is a trace  component in
              basalts but it appears to be added to magmas when  they are contaminated with
              old basalts that have been weathered  or by sediment.  Water and Cl have been
              measured previously in  oceanic basalts by Michael, and he now wants to analyze
              basalts  from the submerged parts of oceanic platforms that were formed by  the
              eruption above mantle hotspots.  This will be done to  determine if water is
              higher in hotspots as might be expected  from the excessive melting at
              hotspots, and to determine if Cl is  elevated in these basalts to determine if
              the basalts have  assimilated ocean crust or sediments.  These results will be 
              important for understanding the evolution and processes in the  Earth's mantle.
