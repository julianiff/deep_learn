Abstract    :
              Dr. Lisa F. Szczepura has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research   Fellowship
              in Chemistry.  Dr. Szczepura received her doctoral degree from   State
              University of New York at Buffalo under the supervision of   Professor Kenneth
              Takeuchi.  Dr. Szczepura will continue research at the   University of Illinois
              at Urbana-Champaign under the sponsorship of   Professor Thomas Rauchfuss.  Her
              postdoctoral research will target   transition metal cluster chemistry and the
              coordination chemistry of   sulfur.  She will investigate the
              hydrodesulfurization and hydrogenation   reactivity of Mo6S8L6 clusters, where
              L is a monodentate phosphine or   nitrogen donor ligand.  The work is important
              to the systematic   development of ligands for transition metal cluster
              complexes through the   application of Werner coordination chemistry
              principles.  The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is
              viewed as   an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the
              knowledge   and experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful
              careers in   contemporary chemical research and teaching.
