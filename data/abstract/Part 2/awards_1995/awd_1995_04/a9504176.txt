Abstract    :
              9504176  Wolpert     The investigator proposes to continue his investigations of
              the large eigenvalue asymptotics of hyperbolic Riemann surfaces. He proposes to
              consider the question of unique quantum ergodicity for the classical modular
              group, connections between spectral asymptotics and questions in number theory,
              and the geometry of the moduli space of real projective structures for a
              compact surface.    Riemann surfaces can be thought of as multi-sheeted covers
              of the plane; have interesting topological properties. In addition, Riemann
              surfaces play a crucial role in the study of complex-valued functions (the
              graph of a complex-valued function is a surface in a 4-dimensional space).
              Indeed they were originally constructed as natural domains for complex-valued
              functions.
