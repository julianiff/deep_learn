Abstract    :
              Klein  9504076  The object of this proposal is to apply Car-Parrinello ab initio
              molecular dynamics to proton conducting systems in which water predominately
              determines the protonic environment.  The focus of this research will be the
              development of new methodology in order to make ab initio simulations of large
              systems for long time scales feasible.  New multiple time scale techniques for
              Car-Parrinello calculations will be explored and implemented on scalable
              architecture machines as a means of simultaneously increasing both time scale
              and the system size. In addition, classical Car-Parrinello will be combined
              with centroid and staging path integral molecular dynamics methods in order to
              go beyond the approximation of classical nuclear dynamics and obtain
              semi-classical quantum dynamics of the diffusing proton on the ground state
              Born-Oppenheimer surface.
