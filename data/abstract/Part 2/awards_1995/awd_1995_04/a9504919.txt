Abstract    :
              9504919  Tahvildar-Zadeh     The proposed research is in the area of
              mathematical physics and deals specifically with regularity and stability
              theory of wave maps. Wave maps are a hyperbolic analogue of harmonic maps,
              where the domain is a Lorentzian manifold rather than a Riemannain manifold.
              When one considers the energy functional for maps from a Lorentzian manifold to
              a Riemannian manifold, the resulting Euler-Lagrange equations become hyperbolic
              - for maps between two Riemannian manifolds these equations are elliptic.   
              Wave maps are called sigma models by physicists, and they arise in modern
              physics in various guises. For example, Einstein's field equations can be
              reduced to sigma model equations. Not much general theory has been developed
              for wave maps thus far as hyperbolic partial differential equations are
              mathematically harder to deal with than the elliptic ones.
