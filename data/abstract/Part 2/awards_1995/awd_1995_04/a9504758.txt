Abstract    :
              9504758 Mason  Abstract      The investigator plans to study problems in three
              different areas. These are (1) universal results for the behavior of sums of
              independent random variables, (2) local empirical processes and (3) the fractal
              nature of empirical increments. Area (1) concerns the study of the law of the
              iterated logarithm for partial sums and their increments that hold under little
              or no assumptions. Area (2) involves the investigation of a new mathematical
              entity called the local empirical process, which is the random mechanism
              governing density estimators, regression function estimators and tail index
              estimators. Area (3) deals with the uncovering of the somewhat unexpected
              fractal nature of the increments of various random processes.   The proposed
              research is concerned with the study of the limit behavior of certain random
              processes and its applications. Very often a random process will exhibit stable
              properties as it is observed over a long period. The classical example is the
              random process of tossing a coin. If the coin is fair, the long time average
              number of heads will with certainty get arbitrarily close to 1/2. This fact is
              a special case of the law of large numbers. Statisticians take advantage of
              this law to construct estimators based on a large sample of data that are close
              with high probability to the population parameter of interest. The areas that
              will be investigated in this project should have a number of useful
              applications to the construction of such estimators.
