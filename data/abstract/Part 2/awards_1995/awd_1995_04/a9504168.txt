Abstract    :
                  The study will attempt to apply a new analytical technique, laser  ablation
              of solids coupled with mass spectroscopy to obtain high-  resolution chemical
              profiles of clam shells ans carbonate minerals  associated with venting to
              establish chemical composition changes  with time.  This should improve our
              knowledge of the temporal  changes in flow characteristics and will eventually
              help evaluate  the effect of fluid venting at convergent plate boundaries on
              the  general geochemical budget of the oceans.
