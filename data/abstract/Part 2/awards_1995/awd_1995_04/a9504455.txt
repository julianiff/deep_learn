Abstract    :
              9504455  Oh     The proposed research lies in the general area of symplectic
              topology and geometry. More specifically, the investigator proposes to study
              Floer cohomology and Lagrangian submanifolds. It is expected that such a study
              will lead to new techniques for Lagrangian embedding and immersion problems. In
              addition, the investigator proposes to consider curvature estimate problems for
              special Lagrangian submanifolds - this may have ramifications in minimal
              submanifold theory.    Symplectic geometry provides a rigorous mathematical
              setting for many problems in classical and quantum mechanics. Lagrangian
              submanifolds are fundamental objects - they are extremal objects in some sense
              - in symplectic geometry, Floer cohomology is a powerful topological tool for
              their study.
