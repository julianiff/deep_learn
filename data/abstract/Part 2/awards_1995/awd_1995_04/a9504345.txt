Abstract    :
              Comprehensive spectroscopic and electrochemical investigations of  the
              interfacial structure of metal electrodes and self assembled  monolayer (SAM)
              modified electrodes form the focus of this research  project.  In work
              supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  Program, surface Raman
              spectroscopy will be used to probe metal  electrodes in situ and emersed under
              potential control.  In  addition, ultra high vacuum methods will be used to
              prepare model  systems which mimic the behavior of these electrochemical 
              interfaces.  Surface Raman spectroscopy, as well as other surface 
              spectroscopic probes, will be used to characterize these model  systems.
              Electrode surfaces modified by organic overlayers will  also be probed using
              these methods.    A detailed understanding of the structure of electrochemical 
              interfaces is crucial to the design of many electrochemical systems  and
              sensors, ranging from fuel cells to environmental monitoring  devices.  The
              work supported here develops and applies methods for  the structural
              characterization of these interfaces to a range of  well controlled model
              systems.  The information gained from these  studies will be invaluable in a
              wide range of technological  applications of electrochemistry.
