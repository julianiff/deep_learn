Abstract    :
              This proposal will parallelize and apply a new and innovative method that was
              developed for the numerical simulation of 3D hydrodynamics and gravitational
              clustering in cosmology.  Our goal is to explain the formation of galaxies and
              large-scale structure in the universe by simulating the coupled effects of
              gravity, gas dynamics, and radiative transfer in an expanding cosmological
              universe.  A correct solution must resolve the multi-scale, nonlinear growth of
              gravitational instability, which leads to anisotropic gravitational collapse,
              highly supersonic motions, strong shocks, radiative cooling, and many orders of
              magnitude of density contrast.  The method is a merger of our substantially
              improved version of the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) Method, called
              Adaptive SPH, or ASPH, and the well-known Particle-Particle/Particle-Mesh(P
              DSG1 3M) gravitational N-body method, in a cosmologically expanding,
              matter-dominated Friedmann universe.  The ASPH method revolutionizes the
              standard SPH method by introducing new algorithms for time-and space-variable,
              anisotropic smoothing and for shock tracking to eliminate spurious heating due
              to artificial viscosity away from shocks.  The ASPH method has significantly
              increased the dynamical range that can be achieved by numerical hydrodynamical
              simulations, and is currently the best method to achieve the resolution
              required to study the problems mentioned above. This project will develop and
              apply a new parallel computer version of our existing algorithm, that will
              significantly reduce the CPU time per calculation.    DSG1
