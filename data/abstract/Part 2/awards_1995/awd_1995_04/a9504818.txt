Abstract    :
              9504818 Murty  This is a renewal of a project in which experimental and
              analytical procedures were developed for characterizing crystallographic
              textures and orientation distribution functions in hcp metals.  These
              techniques are now applied to a study of biaxial creep behavior in hcp metals
              (titanium, titanium-aluminum vanadium alloys, zirconium, and zirconium-niobium
              alloys) that have varied textures, microstructures and operating slip systems. 
              In addition transitional creep mechanisms from power-law to viscous creep and
              related effects of texture on these transitions are explored.   Deformation  is
              characterized by microstructural studies using scanning transmission electron
              microscopy and optical metallography slip trace analysis.  Emphasis is on the
              effects of grain-shape anisotropy and texture on anisotropic biaxial creep and
              transitions occurring under biaxial loading. %%% This research addresses creep
              deformation mechanisms in metal alloys used at elevated temperatures.  Improved
              understanding of these mechanisms allows improvements in design and component
              lifetimes. ***
