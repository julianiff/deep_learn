Abstract    :
              9504908  Poon     The proposed research deals with smooth 4-manifolds and
              complex algebraic surfaces. The investigator will use twistor theory to tackle
              various problems in smooth 4-manifold theory; algebraic surfaces of general
              type are to be considered as well. This latter project is a continuation of the
              Kadaira-Enriques program, where they give a coarse classification of
              (algebraic) complex  surfaces.    Smooth four-manifolds are generally
              considered to be the most difficult and interesting class of manifolds. For
              example, it is known that only in dimension 4 there exists an 'exotic' smooth
              structure. These manifolds also pertain to various models of the universe
              according to general relativity theory.
