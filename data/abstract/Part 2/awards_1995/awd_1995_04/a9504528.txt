Abstract    :
              Hamilton  9504528     The proposed research is in the area of nonlinear
              parabolic partial differential equations - for example, the heat equation -
              arising in differential geometry and the physical sciences. The proposer has
              previously obtained a number of results on the quantitative and qualitative
              aspects of the solutions to these parabolic differential equations; these
              results, in turn, led to applications in smooth manifold theory. In particular,
              the proposer's work on the diffeomorphism classification of four-manifolds with
              positive isotropic curvature is considered an important result in the field.   
              Applications of the proposed research in the physical sciences include movement
              of solid-liquid interfaces of materials, wear of material bodies under random
              impart, motion of lubricating fluids, and evolution of liquid crystals.
