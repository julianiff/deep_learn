Abstract    :
              9504249  Goodey     The proposed research lies in the area of geometric
              convexity theory. In particular, the proposer wants to study projection
              functions for centrally symmetric convex bodies using the Radon transform
              techniques.    The projection functions are objects of importance in stereology
              and tomography. In particular, they are used in the X-ray problem where the
              researchers seek to find efficient algorithms to reconstruct convex bodies from
              their X-ray images.
