Abstract    :
              This project involves the study of polarized electron  collisions with chiral
              molecules, metastable states of noble  gas targets, and ground-state targets of
              the same atoms.  The proposed experiments will address basic physics  questions
              about the dynamics of  electron-molecule and  electron-atom scattering, and may
              provide the first  unambiguous evidence for an electron analog to the well- 
              known phenomena of optical activity.  Another aim of the  program is new,
              compact sources of polarized electron, a  "turnkey" source.
