Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT:      9504201        Serreze    Research supported by this grant is
              under the auspices of the   Arctic Systems Science (ARCSS) Global Change
              Research Program and   is jointly sponsored by the Division of Ocean Sciences
              and the   Office of Polar Programs.  Work to be performed represents prelim-  
              inary steps towards a major 5-year research project named SHEBA,   which is
              envisioned to study the heat budget of the Arctic Ocean   and its impact on
              global change.  The primary goals of SHEBA are:   (1) to develop, test and
              implement models of arctic ocean-   atmosphere-ice processes that demonstrably
              improve simulations of   the present day arctic climate, including its
              variability, using   General Circulation Models (GCMs), and (2) to improve the
              interpre- tation of satellite remote sensing data in the Arctic for analysis  
              of the arctic climate system and provide reliable data for model   input, model
              validation and climate monitoring.     In order to place the field experiment
              phase of SHEBA at the best location, the climatological regime of the proposed
              site must be analyzed.  Researchers at the University of Colorado will compile
              existing data on sea ice and atmospheric conditions in the region and publish
              the results on CD ROM about one year before final planning of the site
              location.  Other researchers in the SHEBA project are expected to use the data
              to plan individual experiments on heat budget measurements.  ??
