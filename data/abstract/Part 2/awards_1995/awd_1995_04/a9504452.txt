Abstract    :
              9504452  Webster     The proposed research is in the area of several complex
              variables; more specifically, it deals with real submanifolds of complex
              manifolds. Two topics are emphasized in the proposal: the investigator
              introduces a concept of double-valued-reflection in an effort to understand
              real algebraic curves sitting inside complex algebraic curves (thus the notion
              of double-valued-reflection generalizes that of conjugation); the embedding
              problem of abstract Cauchy-Riemann structures is to be pursued further,
              focusing on finding those properties shared between embeddable and
              non-embeddable Cauchy-Riemann structures.    The study of Cauchy-Riemann
              structures can be thought of as an attempt to understand certain real surfaces
              sitting inside complex spaces; emphasizes the interplay between real and
              complex geometries. The upshot is that to understand a real object better it is
              often necessary to introduce complex variables.
