              State University  Title:  Conference on Statistical Challenges in Modern
              Astronomy II           2.  Abstract for the project.            This award will
              support a cross-disciplinary conference on statistics and astronomy.          
              In recent years, astronomers have shown considerable          interest in
              applying advanced statistical techniques such as          errors-in-variables
              regression models for measurement error          problems, survival analysis
              for surveys with nondetections, and          clustering algorithms for galaxy
              distri`utions.  Communication          between the two communities was elevated
              by the successful          cross-disciplinary conference organized by Babu and
              Feigelson in          August 1991, the first such meeting in the U.S.  Since
              then,          interest on methodological issues has grown among astronomers,  
                     with nearly 200 papers published annually in the astronomical         
              literature on statistical issues.  The proposed conference will         
              feature lectures by distinguished statisticians on advanced          methods
              applicable to astronomical research.            The proposed conference seeks
              to bridge the gap between the          communities of astronomers and
              statisticians, exposing          researchers and students to issues of common
              interest.  The          sessions will begin with an invited lecture by a
              statistician          describing important new developments relevant to a class
              of          astronomical problems.  Applications and suggestions to tune the   
                    methods for the needs of the astronomy community will be         
              discussed by astronomers.  Specific data analysis problems and          methods
              will then be addressed in contributed presentations.          There is
              considerable opportunity for young researchers in both          fields to
              pursue methodological problems encountered in modern          astronomy.
