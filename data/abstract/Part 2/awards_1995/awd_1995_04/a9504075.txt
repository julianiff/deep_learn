Abstract    :
              9504075  Oden  The almost simultaneous development, over the last decade, of hp
              adaptive finite elements and multi-processor computing as means of dramatically
              improving fluid flow simulations makes the possibility of combining them very
              intriguing.  The potential payoffs are very high but there are many challenges
              before such a combination can be achieved.  Promising new developments in data
              structures, adaptive strategies, problem decomposition and robust parallel
              equation solvers, albeit in the context of model elliptic problems, make this
              problem tractable.  In this project an attempt will be made to extend most of
              these developments onto solving complex three dimensional viscous
              incompressible flows. In particular this project will develop a new hp adaptive
              finite element code built on top of an extendable hash table based data
              structure and equipped with sophisticated a posteriori error estimators,
              adaptive strategies for generating optimal meshes, and customized
              preconditioned conjugate gradient type parallel equation solvers.
