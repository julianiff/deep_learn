Abstract    :
                 9522566 Badzian  This research project aims for fundamental understanding of
              diamond films formed by chemical vapor depostion(CVD), and approaches this goal
              through the hypothesis that defects in CVD diamond may be due to stacking
              faults within sp3-bonded carbon rather than arising from sp2 hybridization. 
              Studies will be conducted to determine the atomic structure of tetrahedral
              forms of carbon, different than cubic and hexagonal, using microwave plasma
              chemical vapor deposition.  Additives to the methane-hydrogen plasma, such as
              B, N, O, Si, Ni, Ti, will be used to influence reaction pathways on the growing
              diamond surface, and to modify the crystalline structure during growth.  Atomic
              resolution structure of diamond surfaces will be studied by scanning tunneling
              microscopy, reflection high and low energy electron diffraction; other
              materials characterization techniques include Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffuse
              scattering, photoluminescence, XPS and Auger spectroscopy.  Cold neutron depth
              profiling will be done in collaboration with NIST. %%% This project will  be
              important to the utilization of the unique electronic, thermal, and mechanical
              properties of diamond films through improved basic understanding of their
              crystalline structure, and the relationships gained between structure,
              properties, and processing.  An important feature of the program is the
              training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area.
