Abstract    :
              9504297  Daskalopoulos     The proposed research lies in the general area of
              mathematical physics; more specifically, gauge theory. The investigator seeks
              to gain a better understanding of moduli spaces of vector bundles arising as
              spaces of solutions to certain problems in theoretical physics and algebraic
              geometry. Analytic methods such as CR-manifold techniques are to be used to
              investigate these moduli spaces and their invariants. It is possible that the
              proposed research will shed light on the relationship between Donaldson and
              Seiberg-Witten theories.    In recent years several unexpected connections
              between theoretical physics (quantum field theories) and various parts of
              mathematics (differential topology, and algebraic and differential geometry)
              have been discovered. Gauge theory began as an attempt to give a unified
              theoretical framework for describing the four basic forces of nature, and has
              found many surprising applications in pure mathematics.
