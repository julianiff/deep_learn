Abstract    :
              P.I.  Plante, Craig J.    Proposal #:  9504505      PROJECT ABSTRACT      
              Bacteria serve dual roles in sedimentary systems: as mineralizers of organic
              detritus and as food for protozoans and invertebrates.  The biomass,
              production, and community composition of bacteria contribute to the character
              of these roles.  The primary objective of the research is to assess the
              importance of deposit-feeder ingestion to both qualitative and quantitative
              aspects of sedimentary bacterial communities.  The principal animal selected
              for intensive study is the deposit-feeding polychaete, Arencola marina.  Other
              polychaetes (Amphitrite johnstoni and Clymenella torquata), hemichordates
              (Stereobalanus canadensis and Saccoglossus kowlevskyi), an apodous holothuroid
              (Caudina arenata), and a bivalve mollusc (Macoma balthica) will be investigated
              for interspecific comparisons.  The mechanisms of lysis, keying on digestive
              surfactants, will be determined.  In vitro work will examine 1) the digestive
              kinetics which affect interactions between surfactants and enzymes; 2) the rate
              and extent of bacterial digestion, 3) the influence of temperature and reactant
              concentrations on bacteriolysis, and 4) the effect of gut exposure time on
              digestive kinematics.  In vivo experiments with temperature and food quality
              will be employed to test predictions resulting from in vitro investigations..
