Abstract    :
              9504357  Ammar       The experimental High Energy Physics Group at the 
              University of Kansas plans to continue its studies of e+e  annihilations in the
              energy region the upsilon resonances  using the CLEO II detector and the CESR
              storage ring at  Cornell.  The topics to be studied include exclusive B  decays
              to charm, exclusive b->u transitions, charm meson and  baryon decays.  The
              group will take a lead role in providing  the monitor and control system for
              the upgraded CLEO III  detector to be completed in 1997.  ***
