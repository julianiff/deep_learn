Abstract    :
              9504177 Freidlin  Abstract  We study random perturbations of dynamical systems
              with conservation laws. The evolution of the first integral leads to a
              diffusion process on a graph corresponding to the first integral. This allows
              progress in a number of PDE problems with a small parameter. The
              two-dimensional Navier-Stocks equation with a large Reynolds number, for
              exampke, belongs to this class of problems. We study also large deviations for 
              the diffusion-transmutation processes. These results help to describe the
              asymptotic behavior of wave fronts and  other patterns in reaction-diffusion
              equations.   Mathematical models of real processes sometimes,turn out to be too
              complicated for analysis. But very often some of the parameters included in the
              model are small (or large) in comparison with the others. This allows us to
              simplify the model and often to obtain the solution in a form convenient for
              applications. We study small random perturbations of  dynamical systems, large
              scale approximation in reaction- diffusion models and other problems related to
              an interplay between random and deterministic factors.
