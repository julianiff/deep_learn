Abstract    :
              9504844  Madison       Theoretical calculations of excitation and ionization are
               undertaken for a number of effective one and two electron atoms.  The
              approaches range from the use of the distorted wave Born  approximation to
              direct time-dependent solutions of the  Schr dinger equation.  The results of
              these calculations are  important to further our understanding of the
              interaction of  charged particles with atoms and for a number of more applied 
              problems in gas discharges and plasma physics.  ***
