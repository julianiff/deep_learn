Abstract    :
              9504237  McLaughlin     The proposed research lies in the interface of
              differential topology and mathematical physics. More specifically, it deals
              with the so called Wess-Zumino-Witten vector bundle on Teichmuller space and is
              an attempt to give a rigorous formula for the projectively flat connection on
              this bundle.    In recent years several unexpected relations between topology
              and mathematical physics have been discovered. If completely successful, the
              proposed research - which is originally motivated by problems in quantum field
              theory -  will likely shed a new light on the study of 3-dimensional spaces and
              knot theory.
