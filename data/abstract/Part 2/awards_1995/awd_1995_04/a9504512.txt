Abstract    :
              Schlosser  9504512    The Maurice Ewing Symposium on pplications of trace 
              substance measurements to oceanographic problems will be  held in October 1995.
              The main goals of the Symposium are:  (1) to review the status of the tracer
              methodology  (technological advances and progress in applications), (2)  to
              evaluate the potential of the individual tracers for  regional and global
              studies of water mass formation and  circulation of the ocean, (3) to outline
              the role of tracers  in calibration of Global Circulation Models, and (4) to 
              outline strategies for the development of the tracer methods  in view of the
              structure of future ocean observing systems.  Resuls from the workshop will be
              published in a proceedings  volume.
