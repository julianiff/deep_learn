Abstract    :
              9504054  Poggio     The research project consists of three parts.  First, the
              investigator plans to sharpen the tools to analyze the sample complexity
              question -- how many examples does the learner need to generalize well?  This
              is related to the complexity of the model the learner is using to fit the data
              and generalize to unseen data.  Implications for model selection and data
              mining will be explored.    Second, it is proposed to develop active algorithms
              which choose their own examples.  This reduces the sample complexity of
              learning at the cost of an increased computational burden.  Access to high
              performance computing will help greatly.  Applications to function
              approximation, pattern classification and system identification will be
              explored.    Finally, the tools developed earlier will be applied to the domain
              of natural languages.  In particular, the sample complexity of learning grammar
              will be investigated.  At the same time the evolution of human languages can be
              modeled as a dynamical system.  This can be used as an evolutionary criterion
              to choose between different linguistic theories (models).  ***
