Abstract    :
              9504081  Monismith    This proposal will link hydrodynamics, the ecology and
              behavior of  siphonate benthic infauna, and phytoplankton dynamics.  The 
              ultimate objective is to quantitatively predict when phytoplankton  biomass can
              be controlled by these benthic organisms.  The research  will employ two
              closely related and complementary studies:  laboratory work with mechanical
              models of siphonate bivalves and  with live animals, and computational work
              using two coupled  hydrodynamic-phytoplankton codes.  The research will be
              supported  by field work carried out as part of the ongoing United States 
              Geological Survey studies of San Francisco Bay.  The laboratory  studies will
              invoke two elements: turbulent and scalar mixing over  a model bivalve bed and
              assessing the extent to which bivalve  behavior (feeding strategies and
              densities of feeding animals)  alters the results obtained with mechanical
              analogs.  The modeling  studies will include the application of two coupled
              hydrodynamic-  biological models to study the effects of vertical and
              horizontal  mixing on phytoplankton production and consumption in shallow 
              estuarine and coastal systems.
