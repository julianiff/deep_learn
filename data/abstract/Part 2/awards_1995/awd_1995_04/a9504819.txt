Abstract    :
              9504819  LaConti   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              proposes the development of a low-cost, efficient, stable composite anode steel
              electrode that will be especially useful in electrochemical processes where
              mild or strongly alkaline electrochemical media is present.   The focus of the
              research effort will be on improving the adiponitrile (ADN) process, which is
              used in nylon-66 commercial manufacture.  The present limitation that exists
              for commercial producers of ADN is corrosion of the mild steel anode.  In
              addition to selectivity and efficiency losses, anode corrosion causes the
              electrohydrodimerization (EHD) process to be periodically shut down to remove
              iron products from the system.  ADN producers consider minimizing anode
              corrosion to be the top priority for future EHD development.
