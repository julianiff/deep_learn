Abstract    :
              9504426  Ewen         This project connects Colorado Christian University to the
               Internet over a T1 (1.544 thousand bit per second) line.  Faculty  and
              students will benefit from access to the resources of the  Internet, including
              libraries and supercomputers.  In addition,  they will be able to communicate
              and collaborate with colleagues at  other institutions in pursuit of research
              and educational projects.    The award provides partial support of the project
              for two years.
