Abstract    :
              9504322  Damuth       Mass transport processes(slumps, slides and debris flows) 
              are now considered as important as turbidity currents in creating  deep-sea
              fans and their leveed channel systems.  However, areal  and volumetric
              distribution of mass-transported deposits remains  uncertain.  ODP Leg 155
              cored 7 sites on Amazon Fan.  These and  high amplitude reflection packages
              recovered from leveed channel  systems, as well as existing high-resolution
              seismic data will  provide the basis of the study to understand the role of
              mass  transport in the construction of deep sea fans.  ***
