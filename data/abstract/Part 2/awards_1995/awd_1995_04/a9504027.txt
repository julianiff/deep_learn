Abstract    :
              9504027  Bodily  This award supports an 18-month Science and Technology  agency
              of Japan Fellowship for Dr. Jyi-Perng Wann at the  National Institute of
              Resources and Environment (NIRE). He  will collaborate with Drs. Yoshiki  Sato,
              Tohru Kamo, and S.  Futamura of the Hydrocarbon Research Laboratory of NIRE. 
              Professor David Bodily of the Chemical and Fuels Engineering  Department,
              University of Utah will also participate in the  project.    The research is
              aimed at improvements in the recovery of  polymers and monomers from mixed
              waste plastics by selective  solvent dissolution and depolymerization at
              low-severity  conditions. Hilderbrand's regular solution theory will be  used
              to select solvents for the dissolution of waste plastic  mixtures. The mixtures
              are difficult to separate by physical  processes, and contamination by plastics
              such as polyvinyl  chloride creates conversion and disposal problems. Processes
               such as incineration and pyrolysis cause potential air  pollution problems and
              low recovery of the energy contents  of the plastics. The combined liquid-phase
              process has the  potential to recover high yields of high-quality materials 
              from plastics. Chemical characterization of the recovered  products will
              provide for determination of the composition  of reaction products, aid in the
              selection optimal reaction  conditions, provide information for the
              understanding of  reaction mechanism, and verify the effectiveness of the 
              propose recovery scheme.  ***
