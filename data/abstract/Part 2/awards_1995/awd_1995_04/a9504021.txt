Abstract    :
              9504021  Miller         Oregon State University will undertake an ocean sciences
               instrumentation development project to develop and test a new   high-capacity,
              hoseless zooplankton collecting pump system for use  at sea.  The pumping
              system (to be named MEGAPUMP) is designed to  address several shortcomings with
              existing pumping systems.  The  unit will consist of an underwater pump mounted
              on a carousel  collection unit.  The pump will be front mounted with a short 
              manifold that serves 10 rotating filter collection tubes.  A  stepping motor
              will be used to "select" the next filter by remote  actuation.  The overall
              configuration will be mounted in a steel  cage to prevent mechanical damage
              during deployment.  Power supply  to the MEGA will be via the suspension cable.
               Environmental  sensors to be attached to the pump include a magnetic flow
              meter  and a CTD for measuring conductivity, temperature and depth.  The  MEGA
              will facilitate zooplankton sampling with greater spatial  resolution and depth
              capacity than previous systems.  The samples  obtained using this system will
              allow for a greater understanding  of microstructure aggregation of zooplankton
              through high  resolution sampling.  This new capability will be important for 
              current and future investigations involving oceanic zooplankton.
