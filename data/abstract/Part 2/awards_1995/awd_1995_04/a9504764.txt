Abstract    :
              9504764  Goldman     The proposal deals with various classical geometries and
              their discrete automorphism groups: complex hyperbolic geometry, spherical
              Cauchy-Riemann geometry, flat Lorentzian geometry, conformal geometry and real
              projective geometry are to be studied. These geometries are all generalizations
              of the geometry of the hyperbolic plane, yet they lack totally geodesic
              hypersurfaces making it difficult to build fundamental polyhedra - one can
              construct discrete automorphism groups directly from fundamental polyhedra. A
              related topic dealing with representation spaces of surface groups is also
              contained in the proposal: these spaces can be identified with moduli spaces of
              holomorphic vector bundles over Riemann surfaces, hence have ramifications in
              algebraic geometry and mathematical physics.    Hyperbolic geometry is the
              oldest known non-Euclidean geometry, and possesses many interesting properties
              not encountered in Euclidean geometry. Discrete automorphism groups are closely
              related to regular polyhedra, and finding them in a non-Euclidean geometry can
              often be difficult. Collections of these groups are also related to certain
              gauge theories arising in mathematical physics.
