Abstract    :
              9504900  Pardon       This project will attempt to define characteristic classes
              and  then prove (by the heat equation method) a Riemann-Roch theorem for  the
              moduli space of rank-two, degree-zero vector bundles on a  Riemann surface.  It
              will also attempt to find an analytic  understanding of the difference between
              Neumann and Dirichlet  boundary conditions for differential forms on the smooth
              part of a  complex projective variety.  Finally, it is planned that prior 
              results of the investigator and Mark Stern concerning pure Hodge  structures on
              the intersection cohomology of a projective variety  will be extended without
              recourse to the theory of D-modules.       There are many quantitative
              approaches to the study of curved  objects, parts of which are not smooth or
              even, but instead have  corners or cusps.  (Imagine a crumpled piece of metal.)
               For  instance, one may ask how these cusps affect the diffusion of heat 
              within the object; or, conversely, whether observed properties of  the
              diffusion determine the nature of the cusps.  For very  complicated smooth
              objects (even those of more than three  dimensions), the effect of the
              curvature of the object on heat  diffusion within it is fairly well understood.
               One goal of this  project is to extend to objects with cusps, the known
              analysis of  heat diffusion in smooth objects.  ***
