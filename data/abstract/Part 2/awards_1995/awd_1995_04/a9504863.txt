Abstract    :
              Young  9504863     The proposed research has to do with dynamical systems using
              probabilistic methods. More specifically, the investigator plans to study the
              statistical properties of chaotic dynamical systems; to develop criteria for
              the existence of natural invariant measures in nonuniform hyperbolic settings
              and find mechanisms that lead to exponential mixing properties.    Dynamical
              systems theory is the qualitative study of (autonomous) systems of ordinary
              differential equations. These systems model various natural phenomena such as
              turbulence, fluid flows, and ecological systems. Although relatively simple
              locally, the global picture of a dynamical system over time can be extremely
              complicated and chaotic; dynamical systems theory seeks to understand this
              global long time behavior in a systematic and rigorous fashion.
