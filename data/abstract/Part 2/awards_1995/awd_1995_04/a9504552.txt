Abstract    :
              9504552  Barrall      This award is under the International Junior Investigator 
              and Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which enables U.S.  scientists and engineers
              to conduct three to twenty-four  months of research abroad at research centers
              of proven  excellence. The program's awards provide opportunities for  joint
              research, and the use of unique or complementary  facilities, expertise and
              experimental conditions abroad.  Financial support for this award is from the
              U.S.-New  Zealand Program.    This award will support a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Geoffrey A. Barrall to go to Palmerston,
              North,  New Zealand to work with Dr. Paul Callaghan of Massey  University.   
              This research will focus on the development and use of  pulsed gradient spin
              echo (PGSE) nuclear magnetic resonance  (NMR) techniques to study the
              translational dynamics of high  molecular weight polymers in flowing and
              non-flowing  systems.  The primary goal of these studies is to test the 
              predictions of present polymer dynamics theories using new  experimental
              information provided by NMR techniques.  This  research will have great
              applicability to engineering  processes used by the American plastics
              industries. ***
