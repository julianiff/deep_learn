Abstract    :
              9504605  Barden  The five Tribally-Controlled Community Colleges in North Dakota
              -  Ft. Berthold Community College, Little Hoop Community College,  United
              Tribes Technical College - are seeking to connect to the  NSFNET.  These two
              year colleges are located in remote areas of  North Dakota.  These are all
              relatively small and offer a complete  range of course selections including
              transfer curricula, para-  professional, and pre-engineering.    Each campus
              includes use of the state's On-line Dakota Information  Network and other
              library resources to improve student ability to  deal with information.  This
              is a particularly important task given  the isolation of Indian reservations
              and their need for  information.  The colleges will work with North Dakota's 
              sophisticated, higher education network to accomplish the  connection.  The
              North Dakota Information Network will provide  technical assistance and will
              provide the gateway service.    Each college will begin their work toward
              connection by installing  appropriate local area networks.  Then training in
              the use of the  connection will be accomplished with the help of Electronic 
              Pathways, an organization devoted to helping Indians connect to the  Internet.
