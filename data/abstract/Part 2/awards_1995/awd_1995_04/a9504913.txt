Abstract    :
              9504913  Calabi     The proposed research involves various aspects of
              differential geometry and differential topology: variational problems in
              surface theory, knot theory in the presence of curvature, topological
              classification of representations, homology manifolds, Einstein metrics on
              homogeneous spaces, equivariant K-theory, and Poisson manifolds are among the
              topics proposed.    Differential geometry studies shapes in space keeping in
              mind their distance and curvature properties; differential topology
              concentrates on relative positions in space whilst ignoring distance or
              curvature. This group proposal then seeks to establish a connection between
              these two areas of research by asking such questions as how the topology of a
              space determines its geometry.
