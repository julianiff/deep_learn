Abstract    :
                  9504144  Knauss  This project will study the nonlinear time-dependent
              constitutive  behavior of structural polymers.  It is a particular emphasis to 
              elucidate the role of dilatation on the time dependent mechanical  behavior and
              to provide a framework for time dependent polymer  fracture.  The study centers
              on the small volume changes that occur  in the time dependent material
              behavior.  Preliminary torsion tests  have showl that the volume changes occur
              in such tests of polymers.  ***
