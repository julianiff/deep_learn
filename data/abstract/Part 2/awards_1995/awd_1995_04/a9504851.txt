Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in support of
              NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be used aboard the R/V EWING, a 239
              foot vessel, which is owned and operated by the Observatory.  Instrumentation
              funded includes a high resolution sound sources system, a magnetometer cable,
              and electronic test equipment for the technician group.    ??
