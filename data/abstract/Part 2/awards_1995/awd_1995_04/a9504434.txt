Abstract    :
              9504434  This project will obtain a series of upper ocean current  profiles from
              the acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP)  permanently mounted on the hull
              of the German icebreaking  research ship Polarstern.  The data will be obtained
              from  the Eurasian Basin of the Arctic Ocean in the summer of  1995.    The
              project has two specific objectives:  to measure the  spatial distribution of
              the background and the internal  wave shear with sufficient horizontal coverage
              to identify  possible sources and dissipation regions for internal wave 
              energy, and to document the distribution of Atlantic  Intermediate Water within
              the Eurasian Basin and modified  surface water on the arctic continental shelf.
                 The resulting information will allow a substantial  improvement in our
              understanding of how internal waves,  through shear-induced turbulence, affect
              the arctic oceanic  heat budget.  A better understanding of the circulation 
              processes in the eastern Arctic Ocean will clarify  interactions between the
              oceanic and the global climate,  and provide information required to
              parameterize and to  tune global circulation models currently being used to 
              study climate change.  ***
