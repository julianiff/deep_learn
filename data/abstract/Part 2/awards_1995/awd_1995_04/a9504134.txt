Abstract    :
              9504134  Millson     The proposed research lies in the interface of topology and
              geometry. Working on the classical problem of classifying linkages in space,
              the investigator has found connections to representation theory and algebraic
              geometry. To be more specific, the proposed research seeks to develop parallels
              between the singularities in the representation varieties of Coxeter groups and
              the singularities in the deformation spaces of linkages.    A linkage in space
              can model a robot arm and other rigid structures with joints; a topological
              classification of possible linkages in space may turn out to have ramifications
              in control theory and robotics.
