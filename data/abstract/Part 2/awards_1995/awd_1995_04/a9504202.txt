Abstract    :
              9504202  MURRAY    Measurements will be made of particulate carbon export
              production  in the western equatorial Pacific at the equator and 165 degree E 
              and the zonal gradient at the equator from drifting sediment trap  samples.
              Comparison of this particulate flux with 15N-NO3 new  production measurements
              will also enable estimates of potential  carbon export as DOC. Participation in
              two cruises will determine  the El Nino/non-El Nino variability and make a more
              accurate  estimate of total export production from the equatorial Pacific.  
              Both cruises are in collaboration with ORSTOM Noumea French  scientists.  The
              first cruise will be conducted on the French R/V  Atalante in October
              1994-1996. These cruises will be part of the  graduate research of Mr. John
              Dunne.
