Abstract    :
              EAR-9504814  Clark, Jordan F.    The Fellow proposes to investigate the
              variability of vertical mixing and quantify the amount of exchange between the
              surface and deep layers of two lakes.  The goal is to identify the dominant
              sources of vertical mixing and the temporal and spatial time scales of these
              events.  Vertical mixing is known to influence lake biology and chemistry with
              a time scale of minutes to days.  The mechanism, spatial distribution of
              mixing, and the amount  of exchange between the surface and deep layers are
              more difficult to quantify, yet are equally important in understanding lake
              dynamics.  These factors will be assessed by first establishing the physical
              setting (solar radiation, wind speed, air and surface water temperatures,
              humidity, and water column temperature gradients) and then introducing a
              gaseous tracer (sulfur hexafluoride) to quantify exchange between surface and
              deep water layers.
