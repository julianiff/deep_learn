Abstract    :
              9504167  Hanan       Hanan is the PI on this request for 12 months of support
              for  each of two years for postdoctoral Magenheim to prefect the  technique of
              measuring chlorine isotopes in basalts.  With this  technique Magenheim will
              determine the effects of assimilation of  oceanic crust on chlorine isotopes
              and evaluate the contribution  of hotspots in chlorine isotopes in MORBs.  This
              may be useful in  determining the amount of crust that has been recycled into
              the  mantle.  It could also be used to determine what part of the  subducted
              crust is returned to the surface in back-arc volcanism.  This is an emerging
              technique that Magenheim was instrumental in  developing and which has great
              potential for telling us about  major geological processes.  This project is
              part of the RIDGE  initiative (Ridge Interdisciplinary Global Experiment).  ***
