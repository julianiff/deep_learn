Abstract    :
              9504158  Lubin    Research supported by this grant is under the auspices of the 
              Arctic Systems Science (ARCSS) Global  Change Research Program and  is jointly
              sponsored by the Division of Ocean Sciences and the  Office of Polar Programs. 
              Work to be performed represents preliminary steps towards a major 5-year
              research project named SHEBA, which is envisioned to study the heat budget of
              the Arctic Ocean  and its impact on global change.  The primary goals of SHEBA
              are:  (1) to develop, test and implement models of arctic ocean- atmosphere-ice
              processes that demonstrably improve simulations of  the present day arctic
              climate, including its variability, using  General Circulation Models (GCMs),
              and (2) to improve the interpretation of satellite remote sensing data in the
              Arctic for analysis  of the arctic climate system and provide reliable data for
              model  input, model validation and climate monitoring.     This work involves
              development of new technology for solar infrared  flux measurements at the
              Arctic Ocean surface.  Efforts will also  be made to develop an all season
              algorithm to retrieve total and  multi-year sea ice concentrations from SSM/I
              85.5 Ghz imagery from  satellites and conduct a validation of polar cloud
              detection  principles, using AVHRR data matched with surface all-sky
              photography and sea ice  coverage logs.  This proposal focuses on  SHEBA PHASE
              I technological development and analysis of existing  data sets.
