Abstract    :
                Professor Hill proposes to continue to develop the Bayesian theory of
              probability of B. de Finetti and L. J. Savage with respect to foundational
              issues that have important implications for applications of Bayesian inference
              and decision theory, and to continue the development of such applications as
              have been initiated by him.   These center about the Bayesian nonparametric
              procedures A(n) and H(n) of Hill (1968, 1988b, 1993a), and the tail-index
              estimator of Hill (1975).  For any epsilon > 0, it is proposed to constuct
              explicit exchangeable processes in a finite model, that satisfy the A(n) and
              H(n) assumptions exactly, apart from a set of observational values with
              probability at most epsilon.  It is also proposed to extend the Bayesian
              methods of forecasting of Hill (1993c, 1993d) using the theory of generalized
              urn processes of Hill, Lane, Sudderth (1980, 1987) and the splitting process
              models of Hill (1993a).       Professor Hill proposes to continue to develop
              the Bayesian theory of probability of B. de Finetti and L. J. Savage with
              respect to foundational issues that have important implications for
              applications of Bayesian inference and decision theory, and to continue the
              development of such applications as have been initiated by him.   These center
              about the Bayesian nonparametric procedures, A(n) and H(n) of Hill (1968,
              1988b, 1993a) and the tail-index estimator of Hill (1975).   It is also
              proposed to extend the methods of forecasting of Hill (1993c, 1993d) using the
              theory of generalized urn processes of Hill, Lane, Sudderth (1980, 1987) and
              the splitting process models of Hill (1993a).  These methods make use of the
              Bayesian theory of optimal decision-making for the purpose of predicting time
              series that arise in business, economics, and  engineering.
