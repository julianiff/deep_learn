Abstract    :
              9504240  Escobar    This Americas Program award will support travel and related 
              expenses to 11 U.S. scientists to participate in a joint  U.S.-Colombia summer
              school in differential geometry,  partial differential equations and numerical
              analysis.  Organizers are Dr. Jose Escobar,  Cornell University, and  Dr. Jaime
              Lesmes, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota and will  take place in Bogota,
              Colombia, in June, 1995..  The school  will offer graduate courses at various
              levels, lectures for  a general audience, and lectures at the research level.  
               The group of lecturers are considered as top U.S. and Latin  American
              mathematicians, and their interaction in this  project will lead to  important
              research collaborations in  this field in the future.  *** .
