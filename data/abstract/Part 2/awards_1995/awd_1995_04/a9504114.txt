Abstract    :
              9504114  Wilkes  This dissertation enhancement award supports a 6-month research
              visit in Japan for  Andrew Stachyra, a graduate student in the Department of
              Physics at the University  of Washington, who works under the direction of
              Professor R. J. Wilkes.  Mr.  Stachyra will divide his time among three
              different research sites over the course  of his six month stay in Japan,
              during which he will be sponsored by the Professor  Yoji Totsuka, the head of
              the Super-Kamiokande Group at the Institute for Cosmic  Ray Research (ICRR) in
              Tokyo.  Super-Kamiokande is a water Cherenkov detector  to be located in the
              Kamioka Mozumi mine in Japan.  Super Kamiokande is  expected to provide new
              information that will be useful in the study of neutrino  oscillations, in
              solar modeling, in supernova modeling, and in setting new limits on  nucleon
              decay partial lifetimes. Mr. Stachyra will spend approximately one month  at
              the ICRR learning how the Japanese data acquisition equipment works, two 
              months at the KEK particle accelerator learning about and contributing to 
              calibration experiments being conducted with a smaller Cherenkov detector
              there,  and about three months will be spent at the mine site learning the
              details of detector  construction before data taking begins in April of 1996. 
              Mr. Stachyra will learn the  Japanese style for constructing electronics for
              high energy physics experiments and  will be able to compare the Japanese
              system with the U.S. system.  He will be able  to compare the advantages and
              drawbacks of both systems and learn when one is  preferred over the other.  ***
