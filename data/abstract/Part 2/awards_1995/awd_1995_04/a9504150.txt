Abstract    :
                To achieve maximum benefit from tiling, compiler  optimization  must exercise
              more control over data movement and storage  assignments than is commonly done.
               Hierarchical tiling takes  responsibility  for several phases of compilation
              and code  improvements that are traditionally  done separately, such as  scalar
              replacement, register allocation, generating  message  passing calls, and
              storage mapping. It uses the mechanisms of  explicitly naming and copying data
              to control the movement of  data up and down  the memory hierarchy and to
              exploit all levels  of parallelism. Its  effectiveness as a systematic
              framework for  hand-crafting highly optimized code  has been tested on
              scientific  applications for IBM SP1 system. This project  will extend the 
              research in compiler optimizations by investigating the  following:   (1)
              Develop a parameterized machine model that captures the  architectural
              information needed to guide hierarchical tiling.   (2) Study  interactions
              between tiling at various levels of  granularity.   (3)  Incorporate
              hierarchical tiling into the SUIF toolset.    (4) Extend the work to  disk
              storage, explicit I/O and implicit  paging virtual memories.    (5)  Validate
              the approach using various programs on different  parallel machines.
