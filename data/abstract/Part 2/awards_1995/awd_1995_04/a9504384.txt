Abstract    :
              9504384  Mentz  The Marine Board of the National  Research Council's (NRC)
              Commission  on Engineering and Technical  Systems serves the national  interest
              by providing, as a result  of requests from sponsoring  agencies, or on its own
              initiative,  evaluations and advice concerning  ocean developments and uses and
              the  nation's ability to meet its marine  and maritime goals.  The Board 
              considers questions of the relation  of engineering and technology to  coastal
              and offshore resource  development and operations; to  navigation and the
              commerce of the  sea, waterways, and ports; to  related human resources and
              onshore  activities; and their relation to  the establishment and 
              implementation of public policies.  The Board identifies opportunities  and
              needs for new technologies and  other developments and recommends  appropriate
              actions.  It stimulates  the exchange of information and  cooperative
              activities, and  provides a forum for the national  and international
              professional  community.    The activities through which the  Board
              accomplishes its program are:  (1) assessments of the technical  capability to
              undertake and manage  offshore and maritime developments  and uses, including
              the adequacy of  knowledge to support technology  development; (2) evaluations
              of  safety of personnel and of the  environment; (3) assistance in the 
              preparation and assessment of the  government's program directed to  ocean and
              maritime developments and  uses; and (4) identification of  future
              opportunities for the  integration of advanced technology  into marine and
              maritime systems  and the influence of technical  advances on the establishment
              and  implementation of public policy.  ***
