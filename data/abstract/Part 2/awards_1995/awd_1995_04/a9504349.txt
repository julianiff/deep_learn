Abstract    :
               This project is for research in computational logic.    The areas of  research
              stem directly from prior analysis of the structure   formulas in negation
              normal form.  That work raised many   questions and  led to explorations in
              several directions.  Substantial   results at the propositional level,
              preliminary experimental   at the first order level, and certain theoretical
              results   that the most important of these may be path dissolution, a   rule of
               inference that is strongly complete at the ground level.    This project 
              continues exploration of this and related inference   mechanisms,  largely
              through experimentation.  One major thrust is to further the implementation of
              the  techniques developed earlier.  The current first order system 
              (``Dissolver'') is a solid platform on which the following   techniques   may
              be tested:  link selection; computing prime implicants;  backtracking; theory
              links and dissolution; and star chains.  While abstract proof-theoretic
              questions are of interest in   their own  right, enhancing the performance of
              Dissolver is an important  motivation for the theoretical work in this project.
               The   investigations into multiple-valued logics largely fit the   category; 
              the study of the following issues  contributes to the development of Dissolver:
               dissolution and  multiple-valued logics; dissolution, analytic tableaux, and  
              distributive law; quantifier duplication, proof length, and   cycles; 
              algorithms for computing prime implicants; and induction and   equality.
