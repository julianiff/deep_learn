Abstract    :
               Two software systems, RRL (the Rewrite Rule Laboratory)   SATO (SAtisfiability
              Test Optimized), developed under the    past grant, have been  successfully
              used for solving many  problems often considered   a challenge for  automated
              theorem  provers, including several dozens of open   problems in  quasigroups. 
              The current research will further increase the    reasoning power of  RRL and
              SATO.  The objectives of this  research are to   develop new high  performance
              reasoning  algorithms, and to apply these   algorithms in  specification  and
              verification of hardware and software, and   in solving  open  problems in
              algebra, logic and combinatorics. The  research   focuses on  constraint
              satisfaction and automated  mathematical   induction.  The topics  include
              efficient  constraint propagation, parallel and   distributed reasoning, 
              intelligent induction schemata formulation, management of    large proofs, and 
              implementation and experimentation of all  the involved   algorithms. 
              Practical  problems will be chosen  from software and hardware design  
              verification and  combinatorics as test problems for both RRL and SATO.  Both  
               systems will be  enhanced to meet the need of large-scale  applications by  
              user-friendly interfaces.  Special  effort will be made to   distribute RRL and
               SATO to the  automated reasoning community worldwide.
