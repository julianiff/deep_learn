Abstract    :
                 This project explores the design of systematic techniques to  adapt the
              internal interface and component structure of programs  of moderate  size or
              larger. Programming tools based on these  techniques could have the  effect of
              increasing the extent to  which the internal interface structure of  systems
              can be made  more fluid, that is, evolvable and adaptable. One potential 
              application is to reorganizing abstraction boundaries in  programs: It is clear
               in practice that software structural  architectures are rarely optimal, but
              the  costs and risks of  adapting them are high. Another potential application
              is to  the  tailoring of general purpose frameworks and components to  specific
               constrained uses, improving performance.    Four questions are addressed: (1) 
              What semantics-based program  manipulation techniques are needed to support 
              manipulation of  internal software interfaces represented, for example, as 
              encapsulation boundaries in programs?  (2) How can soundness and  other 
              properties of the program manipulation techniques be  established?  (3) What
              are  the design considerations for the  development of tools that can operate
              on  programs of increasing  complexity and size?  (4) How can the utility of
              the  techniques  be assessed for development and re-engineering of internal 
              software  interfaces and associated components?
