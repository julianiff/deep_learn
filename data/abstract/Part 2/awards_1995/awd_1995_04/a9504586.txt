Abstract    :
               The investigator and his colleagues study the computer generation of higher
              dimensional curves that interpolate a given sequence of points and are free
              from unnecessary oscillations.  From the sequence, simple geometric constraints
              are found on all interpolating curves that minimize oscillations subject to the
              general interpolation constraints and the associated theory allows for the
              removal of redundant constraints.  Computer algorithms incorporating the
              geometric constraints are used to find entire families of piecewise rational
              curves from which particular curves are selected subject to additional
              application specific constraints.   The study is motivated by applications that
              involve the design of paths along which objects are to move, such as robotics
              and animation. In these applications it is desirable to create motions that are
              smooth and free from unnecessary oscillations. This is important, for example,
              to reduce the energy used in controlling robots or to create accurate
              animations of images from measurements such as those taken to produce medical
              imaging data. For such applications, minimizing the number of unnecessary
              oscillations is accomplished by imposing the appropriate mathematical
              properties on a higher dimensional curve that governs the changes in certain
              important variables that dictate the motion. Algorithms for the automatic
              computer generation of these oscillation free higher dimensional curves can be
              used as  a basis for many different applications.
