Abstract    :
              9504258  Peterson  In this project, the PIs will measure near-bottom velocities
              across  the Argentine continental slope near 42   deg S. during 1996 and 1997. 
              Nine moorings at nine different  depths, ranging from 200m to 5200m will   be
              deployed, using a newly-developed expendable vector-averaging  current meter,
              with temperature and   pressure sensors at a height of 50m from the bottom on
              each  mooring.  Data will be retrieved by an   ARGOS transmitter released after
              one year's deployment.  A second  set of instruments will be deployed   after
              the first year.  Ship support will be provided by Dr. A.  Piola and the
              Argentine Naval Hydrographic   Service, and hydrographic surveys will be
              conducted during each  deployment cruise.  These   measurements will provide
              reference to simultaneous hydrographic  surveys in order to settle
              contradicting   historical data about the actual strength of the Malvinas
              Current  transport.  This is a collaborative study,   and in this award the PI
              will provide the overall scientific  leadership and coordination for the
              project.
