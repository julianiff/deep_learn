Abstract    :
              Research supported by this grant is under the auspices of the Arctic Systems
              Science (ARCSS) Global Change Research Program and is jointly sponsored by the
              Division of Ocean Sciences and the Office of Polar Programs.  Work to be
              performed represents preliminary steps towards a major 5-year research project
              named SHEBA, which is envisioned to study the heat budget of the Arctic Ocean
              and its impact on global change.  The primary goals of SHEBA are: (1) to
              develop, test and implement models of arctic ocean- atmosphere-ice processes
              that demonstrably improve simulations of the present day arctic climate,
              including its variability, using General Circulation Models (GCMs), and (2) to
              improve the interpre- tation of satellite remote sensing data in the Arctic for
              analysis   of the arctic climate system and provide reliable data for model
              input, model validation and climate monitoring.     Researchers at the
              University of Colorado will use data taken from aircraft in previous
              experiments similar to SHEBA to analyze the status cloud data so that the SHEBA
              field experiment may be planned more efficiently.  The aircraft-derived data
              will be used to validate the results from remote sensing data taken from
              satellites so that those results may be extended beyond the specific region of
              the proposed field experiment.  ??
