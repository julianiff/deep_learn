Abstract    :
              Loftis  9504290  The object of this proposal is to use an interdisciplinary
              approach to develop numerical and computational methods for the next generation
              of models in electrophysiology.  It will focus on building models to study
              phenomena that evolve over long time intervals in 2D and 3D geometries, such as
              the formation of life-threating arrhythmias in the heart.  To accomplish this
              goal, implicit methods will be applied to the large stiff differential system
              of equations that establish the kinetics of transmembrane ion movement and
              current flow in the tissue.  This research will also apply techniques of
              parallelization of enhance the computational performance of implicit methods in
              the context of electrophysiology applications.
