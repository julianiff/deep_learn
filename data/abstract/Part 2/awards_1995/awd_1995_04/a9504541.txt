Abstract    :
              9504541  Masih  Theoretical evidence as well as  practical accidents have
              pointed  out that under certain loading  conditions the lift-slab  structures
              are at the threshold  static and dynamic instability.  The instability of the
              structure  is created by stacking the heavy  mass of several slabs at high 
              levels,  while the structure cannot be  braced laterally, since the  bracing
              will inhibit the lifting  process. During construction stage  or under lateral
              loads, such an  instability situation becomes  highly undesirable.    This
              project undertakes an  investigation to the limitations  within which the
              structure remains  statically and dynamically stable.  The project would also
              include a  study of the ways and means of the  safety precautions used and 
              necessary recommendations to  improve them.    Theoretical studies to improve
              the  design of lift-slab structure,  performance against earthquake  forces,
              and to recommend ways to  strengthen the existing lift-slab  structures to
              withstand possible  future earthquakes will be  conducted.  Such improvement 
              should help to avoid tragedies  like those which happened in  Armenia during 
              the 1988 earthquake.    Computer analysis will be made to  study limitations
              as:  the  stacking schemes of the parked  slabs, the safe relationship of 
              those schemes with the geometry of  the structure, the limits of safe  dynamic
              load and its frequency to  maintain safe lifting process, and  the safe
              temporary connection of  the parked slab to the columns.  ***
