Abstract    :
              9504067  Serene  The purpose of this project is to develop parallel algorithms
              for many-body calculations for model systems and materials.  The first goal is
              to elucidate the behavior of phase transitions for these models in
              self-consistent perturbation theories.  In the vicinity of a phase transition,
              fluctuations of arbitrarily large length scales contribute to macroscopic
              thermodynamic properties, so large system sizes are required to quantitatively
              determine the properties of the phase transitions.  In addition, a quantitative
              description of a phase transition requires accurate evaluation of small
              differences between macroscopically-sized free energies, for which a more
              accurate algorithm for evaluating infinite frequency sums was recently
              developed.  This parallel algorithm can be extended from models to real
              materials, however the inclusion of multiple bands and the long-range Coulomb
              interaction requires substantial algorithm development.  The second goal is to
              make progress in this direction, starting with development of algorithms for
              density response in the Random Phase Approximation and aiming towards the
              evaluation of self-consistent GW self-energies.
