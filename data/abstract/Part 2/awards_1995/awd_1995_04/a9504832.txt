Abstract    :
              9504832  Rudolph       Recent research on manifolds of dimension 3 and 4 both
              draws  upon, and has striking consequences for, the theory of complex  curves
              in complex surfaces.  Topologically, complex curves in the  unit ball in
              complex 2-space are simply represented as  quasipositive surfaces, which are
              combinatorially defined and  readily manipulable.  Earlier, Dr. Rudolph
              combined quasipositivity  with results from gauge theory to obtain estimates
              showing that  many knots are much more complicated (in certain specific senses)
               than classical knot invariants can detect; he is now working to  extend such
              estimates (using results from monopole theory).  Other  work in progress
              includes development of skein theory for  Legendrian knots, an attack on a
              question of Harer about fibered  links (are they all stably Hopf-plumbed?), and
              (with Michel  Boileau) a study of Stein-fillable 3-manifolds.       Knots and
              links are superficially simple objects which turn up  in contexts as diverse as
              physics, theoretical meteorology, and  biology.  Mathematically, a rich source
              of knots is the theory of  equations in a small number of variables (the
              simplest mathematical  link, which looks like two rings in a piece of chain,
              comes from  the simple equation xy = 0).  Knot theory--the study of aspects of 
              the geometry of knots and links which are insensitive to continuous 
              deformations--has always had a lot to give to, and take from, the  qualitative
              side of the theory of equations.  Quasipositive knot  theory takes advantage of
              extra structure in certain equations to  obtain stronger results about their
              associated knots; potential  applications range from quantum gravity to
              unraveling the molecular  structure of DNA.  ***
