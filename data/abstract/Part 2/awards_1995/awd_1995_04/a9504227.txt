Abstract    :
              9504227 Pal  ABSTRACT          The Second North American New Researchers'
              Meeting, organized by and  for new researchers, is the only conference that
              addresses the interests and  concerns of recent Ph.D. recipients in Probability
              and Statistics in the  United States, Canada, and Mexico. Because many new
              researchers are isolated  from the statistical community, with little or no
              contact with junior and  senior colleagues in their field, this meeting
              provides a unique opportunity for new researchers to exchange ideas and
              initiate contact with one another. We hope that this conference will assist in
              the professional development of  new researchers, by helping them become full
              participants in the statistical  profession, and by providing an opportunity
              for them to act as peer mentors  for each other as they begin their scientific
              careers.  The ultimate effect of this process is a strengthening of the
              research base of the statistical  community in North America.   All those
              attending the conference are expected to actively participate by presenting
              their current research---either in a talk or displayed in a poster. There will
              be no parallel sessions. The program also includes several talks by senior
              statisticians and probabilists actively  involved in the most up-to-date areas
              of research. These people will be  invited to share their research ideas and
              enthusiasm for research, and to  provide tactical suggestions on how to build a
              thriving research program and  succeed in the academic world and larger
              statistical community.
