Abstract    :
              9504213  COHN, JOSHUA    This a high-vacuum, pulsed lase deposition (PLD)
              apparatus  will be used in the development of a vigorous basic research 
              program investigating the transport and magnetic properties  of perovskite-like
              films displaying giant magnetoresistance.  The study of spin wave dispersion in
              magnetic oxides will be  carried out using layered structures composed of
              magnetic  and superconducting oxide films.  This award also supports  the
              acquisition of an x-ray diffractometer for ex situ  structural characterization
              of specimens.  The use of the  pulsed laser for patterning microstructures in
              discussed as  a promising means of developing  a complete materials 
              engineering facility.    The proposed research involves materials physics
              issues with  direct bearing on potential applications in magnetic  information
              storage and microwave technologies.  Physical  properties investigations will
              included measurements of  transport and tunneling phenomena, magnetic
              susceptibility,  ferromagnetic resonance and microwave transmission.    This
              instrumentation will enable us to meet our educational  goals of training Ph.D.
              candidates and undergraduate  students in frontier areas of research involving
              advanced  materials, their characterization, and processing.  The  knowledge
              and skills developed through use of the  instrumentation will enhance their
              prospects in tomorrow's  technological marketplace.
