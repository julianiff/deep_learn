Abstract    :
              9504870  Scowcroft       This award in partial support of the Connecticut Logic
              Seminar  will allow the seminar to invite at least one outside speaker per 
              month for each of the next three nine-month academic years.  The  seminar
              typically ranges over most areas of current interest in  mathematical logic and
              has had a successful history of weekly  meetings since its founding in 1974. 
              Participating institutions  represent Connecticut and several nearby states.
