Abstract    :
              9504105  Fell    Using molecular techniques for rapid and accurate determination
              of  community structure, this research will determine fungal  biodiversity and
              population biomass of two distinctly different  groups of micro-fungi: the
              basidiomycetous yeasts and the  oomycetous genus Halophythophora.  Both groups
              have important roles  in detrital based food webs.  The research program will
              include  laboratory and field studies.  Laboratory studies will complete the 
              data bank of know species as a basis for determining community  structure in
              the field.  New procedures will be developed with   preliminary emphasis on
              quantitative PCR (QPCR) using laser  detected infrared labeled primers.  Field
              research will center on  reef and mangrove habitats.  Using a combination of
              classical  microbial techniques and molecular methods, the community structure 
              and relative abundance of known and unknown culturable fungi  species will be
              determined.  The identity of these species will be  ascertained by automated
              DNA sequence analysis and nucleotide  alignment with the data bank. 
              Species-specific regions will be  located and primers developed to test the
              accuracy and sensitivity  of PCR techniques in estimating community structure. 
              Through the  use of PCR and QPCR, the occurrence of unculturable species and 
              population densities will be estimated.  The techniques developed  in this
              research can be applied to population analyses of other  micro- or
              macro-eukaryote communities.
