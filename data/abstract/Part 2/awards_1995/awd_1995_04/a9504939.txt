Abstract    :
              9504939  Hirschfeld  This grant provides partial support for the workshop 
              "Quantum Impurity Problems" to be held February 24-26, 1995  at the University
              of Florida.  The topic of the workshop has  been chosen to maximize the
              possibilities for overlap and  constructive exchange between condensed matter
              physics,  field theory, and mathematical physics.  Quantum impurity  problems
              have attracted great attention in recent years due  to strong interest in
              mechanisms for the breakdown of Fermi  liquid theory in the context of
              high-temperature  superconductivity, the development of nanofabrication 
              techniques for realization of artificial impurities on a  mesoscopic scale, and
              successful application of new  theoretical methods such as conformal field
              theory and the  extrapolation of lattice problems to large spacial 
              dimensionalities.  The workshop will bring together workers  from all of the
              above fields to share ideas, in keeping with  the interdisciplinary purpose of
              its sponsor, the Institute  for Fundamental Theory at the University of
              Florida.  %%%  This grant provides partial support for the workshop  "Quantum
              Impurity Problems" to be held February 24-26, 1995  at the University of
              Florida.  This workshop will bring together scientists, both  experimentalists
              and theorists, from a variety of  subdisciplines to share ideas in an
              interdisciplinary way on  topics and techniques related to quantum impurities
              in  materials.  The support will help junior researchers and  students attend
              this workshop.  The workshop is unique, not  part of a continuing series, and
              in an emerging research  area.  For the above reasons, the Materials Theory
              Program  feels support is a wise investment of program resources. ***
