Abstract    :
              9504110    Crossey    This U.S.-Mexico Program award will support a workshop 
              entitled "Planetary Impact Events: Materials Response to  Dynamic High
              Pressure," to be held in Cancun, Mexico, August  27-September 1, 1995 in
              conjunction with the "International  Conference on Advanced Materials IV (ICAM
              -IV).  Organizers  are Dr. Laura J. Crossey, University of New Mexico, and Dr. 
              Luis E. Marin, Instituto de Geofisica , UNAM, Mexico.  Topics to be discussed
              include cratering processes,  Chicxulub impact and the K/T extinction,
              mineralogical  changes during impact, and spectroscopy of shocked materials 
              and samples from the Chicxulub site.    The symposium will expose the
              international materials  community and students from the U.S. and Mexico to the
              work  being done in the planetary impact field.  Speakers will  provide an
              overview of impacts and associated processes,  followed by specialized topics
              of interest to the  participants.  ***
