Abstract    :
              9504276  Ravizza       Ravizza plans to collect hydrothermal water and chimney 
              samples for analysis for the platinum group elements,  rhenium and osmium
              isotopes.  We have little understanding  of the global cycling of these
              elements and there appears to  be more of these metals being inputted by rivers
              than is  being deposited into sediments.  The osmium isotope ratio in  sea
              water has changed dramatically in the past 60 million  years which some
              scientists have attributed to an increase  in continental weathering.
              Understanding the sources and  sinks of Os will be important for evaluating
              this process,  and hydrothermal vents and deposits may be a major sink for  Os.
