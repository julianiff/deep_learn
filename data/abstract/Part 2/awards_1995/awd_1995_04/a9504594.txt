Abstract    :
              9504594  Knight       Knight's research program, both in her hands and in those
              of  her students and collaborators, involves a range of topics in  recursive
              model theory. In this project, she will be working on  several levels of
              abstraction, from seeking new metatheorems to  clarify connections between
              theories and their models, to  addressing problems about models of specific
              theories.  One part  involves finding an algorithm for constructing a
              mathematical  object (e.g., in the setting of reduced Abelian p-groups) whose 
              initial description is not effective.  Another part concerns making  precise
              the connections between recursion-theoretical complexity  and model-theoretical
              definability.       The current grant provides some essential travel and supply
               needs for Knight's research group.  Their research activities  concern an area
              of logic whose main focus is computability, and  which has ties to methods of
              building models for mathematical  theories.  ***
