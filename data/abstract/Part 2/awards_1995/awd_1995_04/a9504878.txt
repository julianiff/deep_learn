Abstract    :
              9504878  Tugnait    The goal of the proposed research is to provide estimated
              system  models together with evaluated (quantified) modeling errors given 
              experimental input-output data for a wide variety of systems  (electrical,
              chemical, power, manufacturing and production,  robotic, electronic etc.)
              operating in open or closed loop.  Such  information (system model and
              quantified modeling error)  is  crucial to synthesis of a robust controller
              which maintains its  design objectives under uncertain modeling.  As such,
              successful  completion of the proposed research is expected to significantly 
              impact the state-of-the-art in robust control design.  Approaches  are being
              considered to transform the given time-domain  experimental input-output data
              into a frequency-domain transform  function model description along with the
              associated noise error  characterization.  Both second-order spectrum and
              cross-spectrum  of the data record as well as higher-order integrated 
              polyspectrum of the data record is being exploited for such  purposes.  This
              allows for far fewer a priori assumptions; rather  such modeling is dictated by
              the acquired data.  The case of  noisy input measurements is also being
              considered.  A stochastic  embedding approach is being followed for quantifying
              modeling  errors.  ***
