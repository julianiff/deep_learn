Abstract    :
              9504535  Cecil     A hypersurface in Euclidean n-space is said to be
              isoparametric if it has constant principal curvatures; it can be shown that
              such a hypersurface must be a plane, a sphere or a spherical cylinder.
              Isoparametric hypersurfaces in the unit n-sphere, however, are a rich source of
              interesting examples; its complete classification is still lacking. Dupin
              hypersurfaces generalize isoparametric hypersurfaces in that the principal
              curvatures are assumed to be constant only along certain directions. The
              proposed research will attempt to classify Dupin hypersurfaces with 4 or 6
              distinct principal curvatures. Cartan showed that such a hypersurface can have
              1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 distinct principal curvatures; when there are 1 or 2 distinct
              principal curvatures the classification problem iq routine, and the case of 3
              distinct principal curvatures was recently done by the proposer and G. Jensen. 
                Isoparametric and Dupin hypersurfaces form a particularly beautiful subarea
              of classical differential geometry; these surfaces are highly symmetric and
              nontrivial at the same time.
