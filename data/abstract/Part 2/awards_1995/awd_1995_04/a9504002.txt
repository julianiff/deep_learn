Abstract    :
              9504002  Gottlieb  New spectral multi-domain methods for unsteady hyperbolic
              problems in complex geometries will be developed further and implemented on
              scalable parallel computer architectures.  These schemes are based on the use
              of a penalty term for enforcing the boundary/patching conditions and the
              schemes may proven asymptotically stable.  A new approach to spectral methods
              will allow for unstructured grids in the individual subdomains.  Combining
              these two novel approaches will result in an algorithm with full geometric
              flexibility.
