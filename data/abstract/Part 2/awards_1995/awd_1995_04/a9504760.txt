Abstract    :
              9504760  Franks     The proposed research pertains to various aspects of
              dynamical systems: the dynamics of surfaces maps, stability theory for various
              flows, applications to celestial mechanics and Hamiltonian systems are among
              the topics to be pursued.    Dynamics of surfaces flows - stability issues as
              well as area conservation issues - is directly relevant to understanding many
              natural phenomena and predicting their long time behavior. For example, the
              proposed research may lead to a better understanding of large scale fluid flow
              problems arising in ocean dynamics involving shallow water waves.
