Abstract    :
              9504186  Kiousis  A fundamental experimental and theoretical study on high- 
              strength (HS) concrete structures is conducted in this  project.  In the first
              part of this research, basic triaxial  testing will be performed on HS concrete
              to evaluate its  lateral expansion tendencies and ability to gain ductility 
              with increased confinement.  A theoretical analysis based on  a simple
              plasticity model and the compatibility of  deformations of the concrete core
              and the transverse  reinforcement will compliment the experimental work.  The 
              second part of the research will concentrate on the testing  of HS concrete
              structural elements that are subjected to  combined axial compression and shear
              loading.  A theoretical  analysis, based on the concepts developed will be
              performed  to predict the response of HS concrete structural elements.  The
              research is expected to contribute to the development of  reliable code
              provisions for the design of HS concrete  structural elements.  ***
