Abstract    :
              Description:  This project supports the participation by ten U.S. scientists in
              a Symposium on the Chemistry of Natural Products, scheduled to be held January
              4-8, 1996 in Karachi, Pakistan.  The Pakistani organizer is Dr. Atta-ur-Rahman,
              Director of the H.E.J. Research Institute of Chemistry at the University of
              Karachi.  The symposium, and a US-Pakistan Workshop that will follow, will deal
              with frontier areas of natural product chemistry.  The program will consist of
              plenary lectures, session lectures and poster presentations. The topics will
              include: physiologically active compounds from Pakistani natural sources and
              traditional (Unani) medicinal preparations; marine natural products; new
              methods of isolation and separation of secondary metabolites; new approaches to
              detection of bioactivity in naturally-derived extracts; advances in the
              methodology of structure determination; the potential of Pakistani natural
              products as synthons for new medicinal agents; and the role of biotechnology in
              Pakistan's science and technology.  Scope:  This project links some of the most
              active US researchers, in natural product chemistry, with one of the best
              institutes in the developing countries in the field. The H.E.J. Research
              Institute of Chemistry has organized several past symposia on natural product
              chemistry, with participation by eminent scientists from around the world, and
              with high quality publications resulting from these meetings.  The US
              delegation is to include at least four scientists with recent doctorate
              degrees, and two female scientists. The project will be beneficial to U.S. and
              to Pakistan scientists and also to participants from countries in South Asia
              and the Middle East which are usually represented.  The project will help many
              of the scientists in these countries to establish contacts with scientists from
              the U.S. for future collaboration.
