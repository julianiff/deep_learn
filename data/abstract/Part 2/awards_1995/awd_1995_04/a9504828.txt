Abstract    :
              Increases in current density result in greater accumulation of  electrostatic
              charge on aerosols and supercooled water droplets at  the tops of clouds. 
              Theoretical models and laboratory measurements  indicate this will increase the
              rate of initial ice nucleation,  leading to observed changes in winter cyclone
              intensity and in  general circulation.  The PIs will first clarify and quantify
               changes in the global electric circuit in response to changes in  the solar
              wind.  This will provide a basis for more quantitative  models of electrostatic
              charge effects on cloud microphysics.   Second, they will test their prediction
              of the return of the Wilcox  effect for the winters of 1992-94, when
              stratospheric aerosol  loading was increased by Pinatubo, and there was
              modulation of  relativistic electron precipitation at sector boundaries. 
              Finally,  the PIs will test the southern hemisphere meteorological data sets 
              for responses to Forbush decreases and sector boundary  crossings.***
