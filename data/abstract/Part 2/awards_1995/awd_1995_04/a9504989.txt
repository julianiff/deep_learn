Abstract    :
              9504989  Miller       Several directions of research in Algebraic Topology are 
              funded by this grant.  Professors Miller and Hopkins are carrying  forward
              their investigation of the homotopy theory of "elliptic  spectra."  This
              includes both arithmetic and analytic aspects,  connecting to the arithmetic of
              elliptic curves and to index theory  and conformal field theory.  Professor
              Liu's work is related; he is  studying the implications of the modular
              properties of elliptic  genera.  Professor Hesselholt is pursuing his analysis
              of algebraic  K-theory via a range of homotopy-theoretic tools associated with 
              topological Hochschild homology.  Professor Garoufalidis's research  focuses on
              the construction and analysis of 3-manifold invariants  analogous to the
              Vassiliev invariants of knots.       Despite the diverse nature of these
              research projects, they  are all reflections of a single great tide that is
              currently  lifting large parts of Mathematics.  Inspired largely by Physics, 
              many fields are in the process of moving from a study of phenomena  accessible
              from a "one-dimensional" perspective to an attack using  "two-dimensional"
              tools.  In Number Theory it is this new approach  which led to the solution of
              the 350-year-old Fermat Conjecture.   The final outcome remains to be seen in
              Topology; but already it  has yielded a much deeper understanding of large
              parts of homotopy  theory, as well as the celebrated constructions of new
              invariants  for knots and higher-dimensional geometric structures.  ***
