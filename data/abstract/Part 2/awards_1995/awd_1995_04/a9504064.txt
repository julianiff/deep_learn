Abstract    :
              9504064  Leveson    Two aspects of the integration of HCI and safety research
              will be investigated in this work.  The first area of research is the
              application of HCI techniques and knowledge to the design of formal
              specification languages---both their printed and automated representations. 
              The concept of semantic distance for formal specification languages will be
              made operational and its implications in the design of such languages will be
              explored.  The approach will involve working with application experts in
              building real specifications and using this experience to determine what
              features of specifications they find most natural, and exploring cognitive
              psychology models of human error and how they can be applied to specification
              languages to minimize the errors that are made.    The second research topic
              involves modeling the HCI and performing a hazard analysis on the model.  This
              work will involve modeling human behavior, developing analysis techniques to
              identify potential hazardous behavior of both the human operators and the
              computer, integrating these models into the general model for specification and
              analysis of critical system properties, and determining how the resulting
              information can be used in the design of the software and the design of user
              procedures.  The subject of how current knowledge about the safe design of
              traditional controls can be applied to the design of computer-based models will
              be examined and experimental testbeds will be developed to test the hypotheses.
