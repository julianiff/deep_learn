Abstract    :
              Hayes  9504071  The object of this proposal is to test innovative variations of
              the IRAM approach so as to extend the range of systems that  can be studied
              efficiently and accurately using the Miller's cumulative reaction probability
              method.  Preliminary tests of these variations in the Miller approach, which is
              based on the use of absorbing boundary conditions, have demonstrated that it is
              possible to obtain accurate eigenvalues for the cumulative reaction probability
              matrix without assembling the full, dense matrix.  As a result, the basic
              algorithm is both scalable and very efficient in an MPP environment because
              standard sparse-matrix concepts can be used to assemble the matrix-vector
              products required to execute the preconditioned IRAM approach.
