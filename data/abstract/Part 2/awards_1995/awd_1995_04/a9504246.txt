Abstract    :
              Research supported by this grant is under the auspices of the Arctic Systems
              Science (ARCSS) Global Change Research Program and is jointly sponsored by the
              Division of Ocean Sciences and the Office of Polar Programs.  Work to be
              performed represents preliminary steps towards a major 5-year research project
              named SHEBA, which is envisioned to study the heat budget of the Arctic Ocean
              and its impact on global change.  The primary goals of SHEBA are: (1) to
              develop, test and implement models of arctic ocean- atmosphere-ice processes
              that demonstrably improve simulations of the present day arctic climate,
              including its variability, using General Circulation Models (GCMs), and (2) to
              improve the interpre- tation of satellite remote sensing data in the Arctic for
              analysis of the arctic climate system and provide reliable data for model
              input, model validation and climate monitoring.     Researchers at Colorado
              State University will improve computer simulations of the effect of Stratus
              clouds on the surface heat budget of the Arctic.  The fraction of open water,
              ice thickness, and snow cover/thickness, and melt pond cover/thickness will be
              used to look at the effect of these parameters on cloud formation.  The
              improvement of the cloud component simulations in Arctic climate models is
              essential to improving the accuracy of global climate models used to examine
              possible greenhouse effects on global climates.  ??
