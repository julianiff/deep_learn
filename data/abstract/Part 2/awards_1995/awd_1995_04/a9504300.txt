Abstract    :
              Research supported by this grant is under the auspices of the Arctic Systems
              Science (ARCSS) Global Change Research Program and is jointly sponsored by the
              Division of Ocean Sciences and the Office of Polar Programs.  Work to be
              performed represents preliminary steps towards a major 5-year research project
              named SHEBA, which is envisioned to study the heat budget of the Arctic Ocean
              and its impact on global change.  The primary goals of SHEBA are: (1) to
              develop, test and implement models of arctic ocean-atmosphere-ice processes
              that demonstrably improve simulations of the present day arctic climate,
              including its variability, using General Circulation Models (GCMs), and (2) to
              improve the interpretation of satellite remote sensing data in the Arctic for
              analysis of the arctic climate system and provide reliable data for model
              input, model validation and climate monitoring.     This joint project by
              researchers at the University of Colorado and University of Alaska will
              increase the understanding of the feedback mechanisms in Arctic climate.  The
              integration of meteorological data derived from satellites with regional
              atmospheric models will allow better prediction of Arctic climate variables at
              the proposed site for the Phase 2 field experiment in 1997.  This research will
              necessary for planning the experiment phase of the study.
