              Higher Level Reasoning for Constraint Satisfaction    Constraint satisfaction
              is an important reasoning paradigm in  artificial intelligence, with many
              applications, extending to  more general computing domains outside of AI. As
              constraint  satisfaction addresses larger and more practical problems, it  will
              become increasingly necessary to bring to bear advanced  artificial
              intelligence techniques for higher level reasoning.  Higher level reasoning
              steps back from the immediate need to find  a solution to a problem and reasons
              about such interests as:  Interactive constraint satisfaction (How to acquire,
              update, and  explain constraint knowledge), Abstraction and reformulation (How 
              to simplify problems by removing constraints without trivializing  them),
              Metaknowledge (How to use knowledge about constraint  management,
              substitutability of constraints, and relation of  constraints to problem
              structure effectively), Knowledge  compilation (Achieving efficiency by
              preprocessing bodies of  constraints), and Subproblem decomposition (Extraction
              of useful  subproblems and their constraint representations).
