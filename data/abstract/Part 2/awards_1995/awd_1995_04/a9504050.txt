Abstract    :
              9504050  Taylor  The proposal training and research plan is intended to provide
              the research associate with a through grounding in parallel computational
              techniques.  It is expected to yield innovative methods and software for
              applying high performance, scalable architectures to large-scale problems in
              plasma dynamics, fluid dynamics, rarefied gas dynamics, and electromagnetics. 
              In the proposed research, we are specifically interested in computing the
              plasma backflow from multiple electric propulsion thruster configurations
              around realistic spacecraft geometries.  The primary goal is to develop a
              portable computational tool that will enable spacecraft designers to accurately
              estimate the backflow contamination from electric propulsion thrusters onto
              spacecraft.  Another goal of this research is to develop scalable
              implementation techniques for existing numerical methods, and to validate these
              with experimental data.
