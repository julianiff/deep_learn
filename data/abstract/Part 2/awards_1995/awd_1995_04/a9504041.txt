Abstract    :
              9504041  Hardwick  This proposal concerns the use of parallel computers to help
              solve computationally intensive problems in statistical design and analysis. 
              The designs considered are sequential, meaning that a design parameters can be
              altered during the experiment in response to the observations already gathered.
               Such designs can offer significant cost benefits, but are insufficiently
              utilized due to the complex analyses they require and the fact they are
              complicated to conduct.  This research attacks these difficulties by
              considering procedures that are significantly easier to conduct, yet nearly as
              optimal.  The computations are still a major hurdle, especially because the
              problem one needs to solve require combining sequential designs and
              computationally intensive bootstrapping.
