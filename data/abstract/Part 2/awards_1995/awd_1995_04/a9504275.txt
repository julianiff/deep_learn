Abstract    :
              9504275  Warren    The goal of this project is the design and implementation of
              a robust and efficient integrated optimizing compiler for the XSB system.  XSB
              is a system that integrates logic programming, deductive databases and
              nonmonotonic reasoning.  The combination of the three paradigms introduces
              challenges to the design of an optimizing compiler for the system.  Firstly,
              the combination give rise to a number of unique optimization problems that are
              not germane to any one of the paradigms alone.  Secondly, an efficient
              compilation system must integrate a suite of optimizations so as to extensively
              share ideas, formulations and implementation efforts.  Some of the interesting
              optimization problems relevant to XSB will be identified and some preliminary
              ideas for their solution will be sketched.  A promising and powerful idea to
              integrate these optimizations through the use of constraints will be outlined. 
              The potential impact of the techniques that will be developed in this project
              to the optimization of functional and (constraint) logic programs will be
              shown.  These techniques will form the foundations for an integrated optimizing
              compilation system that spans multiple languages and paradigms.  ***
