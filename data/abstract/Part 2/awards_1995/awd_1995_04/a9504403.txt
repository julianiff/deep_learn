Abstract    :
              9504403  Komvopoulos  The adhesion and microtribological phenomena of relevance
              to  microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) will be studied.  Special
              micromechanical devices will be constructed to allow  measurement of the very
              minute forces involved.  Emphasis  will be given to the study of high friction
              leading to  sticking during operation of micromachines due to capillary,  van
              der Waals, and electrostatic force effects.  The  experimental studies will be
              supplemented with molecular  dynamics simulations of normal and sliding
              contacts to  analyze the dependence of friction on lattice parameters, 
              direction and speed of motion, and temperature.  From  indentation measurements
              constitutive relations will be  developed for evaluation of the tribological
              results.  ***
