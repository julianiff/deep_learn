              and RUI:  Fuzzy Decision Trees    The objective of this research is to explore
              ways to utilize  fuzzy representation to increase the representative power of 
              symbolic decision trees.  Decision trees are a popular and  easilyunderstood
              inference mechanism for use in knowledge based  systems.  The use of fuzzy
              representations for  knowledge has  similar comprehensibility advantages,  and
              is particularly  natural in describing mixtures of continuous and discrete 
              symbolic features.  Fuzzy representations can advantageously be  combined with
              decision trees.  This project explores merging  fuzzy representation and
              symbolic decision trees by modifying  both the tree-building routines and the
              inference methods.  The  latter of these is quite challenging, and the results
              need to be  empirically evaluated.  The overall goal in doing this is to 
              utilize the existing methodologies while preserving their  important
              advantages, as mentioned above, in the combined forms.
