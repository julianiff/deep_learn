Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9504968  Jose Lage      This proposal is to fund a small grant for
              innovative exploratory research on the use of time-oscillatory thermal fields
              induced in a fluid to promote and enhance mixing.  The benefit of this method
              is that lower shear stresses are placed on the fluid than by mechanical mixing
              techniques, resulting in less severe potential degradation of shear-sensitive
              fluids during mixing.  This may have applications biomedical applications and
              in the mixing of some polymeric solutions which are shear- and
              temperature-sensitive.
