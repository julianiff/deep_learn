Abstract    :
              9504084  Kamber     The proposed research is in index and foliation theory with
              applications to mathematical physics. The proposed problems are central
              problems in the abstract index theory and have significant applications to
              gauge theories and anomalies. Foliation reduction techniques introduced earlier
              by the investigator may prove to have interesting connections to the newly
              discovered Seiberg-Witten monopole equations.    Foliation theory seeks to
              understand the global behavior of spaces of solutions to ordinary differential
              equations; index theory assigns integers and other easily identifiable
              quantities to these spaces and aims to distinguish different spaces by means of
              their indices. The techniques and results developed here continue to find
              applications in various parts of mathematical physics.
