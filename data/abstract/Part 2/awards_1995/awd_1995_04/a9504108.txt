Abstract    :
              9504108  Sagues      This U.S.-Mexico award will support a research
              collaboration  between Prof. Alberto Sagues of the University of South  Florida
              (USF), and Prof. Pedro Castro Borges of the Centro  de Investigacion y de
              Estudios Avanzados (CINVESTAV) in  Merida, Yucatan, Mexico, to work on
              corrosion problems of  reinforcing steel in concrete.  More specifically, the 
              researchers intend to determine the causes and mechanism of  carbonation of
              reinforced concrete structures, study the  combined effects of carbonation and
              chloride ion  contamination on corrosion of reinforcing steel, and  investigate
              the mechanism of diffusion of chloride ions  through concrete.    The
              methodology will include a literature review update,  concrete core sampling of
              structures on both sides of the  Gulf of Mexico, examination of those cores to
              quantitatively  determine rates of chloride ingress, and examination of  field
              test specimens already in place.  The work will  benefit from existing related
              research programs on  carbonation of concrete and lifetime prediction of
              concrete  structures at USF, and investigations on corrosion of steel  in
              concrete at CINVESTAV.  This award is partly supported by  the Division of
              Civil and Mechanical Structures of NSF.    ***
