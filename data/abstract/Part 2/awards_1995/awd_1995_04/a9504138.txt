Abstract    :

              Ontological Hierarchy for Spatial Knowledge    Spatial knowledge is an
              important and ubiquitous kind of  commonsense knowledge.  it also raises a
              critical issue facing  computational models of mind: the relationship between
              behavior  in the continuous world and  inference with discrete symbolic
              representations.  in this  project, a hierarchy of representations for spatial
              knowledge  called the Spatial Semantic Hierarchy (SSH) developed in a  previous
              NSF grant is being formalized so that it can be more  widely useful.  The
              formalization will clarify precisely when and  how different descriptive
              ontologies and inference methods can  interact effectively.  It will also
              identify the minimal  preconditions on sensors, effectors, and environment
              required for  the spatial model to apply and identify the minimal set of 
              targets for machine learning and discovery required to learn an  instance of
              the hierarchical spatial model from experience.  It  will be evaluated both
              mathematically and experimentally on  simulated and physical robots.  The
              results should be  theoretically important to the foundations of artificial 
              intelligence and practically important to intelligent robotics  applications.
