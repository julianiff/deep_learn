Abstract    :
              9504847  Comfort       Research will be carried out in pion charge exchange and 
              elastic scattering reactions at the Los Alamos National Lab pion  beam
              facility, and in studies of the nucleon and few-nucleon  systems using the
              electron scattering facilities at MIT/Bates and  at NIKHEF in Holland.  The
              pion data will be used to measure  chiral symmetry breaking effects and give
              insight into the quark  structure and dynamics of the nucleon.  The electron
              scattering  work will focus on deformation of the nucleon, charge structure  of
              the neutron, flavor structure of the nucleon, and the  structure of few-nucleon
              systems.  These experiments have high  priority within contemporary nuclear
              physics.  Development,  construction, and utilization of major state-of-the-art
              equipment  is integral to this activity.  Education of graduate students is  a
              strong component in every aspect of this grant.  ***
