Abstract    :
              9504522  Brylinski       The main theme of the research of Jean-Luc Brylinski is
              the  geometry of loop spaces and of the space of knots, and its relation  with
              the topology and geometry of finite-dimensional manifolds.   Brylinski is
              developing the differential geometry of gerbes and  their higher order
              analogues and is applying gerbes to the study of  moduli spaces, of
              characteristic classes, of reciprocity laws, and  of manifold invariants.      
              The research program of Brylinski focuses on the exciting  connections between
              topology, geometry and recent progress in  mathematical physics.  Brylinski
              will continue to explore the  mathematical structures underlying these
              connections.  These  structures have many uses in several areas of mathematics,
               including topology, algebraic geometry, differential geometry and  number
              theory.  They are expected to be useful tools in theoretical  physics as well.
