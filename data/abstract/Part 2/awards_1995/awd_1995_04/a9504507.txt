              Topics in multivariate survival analysis and counting processes    Abstract:   
              The objective of this research is to extend applications of multiparameter 
              product integrals and smoothing techniques in survival analysis. Asymptotic 
              properties of density and nonparametric regression based on smoothed  product
              integrals will be developed for the following: data adaptive  construction of
              rank tests for independence from censored data; nonparametric  estimation of
              multivariate survival functions from truncated data;  goodness-of-fit in
              frailty models; and quantile derivative regression in  linear transformation
              models. The results will be applied to the analysis  of data from AIDS and twin
              studies.      Multivariate survival analysis is a rapidly growing area with  a
              wide range of applications in genetic epidemiology, astronomy, econometrics 
              and other fields. The aim of this research is to develop statistical methods 
              for analysis of data arising in such studies.
