Abstract    :
              9504460   Singh   The Culinary Institute of America requests support from NSF
              for  connection of the campus networks for the Culinary Institute of  America
              to NYSERNet and the Internet. NYSERNet is the midlevel  network located in the
              state of New York that will provide  operations and network information
              services. It will provide the  Culinary Institute of America a 56KB connection
              to the Internet, a  collection of interoperable networks that connect most
              research and  education organizations in the United States  The Institute needs
               the Internet connection to be able to access information resources  throughout
              the state, the nation and the world. The connection will  benefit the faculty,
              staff students of the The Culinary Institute  of America.
