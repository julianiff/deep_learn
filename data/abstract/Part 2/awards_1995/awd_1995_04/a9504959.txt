Abstract    :
              9504959  Chao  In this project, the PIs will carry out a modeling study to 
              simulate dynamical processes in the South China Sea, and to examine  their
              dependence on annual and interannual variations of the  monsoon winds and the
              hydrographic conditions in the Kuroshio.   Focus will be on the surface
              circulation, deep circulation, deep-  water renewal, and the formation of the
              South China Sea Warm  current and a cold-water tongue in response to relaxation
              of  monsoon winds.  An existing model will be modified by substantially 
              increasing its resolution to account for mesoscale processes.   Realistic wind,
              current, and thermodynamic forcing will be used.  ***
