Abstract    :
              The proposal calls for experimental studies of electronic  Polarization dynamics
              in atoms and in atomic collisions.  The basic approach is non-resonant,
              two-photon, two-color  polarization spectroscopy, which is uniquely sensitive
              to  dynamics on a 10fs time scale.  Two polarized photons are  absorbed during
              the course of a collision, thus providing a  direct probe of the collisional
              polarization dynamics.
