Abstract    :
              CTS-9504901  Gavalas  Cal Tech      The fundamentals of in-situ formation of
              zeolite films on porous substrates will be studied in order to synthesize
              membranes of high permeance and selectivity.  Films of ZSM-5 and zeolite A will
              be grown on porous alumina plates or tubes placed in clear solutions of
              suitable compositions maintained at appropriate temperature and autogeneous
              pressure.  Control of crystal size, film quality and thickness will be achieved
              by varying the pore size of the substrate and synthesis conditions. 
              Characterization and permeation experimelts will be performed to evaluate the
              performance of the membrane in important gas separations.  The research may
              lead to the development of improved zeolite membranes with potential
              applications in separations, catalysis and reaction engineering.
