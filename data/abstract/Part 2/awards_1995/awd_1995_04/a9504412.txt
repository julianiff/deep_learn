Abstract    :
              Advanced real-time systems, such as the Next Generation Workstation/Machine
              Controller (NGC) for  automated factories, require built-in database support
              for concurrent data access. However,  conventional database systems do not
              provide the performance levels or response time guarantees needed  by these
              real-time applications. To address these needs, an object-oriented software
              system called  Multiprocessor Database Architecture for Real-Time Systems
              (MDARTS) is being designed, implemented, and evaluated. MDARTS supports
              explicit specification of real-time requirements and semantic constraints at an
              object-granularity level. Unlike other approaches, MDARTS has built-in
              strategies to examine these specifications at runtime during application
              initialization and to dynamically adjust its data management configuration on a
              per-object basis to provide real-time guarantees. For maximum performance on
              shared-memory multiprocessors, MDARTS supports concurrent, direct shared-memory
              data access. This unique design achieves transaction execution times two to
              three orders of magnitude faster than current real-time d atabase systems. In
              summary, the contributions of this project are two-fold. One, novel database
              technologies will be introduced, including methodologies for providing 
              probabilistic and hard real-time guarantees and the implementation of an open
              multiprocessor database  architecture providing extremely high levels of
              performance. Two, MDARTS technology will be applied to develop distributed,
              open architecture controllers for actual manufacturing machine tools,
              evaluating  its effectiveness for addressing the high-performance real-time
              data management needs of manufacturing  applications.
