Abstract    :
              9504250 Pinsky  Abstract      This project supports the seventeenth annual
              Midwest Probability Colloquium, to be held at Northwestern University in
              Evanston, Illinois on October 20-21, 1995.  The Colloquium is an annual
              gathering, at Northwestern, of 75-100 experts in  probability theory from the
              Great Lakes region and other parts of the U.S. and Canada. The 1995 program
              features Charles Newman of New York University's Courant Institute as the main
              speaker, with David Griffeath and Claudia Neuhauser--both of the University of
              Wisconsin--as other invited speakers. Newman will speak on first passage
              percolation theory, Griffeath on   threshold growth dynamics and Neuhauser on
              spatial competition  processes. The NSF support is targeted toward stipends for
              graduate students, as well as honoraria for invited speakers.   This project

              Their lectures will be on topics inspired by biological models. The NSF support
              is targeted toward stipends for graduate students, as well as honoraria for
              invited speakers.
