Abstract    :
              9504457  Orlik       This work applies tools developed in the theory of 
              arrangements to several problems arising from the theory of  Aomoto-Gelfand
              hypergeometric functions.  A twisted de Rham complex  is of special interest. 
              It is particularly important to compute  the dimension of the top cohomology
              group and to find an explicit  basis for it, because this cohomology group may
              be identified with  the space of hypergeometric functions.  The present
              approach is by  using similar complexes with different and simpler coboundary
              maps.   In particular, a complex of logarithmic forms and the Orlik-Solomon 
              algebras are studied.  The calculation of the cohomology of these  complexes is
              usually easier than the twisted de Rham complex  itself.  The aim is to prove
              that under certain conditions these  cohomology groups are isomorphic to the
              twisted de Rham cohomology  groups.  Another goal is to use Morse theory to
              find twisted cycles  that give a basis for the twisted de Rham homology.      
              The study of arrangements of hyperplanes is a new branch of  mathematics on the
              interface between topology, algebra, algebraic  geometry, combinatorics, and
              analysis.  Applications include coding  theory, computer science, spline
              functions, and physics.  The  present work is related to hypergeometric
              functions,  representations of Lie groups, Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations, 
              and conformal field theory.  These last topics are of great  interest to
              mathematicians and theoretical physicists.  ***
