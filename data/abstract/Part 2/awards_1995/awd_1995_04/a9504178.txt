Abstract    :
              CTS-9504178  Ronald W. Rousseau  United Engineering Trustees Inc.    ABSTRACT   
              This grant is to support the sixth Engineering Foundation International
              Conference on "Advances and Opportunities in Environmental Separations" to be
              held July 22-27, 1995 at Snowbird, Utah.  The focus of the conference will be
              on the role of separations in solving environmental problems.  The meeting will
              bring together engineers and scientists from the separations and thermodynamics
              communities.  Topics to be discussed include Membrane, Thermodynamics,
              Supercritical Fluid Processing, Separations Involving Dilute Solutions, and
              Colloids and Surfactants.  Case studies of environmental problems and strategic
              views of "Separations and the Environment" will also be included in the
              program.  The conference should stimulate synergistic discussions among
              participants on topics important to separations and thermodynamics and the
              environment.
