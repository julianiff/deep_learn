Abstract    :
              Knowledge of atomic transition moments with subpercent  accuracy in heavy atoms
              is necessary for the success of  Optical Parity Nonconservation (PNC)
              experiments.  Current  experiments rely on calculated values.  The present
              proposal  calls for high accuracy measurements in Cs.  The  experimental
              techniques developed for cesium will be  extended to other atoms of interest
              for testing the standard  model and atomic theory.
