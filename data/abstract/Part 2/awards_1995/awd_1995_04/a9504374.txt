Abstract    :
              This project will study both the collective effects of solar  magnetic activity
              and those of its individual components, including  sunspots and faculae.  The
              investigator wishes to determine aspects  of solar activity responsible for
              irradiance and luminosity changes  and apply this knowledge to modelling of
              irradiance changes by  ground-based observations.  Secondly, he wishes to gain 
              understanding of the physical processes by which magnetic activity  modifies
              the flow of energy from the solar interior to produce  changes in luminosity
              and irradiance at the Earth.  Finally, this  project will contribute to science
              education by (1) involving  graduate students in obtaining/analyzing data and
              writing a  Master's thesis, and (2) having graduate and undergraduate students 
              help new lab students in related assignments.***
