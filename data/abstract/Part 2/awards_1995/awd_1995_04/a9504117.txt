              P.I.:  Goericke                              Proposal #: 95-  04117             
                            PROJECT ABSTRACT    To  understand  the  controls of primary
              production  in  the  world ocean, variations of phytoplankton biomass and
              primary  production  must  be understood as a function  of  physical,  chemical
               and  biological parameters.   Ideally,  one  would  determine  primary
              production as the sum of the products  of  phytoplankton  taxon  specific 
              biomass  and  growth  rates.  Although   this   approach   is  currently   not 
               possible,  phytoplankton biomass and growth rates can be measured using  the 
              chlorophyll-labeling  method,  which  as  introduced  a  decade  ago.  Taxon
              specific growth rates can, in principle,  also  be  determined from the 14C
              labeling  of  carotenoids.  However,  these potentially powerful methods have
              been  used  on  a  limited  basis because a mechanical understanding  of  what 
              is  being  measured was lacking.  This  research  will  study  the  14C 
              labeling  kinetics  of  chlorophyll  a  and  carotenoids  in  nitrogen  limited
               continuous  cultures  of  microalgae  grown  under constant light to  extend 
              previous  research   to  other  carotenoids,  groups  of  algae,   and 
              conditions of nutrient-limited growth.  The study will  also  determine
              pigment-labeling kinetics in algae grown  under  a  diel  photocycle  and 
              algae subject  to  growth  irradiance  changes to assess the limitations of the
              method when  it  is  performed under conditions of uneven growth.  The results
              of  this  study will aid other members of the research community  in the
              interpretation of the pigment labeling experiments.
