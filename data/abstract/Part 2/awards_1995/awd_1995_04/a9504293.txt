Abstract    :
              9504293  Brooks    One of the most promising capabilities of modern Atomic Force
              Microscopes (AFMs) is the ability to measure surface properties (such as
              conductance) along with topographic information. It is an open question how
              best to display multiple properties simultaneously to the user. Possible
              representations include surface color, transparency and shininess; sound
              modulated by the value of the property; and various force parameters, such as
              surface texture and stickiness. In this project subjects such as which channels
              are best for conveying which parameters and how many channels can independently
              carry information will be investigated.    Various physical and virtual
              hand-held tools to see which is most useful will be studied. This is similar to
              a carpenter who has various tools for cutting, smoothing and engraving. So
              might a surface scientist want different tools for different tools for
              different tasks. Working with surface scientists, which tools and
              visualizations are most effective can be determined. A new and more powerful
              interface to AFMs will be designed and built.  ***
