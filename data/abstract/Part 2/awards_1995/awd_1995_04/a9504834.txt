Abstract    :
              9504834  Yau     This research seeks to combine expertise in differential
              geometry and spectral graph theory. The proposers will study the combinatorial
              Laplacian and its eigenvalues using ideas from differential geometry. Several
              major topics from differential geometry and mathematical physics are also to be
              investigated: holomorphic curves, complex and holomorphic vector bundles, and
              general relativity are some of the topics to be pursued.    Spectral graph
              theory plays an important role in computational complexity theory and is
              heavily motivated by problems in communication theory. For example, optical
              fiber networks and Asynchronous Transfer Mode networks require robust and
              simultaneous connections, thus leading one to consider expander graphs. Graph
              theory envisioned here applies also to materials research: the molecular
              structure of macromolecules such as the new fullerene molecule define what are
              known as Cayley graphs.
