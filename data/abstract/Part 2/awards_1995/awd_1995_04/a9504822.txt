Abstract    :
              9504822  Lasiecka/Triggiani  This research project is centered around issues of
              optimality, regularity,  stability or feedback stabilization, for classes of
              linear and nonlinear partial  differential equations which arise in modern
              technological applications.  The  three main areas of the study, bound together
              by a common theme, are:  interacting structures and related  smart materials ,
              modeled by systems of  coupled partial differential equations, typically of
              different types, with possible  couplings of state variables at the boundary;
              analysis and control theory of  linear and nonlinear models of certain elastic
              shells, such as a spherical caps,  but also shells having other geometries; and
              analysis and control theory of  elastic models which exhibit high internal
              damping and which are acted on by  certain boundary controls.  At the core of
              the study are problems of quadratic  optimization, leading to a Riccati theory
              describing the synthesis of the  optimal solution; regularity of solutions of
              partial differential equations in the  interior and at the boundary; and
              feedback stabilization of linear and nonlinear  partial differential equations.
                 This study is motivated by problems arising in structural optimization, 
              stabilization and control.  At the core of these issues lies the notion of 
              optimization, in accordance with some pre-selected quantitative criterion, of 
              the evolution of some physical system.  Such systems often can, and are, 
              modeled as systems of linear or nonlinear partial differential equations 
              involving control variables which are to be selected according to the
              particular  optimization criteria involved.  In this project, such an approach
              is applied to  the study of complex interactions such as arise, for example, in
               thermal/elastic or fluid/structure couplings.  The goal is to develop
              appropriate  mathematical models based on partial differential equations and to
              design  optimal control strategies based on a careful analysis of the
              mathematical  models.  ***
