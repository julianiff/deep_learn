Abstract    :
                Description:  This project supports cooperation between Dr. Gerta Keller,
              Department of Geological and Geophysical Sciences, Princeton University, and
              Dr. Dalila Zaghbib-Turki, Department of Geology, Faculty of Science at the
              University of Tunis.  The project  is to study the Paleocene-Eocene (P-E)
              maximum warming and the Maastrichtian maximum cooling in the expanded high
              sedimentation records of Tunisia, in order to provide a record from the
              marginal Tethys that allows testing of current climate change scenarios. 
              Analytical methods will include high resolution biostratigraphy, quantitative
              assessment of benthic and planktic foraminiferal changes, and stable isotopic
              analysis of benthic and planktic foraminifera and clay mineral analysis. 
              Scope:  This project allows a cooperative activity that provides the US team
              access to some of the most continuous P-E and Maastrichtian low-latitude
              sections, and allows the Tunisian Team access to laboratory facilities at
              Princeton University.  The project enhances cooperative science and the
              training of post-docs and graduate students, and provides the scientific
              community with a critical database for testing various hypotheses regarding the
              P-E greenhouse warming and Maastrictian glaciation.  The project meets the
              objectives of the Division of International Programs in linking US scientists
              with foreign scientists when the expertise and capabilities are complementary,
              and where the project could lead to long term collaboration and to mutually
              beneficial results.
