Abstract    :
              9504264  Connolly       Connolly will be studying obstructions to topological
              rigidity  such as those provided by the group UNIL of S. Cappell.  He will be 
              investigating the problem of fitting a boundary onto a stratified  space with a
              tame end.  He will also be using these to attack the  Quinn Rigidity Conjecture
              (ICM, 1986).  He wishes to take the new  "continuous control" K-theory and use
              it to create a Surgery theory  which is adapted to these problems.  He is also
              including  4-dimensional smooth manifolds in his project (Gauge Theory).      
              In this project Connolly will be attempting to show that:  Arithmetic Groups
              are Topologically Rigid.  In less epigrammatic  terms, this means that the
              extreme symmetry exhibited by some of  the fundamental geometries of nature
              (these geometries are called  Locally Symmetric Spaces by mathematicians and
              physicists), should  eventually be shown to be based on purely topological
              properties of  their fundamental groups.  In highly oversimplified terms, it
              means  that anything that is vaguely like a torus (or a Klein bottle)  should
              be topologically equivalent to a torus (or a Klein bottle).  An example of a
              topological equivalence is given by a circle and  ellipse; they are not
              congruent figures in the sense of Euclidean  geometry, but they are
              topologically equivalent, because a little  stretching of the one produces the
              other.  ***
