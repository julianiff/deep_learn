Abstract    :
              9504308  Orcutt    This renewal award supports development of instrumentation
              for  deploying seismometers in the deep ocean at a hole (OSN-1) drilled  by the
              Ocean Drilling Program near the island of Hawaii. The  overall objective is to
              enable measurement of seismic activity  accurately and over long periods at
              ocean bottom sites, to fill  major gaps in recording worldwide earthquake
              activity which is  primarily limited to land measurements. With their previous
              award,  these Scripps Institution of Oceanography investigators, in 
              collaboration with colleagues at Woods Hole Oceanographic  Institution, have
              prepared and tested (in a test well on land) a  seismograph system suitable for
              installation in a borehole. In the  present work they will prepare a suitable
              housing for the  seismometer to withstand deep-ocean pressures, and will design
              and  build equipment to install the seismograph and data recording  package in
              the ocean bottom borehole from a ship at the sea  surface.
