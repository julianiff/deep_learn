Abstract    :
              EAR-9504808  Durek, Joseph J.    The goal of this project is to characterize the
              three-dimensional anelastic structure of the earthOs mantle in order to
              constrain models of temperature and viscosity variations in the mantle.  This
              is a notable challenge because it is difficult to separate the effects of
              attenuation from elastic focusing of energy.  The immediate objective,
              therefore, is to characterize focusing better in order to remove this
              contribution to attenuation.  A relatively new array of 13 broadband
              seismometers administered by U.C. Berkeley can provide critical data for
              resolution of this problem.  The Fellow will examine anomalies in surface wave
              signals received by this array from clusters of sources in order to determine
              the anelastic structure along specific corridors.  Because the potential
              sources of the anomalies have are sensitive to different components of the
              velocity structure, it is possible to better quantify elastic focusing along
              parallel ray paths, or OcorridorsO without associating them with a specific
              global 3-D elastic model.  Applying similar techniques to other arrays and
              clusters of earthquakes will lead to improved attenuation modeling along other
              corridors, and ultimately, at a global scale.
