Abstract    :
              Chern  9504915     A number of projects in the general area of classical and
              global differential geometry are proposed. In particular, the proposer wants to
              continue his work in complex projective geometry and Finsler geometry. The
              project on complex projective geometry emphasizes the holomorphic aspect rather
              than the more fashionable Kahler aspect; the project on Finsler geometry is in
              part motivated by Hilbert's 23rd problem.    Finsler geometry could become more
              important as several new applications have been found, for example in control
              theory. Chern has an impressive track record of reviving old ideas with new
              applications. Chern's transgression formulae for the Chern-simons
              characteristic classes have recently found applications in physics. Also,
              proposed research on geometric transformations relates to soliton theory which
              is a mathematical theory of solitary waves.
