Abstract    :
              DMS-9504778  PI: McGovern    McGovern will study double cells of Harish-Chandra
              modules for real classical groups, seeking to understand them simultaneously as
              sets and modules for the complex Weyl group.  The main tool to be used is
              Garfinkle's standard domino tableaux.  The main objective is show that every
              real cell is isomorphic as a based module to a complex cell.  This implies that
              any graded Jacquet functor can be realized as a composition of wall-crossing
              operators which are easy to compute/    The theory of Lie groups, named in
              honor of the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major
              themes in twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for
              exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the representation theory of
              Lie groups has had a profound impact upon mathematics itself, particularly in
              analysis and number theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum
              mechanics and elementary particle physics.
