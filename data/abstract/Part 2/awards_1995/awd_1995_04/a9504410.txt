Abstract    :
              Stark, Philip   95-04410  Acoustic vibrations of the Sun contain information
              about the distributions of soundspeed, material density, and angular velocity
              within the Sun.  Current methods for imaging these properties of the solar
              interior from helioseismic eigenfrequencies produce images that might resemble
              the Sun, but the formal uncertainties of the techniques do not accurately
              quantify possible differences between the models and the truth.  Nor can the
              methods incorporate physical constraints that might reduce the uncertainty. 
              The effects of data errors, choice of modeling algorithm, and theoretical
              approximations on the reliability of the images are largely unexplored;
              published uncertainties approximate the variability of the estimation method
              conditional on a particular parametric representation of the solar property and
              a host of other assumptions, without regard for possible biases.  Dr. Stark
              will develop and apply methods to study both the variability and the bias of
              estimates of the distribution of soundspeed in the solar interior and the
              distribution of angular velocity in the solar interior, under less restrictive
              assumptions.  The bias can be controlled using prior physical information about
              the Sun, such as bounds on either energy or observed rotationally-induced
              oblateness.  The work will also lead to new methods to test hypotheses in the
              presence of infinite-dimensional nuisance parameters.
