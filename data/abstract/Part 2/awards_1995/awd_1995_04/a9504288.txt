Abstract    :
              9504288  Mairson    The goal of this research is to investigate the
              computational resources required to implement correct, optimal evaluation
              mechanisms for the lambda calculus.  Because lambda calculus is a foundation
              for the design and implementation of programming languages, such research could
              contribute to the understanding of programming language implementation. 
              Moreover, it would integrate approaches to computation that emphasize semantic
              issues as well as those of computational complexity.    The solution to
              optimality proposed by Gonthier, Abadi, and L vy will be analyzed.  The
              computational correctness of this scheme in an elementary, first-principles
              sense will be established and its computational complexity will be analyzed. 
              Ultimately, a version of a correct evaluator whose complexity is polynomial in
              a reasonable cost model for lambda calculus will be put forward that the lambda
              calculus may be regarded as a "first class" formalism in the sense of the
              invariance thesis, the computationally efficient version of the Church-Turing
              thesis.  The static semantics as a possible foundation for a lazy environment
              model will also be investigated.  ***
