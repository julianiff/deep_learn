Abstract    :
                  This project will culture benthic foraminifera to determine what  the
              environmental variables affect the uptake of trace elements (Ba  and Cd) into
              the shell.  Three genera used for paleoenvironmental  analysis will be studied,
              with experiments to examine the effects  of bottom water chemistry, growth
              rate, alkalinity, pressure, and  depth in the sediment.
