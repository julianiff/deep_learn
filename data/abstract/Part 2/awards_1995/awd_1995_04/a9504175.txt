Abstract    :
                This project describes work in portable, high performance  algorithm
              development, with experimental system support for I/O  intensive  programs. 
              For these programs the data access time is  the predominant component  of the
              running time.  The work has  three thrusts.        (1)  Multiprocessor 
              Multi-disk File Systems.            In ongoing research, an experimental 
              multiprocessor          multi-disk file system has been built, which runs on 
              Intel Paragon.  The file system was built to support a  prototype for a
              standard  application programmer  interface; the interface has been designed to
              facilitate  the production of portable programs.  A major portion of  this
              project is to  evaluate the efficiency of  theoretically optimal data access
              algorithms that  have  already been designed, and to validate the paradigms
              used      to  design  these algorithms for a two-level memory  hierarchy.      
               (2) Additional  Two-Level Memory Model Algorithms.            LAPACK is a
              natural (and very  appropriate) package for  upgrading to accommodate for
              out-of-core data sets.  A  portion of these algorithms will be redesigned and 
              implemented as prototypes  for testing and validation.  Completed programs will
              be released for public use  and  evaluation.        (3) Three-level Memory
              Model.            A significant  research goal is to develop a memory which 
              captures critical performance and  latency behavior  between main memory, disk
              systems, and tape systems, for  many  of the contemporary computer
              architectures.  Such a  model is intended to  support the development of I/O- 
              efficient algorithms.
