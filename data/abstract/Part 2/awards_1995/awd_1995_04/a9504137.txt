Abstract    :
                Distributed computer networks control, scheduling and management  are
              well-studied topics in scientific and engineering  applications, yet the 
              problem of finding optimal approaches that  are not too complex to solve or 
              implement on practical systems  remain unsolved.  Many computer networks are 
              naturally clustered,  and imbalance of load usually occurs among the clusters 
              rather  than inside the clusters.  This project will develop clustered 
              computer  networks' control, scheduling and management policies  for allocating
               computational resources across network clusters  and for managing network 
              operations based on simple network  management protocol(SNMP).  This project 
              will first develop  clustering model based on the data collected from
              monitoring  Bradley network loads from real applications.  Then the project 
              will  investigate and develop adaptive computer algorithms and  heuristic
              schemes for  developing the control policies.  Finally,  the project will
              develop network  load monitoring tools based on X-  window and Tcl/Tk for
              network manager  interface.  The control  schemes developed are expected to be
              applicable to  network load  balancing and management in many other clustered
              distributed  systems.    The project is funded under the RUI program.
