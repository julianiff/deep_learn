Abstract    :
              9504361  Hyatt        This proposal requests funds for Maryland Institute
              College of Art  to establish its own Internet node under the NSFNET program. 
              These  connections will provide operations management and information  services
              and it will give the college a 56 thousand bits per second  connection to the
              NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per  second) National Backbone
              network.    The benefits of this NSFNET connection include e-mail between local
               and remote researchers and educators, file transfer capability and  the
              ability to use remote computer resources.  Also the college  will have the
              ability to investigate innovation in educational  resources and incorporate
              them into their curricula.
