Abstract    :
              This workshop is to develop a seminal statement about research  topics needed in
              developing a science of tools for electronic  systems design.  It brings
              together academic and industrial  researchers with experience in VLSI chip,
              electronic system, and  other design automation fields to integrate their
              varied points of  view.  The workshop facilitates the integration of a wide
              range of  design automation research ideas, and their integration into a new 
              science for systems design.
