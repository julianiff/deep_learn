              ESTIMATION AND COMPUTATION PROCEDURES IN STATISTICS     Abstract:              
              The primary objective of this research is to develop new theory  and methods in
              some important classes of statistical problems in  the areas of sampling,
              missing data analysis and measurement error  models.  The research topics are
              motivated by practical problems   and the main focus is on estimation and
              (approximate) computation   procedures. The research aims to significantly
              advance statistical   knowledge in these areas, and improve some current
              practices in   survey agencies in particular. In attacking some of the proposed
                problems, small sample asymptotic methods are desired. The   potential use of
              accurate saddlepoint approximations in these   problems is studied. In other
              proposed problems, large sample   asymptotic methods are investigated. The
              research topics include  kernel-type estimations in regression when data are
              partially   missing or measured with error; sub-domain estimation in sample  
              surveys; and new and optimal estimation of the distribution   function of a
              finite population.       In this research project new statistical theory and
              methods are  developed and investigated in statistical problems that bear  
              practical importance. The accuracy and simplicity are the main criteria  in
              developing such statistical methods. They have direct applications   in various
              agencies, such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to   improve the accuracy and
              speed of the current statistical practice.   Furthermore, this research
              advances the science and technology  in the Federal Strategic Areas of high
              performance computing and  the statistical aspects of biotechnology.
