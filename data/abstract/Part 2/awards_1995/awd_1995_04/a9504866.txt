Abstract    :
              9504866  Kloet       I propose to investigate the role of sub-nucleon  degrees
              of freedom in the proton and the antiproton.  When  an antiproton scatters from
              a proton, more than half the  time completed annihilation of both particles
              occurs, and  all mass is transformed into energy.  Antiprotons do not 
              naturally occur in nature but can be created by special  techniques. 
              Experiments using these antiprotons have been  done recently, and surprisingly
              large effects of the spin  polarization have been observed.  We will
              investigate what  different models predict for proton-antiproton annihilation 
              and subsequent creation of pions.       Further I propose to study the effect
              of parity  nonconservationin proton-proton reactions.  Recent advances  in the
              description of the weak interaction of excited states  of the nucleon, allow
              for closer analysis of the data,  within the framework of a model that takes
              these excitations  into effect.  ***
