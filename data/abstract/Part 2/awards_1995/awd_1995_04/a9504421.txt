Abstract    :
               The objective  of this   RUI project is to design ``smarter` algorithms that 
              avoid memory  access conflicts without significant slowdown of an  algorithm's
              performance.  In particular, this research focuses on  designing such
              algorithms (especially  for graph problems),  studying their characteristics,
              developing methodologies,  and  evaluating the gains from removal of concurrent
              memory access.    The  methods studied which, when carefully employed by a
              parallel algorithm, avoid  concurrent memory access.  Methods, which have  been
              shown to be effective on  parallel graph algorithms and which are also being
              investigated, include:  (1) pseudotree contraction, a set of rules that allows
              a pseudotree to  be contracted to a rooted star in logarithmic time without 
              concurrent-writing access; (2) edge-list augmentation, a  procedure that runs
              in constant time without any concurrent memory  access; (3) growth-control
              scheduling, a method of balancing   the work performed by clusters of
              processors so that the  total amount of time needed to finish a job is
              minimized.
