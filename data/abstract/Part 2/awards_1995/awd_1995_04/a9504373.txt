Abstract    :
              9504373  Storm    As a result of the worldwide emphasis in Solid State 
              Chemistry the first European Solid State Chemistry Gordon  Conference will be
              held in Irsee, Germany, 24-29 September  1995.  Research scientists from six
              European countries,  Japan and the United States will present the broad 
              international research effort in Solid State Chemistry.  %%%  Interest in Solid
              State Chemistry has grown dramatically  in recent years, owing in part to the
              recognition of the  technological importance and scientific challenges in the 
              study of new materials.  In the United States the advent  of the Advanced
              Materials Processing Program (AMPP) as a  national thrust in the synthesis and
              processing of new  materials recognizes the important role of Solid State 
              Chemistry in research on materials. Owing to the  interdisciplinary nature of
              solid state research, other  scientists are entering the field, including
              inorganic  molecular chemists and solid-state physicists, further  intensifying
              the study of new solids, the development of  new ways to prepare them, and the
              application of  appropriate characterization methods.  ***
