Abstract    :
              9504925  Cao     The proposal lies in complex geometry and differential
              equations, and deals specifically with the Ricci flow - otherwise known as the
              parabolic Einstein equation, which is a geometric evolution equation - on
              Kahler manifolds. The main goal is to understand the asymptotic behavior of
              solutions to the Ricci flow on a compact Kahler manifold of positive
              holomorphic bisectional curvature.    Geometric evolution equations arise in
              nature. And although the proposed research deals with somewhat technical
              aspects of a specific geometric evolution equation, it is possible that it will
              lead to important techniques applicable to a broader class of evolution
              equations.
