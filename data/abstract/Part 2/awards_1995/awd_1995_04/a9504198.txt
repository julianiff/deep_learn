Abstract    :
              OCE-9504198    The investigators will examine physical and theoretical 
              relationships among physical processes, sediment transport and  morphology
              across shoreface, which might lead to understanding of  storm-dominated vs.
              swell-dominated shorefaces.  This will involve  detailed examination of
              time-series of morphology and concentration  of inner shelf sediments. 
              Deployment of acoustic instruments that  are better capable of quantifying
              cross-shore transport are  proposed for both storm and swell-dominated
              shorefaces.  Models  will be modified to account for cross-shorface sediment
              and fluid  motion which recognize the simultaneous contribution of both wave 
              and wind forcing.
