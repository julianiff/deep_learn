Abstract    :
              9504099  Kenny, Thomas    This project is concerned with the design,
              fabrication, and  characterization of micromechanical structures and devices. 
              Emphasis is on the characterization of the fabricated  micromechanical
              structures.  Accurate non-contact  measurements of mechanical properties are
              also very  important.    This instrumentation will be used in support of
              several  experiments, including characterization of tunneling  sensors, study
              of mode shapes in micromachined sensor  components, and fundamental
              characterization of mechanical  microstructures, with emphasis on evolution of 
              characteristics with environmental parameters, such as  pressure or
              temperature.    This interferometer-based measurement system is on its way  to
              becoming a standard for micromechanical structure  characterization in
              industry, and represents a unique  resource in the academic community.  It will
              provide a  fundamentally new capability for microstructure  characterization,
              and enable graduate students to carry out  measurements using equipment which
              they can expect to  encounter in industry after graduation.  This 
              instrumentation represents an invaluable enhancement in the  device testing
              capabilities at Stanford as uell as an  opportunity to carry out
              ground-breaking research into the  fundamental properties of micromechanical
              structures.
