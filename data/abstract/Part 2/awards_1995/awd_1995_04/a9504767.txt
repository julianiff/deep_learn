Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the problem of power dissipation, primarily  on the
              fundamental issues of what are the real sources of power  dissipation in CMOS
              microprocessors, and what can be done to  minimize it at a more global level. 
              The goal is development and  demonstration of techniques that would support
              Power-efficient  Instruction Set Architectures (PISA).  For this, there are
              four  major tasks:      1.  Developing technology independent models and
              metrics for  power dissipation in CMOS logic.      2.  Analyzing current day
              designs to benchmark the state of the  art and to identify processor subsystems
              that        are potential  power hogs.      3.  Development of new techniques
              that will reduce these metrics.      4.  Demonstration of these techniques in a
              prototype CMOS PISA  CPU chip.    These new techniques will include gate design
              level approaches, but  will focus primarily on organizational and instruction
              set  architectural approaches that inherently have a lower power  requirement. 
              The end goals of this research s to develop a deeper  scientific understanding
              of the relationship between power and  computation, and develop techniques that
              minimize the ratio of the  two ways that can broadly impact the continuing
              evolution of VLSI  Technology and its successful use in computing.
