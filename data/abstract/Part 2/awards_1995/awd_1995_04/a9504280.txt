Abstract    :
              9504280  Klein       This work involves laboratory and modeling studies of lavas
               recovered in 1993 from the axis of the southern Chile Ridge.  Preliminary
              analyses reveal that a large proportion of samples  recovered from over 400 km
              of this spreading center are enriched  mid-ocean ridge basalts with trace
              element systematics that are  highly unusual, showing geochemical afinities
              with arc, back-arc,  and recycled continental materials.  Preliminary modeling 
              suggests they may be produced by melting of a mid-ocean ridge  basalt source
              that has been variably contaminated by sediment and  altered oceanic crust,
              possibly introduced at the adjacent  subduction zone.  ***
