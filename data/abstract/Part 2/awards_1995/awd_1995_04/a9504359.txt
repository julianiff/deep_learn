Abstract    :
              9504359  Peters       This project involves work on several problems involving
              the structure of nonselfadjoint operator algebras. These include direct limits
              of finite dimensional operator algebras. One of the principal tools is the
              Connes spectrum or analytic range for analytic algebras. The isomorphism class
              of certain nest algebras can be determined by a finite algorithm. It is
              proposed to improve and implement this algorithm. In another direction an
              investigation will be made of the notion of topologocal nilpotence. This
              concept has been recently studied for Banach algebras, in the context of
              operator algebras, such as nonselfadjoint crossed products.      
              Nonselfadjoint operator algebras arise as triangular subalgebras of   objects
              used by quantum physicists to study particle theory. The properties   of such
              algebras and their connections with dynamical systems are questions   we intend
              to investigate.  In some cases there are computable algorithms.  The goal of
              this project is to contribute to the theoretical understanding   of basic
              mathematical structures.  ***
