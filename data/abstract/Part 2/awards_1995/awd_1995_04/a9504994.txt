Abstract    :
              Colding  9504994     The proposed research deals with Riemannian manifolds with
              lower Ricci curvature bounds. In particular, rigidity and stability problems
              are proposed. For example, the investigator has previously shown that an
              n-manifold with a definite lower Ricci curvature bound which is sufficiently
              close to a fixed n-manifold has volume close to this manifold and is
              homeomorphic to it.    A Riemannian manifold can be thought of as a curved
              space; the Ricci curvature of a Riemannian manifold gives a local measure of
              the curvature. The proposed research seeks to understand the Ricci curvature
              and its relationship to other metric quantities such as volume and the topology
              of the manifold.
