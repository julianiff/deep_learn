Abstract    :
              9504964  Klinkhammer       This project will use chemistry of stable isotopes
              and trace  metals in pore waters and in shells of benthic foraminifera to 
              examine the effects of (1) organic matter and 92) metal  remobilization upon
              the biogeochemical record in the shells.  Carbon isotopes and trace metals
              (Cd,Ba) are widely used as  tracers of past ocean production and deep water
              circulation; the  Pis have preliminary evidence that both are affected by early
               diagenesis.  The project will examine this effect in a range of  environments
              differing in surface water production (hence, carbon  flux to the sediment) and
              in sediment oxidation state.  ***
