Abstract    :
              9504898  Wolfson     The proposed research lies in the area of symplectic
              geometry. This investigator uses techniques from nonlinear PDEs and complex
              geometry to tackle certain problems in symplectic geometry. In particular,
              several problems concerning Lagrangian minimal surfaces and the quantum
              cohomology group are to be considered.    Symplectic geometry provides a
              mathematical setting for many problems in classical mechanics as well as
              quantum mechanics. The existence of Lagrangian minimal surfaces, which are
              extremal objects in symplectic geometry, is a fundamental problem with many
              possible applications to physics.
