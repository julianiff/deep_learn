Abstract    :
              9504091  Ortiz    This Americas Program award will fund a planning visit by  Dr.
              J. V. Ortiz to go to Ecuador to develop a collaboration  between the
              computational chemistry group at the University  of New Mexico and the mass
              spectrometry group of Dr. N. J.  Medina at the Escuela Politecnica Nacional in
              Quito.  They  will use computational and experimental approaches to 
              understanding ion chemistry which will be used in an  investigation of the
              behavior of various matrix materials  used in matrix-assisted laser
              desorption-ionization  experiments.  The latter technique is useful in the mass
               spectrometric characterization of large biopolymers such as  proteins. Each
              group will use completely different methods,  thus taking advantage of each
              other's expertise.  Ab initio  computational methods are not currently used in
              Ecuadorian  research.  The instrument to be used by Ecuador will provide  the
              New Mexico researchers with a unique opportunity to  obtain experimental tests
              of theoretical predictions.  ***
