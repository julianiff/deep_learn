Abstract    :
              9504251  SANSONE    This team of investigators will study the biogeochemical
              processes  associated with the decomposition of organic matter within 
              (approximately) the upper framework  of a coral reef just offshore  of Oahu,
              Hawaii. Particulate and dissolved organic matter  originating at or near the
              reef surface is hydraulically  transported into this upper part of the reef
              where organic moieties  are broken down in a suboxic or anoxic environment by
              heterotrophic  bacteria. These studies should lead to a better understanding of
               nutrient cycling in coral reef ecosystems in many part of the world  ocean.
              Also, because the suboxic reef environment is vertically  extensive (about 1
              meter deep), this system will afford the  opportunity for detailed proxy study
              of suboxic decomposition  processes that are common in other benthic
              environments, such as  soft sediments, but which cannot be carried out in the
              latter  because of the small spatial scale (typically several millimeters).
