Abstract    :
              9504135  Brin     The proposed research lies in singular Riemannian geometry.
              The investigator in collaboration with W. Ballman proposes to investigate
              orbihedra of nonpositive curvature. An orbihedron is a simply connected
              simplicial complex with a group of homeomorphisms acting properly
              discontinuously and preserving the simplicial structure. An orbihedron with an
              invariant metric is a singular Riemannian manifold in the sense of Alexandrov. 
                Riemannian manifolds are abstract versions of surfaces in space and their
              higher dimensional analogs. Originally, Riemannian manifolds were restricted to
              be smooth without sharp edges. In singular Riemannain geometry, the smoothness
              requirement is slightly weakened to allow certain singularities. In some sense,
              the concept of a singular Riemannain manifold is more useful as it includes
              polyhedral surfaces.
