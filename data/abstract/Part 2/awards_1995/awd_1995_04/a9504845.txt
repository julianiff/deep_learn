Abstract    :
              This award supports cooperative research between three U.S. researchers, Jerry
              Bona at the Pennsylvania State University, Ohannes Karakashian at the
              University of Tennessee, and William McKinney at North Carolina State
              University, and two Greek researchers, George Akrivis at the University of
              Crete and Vassilios Dougalis at the National Technical University in Athens. 
              The collaboration will occur at the Institute of Applied and Computational
              Mathematics (FORTH) in Heraklion, Greece.  The objective of the research
              concerns the numerical solution of three types of partial differential
              equations that model various aspects of wave propagation phenomena in nonlinear
              dispersive systems.  The research is concerned with the design and analysis of
              numerical schemes for the integration of interesting and useful classes of
              nonlinear, dispersive wave equations.  Such numerical methods are crucially
              important for use in conjunction with laboratory experiments and for the study
              of the detailed structure of solutions including singularity formation.  The
              project also includes implemen tation of the schemes as computer codes and the
              use of these codes int he investigation of theoretical and applied issues
              connected with this class of  partial differential equations.
