Abstract    :
              9504830  de Moustier    The Scripps Institution of Oceanography will will
              undertake an  instrument develoipment project to build a multi-sensor, digital 
              Deep Tow vehicle capable of fine-scale multibeam swath mapping and  acoustic
              backscatter imaging near the seafloor to a 6000 meter  depth.  The system will
              be configured to operate with either  coaxial or fiber-optic tow cables and be
              capable of deploying  sensor packages as science requirements dictate.  The
              plan is to  integrate a pair of 110 kHz side-looking sonars, a 4 kHz sub-bottom
               profiler, a 40 kHz obstacle avoidance sonar, a 12 kHz navigation  sonar, a
              23.5 kHz up-looking sonar, a CTD, a transmissometer, a  magnetometer and a
              complement of still and TV cameras onto an  existing towed vehicle).  This high
              resolution tool will be used to  study geological seafloor phenomena such as
              crustal accretion  processes, small-scale abyssal sediment processes (sediment
              wave  amplitude, asymmetry, wavelength and orientation), scale dependence  of
              seafloor topography, and seafloor acoustic backscattering.   Ultimately, the
              data will provide a base for better understanding  the relationship between the
              magmatic and tectonic processes that  control the ridge system and hydrothermal
              venting.
