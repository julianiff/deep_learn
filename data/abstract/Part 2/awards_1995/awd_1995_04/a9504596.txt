              Extreme Value Theory    Abstract:    The research is concerned with problems of
              estimation and   research for time series models whose theory is not yet  
              fully understood. The standard linear Gaussian models for   time series data
              are inadequate to describe many of the   time series observed in practice so it
              is important to   develop techniques for estimation and prediction based on  
              more general models. Efficient estimation procedures and   prediction
              techniques for non-causal and non-invertible   ARMA processes are developed and
              a study made of the   theory and application of continuous-time linear and  
              non-linear ARMA processes. Extreme value theory for   linear and non-linear
              models is also investigated.      Existing methods of forecasting are based on
              assumptions   which are frequently not satisfied by observed economic   and
              scientific time series data. This research develops   methods of analysis and
              forecasting for a more general   class of time series models, leading to more
              accurate   forecasting of series which do not meet the restrictive  
              assumptions of the classical theory.
