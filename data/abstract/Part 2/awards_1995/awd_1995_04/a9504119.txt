Abstract    :
              9504119  Hsu    In  recent years there have been rapid advances in improving 
              the  strengths  of  construction materials  such  as  Portland  cement 
              concrete,     polymer    concrete,    and    fiber     reinforced 
              plastics/composites. Experimental testing of specimens made  from  such  high 
              strength materials requires loads that  significantly  exceed  the 400-kip
              capacity of existing equipment now  available  at   the  University  of 
              Houston.  The  College  of  Engineering  currently  has  as  strong  research 
              programs  in  high-strength  materials  involving several faculty members  and 
              students  from  Civil  and  Environmental Engineering and Mechanical
              Engineering.  This  system  will  allow researchers to obtain  load-deformation
               relationships,  and will have deformation-control capability.  It  will 
              enable  research  efforts  beyond  the  current  limits  of  existing 
              equipment,  which is important  for  understanding  the  safety and reliability
              of large composite structures.
