Abstract    :
              9504193  Spainhour  This project will investigate fiber wraps in strengthening
              and  protecting bridge columns and piles exposed to salt water.  The 
              effectiveness of fiber wraps in reducing chloride permeability  will be
              evaluated, as well as, their ability to protect columns  and piles continually
              subject to saltwater exposure from the  damaging effects of corrosion.  The
              effects of exposure to a  tidal marine environment on the strength, stiffness,
              and  durability of the wrap itself will also be addressed.    The research
              involves three years of accelerated exposure  simulating a tidal condition
              using a saltwater immersion tank.  To test a variety of exposure conditions,
              certain columns will be  precracked; others will be treated with the fiber
              wraps after a  period of exposure to the seawater.  The research will
              determine:    1) Whether fiber wraps extend the life cycle of a newly placed 
              column,  2) Whether fiber wraps are cost effective in comparison to other 
              treatment and repair techniques, and  3) At which points in the column life
              cycle is it cost-effective  to apply fiber wraps as either a corrosion
              prevention or repair  device.  ***
