Abstract    :
              Kim   9504286  The objective of this proposal is to shape recognition between
              objects in a viscous fluid as it is an important attribute of many important
              physicochemical and biological processes.  Examples range from fluidic
              self-assembly of GaAs devices on Silicon substrate, to protein-DNA interactions
              during the implementation of the genetic code for assembly of proteins from
              amino acids.  This project offers the applicant outstanding opportunities to
              complement previous laboratory training in protein chemistry, enzymology, and
              structure-function analysis, through rigorous computation of physical  forces
              governing structure-function relationships. The training program will examine
              hydrodynamic steering starting from the simpler geometries, then end with the
              complex geometries as archived in the Brookhaven Protein Databank.
