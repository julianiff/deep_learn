Abstract    :
              Chang, Fang-Ru C.  EAR-9504813    The Fellow will study mechanisms of trace
              metal adsorption and desorption by clay minerals in the presence of competing
              cations and chelating agents.  Synchrotron radiation based X-ray absorption
              spectroscopic studies will be used to investigate the interactions between
              surface functional groups of clay minerals and aqueous species in the
              interfacial region.  Results of this study will improve our understanding of
              biogeochemical weathering and dissolution of clay minerals.  The study will
              provide molecular level information that will be useful for refining solute
              transport models, and it may also shed new light on phytoremediation
              techniques.      The application of XAS to characterize metal adsorption sites
              on clays is an important application of this new technique; the more common
              empirical models of adsorption/desorption are no substitute of solid structural
              information.  This opportunity allows the Fellow to master a new technique,
              combine it with her established strength in clay chemistry, and make solid
              contributions to a societally relevant problem.
