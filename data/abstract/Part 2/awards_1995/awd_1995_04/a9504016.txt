Abstract    :
              This is a planning grant for Dr. Charles Nittrouer and his  two other colleagues
              to visit Indonesia and Papua New Guinea  to organize a research project in the
              coastal ocean of New  Guinea.   This is an important visit since the wet
              tropical  terrain in the Indo-Pacific archipelago is major global  source of
              fresh water, solutes and particulates.  Oceanic  processes active in the
              coastal oceans adjacent to wet  tropical areas control the material flux that
              escapes to the  world ocean.  Very little research has been completed in the 
              Indo-Pacific archipelago.  The proposed work in and around  New Guinea can
              provide important data on the discharge of  sediments from the river and their
              impacts on the  geomorphology, chemistry, and biology of the surrounding 
              coastal zone.  Three scientists represent biological,  physical, and geological
              oceanography, respectively.  This  visit can provide important linkages with
              authorities and  scientists in the region and lay the groundwork with local 
              scientists.
