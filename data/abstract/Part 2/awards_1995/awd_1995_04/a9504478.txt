                ABSTRACT:                                     This research develops new
              statistical methods for Bayesian nonparametric  models, with special attention
              to problems arising in survival analysis. In  particular, the investigation
              focuses on (i) Beta process models for the  cumulative hazard function and some
              attendant Markov chain models, (ii) hazard  rate models using the Extended
              Gamma process, (iii) Cox's proportional hazards  regression model with priors
              on hazard rates and cumulative hazards, (iv) the  problem of variable selection
              in Cox regression, and (v) unimodal distribution  models. In all cases,
              emphasis is placed on priors for which implementable  computational algorithms
              can be developed.        With the recent developments in hardware and software,
              high-speed computer  simulation technology has made it feasible to surmount the
              computational   problems in Bayesian statistical methods which have been
              advocated on   foundational grounds by many leading theoreticians for decades.
              The research  in this project concentrates on furthering such methods in the
              area of survival  analysis. Originating with applications to product
              reliability in industry and  to patient survival after intervention in
              medicine, statistical analyses of   survival data have proved valuable in
              evaluating new materials, new  manufacturing methods and new medical
              procedures. The investigator studies and  implements refined techniques for the
              analysis of data arising in such fields  of application.
