Abstract    :
              9504291  Schauser  The object of this proposal is to study parallel algorithms
              that run efficiently on modern multiprocessors and, in particular, on networks
              of workstations (NOWs).  This research will use a simple but realistic model of
              communication, the LogP model.  The goal is to use the model and its parameters
              to predict and improve the performance of algorithms on various architectures. 
              In particular, it will provide a methodology for porting efficient code from
              one machine(e.g., a low-end NOW) to another (e.g., a high-end NOW/MPP), such
              that both versions are efficient on their respective architectures.  This work
              will be mostly of an experimental nature, and will be carried out on the Meiko
              CS-2.  Some benefits to this research are : accurately predicting the
              performance of parallel code on other architectures, efficiently optimizing the
              ported algorithms, and making the use of  low-end  NOWs as test platforms much
              more viable.
