Abstract    :
              9504517  Stevenson    Title: Experimental Constraints on Melt Migration Models. 
                The porosity of the Earth's Mantle in the region under mid-ocean  ridges is
              unknown, but the knowing the porosity will lead to a much  better understanding
              of how liquids produced by melting of the  mantle are transported to the ocean
              floor as eruptions of magma.  This project plans to measure the porosity of
              mantle materials that  are heated and pressurized to simulate conditions in the
              Earth. The  porosity that they intend to measure will be important for 
              understanding result of the major ocean ridge experiment called  MELT which
              will be conducted in the next year. They have  demonstrated that they can make
              the appropriate measurements on  compacted salt and water, and plan to extend
              their work to molten  basalt in mantle minerals.
