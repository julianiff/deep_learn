Abstract    :
              9504323: Kurtz/Ney  Abstract.  Research programs will be carried out in      the
              areas of Markov processes, stochastic analysis, chains with infinite    memory,
              large deviation theory, branching processes, and stochastic     control.  Work
              on Markov processes will focus on measure-valued      processes related to
              population genetics and other population models.  Work on large deviations will
              include both further theoretical developments and applications to simulation. 
              Branching process models for electron-photon cascades and related physical
              processes will be studied with additional applications of large deviation
              methods.  Theoretical developments for general stochastic control problems will
              include approximation methodology and existence  theorems for optimal singular
              controls.  New types of stochastic equations for Markov processes will be
              studied.   Markov processes are random processes whose future behavior depends
              on the past only through the present.  If you know the current "state" of a
              system having the Markov property, your ability to predict the future is not
              helped by additional information about the past.  Markov processes play an
              important role in the study of population genetics and in  descriptions of
              changing populations more generally, and will be studied in this context. 
              Markov processes are also important as models of physical phenomena such as
              cosmic rays, which will be investigated.  Problems to be considered include
              control, approximation, and extreme behavior.  An additional direction of
              research involves  processes which fail to have the "Markov property", but
              which have special kinds of long range memory.
