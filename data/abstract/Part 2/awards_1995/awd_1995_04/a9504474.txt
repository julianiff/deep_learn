Abstract    :
              9504474  Lempp       Lempp will investigate aspects of the central notions od 
              computability, decidability, and definability in various parts of  
              mathematics.  Computability in arithmetic gives rise to degree   structures,
              given by collections of sets of natural numbers of equal  information content. 
              Two related issues involved in this research are (i)   the existence of
              automorphisms for such structures (yielding   nondefinability results) and (ii)
              the decidability of fragments of their   first-order theories.  Computability
              in group theory involves the existence  of algorithms for deciding certain
              properties of finitely presented groups.   Lempp plans to determine the
              complexity of some of these problems in the   Kleene-Mostowski hierarchy, and
              to show the undecidability of related   problems for finite groups.      
              Computability, decidability, and definability are central notions  of
              mathematical logic, relevant to all of mathematics.  Lempp's   project deals
              with these notions, both inside his field of expertise,  computability theory,
              and in the connections to other areas.  As mentioned   above, computability in
              arithmetic classifies sets of natural numbers  according to their information
              content.  Lempp will investigate   the existence of transformations which
              preserve this content, and the  related question of deciding certain elementary
              properties of these sets.   In group theory the goal is to investigate the
              transfer of undecidable   problems from the infinite to the finite.  Lempp will
              also seek logical   criteria for "feasible" computability, which is to say the
              sort of   computations which could conceivably be done by machine.  ***
