Abstract    :
                 This investigation has three major objectives: (1) to   add new  algorithms
              and methodologies to the repertoire of   geometry techniques, including new
              approximation methods and   algorithms that are simpler and easier to implement
              than   ones; (2) to formulate precise algorithmic versions of a   large body of
               geometric problems from allied fields, in such a way that the   of
              computational geometry can be applied successfully and so   that the  community
              of largely theoretical computational geometers can   properly exposed to the
              more practical applications of the   (allied fields include cartography,
              computer vision,   design, graphics, manufacturing, etc); and (3) to
              disseminate  methodologies of computational geometry to applied   researchers
              who  work in allied fields but who have been largely unaware of   progress in 
              computational geometry, particularly since it has been   construed as a 
              primarily theoretical instrument.  The third objective is   through discussions
              of research directions with contacts in   research labs and through publishing
              papers for conferences   and in  journals whose readership includes a breadth
              of engineering   disciplines.
