Abstract    :
              9550720  Barrera  New Mexico State University proposes the improvement of their 
              science and engineering facilities by purchasing a high resolution  scanning
              electron microscope.  The first objective is to acquire  and install an
              environmental scanning microscope which can image  both "natural" specimens,
              without drying or coating, as well as  conventionally prepared conducting
              specimens, with high resolution,  at low as well as high scanning electron
              energies.  This will  enhance on-going research projects on endophytic fungi,
              senso-  neural cell ultrastructure and characterization of stomatal  structure
              cells in wilty plants.  The second year objective is to  acquire and install an
              x-ray detecting system, and hardware and  software for digital image
              acquisition, storage, manipulation and  analysis.  Sixteen undergraduate and
              nine graduate students will  participate in the first two years alone.  ***
