Abstract    :
              The Winston-Salem/Forsyth County CPMSA Project addresses its  purpose: to
              develop, provide and make systemic a high quality  math/science educational
              program which expands access,  participation and achievement of K-12 minority
              students who are  under-represented in science, engineering and math pipeline. 
               Project goals are: to significantly increase K-12 student  participation in
              high interest mathematics and science activities;  to significantly  increase
              minority K-12 student participation in  gatekeeper courses for math, science,
              engineering and technology  college preparation; to significantly increase
              minority college  student majors in SMET fields; and to put in place a systemic
               reform of curriculum, instruction, and community involvement which 
              facilitates ongoing realization of the first three goals.  Project  objectives
              are: (a) to provide a broad scope of programs which  provide weekly and summer
              opportunities for all minority students  and parents to participate in science
              and mathematics activities in  their neighborhoods, in their schools and at
              project collaborators'  facilities; (b) to strengthen the capacity of the
              teachers in the  delivery system to develop and deliver the high interest and 
              motivational activities; (c) to motivate minority students and  their
              parents/guardians with opportunities to participate in high  interest
              activities; (d) to mentor the minority students with  university and industry
              faculty entering the gatekeeper courses, to  encourage their successful
              participation in the gatekeeper courses  and continuation with those courses;
              (e) to evaluate the students  and monitor their progress through the project
              each year; (f) to  demonstrate the ability to replicate and continue the
              project's  strategies and interventions which correlate significantly with 
              reaching project goals--statewide, regionally, and nationally.    Project
              partners collaborating with Project JUST are:  Winston-  Salem State
              University; Wake Forest University; SciWorks (The  Science Cen ter and
              Environmental Park of Forsyth County); The Urban  League; and the YMCA.  Each
              collaborating partner will provide  direct services to students of the targeted
              project population:  approximately 14,000 K-12 African-American students living
              in the  city's designated Enterprise Community, a 15 square mile section  from
              which most elementary school student are bussed to achieve  racial integration
              in 32 schools.  Project activities will be  provided: in neighborhoods, through
              partnering with the housing  authority and churches; at all K-12; at
              Winston-Salem State  University; at Wake Forest University; and at SciWorks. 
              Project  activities will involve mentors, through partnering with  professional
              SMET associations and with local businesses (e.g., RJR  Tobacco).  Project
              activities will include students' family  involvement.  School system
              curriculum/instructional reform of K-12  science and math will be achieved
              through teacher driven staff  development, provided by strong science/math
              teacher and designed  to be systemically accessible through site-based
              expectations and  scheduling.  ***
