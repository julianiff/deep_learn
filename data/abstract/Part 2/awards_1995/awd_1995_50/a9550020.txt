Abstract    :
              9550020  Prigo    The Continuous Assessment in Science Project's main goal is to
               pilot and evaluate a model of professional development aimed at  advancing
              teacher's skills in conducting everyday assessment of  students and improving
              their science content knowledge.  It is  hoped that through this model teachers
              will build an  understanding of continuous assessment: its position in the 
              context of documenting and reporting student growth; and its  match with the
              use of hands-on, inquiry-based approaches for  developing scientific concepts,
              processes and dispositions.  The  elementary school teachers are expected to
              develop strategies for  conducting such everyday assessment of student learning
              that are  integrated and compatible with instructional activities and 
              classroom management.  The project will begin by working closely  with twelve
              teachers to plan, practice, document and evaluate  strategies for continuous
              assessment and the professional  development necessary for preparing teachers
              to use them.  During  the second year the project will work with working a
              larger  number of teachers to evaluate the model.  During the final year  of
              the project an action guide will be published to support the  dissemination of
              the model through Vermont's SSI project.    The cost sharing will be 18 percent
              of the NSF portion.  ***
