Abstract    :
              To promote high achievement in science, math, and engineering  (SMET), the
              United States must commit and offer resource to  students of color, who are
              underrepresented in these fields. SHARP  is an exciting, multi-faceted summer
              program that will kindle  minority youth's flame for science, math, and
              engineering--and for  careers in SMET fields.  Through SHARP, 50
              African-American,  Latino, and Asian students will be exposed to institutions
              of  higher education, minority professionals in SMET career fields, and 
              hands-on opportunity to work on SMET-related projects.    In the summers of
              1995, 1996 and 1997, SHARP will run a 4-week, 5-  day-per-week commuter camp
              for 50 participants on the campus of the  University of Massachusetts at
              Lowell.  Half will come from Boston  and half from Lowell, a small,
              economically distressed city north  of Boston.  They will learn by doing in the
              University's classrooms  and its science, engineering, and computer labs.  They
              will be  instructed by minority professionals from technology corporations  and
              colleges that are current ESRA partners; these organizations  and individuals
              will also show them that people of color can and do  achieve successful careers
              in these fields, a critical missing  piece for so many minority youth.  Field
              trips will expose them to  colleges and businesses and provide further options
              for hands-on  learning.  Parent activities and follow-up opportunities will 
              ensure that students continue to build on their newly acquired  purposefulness
              and skills.    SHARP involves a strong partnership of businesses, colleges, 
              schools, and other organizations.  It is coordinated by ESRA, a 
              minority-controlled organization that is dedicated to minority  access to SMET
              fields.  ESRA has 9 years experience in just this  type of educational and
              support program, including substantial  experience in programs for inner-city,
              middle school students of  color.  ***
