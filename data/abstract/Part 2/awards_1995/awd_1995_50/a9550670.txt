Abstract    :
              9550670  Morell  The proposed research would focus on how to compute error flow 
              information for a variety of programming models, with the dual goal  of
              reducing the amount of information that needs to be collected to  support its
              uses, as well as reducing the amount of time necessary  to collect the error
              flow information.  The objectives are (1) to  develop algorithms that will
              significantly decrease the time  necessary to analyze the error flow of
              sequential and parallel  computer programs; (2) to implement and evaluate those
              algorithms  on a parallel machine; and (3) to evaluate the efficacy of using 
              error flow information in a variety of contexts.  One graduate and  two
              undergraduate students will participate in the proposed work.  ***
