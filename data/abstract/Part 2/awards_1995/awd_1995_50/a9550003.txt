Abstract    :
              HRD-9550003  *BOWEN*  The University of Washington was awarded a three-year
              grant in  1992 from the National Science Foundation to undertake activities  to
              recruit and retain students with disabilities in science,  engineering, and
              mathematics (SEM) programs.  The project is  called DO-IT (Disabilities,
              Opportunities, Internetworking, and  Technology).  DO-IT has helped high school
              students with  disabilities realize their academic and career potential, and 
              transition to college studies in SEM; SEM faculty have become  more receptive
              and capable of including students with  disabilities in their courses; and
              parents, service providers,  and the public have become more aware of the
              potential  contributions and special needs in SEM fields of individuals with 
              disabilities.    Specific DO-IT activities proposed for continuation include:
              (1)  summer study programs which allow high school students with  disabilities
              to explore SEM fields and learn college transition  skills and strategies; (2)
              a mentoring program that matches high  school students with disabilities with
              successful role models in  SEM academic programs and careers; (3) Internet
              access for  communication and information retrieval; (4) disability awareness 
              presentations to faculty; (5) transition and adaptive technology  workshops;
              and (6) dissemination of program and disability-  related information through
              electronic resources, printed  materials, and videotapes.  DO-IT efforts are
              proposed to be  extended to:  (1) make undergraduate campus SEM programs more 
              accessible to individuals with disabilities; (2) help students  with
              disabilities successfully complete college; (3) help  students transition to
              employment and graduate studies; (4)  increase outreach efforts to students
              with disabilities; (5)  identify factors leading to college completion and
              employment in  SEM; and (6) increase dissemination activities.
