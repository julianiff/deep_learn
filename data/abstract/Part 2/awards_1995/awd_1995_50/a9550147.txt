Abstract    :
              The research study proposed here continues the process the principal
              investigator has already begun in building a theoretical framework for
              connecting in-school and out-of-school mathematics learning and practice and
              test framework.  during this process will (a) investigate how middle school
              students use mathematics concepts and processes in a variety of out-of-school
              situations, and (b) work with two middle school teachers to develop curriculum
              ideas to facilitate connection making by students and investigate whether
              students are connecting their in-school and out-of-school mathematics learning
              and practice.
