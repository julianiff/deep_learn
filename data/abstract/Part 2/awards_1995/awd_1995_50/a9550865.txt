Abstract    :
              Quantum wells are fabricated by placing a thin layer of a smaller  band gap
              semiconductor (well) between two thick layers of a  larger band gap
              semiconductor (barrier).   The band gaps align  yielding a one-dimensional
              square well potential for an electron.    Through this project, reflectivity
              and photoluminescence  (emission from the sample following excitation)
              measurements are  performed on five different single quantum wells and a pair
              of  double quantum wells (two wells separated by a thin barrier)  which yields
              the energy levels of the electron and thus  demonstrates the formation of
              discrete states in square wells,  the dependence on barrier height and well
              widths, and the  formation of symmetric and antisymmetric states due to
              tunneling  and overlap in double quantum wells.   Lifetime measurements are 
              performed by time-resolved photoluminescence on doping  superlattices
              (semiconductor with alternate regions of n- and p-  type doping).   These
              experiments can modernize any undergraduate  curriculum and may be treated as
              experiments in modern physics  and quantum mechanics.   They are timely and
              relate to current  technology and research.   The semiconductor
              heterostructures are  applied as tunable quantum well lasers and light-emitting
              diodes.
