Abstract    :
              This project is funding the purchase of a state-of-the-art Gas 
              Chromatography/Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) for undergraduate  instruction in
              chemistry.   Addition of this instrumentation  affects many of the
              undergraduate courses, including General  Chemistry, Organic Chemistry,
              Physical Chemistry, and  Instrumental Analysis.   Many new experiments are
              being  introduced into the undergraduate curriculum.   In particular,  these
              experiments (1) give students an introduction to the theory  of mass
              spectrometry and demonstrate a variety of aspects of  electron impact and
              chemical ionization spectra; (2) teach  students the basics of structural
              characterization by mass  spectral fragmentation patterns; (3) give students
              hands-on  experience with a GC/MS and provide exposure to modern 
              computer-assisted equipment; (4) give students the opportunity to  use spectral
              library searching routines; and (5) show students  the application of tandem
              analytical methods and the utility of  these techniques for mixture analysis.
