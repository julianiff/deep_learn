Abstract    :
                To increase the representation of minorities in science,  engineering, and
              mathematics (SEM) careers, the University of  Pennsylvania proposes a
              undergraduate Research Careers for Minority  Scholars (RCMS) program designed
              to retain in SEM disciplines high-  potential minority student enrollees. 
              Because it builds on  existing strategies at Penn, particularly those designed
              to  encourage and prepare students for SEM careers, the RCMS program  will have
              economies of cost and scale.      The faculty mentor group will be comprised of
              seven faculty from  Penn, and three from our cooperating institutions. Lincoln
              and  Cheyney Universities.  Minority undergraduate SEM majors from all  three
              schools will be eligible to participate in RCMS program.
