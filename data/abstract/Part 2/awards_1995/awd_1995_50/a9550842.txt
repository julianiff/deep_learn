Abstract    :
              The Department of Computer and Information Sciences is developing  a hands-on
              laboratory, of 10 workstations, to enhance and  facilitate computer science
              majors' understanding of and experience  in networking and data communication
              applications.    This  equipment, which enables students to work in a
              supervised  laboratory environment, is used to implement practical exercises 
              that are coordinated with course lectures.   Emphasis is on  projects that
              allow students to explore the first four layers, and  the application layer, of
              the ISO/OSI model.   Using TCP/IP and  network simulation, activities permit
              students to experiment with,  simulate and troubleshoot different network
              configurations,  internetworking, interconnectivity, protocols, and LAN
              topologies.    Network design problems, which reinforce the concepts of
              top-down  design and modularity learned in software engineering and systems 
              analysis and design, are also addressed.   A network analyzer  permits students
              to monitor network traffic.   Guest lectures by  former students adds another
              layer of expertise to the curriculum.    Students are exposed to the networking
              tools and applications used  by industry and research.   Evaluation will be
              attitudinal and the  course will be disseminated at an SIGSE panel discussion
              and in a  laboratory manual for networking courses.
