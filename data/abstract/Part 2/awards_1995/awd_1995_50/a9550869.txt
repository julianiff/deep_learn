Abstract    :
              This project is purchasing a capillary gas chromatograph (GC) for  investigative
              chemistry laboratories at the college.   This  equipment aids the project
              director in redirecting the organic  and biochemistry laboratories toward
              real-life research  experiences.   Students require capillary GC systems in
              such  independent research as the isolation of sulforaphane from  broccoli
              cultures.   New projects include a multidisciplinary  project on
              characterization of microbial communities in soil by  GC analysis of fatty acid
              profiles.   Ready availability of  capillary GC instrumentation for student
              projects is essential to  expand the project-oriented laboratory approach the
              science  curriculum and to incorporate practical GC theory into the 
              research-oriented projects.
