Abstract    :
              The American Society of Plant Physiologists (ASPP) is organizing a  two day
              workshop to explore ground breaking approaches for  disseminating educational
              information in a way that will build a  strong link between education and
              research.  The expected outcome  of the workshop will be the design and
              initiation of an innovative  plant science education publication to be
              published and distributed  as a supplement to one of ASPP's plant science
              research journals  inclusive of all plant biologists.
