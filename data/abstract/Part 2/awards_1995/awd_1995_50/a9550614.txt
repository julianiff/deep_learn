Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with the general problem of translating  policies
              designed to raise standards in math and science education  into classroom
              practice.  It attempts to identify how three  different types of
              mechanisms-management-based mechanisms,  professionally-based mechanisms, and
              client-based mechanisms-exert  pressure and provide support for teachers to eo
              upgrade  instructional practices.  It also examines how the efficacy of  these
              different mechanisms varies across different settings, in  particular settings
              serving students from different SES  backgrounds.  The project involves
              intensive and detailed fieldwork  in 14 schools:  12 public schools, half
              located in central cities  and half located in suburban areas, and 2 private
              schools.  Schools  were selected form two states representing different policy 
              contexts.  data include interview data from district and school 
              administrators, teachers, and parents; surveys of parents and  teachers; logs
              of parent-principal and parent-teacher interaction;  and review of classroom
              tasks.  The study is designed to provide an  early indication of the progress
              of reforms by analyzing the local  mechanisms which promote them.  It will also
              identify areas of  possible concern which may require policy attention.
