Abstract    :
              The research project considers theoretically the observation that  household
              purchases of durable goods are typically infrequent,  rather than continuous. 
              One explanation for this pattern is the  existence of transactions costs that
              make continuous updating of  the durables stock too costly.  This work presents
              an analytical  solution to the optimal consumption problem of a consumer facing
               transactions costs.  These costs may take any of a class of forms.   They may
              represent a linear adjustment costs or search costs,  applied to either a
              divisible or an indivisible durable good.  The  infrequent purchases generated
              in this model may help to explain  the volatility and persistence of changes in
              aggregate durables  expenditure.    The interactive component includes:  al
              informal lunch/discussion  with women faculty and graduate students from
              Cambridge/Boston  universities, followed by a formal academic seminar by a
              women  scholar; teaching an advanced graduate course in macroeconomics;  and
              promoting visibility of academic and research opportunities for  women through
              an undergraduate speakers program.
