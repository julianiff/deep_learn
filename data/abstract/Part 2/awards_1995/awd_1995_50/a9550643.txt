Abstract    :
              9550643  Hill    Planning activities related to the investigation of Bartonella 
              bacilliformis receptors and signaling mechanisms are proposed.   Specific aims
              of the planning activities include (1) performance of  preliminary
              investigations on Bartonella bacilliformis (2)  collaborations with Dr. Hoover
              (at Vanderbilt) and Dr. Minnick (at  the University of Montana) and (3) attend
              several scientific  meetings.  The specific aims of the research are (1)
              identify and  characterize the Bartonella receptor on host cell surfaces (2) 
              determine whether protein phosphorylation has a role in the uptake  of
              Bartonella into host cells (3) determine whether outer membrane  proteins of
              Bartonella can stimulate host target cells to  proliferate.  ***
