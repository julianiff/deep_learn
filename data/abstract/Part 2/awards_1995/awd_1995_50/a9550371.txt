Abstract    :
              Dr. Patricia McBride is collaborating with members of Princeton  University's
              Physics Department on studies of B physics at Collider  Detectors.  The studies
              extend to topics related to Heavy Flavor  Physics and CP Violation.  The main
              focus of this research is on  design studies for a hadron collider experiment
              dedicated to B  physics and on the development of particle physics detectors, 
              particularly in the area of particle identification.    Interactive activities
              include:  a seminar series in which speakers  are invited to the give lectures
              on research topics in physics in  which lectures include women who are active
              in research both at the  junior and senior level; organizing a series of
              informal seminars  for the graduate students designed to be pedagogical in
              nature and  provide background material on a variety of research topics; 
              teaching an introductory physics course.
