Abstract    :
               9550538  Meyers    This materials development project is the result of a joint
              effort by Miami University and the National Science Teachers Association
              (NSTA).  The project will combine the resources of the Univeristy and the
              publication department of NSTA, to work with schools to produce an innovative
              science journal for children in grades 3-6, a teacher support manual, a parent
              support manual, and a supporting computer network that will connect children
              with scientists and university science students in scientific inquiry.  The
              journal will be the first national journal devoted to research scientists and
              children with an outlet for publication of scientific investigations conducted
              by children.                                                                   
                                     Given the strong record of accomplishment of the PI and
              the publications division of the National Science Teachers Association, the
              panel feel it is likely that the Dragonfly, Dragonfly Companions. the Dragonfly
              Net will be a quality product and recommends funding this project at a high
              priority level.  The Program Officer agrees with the panel and recommends
              funding this proposal.
