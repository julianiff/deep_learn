Abstract    :
              Through this project, the Department of Mechanical Engineering is  developing a
              new mechanical engineering laboratory course that  emphasizes computer-based
              interfacing and control of thermo-  mechanical equipment.   The course includes
              a strong design  component and represents a significant improvement in the 
              curriculum.   A special module of the course is being designed  for ME faculty.
                This module is also suitable as a continuing  education course for practicing
              ME engineers.   Students  participate in hands-on activities and learn both the
              theoretical  and the practical aspects of interfacing equipment with a 
              computer as well as mechanical design and control.   Some newly  purchased
              hardware is used for the experiments.   However,  students design and build
              their own hardware from design kits  that each receive.   This aspect of the
              course draws upon  students' past experience in design and includes the
              following  design considerations: project planning, concept generation and 
              evaluation, hardware design, and evaluation of the built assembly  in its
              control operation.  The controls aspect is based on the  use of an interface
              A/D board, a PC, and various thermomechanical  devices.   The students learn
              how to set up hardware and write  their own control programs in C.   Control
              aspects include  automated testing of a process or equipment; monitoring of 
              pressure, temperature, and shaft speed; warnings if setpoints are  exceeded;
              safety shutdown of equipment; and collection of data  and sequencing control.
