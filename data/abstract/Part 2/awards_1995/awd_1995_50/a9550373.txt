Abstract    :
              Dr. Sadosky's research is on harmonic analysis and operator theory,  fields in
              which the faculty of UC Berkeley is prominent, but  exclusively male.  Thus,
              her stay would enhance women's  participation in those important areas of
              mathematics and its  applications.  Dr. Sadosky will continue developing her
              work on  invariant operators acting on general scattering structures, which 
              leads to applications to the theory of classical operators in  product spaces,
              complex interpolation, and probability theory.    Interactive activities
              include:  acting as program committee member  at the Mathematical Sciences
              Research Institute at Berkeley,  teaching a graduate course, and giving
              lectures and seminars at the  University.
