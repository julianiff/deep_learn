Abstract    :
                The University of California (UCI) Summer Science Camp Academy is  directed
              toward increasing the interest, participation and success  of Hispanic middle
              school students in science, mathematics,  engineering and technology (SMET). 
              The objectives are (1) to  strengthen interest and participation in science and
              mathematics  among male and female students, with limited-English proficiency; 
              (2) to connect science, mathematics, technology, and communication  skills to
              these students' everyday lives and concerns; (3) to  involve students in
              hands-on investigations in science, mathematics  and technology-including
              research in which they participate with  Hispanic scientist who serve as role
              models; (4) to provide career  exploration by visits to local industries, and
              counseling  concerning the academic pathway into SMET fields-with Hispanic 
              undergraduate science majors serving as mentors; (5) to involve  parents in a
              comprehensive set of family activities which heighten  their understanding of
              the accessibility of careers in SMET fields  to their children and to increace
              their involvement in their  children's education; and (6) to develop the
              project's science,  mathematics, technology and writing activities-including
              its  bilingual instructional approaches-for national dissemination.     The
              focus of the program will be on project-based learning on  topics essential for
              understanding biology:  molecular biology,  genetics, and their relation to the
              structure and properties of  DNA.  Solving problems in these areas will require
              students to  develop and use mathematical, computer, and writing skills.  
              Students will work together in collaborative teams as they conduct  hands-on
              experiments and computer simulations.  They will use  computer tools to assist
              them in collecting, analyzing and  representing data.  They will maintain lab
              books in which they  record their hypotheses, observations, and conclusions. 
              In  addition, each team will prepare a research paper; they will them  present
              the paper or ally at the Academy Graduation for  participants, their families,
              school district participants, and UCI  faculty and staff.  ***
