              A Program of      Dissemination and Education about Mathematics on the Internet
                        The Internet is becoming an increasingly fertile source for 
              information and tools of use and interest to the mathematics  community.  These
              resources range from programs and class notes to  data sets for statistics and
              discussions of timely topics vital to  the mathematical community.  Many
              persons who would benefit from  these resources are unable to do so because of
              a lack of knowledge  of what is available and a lack of understanding of how to
              access  items on the Internet.  Based on experience with the Internet in 
              establishing and running the Mathematics Archives, this project is  informing
              the mathematical community about available resources on  the Internet and
              educating them on how to access those resources.   This will be accomplished
              with an ambitious program consisting of  presentations at sectional meetings of
              the MAA and running special  sessions, workshops, and minicourses at national
              and regional  meetings, such as those of the MAA/AMS, AMATYC, and ICTCM.  The 
              impact of this program on the mathematical community is expected to  be
              substantial.
