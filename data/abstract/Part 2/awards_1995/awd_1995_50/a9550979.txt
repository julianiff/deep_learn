Abstract    :
              This project is designed to enhance the laboratory learning  experience in
              courses populated by chemistry, biology, and pre-  professional majors.   Using
              the requested Fourier Transform  Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) in several
              laboratories (organic,  instrumental, physical, biochemistry, and research),
              students  discover molecular and quantitative information about diverse 
              chemical substances.   Several innovative experiments to enhance  student
              learning result in the discovery of the relationship  between hydrogen bonding
              and physical state and hydrogen bond  strength and electronegativity;
              measurement of bond distances  from rotational energies and bond dissociation
              energies from  overtone spectra; qualitative and quantitative analysis of 
              environmental samples; and examination of changes in protein and  nucleic acid
              secondary structure.   The FTIR also facilitates an  ongoing research project
              to determine pesticide persistence in  environmental matrices.   Through use of
              the FTIR in successive  laboratories, students headed for graduate study or the
               environmental workforce are well prepared for the research and  testing
              applications of academic, industrial, private, and  governmental laboratories.
