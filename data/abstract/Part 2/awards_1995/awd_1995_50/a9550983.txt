Abstract    :
              In view of the rapidly growing applications of ultrasound and  optics (lasers in
              particular) in research, industry, and  medicine, it is imperative to give
              students some hands-on  experience with these techniques.   Ultrasonic and
              optical waves  are alike in the sense that they both belong to wave-related 
              phenomena.   This project funds the purchase of the equipment  necessary to
              develop a modern undergraduate laboratory in  wave-related phenomena, which can
              eventually replace obsolete  equipment in the Mechanics and Optics Laboratory. 
                 In this  laboratory, four novel experiments that cover basic linear and 
              nonlinear wave phenomena are taught.   They are (1) interaction  between light
              and sound; (2) ultrasonic Doppler effect used in  medicine; (3) radiation force
              and optical tweezers; and (4) chaos  and solitons.   The primary purpose of
              these experiments is to  teach students physical principles.   Students also
              learn how to  apply these principles to challenges in real life.   
              Additionally, students have the opportunity to learn computerized 
              data-acquisition and analysis techniques, which are essential for  success in
              the present-day workforce.
