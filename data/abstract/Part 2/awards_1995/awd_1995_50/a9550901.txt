Abstract    :
              This project obtains equipment for use in two biology courses,  Procaryotic
              Microbiology and Introductory Genetics, that enables  the university to improve
              the instructional laboratory experience  of undergraduates taking these courses
              in preparation for  transfer to larger 4-year institutions.   Specifically,
              this  project provides equipment for hands-on instruction in modern  genetic
              techniques such as DNA isolation and gel electrophoresis.    The new equipment
              includes a microcentrifuge, pipettors, gel  electrophoresis equipment, a gel
              camera system, and a Macintosh  computer.   The molecular genetic experiments
              enable students to  comprehend the genetic technology that is affecting the
              society  in which they live.
