Abstract    :
              9550545  Jones    A series of computer driven projects that engage students in
              creating atoms, molecules, and crystals and then predicting and testing their
              properties along with environmental consequences is the format of this high
              school chemistry course.   Based on  the Russian materials "To Create the
              Universe," the course is CD-ROM-based, with an accompanying "mini-textbook," a
              manual on small-scale laboratories, a teacher's guide, and a teacher-training
              workshop kit.  The topics include  the design of atoms and molecules of the
              first 36 elements and a study of their properties.  The materials embody design
              challenges to be completed with powerful software and computer applications. 
              This software, including both commercial and newly developed programs, offers
              flexible and motivating situations so students can design new structures and
              experiments related to abstract concepts in chemistry.  Students learn these
              concepts by interactively controlling computer visualizations and animations of
              dynamic atomic and molecular behavior.   National leaders in curriculum
              development for chemistry in the US and in Russia are involved in design and
              preparation of materials and guidance is provided by a prestigious
              international advisory board
