Abstract    :
              The ultimate goal in meteorite-asteroid studies is to understand  the links
              between meteorite classes and their asteroid parent  bodies.  This will allow
              effective use of detailed knowledge of  meteorite petrology to study records
              they preserve of solar system  formation in the asteroid regions.  This
              research is focused on  asteroid observations at spectroscopic resolution
              sufficient to  define specific mineralogies and meteoritic linkages, and these 
              telescopic observations will be supported with laboratory analog  measurements.
               Certain asteroids have been selected on the basis of  their anomalous
              low-resolution IR spectral properties, recently  discovered among the results
              of the Seven Color Infrared Asteroid  Survey of smaller (-50 K,) main-belt
              objects (Clark et al. 1994).   These asteroids are targeted for further study
              due to their  promising affinities to some of the more elusive meteorite parent
               bodies.  At project conclusion, a modified model for asteroid belt  evolution
              will be presented.    Interactive activities include:  1) a graduate course
              will be  taught on astronomy of the Solar System, 2) a seminar will be  offered
              on current readings on proto-planetary nebulae and star  formation regions,
              such as these fields have come to bear on  studies of the meteorite record, and
              3) a workshop seminar will be  led for graduate and undergraduate students with
              the purpose of  constructing an introductory astronomy class curriculum.  On
              the  theory that the best student is a teacher, students will be asked  to lead
              the class.
