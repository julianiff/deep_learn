Abstract    :
              The Mobile Aero System Test (MAST) laboratory provides hands-on  design and test
              experience for teams of undergraduate  aeronautical engineering students.   The
              lab consists of a  nonflying, instrumented, aircraft test bed with both ground
              and  air propulsive systems.   The use of MAST lab provides the real-  world
              educational impact of actual aircraft use with the safety  of ground-based
              experiments.   Current laboratories teach  individually the parts of an
              aircraft with little regard to the  complete system.   MAST lab is an excellent
              venue to provide  exposure to the interactions within the complete aircraft
              system.    New undergraduate experiments emphasize the principles of 
              concurrent engineering in the areas of composite structures,  propulsion,
              guidance and control, and most importantly, systems  integration.   The
              laboratory is also being transported to local  schools, conferences, and
              special community events to promote  technology-related careers.
