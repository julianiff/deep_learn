Abstract    :
              9550658  Weiler  The American Society of Limnology and Oceanography proposes to
              hold  a workshop on the use of emerging computer technologies and aquatic 
              science data bases as undergraduate teaching resources.  These  tools enable
              any student with access to the internet and the  appropriate software,
              regardless of geographic location, to both  access and manipulate some the
              exceptional data bases presently  available through the Internet or on CD ROM. 
              The interactive  capability of Mosaic will enable students to ask their own 
              questions and manipulate data sets in ways of their own choosing,  and on a
              scale not possible with traditional student laboratory or  field experiments. 
              This is an exciting and challenging new way to  introduce students to the power
              of the scientific method.  The  workshop will bring together educators and data
              base managers to  discuss the emerging technologies in the context of
              undergraduate  teaching, to obtain hands-on experience with some of the
              existing  data bases, to develop a resource guide aquatic science information 
              presently available on CD ROM and the Internet, and to develop  recommendations
              on how best to assemble or enhance resources for  use in interactive hands-on
              undergraduate aquatic science  education.  Facilities will also be provided for
              materials used for  undergraduate aquatic science education and for sharing
              slide and  video materials used for undergraduate courses.  The workshop, to 
              be held in conjunction with the Society's annual meeting (June 11-  15, 1995
              Reno, Nevada).
