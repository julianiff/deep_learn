Abstract    :
              The Calumet region (East Chicago, Gary, Hammond, and neighboring  parts of
              Northwest Indiana and Illinois) has a very large minority  student population
              with a low rate of enrollment in post-secondary  education.  The objective of
              this program is to demonstrate to  these students that there are excellent job
              opportunities in  engineering and science where graduates can earn a good
              living  while doing work they enjoy with interesting people.  The focus is  on
              a five-week summer program for students entering grades 8 or 9,  with follow-up
              activities for succeeding summers.  The program is  a cooperative activity of
              Purdue University Calument with the Gary  and East Chicago school systems; it
              is administered by Purdue  Calument and guided by a steering committee made up
              of  representatives from Purdue Calument, Gary, East Chicago, and the 
              Companies supporting the program.  The key feature is the structure  which ties
              science, math, and applications together; thus topics  are chosen so that the
              participants see the importance of math as  a basic tool, and its application
              to engineering and science.  The  mornings are primarily
              lecture/discussion/demonstration; the  afternoons are hands-on (laboratory and
              computer usage) sessions or  industrial tours.  A topic that demonstrates the
              format is DC  electric circuits (science and hands-on lab),along with 
              simultaneous linear equations (math) PSpice (computer program to  simulate
              electric circuits), and Northern Indiana Public Service  Company (plant visit
              to observe and meet engineers for an electric  utility distribution system).
