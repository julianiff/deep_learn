              Physics         Title: Project Oriented Interactive Undergraduate Laboratory   
                     This is a proposal to develop a project oriented interactive 
              undergraduate laboratory course that would allow physics and  astronomy
              students to develop a synthesis of and confidence in what  they have learned. 
              It provides opportunities to experience the  process of learning new physical
              principles through experiments.   In addition, the students will acquire skills
              in instrumentation  and modem experimental techniques, data reduction, and
              modeling  that will enhance their qualifications for other career options.  
              This laboratory will therefore prepare undergraduate physics and  astronomy
              students to pursue a broad range of career options.
