              and forging partnerships.  At the  completion of the project, the state will be
              ready to implement a  comprehensive global education plan through models,
              technology  teacher training awareness campaigns, and ongoing partnerships.   
              Cost sharing is 232% and includes funds from the state, other  Federal
              agencies, corporations and other sources.
