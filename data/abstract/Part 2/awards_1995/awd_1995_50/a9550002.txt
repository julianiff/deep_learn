Abstract    :
              9550002  Kenney    IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF TEACHERS OF
              MATHEMATICS STANDARD IN DISCRETE MATHEMATICS, PHASE II    Boston College will
              develop a nationwide cadre of 300 grade 7-12 teachers at six sites (California,
              Georgia, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, and Ohio) who will activate the
              discrete mathematics standard in their classrooms and share instructional
              experiences with their students and colleagues.  The three-year project, which
              builds on an earlier NSF-supported project, also targets 60 collegiate faculty
              who teach mathematics or mathematics education courses to future teachers. 
              Participants attend a three-week summer institute and two in-service follow-up
              days during the subsequent academic year, and maintain e-mail (and other)
              communication with a designated instructional team member.  The college faculty
              participate in these same activities, implement a course in discrete
              mathematics or topics in discrete mathematics within an existing course that
              includes pre-service teachers at their home institutions, and conduct other
              in-service activities in discrete mathematics as professional development
              opportunities for teachers.  Summer institutes include opportunities for both
              residential and commuter participants.      Summer institutes and follow-up
              activities target discrete mathematics content and pedagogy, leadership,
              equity, and assessment.  Project evaluation includes assessment of progress in
              achieving project goals and objectives, effectiveness of participants, and
              project impact at the classroom and school or district level.   Cost-sharing
              from the universities housing the six project sites represents 18% of the NSF
              award amount.
