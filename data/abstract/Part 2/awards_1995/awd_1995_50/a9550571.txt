Abstract    :
              The Tidewater Summer Science Camp is a four-week summer enhancement  project in
              mathematics and science at Norfolk State University for  minority 7th and 8th
              grade students in the Tidewater, Virginia  area.  The major objective of the
              project are to involve students  in interesting investigations and projects
              involving real-world  science problems, to increase their knowledge, skill, and
               confidence in mathematics and science, and to increase the  likelihood that
              they will pursue mathematics/science careers.   Students are provided hands-on,
              scaled-down versions of science  problems in a laboratory setting; they use
              graphing calculators and  computers to aid in the mathematical analysis of
              science problems;  they go on field trips to obtain first-hand exposure to
              science  practitioners; and they are involved in intensive career  exploration
              and curriculum counseling.  A follow-up component of  the project includes
              Saturday sessions throughout the academic  year.  The program's ultimate goal
              of significantly increasing the  number of the participants selecting
              mathematics/science careers is  monitored by maintaining a data base of the
              participants' progress  through high school and beyond.  ***
