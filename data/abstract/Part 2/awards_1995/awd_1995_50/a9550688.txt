Abstract    :
              The Drew Saturday Science Academy Summer Camp will be a (4) week  residential
              SMET enrichment activity for (16) minority middle  school students in south
              Central Los Angeles.  The goal of the  program is to increase and improve the
              pool of qualified minority  students pursuing science, math, engineering, and
              technological  educational pathways.  Program objectives include: 1) Increasing
               the number of students successfully completing algebra and  geometry; 2)
              Improving the analytical reading and critical thinking  skills of these
              students; 3) Involving parents by increasing their  awareness of what students
              need to succeed in SMET Careers; 4)  Improve computer literacy; 5)
              Demonstrating knowledge of  exploratory research modalities; and 6) Demonstrate
              increased  awareness of science, math, engineering and technological career 
              opportunities.  This will be accomplished using the themes of  space, flight
              and aeronautics in hands-on labs.  Using the approach  it is anticipated that
              students will be more inclined to continue  on the SMET educational pathway.
