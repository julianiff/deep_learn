              Project Summary         A monthly series of interactive satellite
              teleconferences are  being delivered to faaulty who teach undergraduate
              engineering  students.  Each telecast will feature an innovative "best
              practice"  that can be adapted by participants.         NTU will work with NSF
              DUE staff to identify topics and  presenters.  NTU will produce, market,
              deliver and evaluate eight  one-hour, interactive teleconferences in 1995. 
              This grant enables  the seminars to be provided without charge to faculty
              participants.   A license to copy and reuse a videotape of the teleconferences
              as  well as the printed material provided to each registered college is 
              integral to this very cost-effective dissemination project.   Participants will
              be surveyed to determine the impact of their  participation.
