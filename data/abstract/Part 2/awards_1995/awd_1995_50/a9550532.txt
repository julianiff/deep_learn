Abstract    :
              ***  9550532  Khalsa    IntelliTools, Inc. is designing and developing
              Multi-Math Adaptations that work with multiple mathematics curricula, serve
              people with a multiplicity of disabilities, employ a multisensory approach, and
              use the power of multimedia computing combined with hands-on manipulatives and
              classroom activities.  Multi-Math Adaptations targets some 70,000 students
              nationwide in grades K-6 with orthopedic and visual impairments and encompasses
              three different types of instructional materials: multimedia computer
              activities built on IntelliTools product platforms; accessible mathematics
              manipulatives that closely parallel standard mathematics manipulatives but can
              be handled by people with visual and orthopedic impairments; and upgrades to
              IntelliTools platform products.  Some activities are generic and correspond to
              common mathematics teaching strategies and others are direct adaptations of
              those published by any of the three comprehensive elementary mathematics
              instructional materials development projects currently funded by NSF.  ***
