Abstract    :
              The proposal focuses on the effect of math and science skills  learned in high
              school on the later earnings, employment, and  education of non-college-bound
              youth.  While analyst have given  considerable attention to the effect of
              taking math and science on  getting into the pipeline to college, little
              attention has been  given to the effects of math and science for
              non-college-bound  youth.  At the same time, the employment and earnings of
              non-  college-bound youth have both fall substantially, causing serious 
              concern among policy makers.  The proposed study will be based on  the High
              School and Beyond Survey which covers a complete decade  after high school
              allows for detailed analysis of types of  importantly, the survey data cover
              recent years when the drop in  the earnings of non-college-educated people has
              been quite  severe. This work should provide valuable insights into the impact 
              of math and science skills learned in high school on outcomes  later in life
              for the large portion of youth who are non-college-  bound and are after
              overlooked in other work.
