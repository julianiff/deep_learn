Abstract    :
              This project adds a crucial laboratory component to two classes  taught by
              Department of Computer Science:  Operating Systems and  Networking and Data
              Communications.   These two courses have a  common need for
              experimentation-based, laboratory experience.   The  new laboratory has six
              workstations of various configurations plus  a file server.   This lab exists
              on its own subnet, isolated from  the general purpose lab while retaining
              access to its printers and  other services.   It is configured so that each
              machine has two  disks.   The second disk on each machine is provided for 
              experimentation--it can be manipulated and even trashed without  damaging the
              laboratory setup or the general purpose lab.   The  system is as diverse as
              possible, with machines from four different  classes of workstation.   Each
              class is configured differently, has  different requirements, and is used for
              different purposes.   The  networking media are different and varied.   Work is
              being done to  support the automation of machine reinstallation.   Students are
               responsible for machine reinstallation.  This project constructs a  laboratory
              environment to teach Operating Systems and Networking,  produces a set of
              laboratory manuals for each of these  classes--both in electronic hypertext and
              hardcopy forms--and  produces a set of new software, developed to facilitate
              the  laboratory experiments.
