Abstract    :
              9550081  Klanica    Cherry Creek School District, in cooperation with school
              districts in Colorado and New Mexico and Metropolitan State College in Denver,
              prepares 144 mathematics teachers in eighteen secondary schools to teach the
              Interactive Mathematics Program (IMP) in grades 9-12.   The five-year project
              provides direct and intensive support for all 144 mathematics teachers in those
              schools through a program of teacher enhancement that includes summer workshops
              (a three-week workshop prior to a teacher's first year of teaching IMP and a
              one-week workshop prior to each year s/he teaches a new level of IMP),
              quarterly Gatherings, and Immersion workshops.  Participants meet with project
              staff weekly and have a daily professional development period for up to two
              years.  At each of the schools, two teachers join the project in the first
              year.  Two or more teachers per school are added each year, so that -- over a
              four-year period -- every mathematics teacher at the school will have been
              enhanced by the project.       This experimental project provides significant
              opportunities for learning more about the critical issues involved in scaling
              up IMP implementation and how to make it cost-effective.  The project includes
              significant evaluation, a leadership component, and production of professional
              development materials to assist others with teacher enhancement and
              implementation of IMP.      Cost-sharing, which is 191% of the NSF award
              amount, is contributed primarily by school partners, with secondary
              cost-sharing from the National Interactive Mathematics Program, the Colorado
              Department of Education, U. S. West, and the Gates Foundation.
