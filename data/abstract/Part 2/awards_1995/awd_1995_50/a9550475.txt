Abstract    :
              9550475  Rommel    This experimental project tests and evaluates the potential
              of  using measurements and analysis of biological form (morphology)  to help
              students understand basic principles of biology.  The  study's goal is to
              determine the feasibility of helping K-12  teachers and especially middle
              school teachers, develop skills,  materials, and instructional models to teach
              students how to  collect and analyze measurements of their own bodies and then
              to  compare these measurements over time.  The study will determine  the
              relevance of the study of morphology to the needs, interests,  and abilities of
              science students.  In support of this study  teachers and students will be
              introduced to computer graphics  that will all them to customize illustrations
              of students'  skeletons and to compare these illustrations over time and to 
              other organisms' growth.  ***
