Abstract    :
              9550699  Maleque  Meharry Medical College seeks funding for research that would 
              investigate the influences of the ODC/polyamine system on the  process of
              neuronal differentiation by examining the interactions  between the
              ODC/polyamine system and GAP-43.  Furthermore, the  signal transduction
              pathways that may modulate these crucial  elements of neuronal differentiation
              will also be investigated.   The three specific aims of this work are:  (1)
              Determine the  developmental profiles of ODC, GAP-43 (activity, protein and
              m-RNA)  and the polyamine in the postnatal cerebellum and neo-cortex; (2) 
              compare the relationship between the ODC/polyamine system and GAP-  43 and to
              test their interdependence through inhibition of ODC  activity by DFMO; (3)
              study common signal transduction mechanisms  that may modulate both the
              ODC/polyamine system and GAP-43.  This  would be accomplished through
              examination of PKC activity and the  expression of isoforms and PI turnover. 
              Three graduate students  will participate in the proposed work.  ***
