Abstract    :
              Even the simplest of programs can be full of elusive errors.  The  study of
              program checkers, self-testing programs and self-  correcting programs was
              introduced in order to allow one to use a  program P to compute a function f
              without trusting that P works  correctly.  Many problems are easy to specify,
              but efficient  programs which solve them may be vepy complicated.  For such 
              problems, the proposed approaches to program correctness have  already show
              promise.  The goal of this project is to understand  how broadly these
              techniques apply.  This research will develop a  core of algorithmic techniques
              for writing fast and simple  checkers, self-correctors, and self-testers. 
              Previous research on  self-correctors and self-testers obtained theoretical
              tools and  insights which have been used in recent results in the theory of 
              interactive proof systems.  This research involves the study of the 
              relationships between these areas.  Other topics in the area of  computational
              learning theory and game theory will be studied.   These topics have
              applications to algorithms in reinforcement  learning, text correction,
              part-of-speech-tagging, DNA sequencing  and handwriting recognition.   
              Interactive activities include teaching a graduate course entitled  Program
              Correctness Probabilistic Proof Checking and Interactive  Proofs.
