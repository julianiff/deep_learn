Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to develop new methods for  chromosome mapping
              in salmonid fishes including banding techniques  using SINE sequences for
              chromosome identification, species-  specific and chromosome-specific paint
              probes, and in situ  hybridization using cosmid clones for localization of
              genes.   Although there is an extensive linkage map for allozyme loci in 
              salmonids, no single copy genes have been mapped to specific  chromosomes. 
              Construction of chromosome maps would greatly benefit  fisheries research and
              enhance the usefulness of salamonid fishes  as models for research in
              developmental genetics, ecological  genetics, and toxicology.  Accurate maps
              will also allow us to  reconstruct chromosome evolution.  Work on development
              of these  methods will be done during my visit to University of Washington in 
              the 1995-1996 academic year.  The University of Washington is  uniquely suited
              for this research because the School of Fisheries  maintains excellent
              laboratories for research on salmonid fishes  and expertise in the flow sorting
              of chromosomes and single copy in  situ hybridization exists in the department
              of Molecular Biology  and Biotechnology.  Dr. Phillips is developing
              collaborative  projects with faculty members in the School of Fisheries on 
              chromosome mapping and related projects.    Interactive activities include
              teaching a graduate seminar in  molecular systematics and giving guest lectures
              in the Molecular  Techniques class.
