Abstract    :
              Through this grant, the university is purchasing lasers and  associated
              spectroscopic equipment.   The approach in the project  is to combine the
              strengths of the chemistry and physics  curricula and to take advantage of the
              small class sizes  characteristic of the university.   In the upper-division 
              courses, equipment is shared between the two departments and  students from the
              two departments collaborate with each other.    An excited state lifetime
              experiment is being performed by both  sets of students.   In addition,
              chemistry students are exploring  molecular rotations, light scattering, and
              vibrational  spectroscopy.   Using essentially the same equipment, physics 
              students are studying the properties of laser light, measuring  the speed of
              light, exploring nonlinear-optical phenomena, and  characterizing dispersion in
              optical fibers.  The project also  affects lower-division students.   A new
              course, designed for  non-science-majors, centers on holography.   In this
              four-credit  course, containing both a lecture and laboratory component, the 
              nature of light is discussed along with introductory optics,  principles of
              measurement, physiology of vision, and quantum  versus classical effects.   In
              addition, a historical perspective  on many of these topics is presented. 
              Chemistry majors are  required to submit a senior research thesis based on
              experimental  work.   The equipment purchased expands the areas of research 
              accessible to these students.
