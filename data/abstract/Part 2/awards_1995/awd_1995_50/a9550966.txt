Abstract    :
              All undergraduate lab courses in the Department of Planetary  Science are being
              completely revised, and new lab courses  created, to deliver relevant science
              education to liberal arts  majors satisfying their science requirement, science
              majors in  other disciplines requiring a planetary perspective, and  education
              majors preparing to teach science.   Experiments  coordinate the treatment of
              measurements--the traditional  hands-on activity that distinguishes laboratory
              exercises from  homework problems--and the models that scientists use to 
              interpret data and explain how systems work.   Students use  realistic
              scientific tools to generate data and image-processing  techniques to examine
              special collections of data.   Students  performing image-processing exercises
              use the same data and tools  and make the same measurements and discoveries
              that scientists  have made, thus reinforcing concepts far more effectively than
               would passive examination of the same material.   The exercises  are designed
              to give students the opportunity to explore a  fundamental concept or process
              in depth and to discover its  connections to other knowledge and experience.  
              Most lab  exercises use computers in the expectation that science and  computer
              literacy levels reinforce each other.   One immediate  product of the project
              is an undergraduate lab manual, allowing  experiments to be adapted at other
              institutions.
