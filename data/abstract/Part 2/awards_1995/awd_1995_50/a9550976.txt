Abstract    :
              Through this grant, the Chemistry Department is upgrading the  data system
              (high-speed interface, pulse programmer, software,  workstation) on its
              Chemagnetics A-200 Fourier Transform NMR (FT-  NMR) spectrometer.   The upgrade
              includes an accessible Windows  environment, making routine use by students
              possible.   The  system significantly shortens signal optimization and data 
              acquisition times and permits true multitasking (independent data  acquisition
              and data processing), thus permitting the use of the  instrument in larger
              introductory-level courses.   The upgraded  instrument is used by chemistry
              majors and minors in several  courses (Organic Chemistry II, Descriptive
              Inorganic Chemistry  and Analytical Biochemistry), as well as by student
              research  interns.   Approximately 75 students per year will use the  upgraded
              instrument.   The goal of the project is to provide  chemistry majors and
              minors with significant experiences in the  theory and practice of the
              important technique of FT-NMR  spectroscopy by integrating the use of the
              instrument throughout  the curriculum.
