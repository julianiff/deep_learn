Abstract    :
                          Abstract:  This ethnographic and historical study of science 
              curriculum, policy, and their relationship describes and analyzes  the science
              that schools actually teach, and how, in what  circumstances, and with what
              private and public consequences  diverse constituents in and around public
              schools struggle to  define it.  It takes as its specific case, "integrated
              science," a  key component in state and national systemic reforms aimed at 
              redefining the traditional "layer-cake curriculum."  The locus for  the
              research is two comprehensive high schools in one of southern  California's
              largest school districts, and the policy arena in the  state.  The study will
              provide a comprehensive model of school  science, its politics, and its place
              in the broader scientific  culture that defines modern American culture.  By
              providing readers  the concrete and conceptual resources to understand school
              science  in the research sites and to recognize comparable findings in other 
              studies and schools that they know, the project is designed to  foster public
              deliberation about high school science.
