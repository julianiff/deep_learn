Abstract    :
              This project enables faculty to design laboratories in an  introductory
              environmental science class that raise the  scientific literacy of students
              with little or no scientific  background through applying the pedagogy of
              learning.   New  equipment supports the creation of four laboratory exercises. 
                These exercises are designed so that students apply the  scientific method
              using recently developed data collection  technology and computer software.  
              The laboratory exercise  sequence starts students at a relatively low
              conceptual level at  which learning occurs through manipulating physical
              objects to  observe cause and effect relationships.   It concludes with a 
              sampling exercise that involves students with a more  intellectually
              sophisticated level of conceptual and analytical  thought.   The emphasis
              placed on intellectual development in  this series of laboratory exercises is
              unique and highly useful  in developing scientific literacy.    The new
              equipment  introduces scientifically illiterate students to (1) cause and 
              effect relationships in science through the use of a ground water  model and
              computer simulations that allow students to manipulate  variables and watch the
              results, (2) methods of collecting and  analyzing data that range from
              qualitative observations to the  use of state-of-the-art environmental sensors
              and computers, and  (3) effective communication of their discoveries and
              excitement  in a written and mathematical form.
