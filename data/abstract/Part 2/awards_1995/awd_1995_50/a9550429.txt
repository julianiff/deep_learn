Abstract    :
              Effective resource management algorithms are critical to the  performance of a
              computer system.  This project will address open  questions related to
              effective resource management in parallel  computer systems, using a
              combination of experimental techniques,  simulation, and analytical performance
              models.  In particular the  project will investigate questions concerning high
              performance  parallel processor allocation policies, the interplay between 
              parallel processor allocation and memory management, the interplay  between
              parallel programming models and appropriate workloads for  evaluating parallel
              resource management algorithms, and the impact  of workload characteristics on
              the performance of particular  parallel system resource management algorithms. 
                The interactive component of this project involves:  (1) teaching  two
              courses, one a graduate seminar and one a core graduate or  undergraduate
              course, (2) hosting a Northwest Workshop on Academic  Careers for Women,
              modeled after the recent Computing Research  Association (CRA) workshops of the
              same title, (3) participation in  the mentoring and outreach efforts of the
              Women in Engineering  program at the University Washington, and (4) joint
              research with  Computer Science and Engineering faculty and students at the 
              University of Washington.
