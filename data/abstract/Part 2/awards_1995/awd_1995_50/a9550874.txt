Abstract    :
              The college is procuring two Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes,  primarily for
              introductory astronomy courses.   A 12-inch  telescope is being mounted
              permanently in an 18-foot dome on top  of the Strawbridge Observatory and an
              8-inch telescope is being  tripod mounted and is, therefore, portable.   By
              incorporating  observations with these two telescopes, the college is 
              dramatically increasing the opportunity for its students to  observe how
              astronomy is done, as well as to learn about the  importance of careful
              scientific observations and measurements.
