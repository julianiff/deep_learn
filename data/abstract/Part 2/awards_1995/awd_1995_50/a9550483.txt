              Education    This conference would bring together a total of 40 people
              including teachers, students, business persons and those with proven experience
              in building and providing low cost instrumentation/activities for science.  The
              conference would last for two weeks during which time the students and teachers
              would build and use the instrumentation and activities.  At the end of this
              period a proceedings of the conference would be prepared including the plans,
              activities and other low cost means of implementing laboratory based science. 
              These proceedings would then be disseminated both by electronic and printed
              form as widely as possible.  The cost share of this project is 13.8% of the
