Abstract    :
              Image and signal processing laboratory experiments support major  study courses
              of the upper-division undergraduate programs in  electrical engineering and
              computer engineering.   They offer  students powerful techniques and tools to
              apply, synthesize,  design, simulate, and implement state-of-the-art solutions
              to  modern engineering problems.   This project provides laboratory  equipment
              capable of supporting experiments in image processing.     The equipment also
              enhances educational capabilities in the area  of digital signal processing.  
              Such educational capabilities in  image and signal processing are critical to
              technical leadership  of U.S.  industry.  The new equipment establishes three
              PC-based  workstations to support eight programmed experiments based on 
              classical and modern approaches to image processing.   The  equipment also
              expands capabilities of design projects at the  senior level.
