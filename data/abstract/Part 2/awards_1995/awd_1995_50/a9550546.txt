Abstract    :
              9550546  Fisher    IMaST II is a year long eighth grade course that reflects the
              strong interactions between mathematics, science and technology.  Like the
              seventh grade model on which it is built, it requires 120 minute per day for
              the year; but students may be in separate classes. The coordinated content
              focuses on environmental science including biological, physical and Earth
              science; algebra and geometry; and communication, construction and
              transportation technologies.  The instruction is constructivist,
              activity-based, and uses the learning cycle.  It emphasizes problem-solving,
              using real world situations and applications and exhibits the connections among
              disciplines and between local and global concerns.  The materials are developed
              through the collaboration of master teachers, curriculum specialists and
              consultants from industry and education.  They are field tested in ten
              different schools. The modules include student and teacher editions, an
              implementation guide for administrators, and results of ethnographic studies
              and evaluation data for the program.
