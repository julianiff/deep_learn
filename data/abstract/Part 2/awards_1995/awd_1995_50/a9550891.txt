Abstract    :
                         Typical introductory statistics courses do not engage the  attention
              of modern students who come to class fresh from a world  of rapid-fire TV
              commercials, action movies, and dynamic video  games. This project, in
              conjunction with two companion projects,   uses the interactive capability of
              computers to teach basic  statistical concepts (distribution, variability,
              center, spread,  randomness, and association, to name a few) through hands-on 
              activities. Through creative use of technology, the content,  conduct, and
              quality of these courses are being revised to improve  the quantitative
              reasoning skills of all undergraduates, especially  those from traditionally
              nonquantitative disciplines. Students are  encouraged to learn for themselves
              by doing, observing, thinking  and consolidating while, the instructor becomes
              a catalyst and  coach instead of an authoritative lecturer.  The project is
              also  building a laboratory model that works for large sections of 
              introductory courses.
