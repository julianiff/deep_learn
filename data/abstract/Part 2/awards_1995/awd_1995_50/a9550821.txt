              Engineering        Technology and Computer Science Courses    The college is
              proposing to acquire six SUN workstations to improve  the laboratory
              experiences in engineering technology and computer  science curricula. The
              improvement plan proposed will introduce a  new course in VLSI system
              engineering technology. In this course,  students will be introduced to modern
              day VLSI software tools;  hierarchial representation and layout of VLSI
              systems;  computer-aided design of monolithic circuits at transistor gates; 
              circuits; register for routing and cell placement; error checking;  NMOS and
              CMOS processes; MOS inverter; dynamic CMOS and clocking;  special circuit
              layouts and technology mapping; and testability for  VLSI. The course will
              consist of lecture, laboratory, and team  projects on aspects of VLSI systems
              development including  specification, design, implementation, testing,
              validation,  performance evaluation, and integration into the operating 
              environment. Group management and team approach will be emphasized  for the
              projects.    As part of this proposed work, the college will undertake a major 
              enhancement of the computer-aided-laboratory for use in the six  academic
              departments within the division. The development of this  laboratory is vital
              to the success of the proposed emphasis in VLSI  systems courses. Students will
              be able to gain up-to-date  experiences needed in high technology industries.
