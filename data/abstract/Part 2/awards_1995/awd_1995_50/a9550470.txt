Abstract    :
              9550470  Gangolli    The University of  Washington's Mathematics Department and
              College of Education, in collaboration with four school districts in the state
              of Washington, will develop a teacher enhancement proposal for Creating a
              Community of Mathematics Learners.  The one-year planning grant establishes
              teams of K-12 teachers to create "portraits" of current practices in
              mathematics education within their schools, identify teacher leadership roles
              for addressing the discrepancies between current practices and the districts'
              visions for mathematics education, and develop five-year plans for using the
              envisioned leadership in their districts.    The planning grant further
              recognizes the desirability of and provides for the development of more than
              one plan to address leadership needs in large school districts.  The project
              being developed includes a component that develops exemplary partner schools
              for the preparation of prospective teachers, and thus targets teacher
              enhancement/preparation for the full spectrum of K-16.
