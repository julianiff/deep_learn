Abstract    :
              9550017  Smith     This 42-month project develops a cadre of 40 math/science 
              teacher-leaders in K-12, trained on the use of Internet, who  serve as peer
              teacher trainers and members of an on-line  mentoring community.  They in turn
              train, support and mentor 1200  additional teachers from 400 schools in West
              Virginia.  All  participating schools are connected to the Internet and the 
              requisite equipment provided through cost sharing.  The  strategies include
              2-weeks of teacher leader training, an  implementation year including Project
              Green and on-line learning,  and a follow-up three-day conference to debrief
              and prepare the  participants for peer teaching.  The peer groups are taught by
               two teacher-leaders and one graduate student at various sites  throughout the
              state.  The project includes year-long mentorships  via the Internet,
              establishing  affinity groups, and developing a  science education gopher.     
              The science curriculum core for the project is drawn from Project  Green, is
              closely aligned with other state efforts and the  science frameworks, and is
              tied to the statewide concern about  water resources.  Graduate credit is
              awarded through West  Virginia University and Marshall University and ranges
              from 4 to  7 graduate credits per participant.  In addition to developing  the
              expert base and a large community of users, the project  investigates the
              effectiveness of the activity.      Cost sharing is 218%.  ***
