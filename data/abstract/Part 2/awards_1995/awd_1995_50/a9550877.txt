Abstract    :
              The department is purchasing a Finnigan MAT Magnum Gas  Chromatograph/Mass
              Spectrometer (GC/MS) plus data handling  system.   This purchase includes a
              62,000 compound database that  allows students to do computer matching of mass
              spectral data of  unknowns separated by the GC.  Several new experiments are
              being  used to take advantage of the capabilities of the equipment.    The
              experiments involve flavor chemistry, cosmetic additives,  plasticizers in
              polymer samples, and separation and isolation  problems.   These experiments
              are being used in upper-level  Advanced Laboratory courses taken by junior and
              senior Chemistry  majors.   The equipment is also available for use by students
               enrolled in the Undergraduate Research program.    This equipment  allows
              upper-level Chemistry majors to experience the GC/MS  technique as it is used
              by practicing chemists in modern  laboratories.
