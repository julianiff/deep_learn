Abstract    :
              The Summer Science Camp (SSC) program will take place on the San  German campus
              of Inter American University of Puerto Rico.      The project goal is to
              provide the foundation for a lidelong  interest in science and mathematics to
              underrepresented minority  students in Puerto Rico in the intermediate schools
              with the  objective of encouraging these students to consider science, 
              engineering and mathematics as possible career choices.  The  program will
              offer an intensified mathematics and science  enrichment program during a
              five-week period in the summer, and  will serve seventy-five (75) students each
              year selected from area  schools.  The program will provide instruction in
              math, computer  science, the biological and physical sciences, and in Spanish
              and  English communications skills as related to science.  Other program 
              activities include field trips, hands-on laboratory experience,  counseling and
              orientation, seminars, training in study skills,  career exploration
              activities, and motivational activities.  A  follow-up component will be held
              during the regular academic year  to permit project continuity and increase
              effectiveness.    The participants are expected to be equally divided between
              males  and females and predominantly Puerto Rican.  The outcomes of the  SSC
              program will be seventy-five underrepresented students annually  in Puerto Rico
              who will have increased their academic skills,  performance and motivational
              levels to enter and successfully  compete with their peers in a science,
              engineering or mathematics  career.  ***
