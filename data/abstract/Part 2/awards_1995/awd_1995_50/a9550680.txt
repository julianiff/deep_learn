Abstract    :
              The primary goal of this five-year system-wide project is to double  the number
              of minority graduates of Birmingham Public Schools (BPS)  who are prepared to
              enter college as science, mathematics,  engineering, and technology majors.  To
              accomplish this goal, BPS  has established a collaborative relationship
              involving the  University of Alabama at Birmingham, the Birmingham Compact, and
               the Alabama Alliance for Minority Participation Program.  Project  activities
              will have an impact on all 43,000 BPS students in grades  K-12 and their 976
              teachers of science and mathematics.  However,  most academic enhancement
              activities will serve teachers in grades  6-12.  To achieve the project goal,
              these objectives will be  implemented: reform and enrich the K-12 science and
              mathematics  curricula, using national standards in mathematics and science as 
              guidelines; promote K-12 school-based leadership; enhance teachers'  content
              knowledge and increase the use of effective instructional  strategies in
              mathematics and science; provide students with a  range of integrated
              enrichment activities; provide students with  effective social support
              networks; implement a plan for effective  use of school resources; and infuse
              appropriate technology into K-  12 instructional activities.  Project processes
              and outcomes will  be monitored through a comprehensive and integrated
              evaluation  model.  Formative feedback will be used to improve project 
              functions throughout the duration of the grant.  Project  descriptions outcomes
              will be thoroughly documented and will be  disseminated in various formats to a
              range of audiences.  BPS,  because of its unique history, demographics, and
              economic  situation, offers a unique challenge for systemic reform.  The 
              success of this project may serve as a national model for other  similar school
              systems.  ***
