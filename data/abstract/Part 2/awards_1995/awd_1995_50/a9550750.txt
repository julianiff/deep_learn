Abstract    :
              Mississippi State University (MSU) will offer a Summer Science Camp  (SSC) over
              a four-week period in science/mathematics for 50 African  American students
              (grades 7 or 8).  Four follow-up sessions will be  during the academic year. 
              Prior to the SSC, staff will receive an  inservice in the optimal methods for
              teaching minority students.   SSC topics include the basic process skills
              (e.g., observing  techniques) and the casual process skills (e.g.,
              experimenting) in  science.  An emphasis in this SSC will be that process
              skills are  not unique to any science discipline.  Math concepts will be 
              integrated into the science content covered in the SSC.  This SSC  will
              incorporate cooperative and inquiry learning, and  constructivist strategies. 
              Career education opportunities will be  presented by science/engineers during
              campus research facility and  industry tours.  Mentoring by African American
              educators,  scientists, and engineers are within the four week SSC.  This SSC 
              success will be based on pre/post testing of math/science content  and
              performance based measurements.  In the follow-up Saturday  sessions
              participants will develop displays based on SSC activities  for their school's
              science fair and National Science and Technology  Week held on the MSU campus.
