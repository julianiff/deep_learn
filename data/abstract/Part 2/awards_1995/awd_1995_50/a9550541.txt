Abstract    :
              9550541  Bonney    Project BirdWatch is a program that allows elementary and
              middle-  school students to participate in real science.  Observational  data,
              collected by children in the schools, is utilized by  ornithologists at the
              Cornell Lab of Ornithology to study bird  migrations and populations. 
              Furthermore, in school-based research  activities, the students learn to
              analyze and publish the data  themselves.  The outcome of this collaboration
              between the Cornell  Laboratory of Ornithology and TERC is a curriculum that
              can be  adopted by teachers who can attract birds to the schoolyard.  A 
              BirdWatch Learning Guide, consisting of a Teacher's Guide, Student  Field
              Notebook, as well as software for data collection, analysis  and
              telecommunications are the various parts of the projected  curriculum. 
              Students benefit from the project by learning science  content, developing
              skills in science process and data analysis,  learning to share data and
              communicate findings and learning to  work cooperatively on research with other
              students, scientists and  their families.
