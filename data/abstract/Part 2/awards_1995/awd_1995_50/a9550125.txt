Abstract    :
              9550125     Garrett    The Indiana Department of Education's Center for School
              Improvement  and Performance and the Indianapolis Zoo will collaborate to bring
               global change education to Indiana students in grades 4 to 12.  The  Center
              and Zoo will institute a five-phase planning process that  will involve
              scientists, educators, students, business and  community leaders, and the
              media.  Their goal is to produce an  action plan with objectives,
              recommendations, and strategies to  guide global change education in Indiana. 
              The phases include: 1)  forming the planning team (12 members), 2) holding
              monthly meetings  (Jan. to May) of the planning team to plan symposium
              activities, 3)  convening the Indiana Global Change Education Symposium in June
               (100 participants), 4) drafting the Action Plan, 5) circulating,  revising,
              and disseminating the Action Plan.    Cost sharing is 55% and consists of
              in-kind costs made by the Zoo.
