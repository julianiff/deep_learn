Abstract    :
              9550083  Adams    This five year program enables 54 Arkansas high school physics
              teachers to build and test self-contained modules for demonstrating and
              exploring basic physics principles.  Development and testing of the modules
              would be done during 4-week summer workshops and follow-up academic year
              working sessions.  Teachers will make a 3-year commitment to participate in
              each summer's work enabling building on previous summers.  Each summer
              participating teachers may earn 3-semester hours of graduate credit in physics.
               The University of Arkansas-Little Rock (ALR) will establish and operate module
              loan program for at least five years following the grant's expiration, at which
              time the modules will be transferred to the Arkansas Regional Educational
              Cooperatives.  Each module set contains 15 separate and distinct laboratory
              units, three for each of the five areas:  Mechanics, Waves and Optics,
              Electricity and Magnetism, Heat and Modern Physics.    Two or three member
              teams from the same Arkansas Education Cooperative will participate each year. 
              Over the three year period all 18 regional cooperatives will be represented
              Teams within a region and across regions will be connected through  INTERNET
              and distance learning technologies.  Further networking will be done as each
              participant mentors another physics teacher as they use these modules.
