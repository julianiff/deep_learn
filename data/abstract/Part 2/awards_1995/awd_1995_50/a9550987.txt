Abstract    :
              Through this project, an Intelligent Data-Acquisition and Control  (IDAC) system
              is provided for the energy conversion laboratory.    Each of four experimental
              stations in the energy conversion  laboratory is equipped with a self-contained
              IDAC system  comprising a LabVIEW (data-acquisition, control and presentation) 
              system, PC-computation base, C-language compiler, Fuzzy-logic  development
              system, sensors, and actuators.   The intelligent  system facilitates real-time
              data acquisition, provides automatic  control, and presents experimental
              results graphically.   A  renewed interest in the electrical power system
              engineering  technology option is underway, and the proposed laboratory 
              upgrade project better prepares graduates for employment in the  electrical
              utility industry.
