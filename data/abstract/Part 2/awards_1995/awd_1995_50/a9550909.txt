Abstract    :
              The university has made a strong commitment to improving its  undergraduate
              program in chemistry by increasing the coverage of  molecular structure
              analysis in the lecture and laboratory  components of the curriculum.   The
              specific aim of this project   is to fund the acquisition of a multinuclear
              200-MHz NMR  spectrometer that has indirect detection and variable temperature 
              capabilities.   The new spectrometer can dramatically improve  student access
              to a FT-NMR spectrometer for laboratory projects.    It allows us to develop
              pertinent and original experiments to  reinforce the chemical concepts being
              taught in the lectures.    Implementation of this proposal directly affects six
              courses  offered in the chemistry/biochemistry curriculum.   In addition,  five
              faculty members have a demonstrated need for this instrument  in their own
              undergraduate research programs, which involve  numerous students throughout
              the summer and during the academic  year.   This addition is having an
              immediate and meaningful  impact on the undergraduate education that is
              provided and can  ultimately lead to substantial improvements in the laboratory
               curriculum.
