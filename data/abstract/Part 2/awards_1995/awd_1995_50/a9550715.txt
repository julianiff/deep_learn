Abstract    :
              9550715  Hawk    Clark Atlanta University (CAU) will continue to build its 
              comprehensive academic, research, and outreach program in Earth  System Science
              (EES) through the establishment of a Research  Careers for Minority Scholars
              (RCMS) Program in ESS.  Earth System  Science is the study of the earth and its
              component parts, which  include the atmosphere, maritime regions, biological
              and hydrologic  cycles, and geographic features, their interaction and
              evolution.   The proposed program is an outgrowth of an existing RCMS program
              in  Geosciences. The overall objective of the ESS program at CAU is to  expose
              a large segment of the University's faculty and students to  the
              interdisciplinary nature of the study of the interactions among  the earth, its
              atmosphere and oceans while simultaneously  increasing the number of minority
              students pursuing graduate  degrees and careers in this and related areas. 
              This project will  support the following activities:  (1) Establishment of
              sixteen  undergraduate student research positions, eight in year one, four  in
              year two, four in year three; (2) Summer research experiences  for
              pre-sophomore ESS students; and (3) Student travel to national  laboratories
              and conferences.
