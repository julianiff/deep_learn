Abstract    :
              This project funds student work stations, a network server, and  classroom
              equipment to reinforce and expand dramatically the  capabilities of the
              laboratory portion of an introductory  psychology course that serves as the
              science distribution  requirement for half of the student body.   With this
              equipment,  hypertext is used to integrate the materials from lecture, 
              laboratory, library, and video resources, making them available  both at 15
              laboratory work stations and to individual students  through the campus network
              (dormitories and computer work rooms).    This instructional lab network makes
              it possible to use new  types of pedagogical material:  QuickTime video
              segments,  animated illustrations of dynamic processes, and a readily 
              accessible file of slides, overheads, and graphics currently  scattered among
              faculty.    The intended effect is fourfold:  to  give students experience with
              methodologies that were previously  unavailable at the introductory level; to
              provide the means to  explore more actively the methologies and often
              encyclopedic  content of introductory psychology; to teach the use of 
              network-available library resources; and to exploit the potential  of networked
              stations to collect, collate, and display data so  that students have more time
              for interpretation and consideration  of possible alternative hypotheses.
