Abstract    :
              9550157  McIntyre    The 1995 National Conference of Black Physics StudentsSM
              (NCBPS)  meeting will be held February 9-12, in the metropolitan Washington, 
              D.C. area.  the host institution for NCBPS'95 in The American  Physical Society
              (APS).  The 1996 NCBPS meeting is scheduled for  February, 11996 with Fisk
              University, Nashville, TN being the host  institution.  Professor Eugene
              Collins is the faculty member is  charge.  The 1997 NCBPS is tentatively
              scheduled for Brookhaven  National Laboratory as host institution in February
              or March 1997.    The 1995 Conference will be the ninth consecutive meeting of
              NCBPS.   The objective of the NCBPS meeting is to assist and encourage Black 
              students who have shown interest and ability in physics to enter  and complete
              Ph.D. programs, and to initiate research, teaching, or  technical careers
              commensurate with their educational achievement  in physics.    NCBPS
              originated with a group of Black graduate students at the  Massachusetts
              Institute of Technology.  The conferences have been  organized and implemented
              by students with faculty and staff  assistance at the various host institutions
              throughout the country.   The growth of conference participation is shown as
              follows:                   1987      MIT                           34

              away due to lack of funds                 **Over 100 students were denied
              access due to lack of funds      Information is presented through the following
              mechanisms (1)  lectures by distinguished scientists and engineers, (2)
              technical  presentations by Black gra duate and undergraduate students, (3) 
              workshops on the graduate admission process, (4) seminars on  financial support
              to students for science education at the  university level, (5) forums on
              successfully completing a graduate  programs in physics, and (6) career
              opportunities at all degree  levels.  The primary audience for the conference
              consists of  undergraduate students who are majoring in physics and/or who have
               expressed a sincere interest in physics.  A principal goal for the  Conference
              is to permit these students, who are in the process of  making career
              decisions, the opportunity to discuss with graduate  students and scientists
              their concerns regarding a scientific  career and to seek recommendations and
              advice about educational  paths.
