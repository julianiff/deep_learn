Abstract    :
              Through this project, the Chemistry Department is upgrading a 21-  year-old
              30-Mhz NMR spectrometer, which had been inoperable, with  state-of-the-art
              200-MHz FT-NMR capabilities.   This new  instrument provides the ability to
              perform significant  undergraduate research projects, while being simple enough
              to  allow upper-division (e.g., sophomore-level and up) students to  record
              their own spectra routinely for instructional  laboratories.  The exposure of
              students to this instrument begins  in Organic Chemistry, the normal
              sophomore-level course, where  they record the spectra for the products
              synthesized during the  first-semester lab course.   During the second-semester
              lab,  open-ended project-based experiments are performed.   Without a 
              functional NMR spectrometer, the incorporation of this type of  experiment is
              extremely difficult.    The upper-division courses  all, with the current
              exception of Physical Chemistry,  incorporate advanced NMR techniques in their
              laboratory  offerings.   The most notable is the ability to offer a  meaningful
              lab component to a newly introduced Spectroscopy  class.  Undergraduate
              research is enjoying an immediate elevation  in opportunities with the presence
              of an FT NMR spectrometer.    Two of the faculty on staff are increasing their
              activity in  research as a result of increased demand.   Their projects 
              require NMR capabilities, ranging from routine 1H to 31P.   The  spectrometer
              meets both the current requirements, as well as the  foreseeable future needs.
