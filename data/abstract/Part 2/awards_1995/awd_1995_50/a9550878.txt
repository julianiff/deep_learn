                  Life Sciences    Title: Physiology Laboratory Exercises with Interactive
              Computer-  Enhanced Instruction    Computer-enhanced instruction in the
              physiology laboratory  exercises is being employed to determine: (1) if
              computer-enhanced  instruction improves mastery of the material covered, (2)
              what  student attitudes are towards the use of computer applications  versus
              conventional laboratories, and (3) if student dropout rates  are affected by
              this new approach.  The student audience includes  non-science and allied
              health majors, with women comprising 78% of  this population.  A three-pronged
              approach to laboratory  instruction is being employed: (1) Standard hands-on
              laboratories  of a conventional type, (2) Mixtures of hands-on laboratories and
               interactive multimedia software, and (3) Computer-enhanced  laboratories. 
              Intelitool and A.D.A.M software is being employed  with IBM compatible
              computers.  Results of the project will be  reported at the Texas Junior
              College Teacher Association Convention  and to the Texas Higher Education
              Coordinating Board in Austin,  Texas.  Information will also be disseminated by
              the publication of  a scholarly paper.  Evaluation will primarily be based on
              data  collected on-line from statistically proven questionnaires  administered
              over the length of the project.
