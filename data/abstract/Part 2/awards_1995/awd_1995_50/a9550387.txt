Abstract    :
              This research focuses on activation of the trans geometry in  platinum antitumor
              complexes, first studying the reactions of  trans- PtCl2(NH3)(quinoline)  with
              various nucleobases and  nucleotides.  Platinum (IV) analogs will be prepared
              and a careful  comparison of platinum (II) and platinum (IV) reactivity with 
              oligonucleotides will be undertaken using two dimensional and  multinuclear
              nuclear magnetic resonance.  Dr. Roat will also spend  a summer research period
              in the Netherlands at Leiden University's  Gorlaeus laboratories to continue
              research collaboration with Jane  Rudijik.  She will be accompanied by a
              graduate student from  Virginia Commonwealth University and an undergraduate
              from  Washington College.    Interactive activities include:  teaching an
              undergraduate/graduate  level course in Bioinorganic Chemistry; organizing
              seminars for  undergraduates, targeting women and minorities, devoted to
              putting  together competitive applications for undergraduate and graduate 
              research and academic scholarships and fellowships; and  implementing a summer
              research exchange between host and home  institution students with Leiden
              University, the Netherlands where  Dr. Roat has extensive collaborative
              research contacts.
