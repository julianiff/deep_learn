               Physics         Title: A computerized nuclear and particle physics laboratory 
              for  undergraduates    This project will provide physics students at Northwest
              Nazarene  College with hands-on experience using modern, computer controlled 
              apparatus to perform meaningful measurements in nuclear and  particle physics. 
              This goal meshes well with the pedagogical  method supported by the entire
              science division of requiring a  strong research component as part of the
              curriculum.  In addition  to experiments for the sophomore-level physics
              laboratory, two  experiments are proposed which would be part of a
              Junior/Senior  Research Program, in which students work one-on-one on research 
              projects with a professor.  The program presented has been  carefully designed
              for a small department with limited resources.          There are several
              reasons for selecting particle physics  experiments for this program.  Particle
              physics is one of the  frontier areas of modern physics research, yet
              experiments of this  type are not usually part of the undergraduate laboratory 
              curriculum.  These experiments offer one of the few opportunities  students
              have for observing first-hand the effects of relativity.   By providing
              students with practical and up-to-date experience  using modern, fast
              electronic and computerized data acquisition and  analysis, we hope to give
              them the skills and knowledge necessary  to succeed in a career in any branch
              of experimental physics.
