Abstract    :
              9550733  Hrabowski  The University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) has made
              a major  commitment to be a major producer of minority scientists, 
              mathematicians, and engineers.  UMBC's highly successful Meyerhoff  Scholarship
              Program, initiated in 1988, is designed to facilitate  the recruitment and
              retention of minority scholars into these  fields.    NSF support is requested
              to expand and enhance current efforts.   Four groups of forty-four outstanding
              African American students  scholars would be financially and academically
              supported, through  the bachelor's degree, with the understanding that they
              will  continue on to a graduate or professional degree.  Each student  would
              receive strong academic enrichment and support, beginning  with a summer bridge
              program prior to entering the University.  A  UMBC faculty member would work
              with each student on a significant  research project, and each students would
              be assigned a practicing  scientist or engineering professional as a mentor.   
              UMBC has received support from individuals and corporations for  this program
              and is committed to continuing its efforts.  These  students will form a cadre
              of talented professionals who will move  into leadership roles in their chosen
              fields in science and  engineering.  They will also serve as group/role models
              to  succeeding classes of students scholars.  ***
