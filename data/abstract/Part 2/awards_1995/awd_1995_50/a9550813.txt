                       A Mathematica laboratory is being developed to support  expanded
              curricular reform in calculus and to initiate reform of  subsequent service
              courses at the University of Pittsburgh.  The  laboratory is supporting
              expanded implementation of a two track  calculus course, based on the Calculus
              & Mathematica materials of  Davis, Porta and Uhl, and the Harvard Calculus
              Consortium materials  of Hughes-Hallett, Gleason, et al., which is affecting
              all students  in the science and engineering calculus sequence.  In addition, 
              this project is facilitating revitalization of the mathematics  curriculum at
              the next level through reform of the mathematics  courses serving engineering,
              physical, and social sciences.
