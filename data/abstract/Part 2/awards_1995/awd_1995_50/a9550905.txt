Abstract    :
                   The goal of this project is to enhance student performance and  retention
              in introductory computer science courses through the use  of closed
              laboratories.  To enable this teaching approach we will  create a computer
              laboratory.  The laboratory will consist of a  file server, a Postscript
              printer, a network of 20 microcomputers  equipped with Alsys ActivAda, and 10
              dot-matrix printers.  This  facility will be used to conduct weekly closed
              laboratories.  Each  laboratory will provide hands-on learning experiences for
              mastering  basic programming skills and becoming competent with the tools most 
              frequently needed for program development.  These tools, which are  integrated
              within ActivAda, include an editor, compiler, formatter,  debugger, librarian,
              and execution profiler.  The laboratory will  be staffed 14 hours a day.  In
              addition to being used for scheduled  closed laboratory sessions, it will be
              used by students to complete  course programming projects.  An additional 5
              licenses for ActivAda  will permit students to access this software from other
              campus  computer clusters when the lab is scheduled.  By integrating a  closed
              laboratory into our current course structure, we expect to  improve student
              performance on programming projects and increase  the percentage of students
              who successfully complete the  introductory sequence.
