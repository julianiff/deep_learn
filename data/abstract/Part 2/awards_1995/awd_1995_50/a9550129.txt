Abstract    :
              9550129  Hug    For more than 50 years, Ohio has had a program of environmental 
              education and the Ohio Department of Education has had a staff  member assigned
              to this program.  In 1994, the State adopted a  competency-based science
              education program and in 1995 they will  publish instructional objectives for
              social studies that will allow  for school curriculum development committees to
              design  interdisciplinary Global Chang Education curriculum.  Selected  science
              and social studies objectives can be achieved  simultaneously.  Global change
              topics that can be included in the  curriculum include decline of songbird
              populations in Central and  North America, destruction of rainforests, pressure
              on natural  resources of population growth, destructive effects of acid rain, 
              the consequences of desertification or desertization, depletion of  upper
              atmospheric ozone, among others.    By means of this planning grant, they will
              address the need for a  systematic, comprehensive implementation of these
              global issues as  they relate to and accomplish the instructional objectives of
               science in the elementary and secondary curricula.  The goals of  the planning
              project are to 1) carry out an awareness program to  spread the information
              about this effort to elementary and  secondary school educators, 2) to compile
              a status report of Global  Change Education activities which currently exist in
              Ohio, 3) to  develop a Global Change Education Model that will become one of
              ten  educational reform models that are available to individual schools  as the
              basis for their Venture Capital program (this is a special  instate program
              from which school can receive up to $25,000 for  five years to institutionalize
              reform programs), and 4) to file a  final report to NSF which will also serve
              as the guide to  implementing the Global Change Education Model.    Cost
              sharing is 52% and comes from in-kind contributions made by  the Ohio
              Department of Education.
