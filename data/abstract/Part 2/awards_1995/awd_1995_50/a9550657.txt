Abstract    :
              9550657    The objectives of the research are to examine:  (1) the nature of 
              U.S. academic scientific and engineering research contributions to  industry;
              (2) the extent to which the research has contributed to  industrial
              developments: and (3) the educational relevance and  value of the accompanying
              university-industry research  relationships.  The project is designed to
              provide a better  understanding of the nature of academic research and its 
              relationship to industrial innovations.  Sampling designs used to  select
              interview participants serve to maximize variability so that  useful
              generalizations of patterns can be derived, supplementing  data obtained form
              mail surveys.  Dissemination of project results  through publications,
              mailings, and presentations will provide  timely information on the nature of
              and factors shaping the  contributions to industry of academic research in
              science and  engineering and their educational impacts.  Involvement of
              students  in the project and dissemination in courses will contribute  directly
              to education.
