                                          Engineering    Title: Freshman Laboratory for
              Product and Process Engineering      A Product and Process Engineering
              laboratory has been established  for freshmen engineering students. The purpose
              of the laboratory is  to bring students together in teams of three in order to
              explore  fully operative, familiar devices (e.g., videocamera, videocassette 
              recorder, photocopier, bar code scanner) by playing the successive  roles of
              user, assembler, and engineer analyst. The lab places  emphasis on a "hands-on"
              approach to each device and on working in  teams. Results from pilot offerings
              in summer '93(12 students) and  '94(18 students) indicate that this method
              creates an atmosphere in  which students teach each other effectively, and in
              which women and  minorities feel very comfortable and receive a positive and 
              inclusive introduction to engineering.    The objective of the project is the
              demonstration of a cost  efficient manpower design and scale-up of this novel
              freshmen  laboratory to handle a full cohort of up to 216 students per year 
              for two years. Three 24 student sections/semester are offered in  '95-'96 and
              five sections/semester in '96-'97.    The method of laboratory execution
              involves roles for students,  undergraduate and graduate teaching assistants,
              and the faculty  director. The students, working in teams of three, examine
              each of  six devices or processes. The senior undergraduates  provide lab 
              assistance and are selected so that they serve as role models for  women and
              minority freshmen. The graduate teaching assistant (one  per section) has
              general instruction and lab maintenance  responsibilities for each section, and
               serves as back-up technica l  consultant to the seniors. The faculty leader 
              provides an initial  week of hands-on training of seniors and graduate
              assistants with  the lab devices prior to each semester, and leads the student 
              discussion sections on outside readings, and  maintains oversight  of the
              laboratory operations.    The project is significant because it provides an
              immediate  "hands-on" introduction to engineering to freshmen students in a 
              manner which includes teamwork, oral communication and presentation  skills,
              and is conducive to the recruitment and retention of  underrepresented groups.
