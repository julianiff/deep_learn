Abstract    :
              HRD-9550452  The purpose of the project is to develop a mathematical 
              environment for students with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD).   These
              students tend to be easily distracted and tend to disrupt  the typical
              classroom, thus they tend to be several years behind  their appropriate grade
              level.  For this reason, few ADD students  enter careers in mathematics and
              science.  The project will  include the following:  (1)  Adaptation and/or
              design of  innovative instructional and motivational mathematics activities 
              specifically for students K-12 with ADD.  Particular emphasis  will be placed
              on the use of technology, writing, cooperative  learning, experimentation, and
              manipulatives in mathematics  education.  The NCTM standards will be applied
              throughout.  (2)   Training of teachers in the use of these techniques and
              making  materials readily available for classroom use.  By meeting these 
              objectives, the project will benefit students with ADD by  accelerating the
              development of their mathematical capabilities  and putting them on a level
              with their peers.  This improvement  also should change their attitude toward
              the study of mathematics  so that it ceases to be a chore and becomes more an
              interest.   Implementation of this project is intended to result in 
              methodology for teaching mathematics to children with ADD so that  students
              with this problem will have better educational outcomes.
