Abstract    :
              9550694  Community School District 23 (C.S.D. 23) situated in the Oceanhill- 
              Brownsville community of Brooklyn, New York, proposes to implement  a summer
              science camp.  This project will increase students'  interest in and exposure
              to science, engineering and mathematics.   The proposed science camp will serve
              120 students from Junior High  School 263 and intermediate School 284 in this
              school district.   The primary goal of the project is to stimulate an interest
              in  mathematics, science and engineering for middle grade students, and  to
              encourage project participants to consider science, math, and  engineering as
              possible career choices.    The major focus of the project is an enriched
              interdisciplinary  math, science, engineering, and technology multi-media
              program.   Activities include:  1) Instruction through an 
              integrated/interdisciplinary curriculum; 2) Student centered  classroom
              activities; 3) Professional development and instructional  workshops; 4)
              Involvement of parents and community members as role  models and mentors for
              minority students; 5) Career exploration  through interaction with scientists,
              mathematicians and engineers;  6) Urban environmental studies; and 7)
              Activities focused on  research methodology utilizing computers.     Project
              participants will experience the excitement of "doing  science" in the areas of
              science, engineering, mathematics and  technology.  Students will be paired
              with teachers of physical  science, computer science, engineering, math, and
              technology from  various institutions of higher education.  ***
