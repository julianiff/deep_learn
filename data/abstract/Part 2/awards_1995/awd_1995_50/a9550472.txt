Abstract    :
              The purpose of this proposal is to develop cross-sectional and longitudinal
              models of science education from an indicator system perspective and explore
              the policy implications of those models.  The proposed research will be carried
              out in three phases taking approximately three years.  In Year 1, newly
              released NELS: files and other relevant data sets such as the IEA science data
              for the United States and LSAY will be obtained and evaluated for their utility
              in the development of a science education policy guidance system.  In addition,
              technical modeling issues will be address.
