Abstract    :
              9550080  Catherine Twomey Fosnot  City College of the City University of New
              York    Summermath in the City    This is a 5-year project to enhance 810 NK-6
              teachers of mathematics in five school districts in New York City.  Ten entire
              schools are targeted and developed as demonstration/resource sites for the
              districts as well as for teacher preparation program through CCNY.  By the
              fourth year, this is a systemic model available to the NYC Urban Systemic
              Initiative project.  This project is connected with the Freudenthal Institute,
              Netherlands, with its research and school-based focus on teaching mathematics
              through real world problems.  Video materials developed through the Freudenthal
              Institute and in NYC classrooms in this project will be available as the
              project progresses.  The project has 5 phases:  a two-week summer institute, a
              year-long course involving in-classroom collaboration (co-teaching,
              co-reflecting, co-planning), teachers collaborating with teachers on-site,
              field research and writing, and developing teachers as leaders to co-teach
              institutes totaling at least 30 days of enhancement for classroom teachers and
              up to 150 days for leader teachers at the demonstration schools.  The project
              evaluation has three dimensions:  student outcomes, teacher change, and the
              development  of whole school cultures necessary for successful mathematics
              reform.
