Abstract    :
              Mathematics departments in the nations's doctoral institutions  represent a
              powerful resource for fulfilling important national  needs.  From improving
              quantitative literacy to training scientists  and engineers, from connecting
              universities and industries to  educating the next generation of mathematics
              teachers, these  departments have the potential to make a real difference in
              areas  that extend well beyond their own majors and boundaries.   Universities
              have become vitally engaged in efforts to assess their  role, exploring new
              thinking about scholarship, reform in  curriculum and teaching and the
              relationship between undergraduate  teaching, graduate training and research.  
               Since nearly every student who enrolls in a university takes a  mathematics
              course at some point, mathematics is strategically  positioned--even
              obligated--to affect the role of the university  and improve in teaching,
              learning and scholarship.    This project will identify critical issues related
              to quality  mathematical experiences for undergraduate students in doctoral 
              institutions, set strategies for implementation of the  recommendations of
              recent reform reports and develop a continuing  agenda enabling mathematics
              departments to assure quality  undergraduate and graduate programs at doctoral
              institutions.  The  project will highlight activities that work in departments
              across  the country, engage both faculty and administrators in dialogues  about
              programs and resource needs, and give departments the  information and means
              necessary to replicate or adapt successful  programs.
