Abstract    :
              9550372  Gutstein    The University of California, Davis will use this planning
              grant  "Planning an Informal Science Education Program at the University  of
              California, Davis" to redefine its relationship with and  responsibilities
              toward the public.  Outreach for them is being  viewed as a interaction between
              public needs and interests and the  university.  Leadership will be provided by
              a committee of  university faculty and an advisory board consisting of external
               university museum and science education professsionals will meet  with project
              directors twice during the year.  Together they will  examine the regional
              science education needs, the existing public  education activities at UCD, and
              investigate the potential for  establishing a comprehensive informal science
              program.  Among other  things this will include the coalescing of various
              scientific  collections (geology, entomology, anthropology, the botanical and 
              arboretum collections) and their respective independent educational 
              programming into a regional science education network.  Advisors  will include
              members of the UCD faculty and administrators as well  as individuals
              representing external university museum and science  education experts.
