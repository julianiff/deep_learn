Abstract    :
              Clark Atlanta University will sponsor a four-week Summer Science  Camp for fifty
              seventh and eight grade students each summer for the  three-year period,
              1996-1998.  The goals of the Clark Atlanta  University (CAU) Summer Science
              Camp (SSC) Program are to provide  a foundation and support to promote the
              development for a lifelong  interest in the sciences, engineering and
              mathematics (SEM) for all  of its participants and to encmurage participants to
              consider  careers in SEM.  Program participants, selected from elementary and 
              middle schools in Metropolitan Atlanta, will enroll in an academic  enrichment
              experience that includes interdisciplinary science,  computer applications,
              mathematics, and communications skills.   Instruction will emphasize problem
              solving and critical thinking  while focusing on real life situations.  In
              addition to classroom  experiences. participants will interact with research
              scientists in  their laboratories and in career awareness seminars and
              discussion  groups.  Weekly field trips will round out the academic experiences
               of the Program.  Follow-up activities during the academic year  include
              workshops each semester for program participants and their  parents, an awards
              program at the end of the school year, a  mentoring program in which
              participants will be matched with  undergraduate or graduate student science
              majors who will serve as  their mentors, and two newsletters each semester that
              highlight the  accomplishments of the participants and Clark Atlanta University
               Scientists.  ***
