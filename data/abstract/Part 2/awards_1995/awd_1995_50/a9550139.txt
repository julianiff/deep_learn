Abstract    :
              The Cdc28 kinase in budding yeast, and its homologs (cdks) in  higher
              eukaryotes, function as key regulators to allow progression  through the cell
              cycle.  The proteins that regulate Cdc2 are  targets for oncogene action.  A
              genetic screen was undertaken to  identify additional proteins which regulate
              cell cycle progression.   This screen identified a novel, essential protein
              kinase, Pdl3.   Mutations in PDL3 affect cell cycle progression through G2 or M
              and  bud  morphology.  Additional data are consistent with a model where  Pdl3
              is required for the activation of Cde 28 kinase.  The primary  goals of these
              experiments are to:  characterize biochemically the  activity of the kinase,
              define the function of Pdl3 in cell cycle  control, and identify other
              components which interact with Pdl3 in  control of morphology and cell cycle
              progression.    Interactive activities at SUNY Stony Brook include:  teaching
              two  courses for women in the Project WISE program; teaching a graduate  course
              in the cell cycle; and acting as advisor to undergraduate  and graduate
              students doing research in the lab.
