Abstract    :
              9550123  Fridley    The State of Utah is in the process of reviewing its
              secondary core  science curriculum.  They have determined that about one-third
              of  the major objectives within the 9th grade curriculum are related to  global
              changes in the oceans or atmosphere.  Thus, as they say a  "planning grant will
              provide Utah with an opportunity to assure  that global change education
              remains prominent within the statewide  ninth grade science curriculum; that
              teachers have exemplary lesson  plans with local and statewide resources to
              help teach global  change; that formal and informal community resources focused
              on  global change are coordinated with the work of teachers and  administrators
              in global change education; and that plans can be  made to secure future
              sources of revenue to continue global change  education training and
              coordination."  A steering committee made up  of teachers and science
              coordinators will develop a five year plan  and establish a resource database. 
              The impact of the program will  be statewide, especially at the ninth grade
              level.  Planning  activities include a variety of meetings that will move the
              plan  forward from concept to curriculum plans, by increasing the  networks of
              interested teachers and administrators, developing a  database including lesson
              plans produced by others about global  change education.  These will be
              evaluated for potential use in  Utah.    No-cost sharing information is
              provided.
