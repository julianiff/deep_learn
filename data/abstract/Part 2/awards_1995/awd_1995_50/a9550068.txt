Abstract    :
              9550068  Wagreich    This is a proposal for a 4-year old project at $3,074,754
              to: 1) establish university-school partnerships for improvement of mathematics
              instruction using standards-based curricula and 2) create a set of resource
              materials for others to use in similar efforts.  The K-5 focused partnerships
              will involve 385 teachers, each in 115 hours of staff development, over three
              years.  One-third of these will participate in 76 additional hours to prepare
              teacher-leaders in each participating school.  This project is coordinated with
              Chicago USI.    The project will also draft, field-test, revise, and publish a
              set of resource materials for use by curriculum coordinators, teacher-leaders,
              and university faculty for comprehensive teacher enhancement in elementary
              school mathematics.  TIMS Elementary Mathematics Curriculum, published by
              Kendall-Hunt, will serve as one exemplar of a standards-based curriculum.     
              Cost-Sharing is reported at $1,612,066 or 52% with funds coming from pilot
              schools, the publisher, and the Chicago Urban Systemic Initiative.
