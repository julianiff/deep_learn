Abstract    :
              Through this project, a state-of-the-art laboratory in Automatic  Data
              Collection and Identification (ADCI) is developed and  provides training in
              capabilities, function, and integration of  these technologies into industrial
              systems.   The demand for  trained engineers and technologists to implement
              such ADCI  technologies as Bar Code, Radio Frequency Identification,  Magnetic
              Stripe, Machine Vision, and Voice Recognition has  exploded in recent years.   
              Familiarity with bar code standards,  symbologies, printing methods, print
              quality verification  analysis, the design of ADCI databases, the integration
              of  systems using ADCI to track work-in-process and inventory, and  evaluation
              procedures for selecting different ADCI technologies  will be essential to the
              graduating students at the baccalaureate  of science level within the next 10
              years, since the usage of  these technologies is universal in industry today. 
              Initially,  this laboratory is being utilized to support courses in  Mechanical
              Design and Manufacturing Problems, Automated  Manufacturing, Polymer Process,
              Statistical Quality Control, and  Manufacturing Planning.  Three other courses
              in Facility  Planning, Automatic Data Collection and Identification, and 
              Senior Project are planned for addition into the undergraduate  technology
              curriculum.
