Abstract    :
              9550540  Lochhead     Building on the successful development of four
              challenge-enhanced, replacement  science curriculum units for grade 9-12, the
              aim of this project is to create and publish 12 units that use design
              challenges while still emphasizing the learning of science concepts.   Design
              and Technology for Science includes challenges that involve biology, physical
              science, physics, integrated sciences, and technology education topics.  The
              curriculum focuses upon selective process skills:  information-gathering,
              designing, and planning and conducting experiments.  The units address national
              Standards and teach integrated science-technology in a work-related context
              useful both in academic and vocational programs.  The units can be used
              flexibly by teachers who are creating science and technology courses and by
              technology education teachers who want to experiment with  open-ended,
              constructivist-based materials that emphasize the acquisition of science
              concepts.  Optional low technology activities support the use of
              microcomputer-based laboratory equipment in the classroom as well as the use of
              graph-generating spreadsheets to collect and display data.  Thus, students take
              on the role of scientists and engineers as they experience hypothesis
              generating-testing and design cycles in real-world settings, and engage in
              tasks that integrate a wide range of scientific and technology-oriented skills
              and concepts.
