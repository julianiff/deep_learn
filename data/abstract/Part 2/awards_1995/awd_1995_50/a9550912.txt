Abstract    :
              The university is creating a Data Engineering Laboratory to support  database,
              software engineering, knowledgebase, and other  data-intensive computer science
              courses that require substantial  database system services.   Using an
              existing, dedicated database  server (Sun Microsystems 690MP), PCs, and
              workstations, the   university is creating the instructional support software
              necessary  to upgrade five existing courses and to introduce two experimental 
              courses to the computer science curriculum.   Existing courses  benefit from a
              qualitatively superior instructional environment and  the experimental courses
              introduce new topics into the computer  science curricula.   Course materials
              and instructional software  are available to the community on the Internet, via
              World Wide Web.
