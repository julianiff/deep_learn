Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the inclusion of a Hewlett-Packard GCD, a  capillary gas
              chromatograph with an electron ionization detector,  in a newly developed
              chemistry curriculum.   The two guiding  principles in developing this new
              curriculum are (1) courses  should be discovery-based with students being
              actively engaged in  scientific inquiry and (2) the boundaries which have 
              traditionally separated the subdisciplines of chemistry should be  removed.  
              The new curriculum includes a 1-semester, discovery-  based introductory course
              and is followed by intermediate and  upper-level courses that continue to
              illustrate the  interdisciplinary nature of chemistry.    The Hewlett-Packard
              GCD  is a dual use instrument in that it may operate as a capillary GC  or as a
              GC/MS.   As such, this instrument will fill two important  gaps in
              instrumentation and will be extensively used in four of  the eight core courses
              required for the new chemistry major, as  well as in advanced electives and in
              independent research  projects.   A significant number of majors from other
              disciplines  also enroll in two of these four courses, extending the impact of 
              the inclusion of this instrument in the new curriculum beyond the  doors of the
              chemistry department.
