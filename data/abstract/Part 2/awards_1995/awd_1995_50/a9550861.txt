                  Life Sciences    Title: Instrument Aquisition in Support of Marine Biology 
                       Curriculum Development    The University of Oregon's Institute of
              Marine Biology has a well  recognized program for undergraduates. Courses are
              attended by  students from both the University of Oregon and from institutions 
              throughout the nation. We offer students intense field oriented  courses that
              cover a variety of marine science disciplines.    The problem addressed in this
              proposal relates primarily to two of  our process oriented courses, biological
              oceanography and estuarine  biology. These courses should include an
              investigation of the open  waters of the nearshore ocean and estuary. We have
              neither had  boats for access to these habitats nor the appropriate equipment
              to  allow students to sample these areas and gain a full understanding  of the
              processes involved in open water habitats. The recent  acquisition of suitable
              boats at OIMB now enables us to take  students on to the water. This has
              allowed us to plan laboratory  exercises in these courses giving undergraduates
              the opportunity to  conduct investigations, using modern oceanographic
              equipment, of  these open waters.    With this proposal we seek funding for
              equipment to facilitate the  development of these laboratory exercises. The
              funds will provide  field and laboratory equipment for students to answer
              questions  about oceanographic and estuarine processes. We propose to expand 
              the biological oceanography and estuarine biology courses to  include
              activities that investigate the physical and biological  parameters of open
              water using modern instrumentation and  techniques. Students will obtain
              hands-on experience in the  co llection of data in the field, and will have the
              opportunity to  process these data in both field and lab settings. This will 
              provide them with a more complete picture of the biology of coastal  and
              estuarine habitats.
