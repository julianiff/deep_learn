Abstract    :
              This project provides new improved laboratory experiments  pertaining to analog
              electronics courses in a 2-year electrical  engineering technology program.  
              Experiments related to  temperature effects, nonlinear systems, advanced
              devices and  circuits, and noise effects are conducted using the 
              microcomputer-based workstation and LabVIEW.   The project  involves developing
              new test methods or virtual instruments to  characterize the new laboratory
              experiments.   The workstations  can also be utilized for other laboratory
              experiments related to  circuit and analog electronics courses in electrical
              engineering  technology and sophomore engineering curricula.  In this project, 
              the student's learning behavior and understanding of the concepts  related to
              proposed experiments are also studied.   A survey of  questions is being
              devised to get the feedback from students  regarding the usage of new
              laboratory equipment and LabVIEW.
