Abstract    :
              This project establishes an undergraduate neurophysiology  laboratory.   The
              laboratory is equipped with four-student  electrophysiology rigs, including
              microscopes, intra- and  extra-cellular amplifiers, Apple computers, and MacLab
              software.    This laboratory serves students who major in neuroscience, 
              psychology, and biology and is used in both lower- and upper-  division
              courses.   It is used to demonstrate experiments to  first-year students and to
              allow them to conduct a simple  experiment.   In the upper-division course,
              Fundamentals of  Neurophysiology, the rigs are used for a series of challenging
               laboratories that teach students how to use the equipment, design 
              experiments, analyze data, and present their results both orally  and in
              writing.   The exercises focus on invertebrate  preparations and emphasize the
              principles of both cellular and  behavioral neuroscience.   The laboratories
              bring to life  concepts that students only read about until now and should 
              encourage some to pursue further studies in neurophysiology.    During the
              academic year and summer, many students conduct  independent research under the
              supervision of faculty members.    The rigs are available for such projects and
              for students who  focus on neurophysiology for their senior theses.   Finally,
              the  PI can use the equipment to develop new neuroethological  preparations
              suitable for undergraduate laboratories.
