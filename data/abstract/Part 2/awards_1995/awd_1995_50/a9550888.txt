Abstract    :
              Material science, recently identified as one of five strategic  and critical
              areas of research by the Clinton administration, is  experiencing a period of
              major advances in numerous areas.    Since many of the desired characteristics
              of these materials are  evaluated as a function of their structure and/or
              elemental  composition, the material scientist looks toward x-ray techniques 
              to provide fast, accurate, elemental and structural information  requiring
              minimal sample preparation.  The chemistry department  is establishing a modern
              x-ray analysis laboratory composed of a  wavelength dispersive x-ray
              fluorescence spectrometer and an  x-ray powder diffractometer.   This project
              affects non-science-  majors in general education courses, as well as most
              science  majors in courses ranging from General Chemistry to Physical 
              Chemistry.   Undergraduate research, examining environmental  topics, is being
              implemented, thereby encouraging participation  in independent study by
              African-American and women students.
