Abstract    :
              An innovative technique for strengthening and retrofitting steel  girders in
              composite steel concrete bridges by epoxy bonding carbon  fiber tape/plate to
              the girder tension flange is presented.  The  feasibility of this technique
              will be established via experimental  and analytical modeling of coupon
              specimens.  Development of a  project to study full-scale composite specimens
              which utilize this  innovative technique will follow.  The research is
              anticipated to  result in new knowledge, add to the data base for integrating 
              advanced modern materials into Civil Engineering structures, and  help bridge
              design engineers extend the service life of existing  bridges.  The knowledge
              learned will guide a durability study of  steel girder bridges with carbon
              composite laminates.    The interactive activities are designed to provide
              greater  visibility of women engineers on campus and thus to encourage  female
              students to pursue a career in engineering.  They include:   teaching a
              sophomore level course and senior/graduate level course;  organizing a seminar
              series enhancing the visibility of women who  hold academic, industry, or
              government, positions within various  specialties of Civil Engineering; and
              assisting SWE members in  organizing an engineering activity during National
              Engineers Week  to enhance visibility of female engineering students to high
              school  and/or grammar school students.
