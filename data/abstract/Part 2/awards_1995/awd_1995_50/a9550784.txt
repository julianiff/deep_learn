Abstract    :
              This funding supports the continued development of a program of  field-based
              instruction and undergraduate research on limnology  and Quaternary geology.  
              The new equipment increases the  university's ability to integrate hands-on
              activities and  research projects into introductory courses, the summer science
               program for high school juniors, a planned outreach program for  area science
              teachers, and selected upper-level courses and  improves the opportunities for
              undergraduate research projects.    The most important use of the equipment is
              in introductory  courses, which expose the maximum number of students to
              geology  early in their academic careers.   The growing emphasis on field-  and
              research-based instruction in these courses has improved the  learning
              experience for students by engaging them in the process  of solving local
              geologic problems using data that they have  collected themselves.   Students
              learn about geologic materials  and the process of scientific investigation
              through a series of  interrelated exercises.   This introduction ultimately
              provides  students with a familiar reference with which to compare concepts 
              presented in class.
