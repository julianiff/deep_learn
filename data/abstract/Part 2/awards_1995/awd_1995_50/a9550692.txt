Abstract    :
              9550692  Travis    The purpose of the Research Careers for Minority Scholars
              (RCMS)  Program at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) is to 
              increase the number of minority student graduating in mathematics  and
              statistics, to enhance their educational achievements, and to  increase the
              number who attend graduate school and pursue careers  in these fields.  To this
              end, UTSA will make available  scholarships to talented undergraduate students.
               We will identify  and recruit 18 honors minority students (4 each of freshmen
              and  sophomores and 5 each of juniors and seniors) to participate in the 
              program.  The program will be strongly research oriented and the  capstone will
              be a mentor relationship between research faculty and  RCMS Scholars.  The
              faculty participants will be asked to commit  themselves to mentor
              relationships with students, to encourage them  to pursue graduate training,
              and to assist in addressing and  solving academic and personal problems. 
              Program elements include  (1) Mentor relationships with a faculty research
              mentor and  graduate student; (2) An EXCEL Summer Bridge Program for in-coming 
              freshman; (3) Curriculum enhancement, using Calculus as the anchor;  (4) Summer
              research internship in mathematics and statistics; (5)  Honors Research and
              Professional Development Seminars; (6)  Undergraduate Research courses; (7)
              Distinguished Guest Lecturer  Series, utilizing minority role models in the
              science; (8)  Participation in at least one professional meeting at the state
              or  national level during the academic year; (9) Special Workshops such  as
              Preparing for the GRE and Getting Into Graduate School; (10)  Academic and
              career advisement; and (11) Aggressive retention  efforts.
