Abstract    :
              The university is purchasing a modern photodiode array (PDA)  instrument to
              upgrade its analytical chemistry curriculum.     Semester-long courses in
              Quantitative and Instrumental Analysis  are being integrated into a 2-semester
              series entitled Analytical  Chemistry I and II.   The department also plans to
              integrate a  course in Spectrometric Identification.   The instrument is 
              utilized in General Chemistry and Biochemistry.   The primary  objective in
              General Chemistry is to increase student interest in  the sciences by exposing
              them to modern instrumentation early in  their undergraduate career.   In
              Analytical Chemistry-I, students  are exposed to the advantages of PDA
              technology for the  quantitative analysis of mixtures, and to study reaction 
              equilibria under varying environmental conditions.   The  instrument is used
              for lessons in precision and accuracy in  Analytical Chemistry-II and for
              lessons in spectroscopy in  Spectrometric Identification.   Lastly, the
              instrument exposes  Biochemistry majors to the latest methods for analyzing
              enzyme  kinetics, including the determination of constants that  characterize
              binding and reaction rates.
