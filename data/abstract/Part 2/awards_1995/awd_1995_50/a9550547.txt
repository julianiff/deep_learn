Abstract    :
              A serious, continuous need clearly exists for dissemination  of models of
              computer usage that have been demonstrated to  be effective in supporting
              undergraduate education.  The  1995 National Educational Computing Conference
              (NECC '95),  with an anticipated attendance of more than 5,000 persons,  offers
              an excellent opportunity to devote several regular  conference sessions to
              exactly this kind of sharing of  ideas, programs and products.    As program
              chair for NECC '95, this principal investigator  seeks funding to enable the
              Conference to invite  researchers, scholars, and practitioners from all of the 
              sciences and from other disciplines that the NSF Department  of Undergraduate
              Education (DUE) supports to participate in  these special sessions.  The
              purpose will be to demonstrate,  discuss, and even produce cross-pollination of
              their work.    Appropriate DUE projects can be identified from the  abstracts
              in Project Impact:  Disseminating Innovations in  Undergraduate Education, a
              compendium of the projects  featured at the DUE sponsored activity May 31 -
              June 3, 1994  in Arlington, Virginia.    Inviting principal investigators who
              have developed  interesting products such as software, multimedia, etc. to 
              display and discuss those products not only showcases NSF-  supported research,
              but provides opportunities for one-on-  one interaction, hands-on interactive
              experiences,  stimulating exchanges of ideas, and improvements in uses of 
              computer technology in science education at all levels.
