Abstract    :
                  9550090  Johnson    This Local Systemic Change Through Teacher Enhancement
              project is the result of a collaboration between nine small rural school
              districts, one large urban district and Ball State University.  The project
              will combine the resources of the school districts, the university, the Indiana
              Department of Education, private organizations, and the community to institute
              and support an integrated, inquiry-based, hands-on science curriculum in the
              elementary schools in the region.  The curriculum to be implemented throughout
              the district will include NSF funded FOSS, EDC-Insights, and NSRC-Science,
              Technology, and Children materials as instructional modules for the school
              districts.    The project is an example of a university and school districts
              that have leadership teachers who have been trained by past NSF projects and
              who are ready to support district-wide efforts.  This group of lead teaches
              will work with scientists, science educators, and master teachers to plan and
              staff the summer leadership institutes and will form a leadership team core at
              each school site to mentor and educate teachers in elementary science teaching
              and reform.  In addition to attending the first summer institute, these
              teachers will each attend the second summer institute and mentor a new teacher
              into the leadership team.  This process is repeated each year with a total of
              336 teachers directly impacted by NSF funds.  This number represents no less
              than 6 teachers per school for 37 schools in ten school districts.
