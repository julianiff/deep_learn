Abstract    :
              9550127  Bollwinkel    The University of Northern Iowa, the Geographic Alliance
              of Iowa,  and the Environmental Issues Instruction (eii) program, in 
              conjunction with the Iowa State Department of Education will 1)  develop a
              structure for involved personnel, 2) establish evidence  of broad support, 3)
              form a list of consultant resources, 4)  evaluate curricular assumptions, and
              5) outline a development and  institutionalization plan.  Once these activities
              are done, they  will develop and submit proposals for support to implement
              their  plan.    To accomplish their goals, they will develop both a steering 
              committee (6 members) and a planning committee (17 members) drawn  from a broad
              base of partners (formal, informal, and general  public), identify
              stakeholders, and evaluate various assumptions  they have about developing a
              global change curriculum model,  activate participation in a communication
              network, outline a plan  for training trainers, and establish a list of
              consultants.  The  results of this work will be dissemination by means of the
              network  of approximately 1000 teachers trained in environmental issues.   
              Cost sharing is $6500 (%) and comes from funds and in-kind  contributions made
              by the Geographic Alliance of Iowa and the  University of Northern Iowa.
