Abstract    :
              The problem addressed by this project is the outdated limiting  experiences
              students receive in animal and human learning, animal  cognition, and
              comparative psychology.   The problem is  pedagogical in the sense that
              students' exposure to animal  research, a benchmark in psychological science,
              is not  contemporary.   The problem is theoretical because research  involving
              complex visual and auditory stimuli cannot be  conducted.   It is
              methodological because human studies of  operant phenomena, a source of
              controversy in the literature, are  not easily conducted.   It is academic
              because the proper  methods, statistics, and design issues pertinent to a 
              contribution to laboratory sciences are not possible.   The  objective is to
              provide flexible, powerful learning stations to  study a range of species, a
              variety of visual and auditory  stimuli, and a range of responses including
              ones directed toward  the stimuli.   Restructuring solves the pedagogical,
              theoretical,  methodological, and academic problems the old laboratory faces.  
               Special audiences targeted for the project include students in  Introductory
              Psychology and in a variety of midlevel and advanced  courses and independent
              studies in Biological and Behavioral  Processes.
