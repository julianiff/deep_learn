Abstract    :
              The university is developing an Adaptive Technology Laboratory  for its mentally
              and physically challenged students.   The number  of students with disabilities
              who are studying or want to study  at this institution is increasing.   The
              creation of an Adaptive  Technology Laboratory provides students with
              disabilities who  major in science, mathematics, and computer science the tools
               with which to perform their work.   It enriches their learning  experience and
              substantially improves the support given to these  students in compliance with
              Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act  of 1973.   More importantly, this
              project enables them to develop  the necessary independence that leads to
              increased productivity,  self-esteem and, ultimately, access to careers in
              science,  mathematics, and computer science.   Students who use this 
              technology are being asked to evaluate the impact on their  coursework,
              homework, and study habits.   Results of these  surveys are being shared
              through two newsletters:  Special  Education Resource Center Newsletter and
              ConnSense Newsletter as  well as at conferences and on-line.
