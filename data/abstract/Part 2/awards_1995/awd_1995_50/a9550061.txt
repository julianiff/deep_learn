Abstract    :
                  9550061  David Page    The All Learn Mathematics project is a three-year
              project to improve the mathematical understanding and the classroom pedagogy of
              middle-grades teachers of mathematics in Chicago Public Schools, grades 5-8. 
              The project will involve 500 classroom teachers and provide 100 hours of
              enhancement for each teacher over two years in eight summer institute days,
              monthly after school sessions, and project staff working in the classroom.  
              Teachers will work in cadres of fifty teachers to build collaborative networks
              in addition to the specific enhancement.  The program will assist teachers and
              administrators in building parental support and a students helping students
              environment in the school.  The project will target schools in the Chicago
              Systemic Initiative and develop cadres of 50 teachers in each of Chicago's ten
              subdistricts.  The project is funded at $1,932,417 with cost-sharing at
              $1,016,267 or 53% primarily from the local schools in the Chicago school-based
              structure.
