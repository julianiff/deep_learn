Abstract    :
              The Drafting and Design Department is incorporating rapid  prototyping as a key
              element in the revision of the curriculum.    Objectives of this project are:
              (1) to modernize the drafting and  design technology curricula by providing the
              required rapid  prototyping laboratory equipment; (2) to establish a rapid 
              prototyping laboratory for hands-on learning concordant with  curriculum
              development recommendations for associate degree  engineering technology
              courses; (3) to implement available  distance learning technologies for
              cost-effective rapid  prototyping laboratory access by other 2-year associate
              degree  programs; (4) to offer rapid prototyping laboratory access to a 
              regional consortium; and (5) to provide rapid prototyping  laboratory access
              for the university's project to implement,  integrate, and pilot implement a
              national model for manufacturing  education.     The current basis for design
              representation is the  solid geometric model.   New program outcomes would be
              enhanced  by providing students with the opportunity to take the next  logical
              step (i.e., from a solid geometric model, seamlessly and  quickly, to an actual
              prototype of the part to be manufactured).    Students acquire additional
              knowledge and skills at the design -  production interface, the type of
              concurrent engineering that is  becoming commonplace in heavily technological
              advanced  manufacturing operations.
