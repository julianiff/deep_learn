Abstract    :
              9550126  Wilson    This project provides funds for part of one staff member and
              some  other expenses to bring together stakeholders in Maine's efforts to 
              incorporate global change education in schools.  The central thrust  of the
              grant is to capitalize on the concern for environment issues  in Maine and
              assure that global change concepts will be part of the  ongoing restructuring
              and curriculum revision.  Under this grant,  the project team will determine
              the current state of environmental  education in the state, examine how the
              state frameworks and  national Goals 200 can be supported by this initiative,
              develop an  agenda for environmental education, recommend an advocate for 
              environmental education, and heighten awareness.    Cost sharing other than
              waiving indirect costs are not included.
