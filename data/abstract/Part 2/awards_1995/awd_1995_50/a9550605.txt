Abstract    :
              9550605  Morgan  The proposed research would investigate the optical and
              electronic  properties of 2-6 semiconductors and the relationship of these 
              properties to the photorefractive response.  Specific objectives of  this
              project are (1) to determine the effect of purification,  crystal growth
              techniques and post-growth treatments on trap  density, carrier transport
              properties, absorption coefficient and  other properties relevant to the
              material's photorefractive  performance, (2) to use selected transition metals
              as dopants in  order to evaluate the relationship between dopant species and 
              concentration, defect and transport properties and photorefractive  properties,
              (3) to measure the time response of the photorefractive  effect and its
              dependence on defect properties and (4) to study the  effectiveness of studying
              the bandgap and other properties by  alloying in order to optimize the material
              for use at a specific  wavelength.  The project will support 4 undergraduate
              and 2  graduate students.  ***
