Abstract    :
              The solution phase chemistry of SO2 its reaction with water and  other
              atmospheric constituents, is recognized as a major source of  acid rain.  Many
              of the good oxidizing agents formed by gas-phase  chemistry in the troposphere,
              such as O3 and H2O2, do not react  with SO2 at a measurable rate unless
              dissolved in an aqueous  environment.  A combinatimn of spectroscopic
              techniques will be  used to locate and characterize the electronic energy
              levels of SO2  in the condensed phase.  Intramolecular relaxation following the
               photoexcitation of SO2 and the rates of product formation will be  examined
              using transient Raman spectroscopy at the University of  Rochester and
              Photoacoustic Calorimetry (PAC) at the University of  Pittsburgh.   
              International activities include:  developing a graduate-level  course, Lasers
              in Chemistry; and initiating a graduate women's  seminar series in conjunction
              with Carnegie Mellon and Duquesne  Universities which will include a formal
              time for undergraduates to  present their research.
