Abstract    :
              The Psychology Department has developed an interdepartmental  neuroscience
              major.   Essential to this program is the recently  renovated Laboratory of
              Quantitative Neuromorphology, for which  this project funds new equipment.  
              Educationally, the overall  purpose of the laboratory is to transcend
              information in  textbooks and lectures by involving students with closely 
              supervised, hands-on research experience using state-of-the-art  equipment to
              explore the human brain at the gross and  microanatomic level.   Furthermore, a
              fundamental belief behind  the neuroscience program is that knowledge of the
              brain  profoundly affects one's perception and appreciation of personal, 
              linguistic, psychological, and sociopolitical phenomena.   The  long-term
              research goal is to develop a quantitative dendritic  and spine map of the
              human cerebral cortex to supplement  qualitative knowledge of the same.    Four
              pieces of equipment  are involved: (1) a Neurolucida system, a
              state-of-the-art,  comprehensive, interactive image analysis program for three-
               dimensional morphometry of microscopic tissue sections; (2) a  multihead
              Olympus microscope, which is an efficient and effective  teaching tool that
              permits three individuals (i.e., the professor  and two students) to examine
              stained tissue simultaneously; (3) a  Campden Vibroslice vibratome for
              sectioning tissue; and (4) a  PowerMac computer system for classroom
              demonstrations, tutorials,  interactive educational programs, and data
              analysis/presentations  by students doing individual research projects.
