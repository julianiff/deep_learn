Abstract    :
              The project is improving laboratory curricula through the  introduction of new
              experiments and acquisition of a gas  chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS). 
               The GC/MS facilitates  new experiments and instruction in organic chemistry, 
              quantitative and instrumental analysis laboratories, and  undergraduate
              research.   The availability of a GC/MS is  increasing the quality and scope of
              instruction in these courses.    Laboratory curricula reform, facilitated by a
              state-of-the-art  GC/MS instrument and associated outreach efforts is
              attracting  more students to the study of chemistry, particularly 
              underrepresented groups including women and minorities.   The  improvements
              increase the department's ability to offer these  students laboratory courses
              and research training in the use and  understanding of a powerful analytical
              instrument.
