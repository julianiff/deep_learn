Abstract    :
              The research component of this project is designed to develop an 
              interdisciplinary approach to creating geologic hazards potential  maps in
              areas at high risk for slope failure.  The study will  integrate geological
              observations, geotechnical materials testing,  and geographic information
              systems (GIC) analysis of major paleo-  landslides within the Huntsville,
              Alabama city limits.  Concerns  about the potential for catastrophic slope
              failures in this and  other parts of the southeastern US has been heightened by
              recent  delineation of a belt of active seismicity in Eastern Tennessee.  
              Meaningful analysis of the potential risks will require both the  short-term,
              pragmatic considerations of geotechnical engineering  and longer-term geologic
              understanding of natural systems.    The interactive activities will promote
              dialogue between geologists  and geological engineers.  Activities include
              supervision of Earth-  systems based geology laboratory, already successfully
              implemented  at the investigator's home institution; leading a graduate course 
              on pedagogical strategies for geology teaching assistants; and  conducting a
              graduate seminar on a topic of mutual interest to  geologists and geological
              engineers.
