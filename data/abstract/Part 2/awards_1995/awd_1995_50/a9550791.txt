                                          Life Sciences    Title: Laboratory Exercises in
              Plant Biochemistry      Most laboratory courses utilize experimental materials
              which  students find abstract, are presented in an uncoordinated manner,  and
              are "canned" or confirmatory in nature. The use of more  interesting materials
              would promote student involvement, while  presentation in an intellectually
              stimulating context would enhance  learning. This project is developing a
              series of experiments on  plant acids and pigments designed to implement a new
              approach to  engaging students in science. The target audience of these 
              exercises is non-major biochemistry students. The experiments are  designed to
              focus on the development of student expertise in the  use of research tools,
              expose all students to the process of  scientific research, and provide a
              framework for cooperative  learning opportunities. The project is developing
              coordinated  experiments which will reward students with a sense of progressive
               mastery of earlier concepts and tools, and foster a holistic view  of science.
              The goal of this tool-based approach is to empower  students to generate and
              answer their own questions about the world  around them and lead them into
              independent investigations. Plant  acids are used to provide a pedagogical
              vehicle for learning about  Ph and biological buffering, while providing a
              relevant bridge to  familiar commercial products. Plant pigments, specifically 
              anthocyanins, chlorophylls and carotenoids, are used to provide an  interesting
              and colorful approach to an understanding of  biochemical phenomena. The
              developed exercises will be field tested  at the P.I.'s institution and
              disseminated without cost to  inte rested undergraduate and educators via
              electronic means over  the Internet.  The methods and exercises developed as
              part of this  project will be utilized in the development of an advanced
              science  content course for pre-service teachers in collaboration with  faculty
              from the University of Nebraska Teachers College.
