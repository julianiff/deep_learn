Abstract    :
              9550561  Eaton  The proposed research would define the effects of metallicity, 
              extreme stellar evolution and atypical internal rotation on  magnetic activity
              by studying populations of stars less common than  those used previously to
              define the relationship of stellar  rotation to magnetic activity.  Populations
              being considered are  (1) old metal-poor (population 2) stars (2) rapidly
              rotating single  giant stars, (3) cool, windy giants and super giants, and (4)
              large  numbers of nearly constant stars.  The immediate impact of this 
              research will be a better understanding of how magnetic activity  varies with
              convective properties and rotation of cool stars.  Four  undergraduate students
              will participate in the proposed work.  ***
