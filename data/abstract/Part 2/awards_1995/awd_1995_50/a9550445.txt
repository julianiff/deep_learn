Abstract    :
              Recently, bright luminescence was reported in GaN films with high  crystalline
              defect densities.  This result is puzzling since  crystalline defects usually
              quench luminescence.  That defects can  exist in light emitting devices without
              severe degradation of the  light output is very unusual and merits further
              study.  Dr. Palmer  will carefully examine the relationship between crystalline
              defects  and optical properties in GaN.  Samples will be grown by MOVPE at  NTT
              Optoelectronics Laboratories by Dr. T. Matsuoka, and  characterized (TEM, X-ray
              for crystal quality; PL for optical  properties, C-V and Hall effect for
              electrical properties; DLTS for  non-radiative defects) by Dr. Palmer working
              with graduate and  undergraduate students.  As part of this research, a
              graduate  student will be sent to Japan to:  visit Dr. Matsuoka's laboratory 
              and learn more about the growth of III-V nitides, visit other  Japanese
              laboratories actively involved in III-V nitide research,  and attend and
              present results at an international conference to be  held in Japan.   
              Interactive activities include:  organizing a seminar in which  prominent women
              in engineering and the physical sciences speak  about their work; teaching a
              challenging (required) upper division  undergraduate course, "Introduction to
              Semiconductor Devices"  during the spring term; and sponsoring an undergraduate
              woman  research intern through the host institution's Women in Engineering 
              Program (WEP).
