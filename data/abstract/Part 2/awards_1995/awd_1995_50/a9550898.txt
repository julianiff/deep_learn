Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a Varian GEMINI 2000  High-Resolution
              NMR System to support its instruction  laboratories and enhance its senior
              research programs.    Introduction of NMR concepts with hands-on access to
              modern NMR  spectroscopic techniques early in a students chemical education 
              increase interest and excitement in the field of chemistry.    Students must
              have instruction in FT-NMR to meet the demanding  requirements of the academic
              and industrial world.
