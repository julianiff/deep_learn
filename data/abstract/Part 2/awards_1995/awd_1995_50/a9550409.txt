Abstract    :
              Dr. Luiti's research is on the phenomenlogy of hard processes in  nuclei.  The
              work concentrates on open problems in deep inelastic  lepton scattering from
              nuclei and heavy quarks production in  hardon-nucleurs collisions.  High energy
              experimental data on  nuclei collected in the last decade to present show that
              nuclei do  not simply behave as a collection of free nucleons, and quark 
              distributions might be modified in the nuclear environment.  New  lines of
              research have been developing since then, pursuing the  idea that by studying
              the modifications of hadronic properties and  interactions due to the nuclear
              medium, one might be able to have  an understanding of the hadronic properties
              and interactions  themselves.    Interactive activities include:  teaching a
              graduate course titled  "Hard Processes in Nuclei," organizing a series of
              seminars with  women speakers in the field of nuclear and particle physics; 
              organize a women's group in physics and working with the society of  Physics
              Students.
