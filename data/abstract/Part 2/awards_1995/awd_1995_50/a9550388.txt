Abstract    :
              This proposal, submitted under the Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) 
              Program, is designed to investigate student, parent, and school factors that
              are related to mathematics and science enrollment and achievement in secondary
              schools.  The study will examine three sources of influence on the outcome
              variables of courses taken and achievement in science and mathematics in
              secondary schools:  Parental influence as indicated by parents' involvement,
              encouragement, and expectations; students' motivation and interest; and school
              influence as indicated by tracking and interest and access to information and
              guidance.  Further, gender and ethnicity-based differences will be investigated
              to  assess if enrollment in science and mathematics courses and achievement
              among women and minorities and differentially affected by these factors.    The
              education plan describes three main activities:  Teaching, curriculum
              development, and advising-mentioning.  The plan lists strategies that will lead
              to continual improvement in teaching and to the development of a "personal
              pedagogy."  The development of  new courses will be guided by new knowledge and
              research in the field.  New courses in research methods and measurement will be
              application-oriented with an important part of the education.
