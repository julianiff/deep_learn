Abstract    :
              The department is constructing a time-resolved fluorescence  spectrophotometer
              for use in advanced undergraduate laboratory  courses.   The main activities of
              the project are (1) enhancing  and modernizing the spectroscopy component in
              advanced  undergraduate laboratories by the introduction of lasers; (2)  using
              fluorescence spectroscopy as a tool to expose students to  current research
              interests in biophysical chemistry; (3)  collecting data to reinforce chemical
              principles introduced in  the courses; and (4) providing students with training
              in  techniques for both the physical-chemical characterization and  dynamical
              study of biomolecules.  The chosen set of experiments  uses time-resolved laser
              fluorescence spectroscopic techniques  for data collection and exposes students
              to research on  antibodies, nucleic acids, and heme proteins, and to the 
              dynamical processes occurring in biomolecules.   The experiments  also
              introduce the fundamentals of fluorescence spectroscopy as  well as exposing
              students to modern techniques in pulsed laser  spectroscopy.
