Abstract    :
              9550117     Eaton     Driver's Ed, for Teachers Navigating the Information
              Superhighway  Northeast Louisiana University    This 36 month project directly
              trains 60 teachers to use the  Internet, to integrate Internet resources with
              state mandated  curricula, to translate technology into the daily activities of
               mathematics and science, and to train their colleagues.  The  teachers are
              drawn from the districts in the vicinity of the  university with one or two
              from each of the fifteen districts for  each year of the project.  The intent
              is to produce a cadre of  well-trained network-literate teachers who can
              stimulate interest  and support activities using technology. The teachers who 
              participate each year have 12 month graduate assistantships.  Preceding their
              assistantships, they take "Internet Applications  for Educators"via the
              Internet.  While at the university, they take  9 credits each semester
              including directed studies and provide 20  hours of classroom support for their
              peers.      Cost sharing is 229%.  ***
