Abstract    :
              9550652  Hardy  The proposed research would improve the research infrastructure
              in  the atomic, molecular, and optical laboratories at Florida  International
              University.  A ring laser system and a radio  frequency spectrum analyzer will
              be purchased.  The ring laser  system will provide a continuous wave, narrow
              line width, intense  source of photons for use in three experimental programs. 
              Cooling  and trapping of metastable rare gas atoms will be used for a source 
              of slow atoms for differential and integral scattering cross  section
              measurements at low relative velocities.  Laser radiation  will be used for
              atomic beam deflection in time-of-flight studies  of the dissociative
              recombination reaction.  Beam deflection will  be used for state separation and
              identification in measurements of  the dissociative recombination reaction of
              the molecular ions of  the rare gasses.  Lasing without inversion and optical
              transparency  will be studied in rubidium systems.  Two graduate and two 
              undergraduate students will participate in the proposed work.  ***
