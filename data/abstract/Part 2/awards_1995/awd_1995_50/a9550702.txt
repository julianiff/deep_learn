Abstract    :
              9550702  Wu  The proposed research would support new research in theoretical 
              physics at Prairie View A&M University.  The research would focus  on (1)
              B-particle processes.  The B-particle physics and CP  violation work will be
              devoted to finding methods to sort out the  CP violating phases from the phases
              which can interplay with them.   Tests of CPT invariance and B decays with
              final state baryons will  also be studied.  The computer simulation of physical
              processes  work will be aimed at creating an event generator of gluon-gluon 
              scattering which produces a top-anti-top pair plus two gluons.   Four
              undergraduate students will participate in the proposed work.  ***
