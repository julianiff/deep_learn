Abstract    :
              The Eastern Michigan University (EMU) Summer Environment Camp will  address the
              critical Shortage of mathematicians, engineers, and  scientists the United
              States has experienced in recent years and  that is expected to worsen during
              the next two decades.  This  program will create opportunities for talented
              underrepresented  minority students in the seventh and eighth grade to obtain 
              mentoring and learning experiences that will encourage their  enrollment in
              mathematics and science courses at the secondary and  college levels.  The
              disciplinary focus is on the environment-  specifically, water, air and energy
              resources.    The camp consists of two phases: a four-and-a-half week
              residential  program and four Saturday Academies during the following school 
              year.  Fifty seventh-grade students from six public school systems  in
              southeast Michigan will plan and conduct research projects;  participate in
              explorations and field trips; ald discuss academic  and  career goals with
              university and pre-college faculty, graduate  and undergraduate students and
              minority mentors from business and  industry.  This project ia an
              interdisciplinary partnership of  EMU's science and mathematics faculty with
              student mentors,  industry leaders, government agencies, school systems and
              parents.  ***
