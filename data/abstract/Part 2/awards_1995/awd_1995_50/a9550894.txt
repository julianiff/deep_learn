Abstract    :
              The institue is pruchasing two computer controlled telescopes,  computer control
              upgrades, three CCD cameras, and four computers  to run the telescopes, collect
              and process CCD images, and  upgrade existing telescopes.   This equipment
              provides students  with the opportunity to use modern equipment for
              astronomical  observations.   The equipment is being used for an astronomy 
              class and student-directed research involving variable star  observations.   A
              goal of this project is to encourage  engineering and science students to
              continue working in astronomy  after graduation as well trained amateurs.
