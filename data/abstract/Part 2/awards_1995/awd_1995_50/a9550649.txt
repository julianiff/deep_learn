Abstract    :
              9550649  Natvig  The proposed research would involve undergraduate researchers
              in a  collaborative effort to obtain fundamental information about genome 
              structure in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa.  The  research aim of
              the Neurospora Genome Project is to sequence and  map genes that encode
              expressed proteins.  The mission of the  project is to increase the number of
              students receiving laboratory  experience in molecular genetics.  Project goals
              include:  (1)  obtain partial sequences of random cDNA clones and compare 
              sequences with known genes; (2) Identify cosmid clones  corresponding to cDNA
              clones and (3) map cosmids to the appropriate  chromosomes using RFLP analysis.
               Five undergraduate and two  graduate students will participate in the proposed
              work.  ***
