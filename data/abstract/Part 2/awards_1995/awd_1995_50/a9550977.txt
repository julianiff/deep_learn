Abstract    :
                   New standards for the K 12 curriculum which have been  developed by the
              National Council of Teachers of Mathematics call  for the integration of
              technology into the teaching and learning  of mathematics and for the increased
              use of active explorations  in mathematics.  Mathematics education majors need
              to gain  experience in these areas during their preservice mathematics 
              courses, so that they can then bring this knowledge with them  into the public
              schools.       The objective of this project is to integrate computer 
              visualization of geometric ideas into a geometry course.  Seven  lab activities
              are being developed, with components on Euclidean  and Non-Euclidean
              geometries, transformations and projective  geometry, tilings, polyhedra, and
              geometric constructions.  The  primary software used to carry out the lab
              projects is GeomView,  a geometry exploration system developed at the Geometry
              Center in  Minneapolis, MN.  Additional software will include Mathematica  and
              Geometer's Sketchpad.         The project will provide mathematics education
              majors models  and tools which they will integrate into their own teaching,
              thus  strengthening the climate for teaching and learning in the public 
              schools.  Evaluation of the effectiveness of the project will be  through
              surveys of teachers once they are in the public schools.
