Abstract    :
              A four-week summer science camp for minority students will be  offered over the
              course of three years which will meet these  objectives: a) teaches
              participants natural science and mathematics  topics through data collection
              and analysis; b) instructs students  about Alaskan Native traditional knowledge
              and use of the  environment; and c) introduces resource management and other 
              science and mathematics careers as an option for Juneau's Alaska  Native youth.
                 The camp is the result of a working partnership of state and  federal
              resource management agency personnel, the science and  mathematics faculty at
              the Juneau School District and the  University of Alaska Southeast, the
              Discovery Foundation, the  Chilkoot Culture Camp, and Earthwatch.  Innovative
              follow-up  activities will create a network of learners (both teachers and 
              students) who share the above stated goals.  The lessons we learn  from
              developing integrated science and mathematics curriculum and  assessment tools
              that are relevant for minority students and that  are based in the recently
              adopted Alaska Student Performance  Standards, will be applied to District
              curriculum throughout the  following school year for use by reeular classroom
              teachers.  The  camp will provide a model from which other school districts in 
              Alaska may benefit.  The project will address equity issues by  raising
              standards for mathematics and science education for all  students.
