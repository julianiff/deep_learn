Abstract    :
              The biology faculty are committed to improving the curriculum for  biology
              majors in cell and subcellular biology.    This project  funds an
              ultracentrifuge and microcentrifuges to help the faculty  achieve the next step
              to an improved curriculum.   Integration of  the new equipment into the program
              is outlined as two phases: (1)  the implementation of new, investigative
              laboratory exercises  that are not possible without the equipment and (2)
              involvement  of more students in molecular research.   Seven courses are 
              significantly enhanced, including General Biology, Bacteriology,  General
              Ecology, Genetics, Cell and Molecular Biology, Animal  Physiology, and Plant
              Physiology.
