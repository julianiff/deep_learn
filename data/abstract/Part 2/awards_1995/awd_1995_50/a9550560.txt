Abstract    :
              9550560  Fratiello  The project will involve the application of multinuclear
              magnectic  resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to two research programs.  The 
              instrument to be utilized is a Bruker AM-400 MHz superconducting  Fouier
              transform NMR spectrometer, capable of high resolution and  sensitivity for
              studying low abundance nuclei, and equipped with  accessories for the variable
              temperature, two dimensional, and  multinuclear experiments to be emphasized in
              these programs.  The  research program titles and the nuclei to be studied are 
              "Lanthanide lon Complexation" (1H, 12C, 15N, 27Al, 31Cl, 8lBr, 89Y,  113Cd,
              127l, 139La) and "Polyborane/Carbon Cluster Chemistry" (lH,  llB, 13C, 19F,
              31P).    The project will involve six to twelve students from minority  groups
              underrepresented in the sciences, specifically, African  Americans, Hispanics,
              and Native Americans, with the objective of  preparing them for graduate school
              and careers in science.   Activities will include research training, as well as
              seminars, and  academic and career counseling.  ***
