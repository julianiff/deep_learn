Abstract    :
              The research consists of coordinated imaging and spectroscopic  observations of
              comets during perihelion passage.  Images at 5-25  microns and spatially
              resolved long slit spectra of cometary dust  will be acquired with the mid-IR
              camera at the Mt. Lemmon  Observatory 1.5 m telescope, and with the new Long
              Wavelength  Spectrometer at the 10 m Keck telescope.  Such a compete set of 
              data has never been obtained for any comet.  The superior  capabilities of the
              LWS at Keck will allow us to observe the  pattern of the dust emittance in
              close proximity to the nucleus  which determines the morphology of the whole
              coma.  At Mt. Lemmon  we can study a larger field of view with longer temporal
              coverage  which is important for better understanding of the physical 
              characteristics of nuclei and comae.  We expect to learn new  details of the
              dust optical properties, composition, size  distribution and, finally, of
              cometary nuclei themselves.    Interactive activities include teaching of a
              high enrollment lower  division Physics class, and upper division course on a
              Solar System  Formation.  Other interactive commitments include:  inviting
              female  speakers to participate in the astrophysics seminar series, and 
              initiating a new program using UCSD TV which broadcasts to 10.6  viewers over
              the local area.  Interviews and panel discussion will  allow resident women
              scientists and visitors to discuss their  research and other issues relating to
              women in science.
