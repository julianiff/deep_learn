Abstract    :
              9550124  Fulton    This project provides funds to initiate planning for a
              combined  grades 7-12 science and social studies curriculum on global change.  
              A March conference brings together teams to review the available  materials,
              discuss the role of networking in information exchange,  and begin planning a
              statewide global change curriculum.  An April  meeting of a smaller working
              group will write a proposal for  materials development to be submitted to the
              NSF.    Building on existing efforts in the state, this proposal focuses on 
              statewide data and its compatibility, extending the data by  providing analysis
              and public impact information, and team  progress.    Cost sharing is extensive
              and includes 75% from the state.
