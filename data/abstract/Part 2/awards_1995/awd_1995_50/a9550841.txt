              Physics             The aim of this project is to increase the learning, 
              retention, and enrollment of students in physics at Ventura  College.  This is
              being achieved by adopting a workshop approach  to teaching physics using
              enhanced microcomputer-based laboratory  (MBL) tools.  The time students
              traditionally spend listening  passively to lectures is replaced by direct,
              peer-group  collaborative enquiry in a laboratory environment.  Workshop 
              physics uses integrated computer tools, including MBL, in  mechanics and other
              areas of the curriculum.  Enhanced use is  made of dynamic spreadsheets and
              graphs for data analysis.  An  emphasis is placed on using these tools for
              modeling.  The use of  digital video analysis is also being used in the
              laboratory  setting.  Workshop physics provides a more supportive learning 
              environment for students and a more supportive atmosphere for  traditionally
              at-risk students such as those in Ventura's large  Hispanic population.  In
              addition, the MBL equipment and  techniques from Workshop Physics will be
              introduced into the  physical science course being developed for preservice
              teachers.
