Abstract    :
              9550550  Kass    The American Association for the Advancement of Science is 
              requesting a planning grant of $49,845 to support a one-year  planning effort
              that involves front-end research and a series of  parent focus groups.  This
              initiative will help to design a  national undertaking to stimulate parent
              involvement in science and  mathematics education.  Anticipated outcomes
              include: a widely  published review paper that will summarize the research
              literature  and current parent involvement projects, and that will suggest 
              promising strategies to increase parent involvement in science and  mathematics
              education and; a major initiative, spearheaded by AAAS,  to develop parent
              involvement activities and programs that can be  linked to AAAS's
              community-based science projects and other  projects nationwide.
