Abstract    :
              9550433  Melody    This project provides funds for an extensive planning process
              that  includes assessing Florida's global change education needs,  isolating
              themes, developing a curricular plan, developing an  implementation model, and
              developing an assessment and evaluation  model.    Representatives from each of
              Florida's 67 school districts are  involved in the planning process.  Since the
              model will be designed  within the Qtate's new Science Curriculum Framework,
              each district  is expected to benefit from access and participation.    Cost
              sharing is not mentioned, however, senior personnel are not  charged to the
              grant.
