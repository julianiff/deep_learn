Abstract    :
              This project is establishing a computational chemistry facility  in order to
              introduce undergraduate students to the concepts of  modern molecular mechanics
              and molecular modeling.   The facility  integrates these modern computational
              methods into a broad range  of chemical topics extending from theoretical
              physical chemistry  to bio-organic DNA chemistry.   It is utilized in both the 
              classroom and undergraduate research environments.   An academic-  industrial
              alliance is being established to acquaint students  with an industrial
              perspective for the use of these tools.   In  addition, the industrial
              consultants suggest and develop new  computational experiments for classroom
              use as well as conduct  workshops for high school science teachers during the
              summer  months.
