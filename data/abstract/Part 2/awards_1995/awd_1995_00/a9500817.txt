Abstract    :
              9500817-Engstrom - GOALI  ABSTRACT      Deposition and growth of thin films
              represents an enabling technology that impacts a number of existing and
              emerging industries, including microelectronic and optoelectronic device
              fabrication.  This work will investigate the use of collimated supersonic jets
              of molecular thin film precursors under conditions of medium to ultrahigh
              vacuum to grow thin films.  Previous work by the principal investigator has
              demonstrated explicitly that kinetic limitations to epitaxial growth can be
              overcome by the use of molecules possessing hyperthermal kinetic energies. 
              This work is being extended to a fundamental examination of the connections
              between the chemical dynamics of the adsorption reaction and the resulting thin
              film morphology, as well as an explicit, quantitative evaluation of the
              hypersonic flow field.  The studies will be conducted in a supersonic molecular
              beam growth chamber that has been optimized for thin film growth and evaluation
              of the hypersonic flow field, the latter including the pertubing effects of the
              substrate itself.  Computational studies of the flow fields will be made
              employing the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) approach.  These large-scale
              simulations will be performed on a massively parellel computing platform. 
              Specific materials systems to be investigated include:  selective epitaxial
              growth of silicon; deposition of silicon carbide on silicon; and deposition and
              growth of carbon-nitride.  It is expected that these studies will provide a
              fundamentally-based pathway for scale-up of the process necessary for eventual
              commercial applications.
