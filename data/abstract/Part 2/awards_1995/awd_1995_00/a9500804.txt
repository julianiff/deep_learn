Abstract    :
               DMS-9500804 Lebovitz  The project consists of two principal  parts. One is a
              series of explorations in fluid dynamics  emphasizing parametric instabilities
              in flows with noncircular  streamlines. These flows include many of interest in
               astrophysical and geophysical fluid dynamics. The other principal  part is a
              mathematical study of slow evolution in  finite-dimensional systems with two
              timescales (a fast and a slow  timescale) that experience bifurcation in the
              limit in which the  evolution on the slow timescale ceases. They are related in
              that  the fluid-dynamical problems can, in some cases, be reduced to 
              finite-dimensional problems of the kind described.   The goal of  the proposed
              research is to understand the behavior of fluids in  natural settings, like
              stars, planets and earth's oceans and  atmospheres. Certain simple,
              theoretically deduced flows, once  thought to represent real flows in these
              natural settings, turn  out to be impossible because they are unstable, i.e.,
              they do not  persist under the small disturbances to which all natural 
              phenomena are subject. The goal is then to understand what flows  are possible.
              For example, can one find stable flows by  considering how an unstable flow
              changes with time? Many of the  mathematical problems arising in this study
              arise already in the  study of simpler dynamical systems, and part of the
              proposed  research is to consider these simplified problems.
