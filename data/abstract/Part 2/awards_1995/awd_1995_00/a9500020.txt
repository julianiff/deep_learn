Abstract    :
              9500020  Menq   The goal of this research is to develop an integrated framework
              for precision machining of complex surface geometries, in which product quality
              and productivity are planned and controlled in the process development phase
              rather than in the manufacturing phase of the production cycle.  The present
              study focuses on end milling, one of the most widely used machining processes
              in the manufacture of parts with three-dimensional sculpted surfaces.  Reliable
              mathematical process models will be developed to determine the optimum
              machining conditions in end  milling.  The first task will be to develop
              predictive models for cutting forces and the resulting surface errors in
              various end milling processes.  The second task is to develop advanced
              machining strategies and compensation schemes that utilize the developed
              predictive capability to plan optimal cutting paths and feedrates for the
              reduction of production time and costs, and to improve product quality by
              correcting the anticipated errors before actually machining a surface.    There
              are about fifty thousand small machine shops in the United States that could
              gain some benefit from this research.  The research is intended to enhance the
              understanding of the cutting performance and dimensional error formation in the
              end milling process, and to develop an integrated framework for precision
              machining of complex surface geometries.  The models developed here can be
              implemented in an open computer-aided design and manufacturing system to
              establish an intelligent machining planning system for three-dimensional
              sculptured surface machining.
