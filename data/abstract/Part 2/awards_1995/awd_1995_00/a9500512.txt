Abstract    :
                A 5-year program is outlined to use GOES-5, -6, and -7  geosynchronous
              magnetic field observations to determine the  characteristics of the solar
              wind-magnetosphere interaction.  A  linear prediction filter analysis of the
              dayside magnetospheric  magnetic field strength will determine the time scales
              and lags  associated with the response to variations in the north-south 
              component of the IMF, the IMF cone angle, and the solar wind  dynamic pressure.
               A Fourier decomposition of the geosynchronous  magnetic field observations
              will determine the effects of these  solar wind parameters upon the diurnal
              variation of the  magnetospheric magnetic field.  We will use the results so
              obtained  to discriminate between several suggested modes for solar wind- 
              magnetosphere interaction and to extend models for the dayside  magnetopause to
              more extreme values of solar wind parameters.  We  propose a plan to use
              variations in the east-west component of the  magnetospheric magnetic field to
              distinguish between component and  antiparallel modes of dayside merging as a
              function of solar wind  conditions.  Finally, we combine solar wind,
              geosynchronous, and  ground observations to study the effects of north/south
              IMF  turnings and solar wind dynamic pressure variations upon low-  latitude
              dayside ground magnetograms in an effort to determine the  cause of the
              enhanced H components seen in low-latitude ground  magnetograms during DP2
              convection pattern variations.
