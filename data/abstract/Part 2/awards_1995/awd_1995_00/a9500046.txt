Abstract    :
              9500046  Balling   The focus of this project is on improving the efficiency and
              effectiveness of engineering design of complex engineering systems.  The design
              of modern engineering systems requires the participation of engineers and
              others from a wide range of disciplines.  Normally, these individuals are not
              well trained to work together as a multi-disciplinary design team.  The purpose
              of this project is to develop algorithms for efficiently approaching system
              analysis and design.  Specifically, a method is sought whereby a system can be
              decomposed into disciplinary elements such that design and analysis may proceed
              within each discipline, independent of the other involved disciplines, and the
              disciplinary designs then combined and iterated into an optimal or satisfying
              system design.  The approach is to introduce coupling functions, which couple
              the analyses and designs contributed from the disparate disciplines.  Iteration
              to achieve convergence on the coupling functions is expected to provide an
              optimally designed system.  Research will include the search for robust
              application methods for the proposed approach and simplification to enable
              treatment of disciplinary large and complex engineering systems.  This research
              could provide a method for efficiently and effectively engaging disciplinary
              experts in the process of design.  If successful, it could provide an approach
              to design that leads to more optimal designs in less time than the conventional
              methods.
