Abstract    :
              9500869   de la Llave      The project involves a broad based approach to
              problems of dynamics   using methods from K.A.M. theory, hyperbolic dynamical
              systems and   numerical exploration. In particular, we plan to study questions
              such as   breakdown of invariant curves, rigidity of hyperbolic systems and  
              variational methods.      A study will be made of the long term behavior of
              systems whose   evolution is known.  The plan uses a broad based approach that 
               combines analytical techniques and numerical explorations in such a   way that
              they complement and reinforce each other.  Many of the   concrete problems that
              will be studied are motivated by hydrodynamics,  for example, to compute the
              smallest amount of stirring that   guarantees a thorough mixing.  ***
