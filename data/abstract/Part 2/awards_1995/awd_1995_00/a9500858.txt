Abstract    :
              9500858  Roland  This is a CAREER award to conduct theoretical research on  thin
              film growth of semiconductor materials and to undertake  realted educational
              activities.  The research focus will be  on issues relating to the effects of
              atomic beams and strain  on thin film growth.  By using a low-energy atomic
              beam, a  pulse of energy may be delivered locally to the growth  surface and
              tune the kinetics.  The effect of such atomic  beams on low temperature growth,
              on three-dimensional  clustering mechanisms and on the crystallization of 
              amorphous material and regrowth phenomena will be  investigated.  In addition,
              the effects of biaxial strain on  the initial stages of growth and step
              distributions will be  investigated.  The main tool of study will be molecular 
              dynamics simulations using realistic potentials, coupled  with ab initio
              molecular dynamics and kinetic Monte Carlo  simulations.    The educational
              component includes the development of a  course on modern numerical methods in
              physics, development  of educational videos related to the research and
              research  experiences for undergraduates.  %%%  This is a CAREER award for
              computer simulation studies of  the growth of thin films of semiconducting
              material.  Understanding the growth mechanisms of these films is  vitally
              important for the semiconductor industry in addition  to providing fundamental
              insights into the underlying  physical phenomena.  The educational component
              includes the  development of a new course on computer simulation for  physics,
              the production of educational videos related to the  research and the
              incorporation of undergraduates in the  research process.  ***
