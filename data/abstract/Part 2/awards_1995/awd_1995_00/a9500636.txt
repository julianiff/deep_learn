Abstract    :
              Eremenko  DMS-9500636    Eremenko will continue his study of distribution of
              values of meromorphic functions and meromorphic curves, using the new methods
              of potential theory, developed in his previous work.  He will concentrate on
              the following topics: Picard theorems for differential polynomials, extremal
              cases in the defect relations, and the value distribution for holomorphic
              curves of finite order.    Classical function theory has introduced geometric
              techniques which have proved to have far wider applicability than first
              imagined.  The subject exploits the interplay between geometric interpretation
              with powerful analytic techniques to yield some of the most complete
              mathematical results in the field of analysis.
