Abstract    :
              9522129  Gangopadhyay  The proposal by Prof. Gangopadhyay involves novel
              approaches for the deposition, characterization and device studies in Carbon
              Nitride.  The experimental work focuses on the development of two deposition
              systems, namely, a remote plasma enhanced chemical vapor system (RPECVD) and a
              capacitive discharge chamber (CDC) for the growth of  'superhard' carbon
              nitride.  The carbon films grown by these methods is expected to be amorphous
              or crystalline depending upon the parameters, substrate temperature and bias
              voltages employed in the process.  An application of these films is in the area
              of antifuzes for field programmable gate arrays (FPGA's).  Previous studies of
              this material were unsuccessful due to the stability of the plasma; however,
              the acquisition of a remote plasma system should enable the PI to achieve
              control over the C-H and N-H products in the chamber.  ***
