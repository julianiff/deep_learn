Abstract    :
              The Minority University Space Interdisciplinary Network, MU-SPIN, is a program
              for minority institutions, as well as colleges with significant minority
              enrollments, which is oriented around wide area  networking technology and its
              use in supporting interdisciplinary research.  Sponsorship is by the  NASA
              Goddard Space Flight Center, Data and Computing Division, the University
              Programs Office, the  Equal Opportunity Office, and NASA Headquarters.  Based
              on the success of the 1991-1994 meetings, this project is to support the fifth
              meeting of the MU-SPIN User Working Group, October 4-7, 1995, at  Morgan State
              University, as well as a set of smaller workshops to be held during the year as
              a  supplement to the workshops are to provide opportunities for discussions on
              networking,  communications, and infrastructure building and for the exchange
              of ideas on networking and  communications to support interdisciplinary
              research.  Funding will support the cost of participant  travel, meals, and
              arrangements for the October meeting and expenses for the smaller workshops. 
              The  project is directly relat ed to the interests of the Computer and
              Information Science and Engineering  Directorate in that CISE is actively
              supporting programs to enhance the opportunities of  underrepresented
              populations in the computing field.  Access to adequate facilities, and the 
              interchange made available by the network connections is an important aspect of
              this effort, and the  programs of the large October meeting and those of the
              smaller workshops are expected to enhance the  opportunities of the
              participants.
