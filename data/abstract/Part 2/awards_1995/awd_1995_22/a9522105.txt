Abstract    :
              9522105  Solo-Gabrriele    This is a planning award the objective of which is to
              determine  the feasibility of the approach the investigator plans to take in 
              conducting research on the factors that influence the movement of  chemical
              contaminants from surface water systems to groundwater  aquifers.   The
              investigator's objective is to incorporate  factors that influence movement of
              contaminants from surface to  groundwater aquifers in development of a
              mathematical model that  can be used in engineering design of water supply
              systems.  Factors that are planned for consideration include the relative 
              importance of storm events that yield contaminated surface water  to the
              duration of the period between storm events.    The proposal leading to this
              award was submitted in response to  NSF 93-130, Research Planning Grants and
              Career Advancement  Awards for Women Scientists and Engineers.  An
              understanding of  the mechanisms by which pollutants move from surface to 
              groundwater aquifers is necessary in the formulation of  mathematical models
              that can be used in the engineering design of  water supply systems.  Results
              of this project are expected to  guide the investigator in development of a
              competitive research  project that advances our understanding over how
              contaminants  move from presence in surface waters to aquifers used to supply 
              water for domestic and industrial uses.
