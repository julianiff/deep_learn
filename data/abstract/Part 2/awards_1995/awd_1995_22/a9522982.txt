Abstract    :
              9522982  Khoshnevis   The current state of the art of rapid prototyping
              technology is limited by parts size, surface quality and geometric tolerance. 
              In this one year research project, a novel approach to improving surface
              quality will be attempted.  It is a synergistic approach combining extrusion of
              a paste like consistency materials with a trowel like smoothing tool controlled
              by a robot.  Eventhough this contour crafting approach builds on established 3D
              additive fabrication techniques, several fundamental design issues of
              components and their assembly into a prototype machine need to be addressed in
              order to test out the feasibility of this innovative approach.   Rapid
              prototyping technology has been well accepted by designers to test out form and
              fit of new parts.  The technology is slowly evolving to the stage of making
              final parts directly from a computer design eliminating several manufacturing
              steps.  This leads to the potential of very fast cycle time from design state
              to the product launch.  Additional benefits could be envisioned in reduced work
              in process and reduced inventory of finished goods.
