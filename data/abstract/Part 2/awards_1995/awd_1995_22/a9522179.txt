Abstract    :
              Abstract:     Professor William A. Goddard at the Beckman Institute of the 
              California Institute of Technology is supported by a grant from the  
              Theoretical  and Computational Chemistry Program to perform research involving
              theory   and  simulation on problems relevant to new catalysts and chemical
              processes.    The  goal of the research is to determine a set of general
              concepts and   principles  that will form the basis of mechanistic
              understandings.  These   understandings  would make it possible to predict some
              of the properties of new systems   without  measurements or calculations.  The
              strategy to achieve this goal is to   make use  of ab initio quantum
              mechanical, QM, results combined with molecular   dynamics,  MD, studies of
              reaction kinetics.  The need to perform these QM and MD  calculations on
              realistic models of systems of practical industrial   interest is  given high
              priority.  The work is divided into method development and the  application of
              QM and MD to specific catalytic problems of industrial  importance.  This
              research is supported  under the NSF  Grant Opportunities for Academic Liason
              with Industry (GOALI) initiative.     There is enormous opportunity for theory
              and simulation to aid in  designing, developing, and engineering the catalysts
              and chemical   processes  important to industry and society.   With reliable
              simulations to reduce   the  number of experiments, U.S. industry could save
              many millions of dollars   per  year and could cut years off development cycles
              by focusing on the most  promising catalysts and processes.   To help provide
              the scientific basis   for  designing, characterizing, and optimizing new
              catalysts, the supported   research  involves a broad attack on the mechanisms
              of several industrially   significant  catalytic processes.   This theoretical
              work involves the use of both   ab initio quantum theory and molecular dynamics
              simulations. These   studies will demand size and time scales which stretch
              current   methodologies and, hence, considerable emphasis is placed on
              developing   new methods.
