Abstract    :
              9522660  Vonder Haar        The Center for the Analysis and Prediction of Storms
              (CAPS) at the  University of Oklahoma is one of the NSF s Science and
              Technology Centers.  The  goal of CAPS is to develop the scientific basis for
              the improvement of short term  forecasts (less than 24 hours) of severe
              convective weather.        The purpose of this project from the Colorado State
              University is to work in   conjunction with CAPS scientists to produce
              high-quality, gridded analyses from the   Oklahoma adaptation of the local area
              prediction system developed by the National   Oceanic and Atmospheric
              Administration.  These gridded analyses will be used by  CAPS scientists in
              diagnostic studies of convective phenomena; as background fields  for
              high-resolution Doppler-retrieval procedures; as initial conditions for 
              high-resolution numerical models and four-dimensional data assimilation
              procedures  in order to test the capabilities of the CAPS Advanced Regional
              Prediction System.   Additionally, these gridded analyses will be used by a
              variety of scientists in the  study of severe weather.  ***
