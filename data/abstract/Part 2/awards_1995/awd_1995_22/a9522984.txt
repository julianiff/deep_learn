Abstract    :
              9522984  Landis    This  is a joint research project between the University  of 
              Maine  and  Northwestern University.  The objective  of  the  research  is  to 
              observe the three  dimensional  growth  of  internal  microcracks in small
              cement and  mortar  specimens  loaded  in uniaxial compression.  The
              microcracking will  be  measured  using  synchrotron x-ray microtomography 
              combined  with  a  3-D  image analysis technique.  The  research  work 
              represents the first time that quantitative measurements  of  internal 
              cracking  of  cement-based  materials  have   been  possible  at micron
              resolution.  A clearer understanding  of  fracture  mechanisms  are critical
              for  the  development  of  materials  which  are both stronger and tougher.  
              Recently,  using  the  concepts of microfine particle  packing  in  the  range 
              of  submicron millimeter, concrete with a compressive  strength of up to 800
              Mpa has been developed.  The influence  of  particle  size  distribution
              (reactive and  non-reactive  particles) on fracture toughness is to be
              investigated.
