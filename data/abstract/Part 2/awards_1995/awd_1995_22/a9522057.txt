Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin in the
              purchase of a networking IBM RISC  workstation.  This equipment will enhance
              research in a number of areas including the following: theory  and computer
              simulation of polymers; mechanistic and exploratory organic photochemistry; ab
              initio  quantum chemistry; theoretical spectroscopy in condensed phases;
              molecular shapes and catalyst design;  and, local polymer dynamics.    A
              workstation network of fast, modern computer workstations is a new way to
              satisfy the computing  needs of chemistry departments.  Such a "computer
              network" also serves as a development environment  for new theoretical cods and
              algorithms, provides state-of-the-art graphics and visualization facilities and
               supports research.
