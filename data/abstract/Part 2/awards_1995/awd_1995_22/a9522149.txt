Abstract    :
              This dissertation research will examine and juxtapose environmental debates
              characteristic of two cities, Houston, Texas and Shenzhen, People's Republic of
              China (PRC).  The research will address the ethical concerns inherent in
              ecological effects of global economic systems predicated on the aggressive
              development of science and technology.  Having completed fieldwork in Houston,
              the dissertation student will spend a year in the PRC, developing an
              ethnographic geography of the cultural forms of everyday life within the
              context of preexisting social and spatial structures.   The fieldwork will
              involve networking, a survey of Shenzhen intellectuals, in-depth interviews,
              archival research, and mapping exercises.  Expected results will include an
              outline of the general domains and terms of the environmental ethics debates
              there and an analysis of how the attitudes of the Shenzhen intelligensia toward
              the social use of science and technology inform their ethical positions.  The
              information from the studies in Houston and Shenzhen will also provide a basis
              for analyses of how social relationships and status, as well as status within
              the world economic system, influence the ability of individuals, groups,
              regions, and nations to participate in debates about environmental ethics.
