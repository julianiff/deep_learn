Abstract    :
              Abstract  Gilgenbach  CTS-9522282    The PI proposes to  extend his work on
              pulsed laser ablation to the new film growth method of channel-spark pulsed
              electron beam ablation.  The objectives would be to develop a knowledge base
              and scaling laws on electron beam ablation, which can be compared to laser
              ablation and thus evaluate new engineering applications.  Five research tasks
              will be addressed. These include: (1) electron beam characterization, energy
              deposition mechanisms and electrical efficiency; (2) diagnostic
              characterization, using laser and optical techniques, of species composition
              (atoms, ions and electrons); (3) particulate and molten droplet generation
              mechanisms, size and density; (4) effects of electron transport, focusing, and
              plasma chemistry in background gases; and (5) electron beam ablative deposition
              of thin films and correlation with diagnostics. Where applicable comparisons
              will be made with the corresponding laser ablation results.  The electron beams
              will be generated using a channel-spark device in which high currents (~1.5
              kA),and moderate voltages (~20 keV) are employed, resulting in beam energy of
              approximately 1 J/pulse.  The PI plans to carry out both experimental and
              modeling efforts during the course of this investigation.
