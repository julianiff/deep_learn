Abstract    :
              EEC-9525533  Jones    This award provides funding for a joint
              Industry/University  Cooperative Research Center in Coating Research at the
              Eastern  Michigan University, Michigan Molecular Institute, and the North 
              Dakota State University.    The Centers' two-fold mission is to be a leading
              academic  organization that develops relevant scientific knowledge for 
              understanding and expanding the technology of paints and coatings  for the
              benefit of its members and to enlarge the cadre of  scientists and
              technologists capable of working effectively with  coatings.    The thrust
              areas of the Center's research activities are defined by  critical problems
              facing the coating industry and coating users.   These areas include:  a.)
              reduction, ultimately, elimination of air  pollution; b.) cost-effective
              improvement of product quality; c.)  improved corrosion protection.     There
              are 17 company members currently involved in Center's  research activities. 
              These research activities will be coordinated  through the Eastern Michigan
              University under the guidance of the  Industry Advisory Board.    The Center
              will perform research in seven areas of science and  engineering that are
              directly relevant to these thrust areas, often  combining resources of the
              institutions to focus on a thrust area.   Projects will be implemented
              primarily by faculty, staff, and the  students of the three institutions.     
              Additional funding is provided in this award to support two women 
              undergraduate students who will work as research assistants during  the 1995-96
              fall and winter semesters.  One student will work on a  project entitled
              "Rheology of low and Solventless Water Reducible  Coatings."  The other student
              will work on the project "Improved  Methods for VOC Analysis."
