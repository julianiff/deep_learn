Abstract    :
              9522840  Ji  An integrated study for the design, placement, and control of 
              platform, manipulators is carried out. The concept of vertex  space approach is
              extended to architectures of platform  manipulators other than the Stewart
              type. The effects of  dimensions on vertex spaces and workspaces are analyzed.
              A  variety of placement strategies are considered and optimization  techniques
              are developed. An operational space control system is  designed that bypasses
              the complex forward kinematics with  passive joint sensing. An experiment
              platform manipulator is  built to verify and enhance the analytical study and
              graphic  simulation. The research results provide a rational tool for 
              synthesis, placement optimization, and operational space control  of platform
              manipulators.***
