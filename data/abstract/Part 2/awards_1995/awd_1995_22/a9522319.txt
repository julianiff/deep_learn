Abstract    :
              9522319  Jain     A laboratory-oriented hands-on curriculum for data
              communications and computer networking will be developed. This will enable
              students to experiment with various communications/telecommunications and
              networking concepts using a workstation, a PC, or a network of workstations.
              They will be able to design new protocols, verify them using protocol
              engineering tools, implement them, and visually see the impact of their
              actions. Data message flows, packet losses, control/routing message flows,
              virtual circuit setups, link failures, bit errors, etc. will be seen by the
              students at a slow (visible) speed. Multimedia and sound effects will be used
              to show abnormal conditions such as errors and losses. Various nodes of the
              simulated network will be programmable to run automatically or be under manual
              control of students. The manual control will allow the students to see the
              effect of unpredictable actions.     The major features of this project include
              the following: 1) Hands-on laboratory-oriented curriculum requiring students to
              develop protocol modules and experiment with their designs. 2) Integration of
              traditional concepts. 3) Use of a distributed gaming/simulation environment to
              allow experimenting with unpredictable behaviors. 4) Use of multimedia visual
              techniques to show the effects of various actions 5) Application of protocol
              engineering principles to protocol development.  ***
