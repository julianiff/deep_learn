Abstract    :
              9522212  WEISS   Anthropologists around the world possess in their laboratories
              small amounts of human tissue collected in surveys of human populations over
              the past several decades.  Widespread interest exists in a worldwide assessment
              of human variation, its amount, patterning and origins; an effort to collect
              data for this purpose, called the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) has
              been proposed.  For any such project, it will be important to have open-ended
              amounts of genomic DNA from worldwide samples, so that many investigators can
              analyze them extensively.   The purpose of this project is to address the need
              for amplifying an open-ended supply of representative genomic DNA from
              field-collected or archival samples at a low cost, that can be  undertaken by
              laboratories around the world.   The investigators propose to do systematic
              developmental work on an exploratory method for amplifying small amounts of 
              DNA.  The method (Adapter Attachment and Amplification-AAA) involves cutting
              genomic DNA in usefully long fragments and amplifying those fragments in a
              specific way so that the result is a mix containing as much of the original
              genome as possible.   If this method can be developed effectively, large
              quantities of DNA can be generated that are easy and inexpensive to work with
              and store.  This approach, if successful, can have a transforming effect on the
              sample design of the HGDP as well as other large-scale genetic surveys.
