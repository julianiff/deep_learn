Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the   Department of Chemistry at the University of California-Santa
              Barbara to acquire an Applied   Photophysics stopped-flow kinetics
              spectrophotometer.  Research projects to be carried out with  these 
              instruments include:  reductive nitrosation of ferriheme proteins, mechanisms
              of  vanadium(V) peroxo  species relevant to the enzymatic bromoperoxidase
              activity, and the  characterization of intermediates in  reactions of activated
              nitroarenes and nitrogen  heterocycles.    The stopped-flow kinetics 
              spectrophotometer is useful when studying very fast chemical  reactions.  The
              stopped-flow method  permits mixing of two solutions in less than one (1) 
              millisecond.  This provides a complete  concentration-time record of the
              reactant solutions.  The  stopped-flow method is especially useful when 
              studying enzyme-catalyzed reactions and in  catalysis where the common need is
              rapid mixing for kinetic  studies.
