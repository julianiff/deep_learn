Abstract    :
              Many mass-collecting methods have been used in biodiversity surveys of
              terrestrial  arthropods, including Malaise traps (tent-like structures that
              funnel flying insects into a  collecting, jar), light traps, pitfall traps,
              sweep nets, and canopy fogging with insecticides.  Although samples should
              ideally be representative of the community or taxon selected for investigation 
              capture depends on such factors as individuals  behavior, activity level, and
              size.  Each method has  inherent sampling biases and caution must be exercised
              in comparing subsets of specimens across  samples.  Malaise traps are
              widely-used, cost-effective devices for collecting large numbers of flying 
              insects.  Their usefulness in quantitative biotic surveys and ecological
              studies has been questioned,  however, because their trapping efficiency and
              bias are generally unknown.  Using recent barcode  technology that considerably
              speeds the quantification of between-sample differences for abundant,  speciose
              taxa, this project will explore the appropriateness of Malaise traps as
              quantitative sampling  devices
