Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9522066    This project explores the use of sol-gel preparation of
              mixed oxides to achieve predictable structures or textures and to apply this to
              the synthesis of acid catalysts.  Specifically, titania-silica and
              alumina-silica are studied; the silicon precursor has significantly slower
              reactivity and this permits prehydrolysis to be used as a tuning variable.  By
              varying the prehydrolysis ratio, gel networks of various microstructures can be
              obtained.  Characterization of the product properties may provide a correlation
              of homogeneity with acidity.  Nitrogen adsorption, X-ray diffraction, thermal
              analysis, pyridine adsorption, and 1-butene isomerization are used to
              characterize the textural, structural, and catalytic properties of the mixed
              oxides.  Alternative precursors such as double metal alkoxides and performed
              sols are also studied, as are mixed oxides prepared by coprecipitation.    This
              effort should provide the means to design mixed oxides with specific
              properties.  Although the procedures to be used are well established, little
              systematic work on how the variables involved affect product properties has
              been done.  (In other words, mixed oxide preparation is more "art" than
              "science".)  Although this effort looks at catalytic properties, if successful
              it would clearly be extendable to other applications using mixed oxides, such
              as optical waveguides.    ***
