Abstract    :
              9522257  Sobel     This project is to integrate a formal method into a software
              engineering curriculum. The formal method chosen captures the external behavior
              of a system component while supporting both the compositionality of component
              specifications and the hierarchical decomposition of a system specification.
              The method will be introduced by a sequence of courses, beginning in the
              sophomore year, after two semesters of programming and one semester of discrete
              math.   The first course will address the basic skills needed to apply formal
              method techniques and will not be coupled to any implemented language. The next
              course will apply the method to a particular programming language and the third
              course will extend the concepts to the analysis and design phases of the
              software life cycle. The last course in the sequence will address concurrency
              in depth. Finally, students will test the efficacy of their modified curriculum
              through an existing project-oriented senior capstone sequence.   The project
              will be managed, monitored, and assessed by an advisory council, which will
              include members of the project and external consultants. The curriculum format,
              the evaluations used, and the final results will be made available to the
              academic community through publications and presentations.  ***
