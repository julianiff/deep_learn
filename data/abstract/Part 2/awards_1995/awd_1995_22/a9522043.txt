Abstract    :
              9522043  Wang    This project proposes to apply a new technology, designated
              "optical trapping," to study the initial events in a soybean root cell upon
              binding of symbiotic bacteria, Bradyrhizobium japonicum.  The "optical trap"
              employs a focused beam of laser light to trap a micron-sized particle(s) within
              the focal plane.  The use of the optical trap will allow B. japonicum cells to
              be moved to the surface of a soybean cell to study the effects of their
              adhesion on a single soybean cell in a defined region of the root, and with a
              clear definition of the time of binding.  Time-dependent changes in membrane
              potential, pH, calcium fluxes, and cytoskeletal organization will be monitored.
               The B. japonicum - soybean cell interaction is an example of the binding of a
              biologically significant ligand (the B. japonicum cell) to a target (soybean
              cell), and a systematic description of the structural and physiological
              dynamics of the plant cell upon ligand binding in this system may offer
              insights on the analysis of other receptor-ligand and/or cell adhesion systems.
