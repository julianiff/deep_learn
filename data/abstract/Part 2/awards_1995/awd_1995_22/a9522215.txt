Abstract    :
                This award supports a rare opportunity to search for  manifestations of
              decadal climate change in the Dry Valleys,  a remote and eqsentially
              un-instrumented region of the  world, and to examine the long-term dynamics of
              active  polygonal patterned ground.  The opportunity hinges on  extensive
              arrays of soil displacement markers installed over  30 years ago by Robert F.
              Black; whether these marker arrays  have considerable scientific promise
              depends on their  current state, and on the ability to find them.  Assessing 
              their scientific merit is particularly timely in view of the  current
              intensification of research activity in Antarctica  combined with the
              increasing concern for minimizing  environmental impacts on research
              activities, past and  present.  In this context, it is natural to question the 
              merit of maintaining monitoring sites established long ago,  and to remove
              traces of past activities, including soil  displacement markers provided they
              are no longer useful.  ***
