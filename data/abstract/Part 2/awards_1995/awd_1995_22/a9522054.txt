Abstract    :
              9522054  Kalkoran    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
              project explores a novel thin-film electroluminescent (TFEL) display technology
              based on porous polysilicon.  Phase I resulted in the first-ever electrically
              induced visible emission from thin films of porous silicon on a glass
              substrate, thus showing the feasibility of silicon-based displays.  Phase II
              will study the trade-offs among process parameters as a foundation for display
              fabrication.  An improved solid-state metal contact will be sought which
              conforms with porous silicon surfaces for high-efficiency light emitting diodes
              (LEDs).  In situ electroplating will be used to deposit metal contacts on
              porous silicon in the electrolyte originally used to form the material.  In
              this way an ohmic contact can be made to the entire nanostructred layer. 
              Because the sample is not exposed to air prior to metallization, an insulating
              oxide layer at the interface is avoided.  Finally, red, green, or blue
              polysilicon LEDs with high efficiency will be fabricated.  A dot matrix
              alphanumeric display will be tested by integrating a 5x7 array of these
              devices.    Potential commercial applications of this new technology for
              all-silicon processing of flat panel displays will be found in high volume
              manufacture of high definition home television, computer screens, and medical
              video imagers.
