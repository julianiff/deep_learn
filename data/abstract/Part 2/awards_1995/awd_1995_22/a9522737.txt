Abstract    :
                      9522737  Brei  This Research Planning Grant is to evaluate the concept
              of C-block  piezoelectric actuator design.  C-block actuators are curved 
              composite beams with at least two layers of piezoelectric materials  which have
              the potential for generating larger forces and orders to  magnitude more
              deflection than equivalent polymeric stacks.  This  project will design, build
              and test a C-block actuator for both its  static and dynamic performance.  Such
              actuators have applications  in the aerospace, automotive, health and
              rehabilitation, and  manufacturing fields.  ***
