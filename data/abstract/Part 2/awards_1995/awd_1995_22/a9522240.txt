Abstract    :
              9522240  Chiang    This Nano 95 award is for the development of a unique,
              variable  temperature UHV AFM/STM instrument which will allow unique  control
              of the sample temperature from 4K to 400K.  In addition,  the instrument will 
              be coupled to a surface analysis and  preparation system for controlled sample
              conditions.  New types  of scientific problems will become accessible with such
              an  instrument, including the adsorption of molecules on surfaces at  low
              temperatures, the in situ observation of chemical reactions  as a function of
              temperature the observation of surface  transitions in both physisorbed and
              chemisorbed systems, the  direct measurement of forces used to move atoms on
              surfaces, and  the atomic scale mechanical properties of surfaces at low 
              temperature.  %%%
