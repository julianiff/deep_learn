Abstract    :
              Basic research activities are proposed to develop analytical combined with
              numerical  and experimental approaches to the study of wave propagation through
              random media.  Optical,  acoustical, and micro- waves propagating through
              random media experience random fluctuations and these interactions between the
              waves and the scattering media affect a broad range of sensing problems. 
              Random media are common to many materials systems:  snow, fog, atmospheric
              turbulence, vegetation, and biological systems.  The proposed research is
              fundamental in nature and general in applicability.  The  proposed research
              focuses on development of multiple scattering theories as applied to
              generalized  space-time interferometry and imaging in random media.  Four topic
              areas are proposed for  investigation:  (1) Ultra-wideband scattering by random
              media (2) Angular memory signature and  generalized polarization signature (3)
              Enhanced backscattering with emphasis on clarifying the  relationship between
              volume and surface scattering especially when particle sizes are in the
              resonant  region. and (4) Imaging of objec ts in random media.  Possible
              synergism exists within the above topic  areas.
