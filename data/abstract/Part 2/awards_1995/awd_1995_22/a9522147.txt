Abstract    :
                    9522147  Berger  This is an award to start a consortium between four
              universities  to study seven stress analysis type problems of interest to the 
              industrial community.  The idea is to develop a library of  Green's functions
              which will greatly expedite the solution of  complicated but real world problem
              stress analysis problems.   These Green's functions will then be used in the
              boundary element  procedure for efficient computational codes.  These monies
              will  be used to support graduate students involved in these problems.  ***
