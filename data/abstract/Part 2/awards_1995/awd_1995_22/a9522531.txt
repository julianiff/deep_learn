Abstract    :
              Toomey   9522531  This research which is a cooperative effort between
              seismologists and computer scientists at the University of Oregon - aims to
              develop a high performance computing (HPC) environment for marine seismic
              tomography and to test that environment by applying it to existing delay-time
              data from the east Pacific Rise (EPR) at 9 degrees 30 minutes north.    This
              project will develop a problem-specific programming environment (PSPE) for
              seismologists, initially designed around an existing tomographic code.  The
              environment will extend infrastructure (already developed by the PIs) that
              supports "models of observability " for uniform tool interaction at the
              programming language level.  The extensions will raise the model abstractions
              to the applications level, giving the seismologist a familiar environment for
              interacting with development tools.  The environment will be tested first by
              applying it to delay-time data from the EPR.  This data has already been
              analyzed in publications addressing the velocity and attenuation structure of
              axial magma chambers but efforts to image the P wave velocity structure have
              focused only on the upper crustual sect.  Significant performance improvements
              in the code will, for the first time, allow a simulations analysis of the
              complete data set, resulting in an unprecedented image of the full crustal.
