Abstract    :
              NCR-95223 15  PI: Richard Pethia    In response to computer security threats,
              the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) has  established a Computer
              Emergency Response Team (CERT) to support users of the Internet. The  Internet
              CERT coordination center is located at Carnegie Mellon University's Software
              Engineering  Institute and has been active since November 18, 1988. CERT is
              chartered to work with the Internet  community in detecting and resolving
              computer security incidents.    Since its inception, CERT has responded to
              continuous stream of security incidents. The incident rate  and impact on
              Internet sites has grown steadily as the Internet user population has grown. As
              the  incident rate has grown, so has the sophistication of the intruders. Where
              intruders once focused on  exploitation of weak passwords and widely known
              vulnerabilities, they have now progressed to  examining source files for new
              security flaws, exploiting protocol flaws, and using tool kits to  automate
              their attacks and increase their impact.    CERT is expanding its program to
              increase its emphasis on incident prevention through a combination  of
              technology improvement, security awareness and training, and security
              assessment activities. This  expanded program includes two areas where CERT can
              provide special help that will facilitate the  orderly, secure progression to
              the next stage in the Internet evolution:         1. Collaboration with router
              manufacturers              2. Collaboration with network service Providers
