Abstract    :
              9522195  Quate  The proposal by Prof. Quate addresses a fundamental issue in
              nanoscience and engineering, namely, the fabrication of nanostructure
              electronic devices with a novel anomic-force-microscopy (AFM)-based
              nanolithographic technique.  The proposal uses the concept of 'direct writing'
              with AFM tips with an innovative approach to building sub 0.1 pm devices and ,
              thereby, open the door to exciting new devices research in the next century. 
              Parenthetically, if we allow the SIA roadmap, then device dimensions are
              predicted for 700 nm c hannel lengths by the year 2010 and the proposal by
              Quite leads in this direction.  The problem of manufacturing through is
              addressed with the use of MEMS technology to form an array of parallel proximal
              silicon probes (i.e.  AFM tips on cantilever beams) which are controlled by
              integrated piezoelectric ZnO actuators on a piezoresisitive cantilever.  The
              high electric field which is produced by the proximity of the AFM probe tip up
              to the semiconductor surface causes bound protons to be released under the tip
              with subsequent field-enhanced oxidation.  This subsequently serves as an
              etchant mask to transfer a nanolithograph pattern into the underlying
              semiconductor.  This work is highly revolutionary and visionary.  The basic
              element of and adaptively controlled 'nanowriter' is the component for this
              instrument research and should be well understood before moving to a large
              matrix array of similar elements.  ***
