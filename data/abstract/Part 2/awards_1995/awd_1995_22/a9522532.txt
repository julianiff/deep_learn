Abstract    :
              This is a Research Planning Grant for women who have nt had prior  independent
              Federal research.  The award is allowing the PI to  develop a research program
              in the area of multicast communications  for highly parallel computing systems.
               The planning activities are  concentrated on the investigation of routing
              contronl strategies  for multicast networks from the following aspects: 1)
              designing new  routing control strategies which can more effectively reduce the
               non-uniformity of multicast connections; 2) developing a network  simulator to
              simulate the multicast networks under these routing  control strategies, and
              gather a large amount of statistical  performance data to compare different
              control strategies and guide  the theoretical analysis in the later phase of
              the research  systems.
