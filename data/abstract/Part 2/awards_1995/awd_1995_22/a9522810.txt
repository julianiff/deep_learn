Abstract    :
              The primary objective of the project is to enhance and port a  software
              simulation package, SIMARC, to a Sun workstation  network.  The purpose of the
              SIMARC package is to enable the user  to quickly develop Modularly Configured
              Attached Processor (MCAP)  architectures and simulate the execution of various
              algorithms on  these architectures.  The SIMARC package has already  been 
              developed at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP)  for IBM PC compatible
              computers. The simulator and assembler  portions of SIMARC would be ported by a
              group at UTEP and the  architecture editor portion would be ported by a group
              at the  Instituto Technologio de Estudios Superiores Monterrey Campus  Ciudad
              de Mexico.  Also both groups would use the package to  develop high-performance
              architectures for executing signal  processing and communications algorithms. 
              The principal result  of the project would be a software package that could be
              used for  the fast prototyping of customized attached processors designed  to
              efficiently execute specified sets of algorithms.  ***
