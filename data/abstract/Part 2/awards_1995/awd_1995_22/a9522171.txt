Abstract    :
              9522171  Gulliver    The objective of this project is to conduct experimental 
              investigation of the dissolution and droplet formation processes  in riverine
              environments as a step toward formulation of better  mathematical models than
              are currently available for use in  prediction of the transport and fate of
              slightly water-soluble  pollutants of surface waters.  The experiments will be
              performed  in a moving-bed flume that was specifically designed for conduct  of
              interfacial transfer experiments.  The flume simulates  conditions in flowing
              streams that affect dissolution, rate of  droplet formation and the equilibrium
              concentration of the target  pollutant in the polluted water.    Spills of
              slightly soluble liquids on surface waters result in  the formation of surface
              slicks that move in the direction the  water is flowing while dissolving,
              evaporating and forming  droplets in the flowing water.  Environmental issues
              associated  with spills of these liquids relate to the transport properties  of
              the spilled liquid and the characteristics of the bed over  which the liquid
              flows.  Results of this research are expected to  improve the engineering
              design of mitigation measures that can be  applied to reduce the pollutional
              impact of these pollutants on  the quality of surface water supplies in
              preparation for their  intended use.
