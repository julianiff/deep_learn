Abstract    :
              9522878  Byrne    Important controls on the behavior and the rare earth elements
              in  seawater include: Solution complexation, association with organic  ligands
              on particle surfaces, and incorporation in phosphate  coprecipiates. An
              understanding of these controls is important for  a general understanding of
              metal behavior in seawater, and also  because of the closely related
              chemistries of the rare earths and  anthropogenic radioactive actinides. The
              behavior of Y, are rare  earths and actinides in complexation, coprecipitation
              and sorption  processes is highly dependent on ionic strength and pressure.
              There  is relatively little direct information allowing quantitative 
              predictions of the influence of ionic strength on rare earth  equilibrium
              processes, and an extreme paucity of data appropriate  to descriptions of the
              influence of pressure on trace metal  equilibria in general. This study will
              quantitatively characterize  the influence of pressure and ionic strength on
              the comparative  solution, surface and solid-state chemistries of yttrium and 
              fourteen rare earth elements.
