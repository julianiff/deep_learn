Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to describe and analyze the grammar  of San Miguel
              Chimalapa Zoque (MIG Zoque). This is a Mixe-Zoquean  language spoken in
              southwestern Oaxaca, Mexico. The project will  be the first detailed
              documentation of MIG Zoque and the first  study of the syntax of any of the
              Oaxacan Zoque dialects.  Project work involves twelve months of study in
              Mexico, working  with native speaker consultants to determine the grammatical 
              structure of the language. Samples of naturally-occurring speech  and narrative
              texts of various kinds will be recorded,  translated, and analyzed in order to
              study the discourse  structure of MIG Zoque and to enhance and guide the direct
               elicitation process.  The result of the project will be the student
              investigator's  doctoral dissertation. The project is expected to have 
              significance for (a) the documentation and description of  Mixe-Zoquean
              languages, which are rapidly being replaced by  Spanish in all communities; (b)
              historical work in reconstructing  epi-Olmec, an ancestor of the modern Zoquean
              languages; (c)  theoretical work in morphosyntax and syntax, by providing
              current  and usable data on a language with many interesting phenomena at 
              these levels of the grammar; and (d) the promotion (via the  foregoing) of
              research on a wide range of languages, especially  those studied in the 'field'
              and faced with imminent extinction.
