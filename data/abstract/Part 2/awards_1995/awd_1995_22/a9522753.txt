Abstract    :
              9522753  Bailey  Most research efforts to improve cycle time in semiconductor
              manufacturing have focused on scheduling issues, and efforts to reduce time to
              market have used a concurrent engineering approach to approving coordination
              between engineering and fabrication personnel.  This work will plan a research
              effort toward integrating engineering with the other functions within a firm,
              from product conception to final assembly.  The planning stage is essential
              because, while the need for thorough engineering integration is
              well-recognized, the exact description and prioritization of the problems
              resulting from its absence are not.  Collaboration with industry, including
              visits to semiconductor research, manufacturing, assembly, and packaging
              facilities, will allow appropriate case studies for the subsequent research to
              be defined.  The sophistication of both semiconductor products and
              semiconductor manufacturing processes make coordination and integration of
              semiconductor production systems particularly difficult.  The goal of this
              research is to define clearly the engineering function throughout an
              organization, to develop a predictive model of firm performance as a function
              of engineering integration, and then to develop mechanisms for combining the
              resources of the engineering function with production, assembly, and other
              departments in this high-technology industry.  Both cycle time and time to
              market could be shortened through a mechanism for engineering integration that
              allows faster identification and resolution of production problems.
