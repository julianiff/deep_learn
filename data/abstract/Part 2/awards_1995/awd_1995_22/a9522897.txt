Abstract    :
              9522897  Argento   This project will develop methods to design, build and test
              filament wound composite spindles for operation at rotational speeds of 60,000
              r.p.m.  The analytical methods, based on composite design and advanced beam
              theory, will predict the natural frequencies, stability and dynamic response
              from cutting forces, and the time history of stresses that may lead to
              premature failure.   Complementing this analytical design work, composite
              spindles will be fabricated  by filament winding. These spindles will be tested
              statically in bending and torsion, and dynamically, both in a rotating and
              non-rotating manner to experimentally determine the modes and mode shapes.    
              The impact of this research will be analysis tools to take advantage of the
              light weigh and high stiffness of anisotropic composite spindles.   This is
              significant because high speed machining is a way to increase productivity when
              machining compliant precision components.   High speed spindles are a critical
              component for machine tools to achieve these improvements in productivity and
              precision.
