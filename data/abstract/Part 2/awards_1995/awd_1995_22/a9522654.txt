Abstract    :
                  9522654  Pantelides       The concept of convex modeling provides an
              attractive alternative  for analysis of uncertainty in systems for which a
              limited amount  of information is available.  The optimization algorithms to be
               developed will be used for minimizing the volume of a structural  system under
              uncertain static loads, self-strained uncertainties  such as fabrication
              errors, temperature gradients, support  settlements, and a combination of the
              above uncertainties.   Constraints on the joint displacements and member
              stresses will be  imposed.  Another type of problem with uncertainty is that of
               minimizing the volume of a structural rotational or transnational  supporting
              springs.  Constraints on member stresses and joint  displacements are imposed. 
                  A different type of problem is one of minimizing the amplitude of  the
              primary structure equipped with a dynamic absorber when  uncertainties exist in
              the damping and frequency characteristics of  the vibration absorber and the
              primary structure.  The optimum  design of structures with uncertain structural
              properties, under  uncertain earthquake excitations will also be performed. 
              Finally  the minimum volume design of structures with uncertain soil- 
              structure interaction properties, under uncertain earthquakes will  be
              performed.
