Abstract    :
                    9522306  Issa  This project will study the reliability of models that are
              used to  predict failure of brittle materials in applications from data that 
              is generated on small test specimens.  The success of the study  hinge on: (a)
              formulating a similarity criteria for testing, (b)  selecting an adequate
              kinetic model for crack nucleation and  propagation which reflects experimental
              observations of fracture  mechanisms, and (c) formulating a three dimensional
              reliability  model for brittle struatural elements.  The study will combine the
               Weakest Link Theory for modeling crack nucleation with Statistical  Fracture
              Mechanisms formalism describing the statistical features  of the macroscopic
              crack growth.  ***
