Abstract    :
                This three-year awards will support U.S.-U.K. cooperative research in
              physiology between John Trotter of the University of New Mexico and Karl Kadler
              of the Wellcome Trust Cell Matrix Unit at the University of Manchester in the
              United Kingdom.  Other co-investigators at the University of Manchester are
              David Holmes and John Chapman.  The objective of the research is to determine
              the molecular structure and formation of echinoderm collagen fibrils.  The U.S.
              investigator, through NSF-supported research, has determined the shape and
              molecular structure of echinoderm fibrils.  In cooperation with colelagues in
              the United Kingdom, he will analyze the mass distribution of whole collagen
              fibrils from three different species and determine the molecular mechanism of
              fibril growth.   The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration knowledge
              and expertise in biochemistry and in methods for isolating native collagen
              fibrils from echinoderms.  This is complemented by the British investigators'
              expertise in biophysics and in the analysis of molecular mass distributions in
              collagen fibrils using scanning transmission electron microscopy with
              computerized image analysis.  The results will advance our knowledge of fibril
              structure in echinoderms and invertebrates.  The collaboration may lay the
              ground work for synthetic novel biomaterials based on collagen fibrils, which
              strengthen  when its structure is deformed.
