Abstract    :
              With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Forbes will  
              investigate the dynamic phenomena associated with flexible biradicals. He  
              will study the mechanisms of exchange interactions which include vacuum,  
              sigma bonds, solvent and excluded volume. Further, the principal   investigator
              will investigate the theory for spin physics of correlated   polyradicals.
              Finally, he will elaborate the dynamic effects such as   lifetime broadening
              and J-modulation.  Degradation of organic compounds which are an integral part
              of consumer   products often occurs by means of free radicals. This is
              particularly   true for products that are exposed to light (i.e., polymeric
              materials   for containers and wrapping materials). This investigation
              addresses how   this reaction occurs and what are the factors which influence
              the course   of the reaction. Thus an understanding will facilitate how
              degradation by   light can either be prevented or accelerated. Finally, the
              results of the   study will be valuable to physicists and organic chemists.
