Abstract    :
              9522864  Chuang  Fundamental linear and nonlinear gains and their polarization
              dependences in strained semiconductor quantum wells will be investigated
              theoretically and experimentally.  We will design strained quantum wells such
              that (a) the gain of the TE (parallel to the quantum-well planes) polarization
              is dominant, (b) the gain of the TM (perpendicular to the planes) polarization
              is dominant, and (c) the gains of both polarizations have nearly the same
              magnitude using InGaAs/InGaA1As and InGaAs/InGaAsP material systems.  Samples
              in which the light-hole subband is aligned with or above the heavy-hole subband
              can be designed such that the gain of the quantum-well active region becomes
              polarization insensitive.  Nonlinear optical gain processes such as band
              filling and spectral and spatial hole burning effects in strained systems play
              important roles in these inverted media and will be investigated.  Strained
              quantum wells have important technological applications in optoelectronic
              devices including semiconductor optical amplifiers and lasers for optical
              communication systems.  With our comprehensive study of the linear and
              nonlinear gains, polarization-insensitive semiconductor optical amplifiers
              using strained quantum wells will be designed using both InGaAlAs and InGaAsP
              systems.  ***
