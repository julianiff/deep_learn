Abstract    :
              9522921  Silverman   This research is to develop the first in situ glucose and
              lactate sensors for bioreactor process control.  These sensors will be designed
              to meet reasonable specifications for operational lifetime, resistance to
              fouling, and maintenance of bioreactor sterility. Multiple layeps of redox
              enzymes will be electrically connected to electrodes through
              electron-conducting hydrogels that are permeable to the substrates and the
              products of the enzymatic reaction.  This process of enzyme "wiring" is the
              basis of the sensors, and allows them to control cell growth in bioreactors by
              monitoring substrates, products, toxins, etc.   The successful completion of
              this research will improve the efficiency, reduce wastes, and lower
              manufacturing costs in bioreactors.  These sensors will also simplify the
              monitoring process, add to understanding of control parameters, and begin the
              expansion of this technology to other analytes.
