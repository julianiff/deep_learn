Abstract    :
              9522886  Floudas   This award addresses the integration of chemical process
              design and control.  The design of a process determines the properties of
              variable interaction, disturbance rejection, and set-point tracking, which
              comprise its inherent controllability.  Process design synthesis unusually
              seeks the process that extremizes some economic objective without consideration
              of controllability.  The goal of this research is to study ald develop a
              systematic approach for the interaction of design and control that will take
              into account dynamic models of the chemical process.  In particular, the
              research will focus on (1) the study of a new optimization-based framework that
              can address nonlinear problems with continuous and integer variables in the
              presence of both differential and algebraic constraints, (2) the development of
              new methods for the interaction of design and control that will address the
              issues of model uncertainties and disturbances during operation for steady
              state and dynamic performance, and (3) the application of the new framework for
              the interaction of design and control to distillation column synthesis,
              reactor-separator-recycle systems, and batch distillation columns.   If
              successful, this research will provide new insights on the design of chemical
              process facilities that could yield improved output, reduced production cost,
              and reduced environmental impact.
