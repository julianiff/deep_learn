Abstract    :
              A large but not exhaustive, collection of Henry Stommel's  work  will be
              published as a three bound volume set. The  works, from his seminal work on the
              explanation of the Gulf  Stream to more recent research on the thermohaline 
              circulation, will grouped by subject area with a brief  introduction to each
              subject by a prominent scientist who  will describe the significant impact that
              Stommel's work had  within that area of research. This organization should be 
              especially helpful to students who can gain not only an  appreciation for
              Stommel's influence, but also see how  science progresses by building on the
              work that has been  done earlier.
