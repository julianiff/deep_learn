Abstract    :
                .                Circuits are a fundamental model of computations. 
              Communication complexity and polynomial approximation have  yielded many
              advances in the last decade; yet many important  theoretical  and practical
              problems are unsolved. This  investigates the relative power of threshold, mod,
              and  binary gates as computational devices. This project provides  support
              postdoctoral associates to work with the PI to  address these problems. ***
