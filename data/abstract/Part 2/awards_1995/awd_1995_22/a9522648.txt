Abstract    :
              9522648  Salas  United States, Italy and several other European countries  have
              recently experienced the occurrence and consequences of  extreme flood events. 
              The objectives of the United States  Italy Workshop on the Hydrometeorology,
              Impacts and  Management of Extreme Floods are: a) to document the stateof- 
              the-art in these research areas; b) to compare structural  and non-structural
              approaches to flood mitigation in terms  of physical characteristics, policies,
              risk and uncertainty  management, mobilization of resources and institutions,
              and  other constraints; c) to discuss potential research topics  in the area of
              extreme flood mitigation of common interest  to all participant countries; and
              d) to disseminate the  workshop findings and recommendations to all pertinent 
              United States and European experts and agencies.  The  workshop will take place
              on November 13-17, 1995, in  Perugia, Italy.  ***
