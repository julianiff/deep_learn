Abstract    :
               9522570 Mayer  An International Conference on Ion Beam Anaysis is being held to
              address new, sophisticated ion beam techniques such as high energy beams,
              elastic recoil, and resonance methods in relation to advanced materials science
              characterization needs.  Current topics in materials growth and related ion
              beam characterization are an integral part of the conference.  There will be an
              opportunity to assess the field, and to establish ties between universities,
              research institutions, and industry.  It is expected that top scientists in the
              field will attend, and that the Conference will provide an effective forum to
              discuss and delineate critical scientific issues in this research area, and to
              consider and define the approaches and techniques needed to address them.   %%%
               An evaluation of the progress and status of Ion Beam Analysis and related
              materials processing and characterization issues, especially critical materials
              research areas of epitaxy, processing, and the relationship of materials
              research to device and circuit fabrication along with current assessments of
              the most important developments in this field will be of great value to the
              understanding and enhanced utilization of advanced materials in the field of
              electronics and photonics.    ***
