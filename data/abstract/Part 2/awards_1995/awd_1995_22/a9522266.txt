Abstract    :
              9522266  Cheng  The proposed research is focused on,  on-line dielectric 
              diagnostics of operating transformers in the framework of  electric PD
              detection.  The proposed approach consists of three  fundamental parts:  (1)PD
              signal detection, (2)Signal  preprocessing and (3)classification.  In the first
              part, temporal  PD signals as well as external noise signals coupled through 
              power lines are collected by using a data acquisition system  developed
              previously.  These signals are picked up from ground  wires of both transformer
              and bushing, from the air, or others.   Then they are fed into the block of
              signal preprocessing, where  noise cancellation and other classical techniques
              of signal  processing are employed.  The study of stochastic characteristics 
              of PD's and noises will help to design reliable and effective  filters. 
              Features used in the PD recognition block will be  determined in the task of PD
              & noise characterization.  After  performing feature mapping from the filtered
              temporal signal, a  neural network is used to identify defect types of
              dielectric  insulation in operating transformers.  The neural network is 
              trained with the knowledge of PD patterns from the task of PD 
              characterization.  ***
