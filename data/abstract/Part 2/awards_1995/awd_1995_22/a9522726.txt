Abstract    :
                  9522726  Lee  An integrated analytical and experimental study is planned to 
              examine a new nondestructive testing capability for carbon fiber  cement
              composites (CFCC) based on recent experimental observations  that electrical
              responses such as the electrical emission or the  change in the bulk electrical
              resistivity can be related to the  flaw generation and growth in some
              materials.  Carbon micro-fibers  are added to concrete to increase the bulk
              conductivity of the  concrete by forming an intricate network of fibers as an
              electrical  "tag" as well as to improve the structural performance.  The 
              primary objective of the proposed study s two-fold: (1) to better  understand
              and explain the fundamental mechanisms associated with  the electrical
              fracto-emission and bulk resistivity change in CFCC,  and (2) to establish and
              validate the experimental data and  underlying theoretical basis for the
              nondestructive testing  capability which needs to be responsive to the unique
              structural  characteristics of CFCC.
