Abstract    :
              This award is made to the University of California at Davis in support of   a
              national career planning workshop for underrepresented minority   undergraduate
              chemistry majors.  The workshop to be held July 25-28,   1996, at the Davis
              campus is the third such workshop, the first having   been held in 1992 at
              Purdue University and the second at UC Davis in   1994.  The objective is to
              bring minority students together with   high-achieving minority mentors from
              industry, academia, and government   in order to introduce the students to the
              opportunities created by   obtaining an advanced degree in chemistry.  The
              workshop will be hosted   by the University of California Davis Chemistry
              Department and will   provide opportunities for the student participants to
              observe graduate   research, advanced laboratory instrumentation, and to meet
              with graduate   students to discuss areas of mutual interest.  This award is
              viewed as a way of encouraging qualified minority   undergraduates to continue
              their studies in chemistry by introducing them   to successful minority
              role-models in a supportive setting.  The longer   term objective is to
              increase the participation of minorities in careers   in chemistry that require
              advanced education.
