Abstract    :
                      9522206  Kassner  The ductile fracture Mechanisms of constrained metals
              will be  studied using an integrated mechanics-materials science approach.  
              Common engineering situations involving constrained metals are thin 
              interlayers such as welds and brazes, metal interconnects in  integrated
              circuits and some composites.  Current theories for  ductile fracture are
              generally based on cavity growth which in turn  require  unrealistically large
              plastic strains.  two new cavity  expansion models that do not require
              macroplasticity or cavity  nuclei coalescence based mechanisms appear to be
              more reasonable.   High triaxial stress states will be studies using silver
              interlayer  specimens that are free of bulk defects.  Changes in the void 
              microstructure of the interlayer will be examined at small plastic  strains via
              the scanning electron microscope and high voltage  transmission electron
              microscopy.  ***
