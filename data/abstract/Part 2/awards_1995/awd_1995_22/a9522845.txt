Abstract    :
              9522845  Ziegert   A new design concept for coordinate measuring machines uses a
              novel parallel kinematic structure that provides five degrees of freedom for
              orientating the measurement probe.  The structure is a hexahedron formed from
              two tetarahedra that share a common base.  The six legs of the device are
              telescoping tubes that incorporate laser ball bars to measure their extension,
              held together by spherical magnetic joints.  The redundancy of six measurements
              for five degrees of  freedom positioning will be used for calibration and
              compensation for the thermal environment. The hexahedron design also promises
              lower mass, which means improved dynamic performance.  The research issues are:
               assessing the accuracy and thermal stability of the structure formed by the
              links and magnetic joints, the actuation and delivery of laser beams for
              metrology through evacuated or helium filled tubes, and control and dynamic
              performance tests.   Using  self-compensation to make it thermally insensitive,
              this design can be moved out of temperature controlled rooms to the factory
              floor.  Lower mass improves the dynamic response, so measurements can be made
              faster, lowering inspection cost.  Taken together, the impact of this project
              will be faster feedback on dimensional attributes of mechanical parts at the
              process, speeding up process improvements.  ***
