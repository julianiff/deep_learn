Abstract    :
                      9522730  Rashid  This project is to study the formation of new free
              surfaces in  solid continua.  Examples of such surfaces occur in fracture and 
              fatigue, in material removal processes in manufacturing and in  tearing of thin
              sheets.  A new theoretical construct is proposed  for study which seeks to
              overcome a weakness in classical fracture  mechanics.  An "exclusion region" is
              proposed inside which no  conventional material response model applies.  The
              conditions for  the advancement of the separation front is flexible in form and
               ideas on behavior at the microscopic level attending rupture are  naturally
              represented.  ***
