Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Joan F. Brennecke  University of Notre Dame  CTS-9522835   
              Supercritical (SC) carbon dioxide has been shown to be a viable reaction medium
              for a wide variety of reactions.  For example, it has recently been shown that
              commercially important processes, such as the asymmetric hydrogen-transfer
              hydrogenation of prochiral olefins and ketones and the oxidation of cyclohexene
              to adipic acid, can be run in supercritical carbon dioxide.  The benefit of
              operation in CO2 lies in its potential for replacing hazardous organic solvents
              (chlorinated solvents, in particular).  Being non-toxic, some reaction rates
              are actually accelerated in SC CO2, there are some examples in which the use of
              CO2 as the solvent also results in better selectivity for the desired compound,
              and the tunability of solubilities in supercritical fluids suggests possible
              energy-saving downstream separation schemes.  Thus, chemical reaction and
              processing in SC CO2 is an attractive alternative to conventional manufacturing
              techniques.
