Abstract    :
              9522082  Lau  The purpose of this project is to investigate novel nitrogen
              sources for Group-III nitride growth by organometallic vapor phase epitaxy
              (OMVPE).  Emphasis will be on the identification of (a) viable source(s) which
              will allow high quality nitride growth at lower temperatures than what are
              required using ammonia.  A close collaborative effort has been established
              between the University of Massachusetts/Amherst and Morton Advanced Materials
              (a division of Morton International, Inc.), a major supplier of metalorganic
              sources of OMVPE.  With sources developed by Morton, GaN will be grown with
              various growth parameters.  Promising sources will be identified and thoroughly
              investigated via optimization growth experiments.  Grown layers are
              characterized by microscopic, structural (double crystal X-ray diffraction and
              TEM), electrical (CV and Hall), and optical (transmission, photoluminescence)
              measurements.  Feedback of growth results to Morton allows further refinement
              of the sources.  Suitable p- and n-type dopant source compatible with the new
              nitrogen sources will also be identified through doping experiments. 
              Investigations of the effects of the nitrogen source on dopant incorporation
              will be included.  Finally, this information will be applied to the growth and
              fabrication of simple devices such as LEDs and MESFETs, allowing further
              evaluation of the layer quality pertinent to device applications.  ***
