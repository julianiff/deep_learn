Abstract    :
              9522028  Wofsy     This project will focus on the development and optimization
              of a diode-laser-based, laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) system for in situ
              detection and quantification of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the troposphere and
              stratosphere.  The research plan will exploit very recent advances in diode
              lasers and associated optical technologies in an effort to construct an
              instrument that is significantly smaller, lighter, more efficient (lower power
              consumption), less expensive, and  more sensitive.   In situ measurements of
              SO2 at ultra-trace concentrations are required to address several prominent
              issues in atmospheric chemistry.  Sulfur-containing gases play important roles
              in the chemistry of the global troposphere, in local and regional pollution, in
              the biogeochemical sulfur cycle, and in the formation of sulfate aerosols in
              both the troposphere and stratosphere.  The primary anthropogenic sulfur gas is
              SO2, but no high-sensitivity, fast response instrument exists for in situ
              detection of SO2 at the low parts-per-trillion (pptv) concentration range.  The
              detection scheme that will be investigated during this project has a proposed
              detection limit of 2 pptv/sec for sulfur dioxide and a size compatible with
              airborne deployment platforms.   Collaborative investigations between
              researchers at Harvard University and the Naval Research Laboratory have
              recently demonstrated the ability to generate the tunable 215-220 nm UV
              radiation required for SO2 LIF by frequency quadrupling a diode laser.  Further
              development, optimization, and testing of the performance features of  this
              diode-laser-based UV source will be performed during the course of this grant. 
              The minimum goals of this continuing research effort will be to attain an
              average laser power of at least 100 uW at 220 nm, while maintaining a
              sufficiently narrow linewidth of < 0.10 cm-1.  Consideration for future funding
              will be contingent on successful demonstration of these minimum performance
              specifications.  If successful, the generali ty of fluorescence detection and
              the relatively wide tunability of the proposed diode laser system will permit
              applications to a number of other molecules (for example, nitric oxide) and
              environments.
