Abstract    :
              ***  9522166  Frangopol  The main objective of this research is to develop a
              framework  for considering system reliability in evaluation and design  of
              steel and concrete highway bridges.  The study consists of  several major
              tasks.  After a review of both the current  component-oriented methodology and
              the applications of system  reliability concepts in bridge evaluation and
              design, an  objective and practical system-oriented reliability-based 
              methodology will be proposed.  In this regard, both  serviceability and
              ultimate limit states will be considered  based on the Load and Resistance
              Factor Design method.  Using  the incremental loading fault-tree strategy,
              system factor  modifiers will be introduced in both bridge evaluation and 
              design to account for the presence and interaction of  individual components in
              the bridge system.  In this manner,  the full potential of system reliability
              concepts to the  advancement of bridge evaluation and design processes will be 
              realized.  A data base consisting of at least forty-three  highway bridges
              located in the U.S. in thirteen different  states will be used to demonstrate
              and validate the  applicability of the proposed methodology.  The end result 
              will have a significant impact on improving the management of  the reliability
              of our highway bridge infrastructure.  In  fact, the proposed bridge system
              reliability methodology will  greatly assist engineers in making more rational
              decisions  with respect to both safety and economy in evaluating and  designing
              highway bridges.***
