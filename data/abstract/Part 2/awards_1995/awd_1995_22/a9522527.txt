Abstract    :
                    9522527  Salant  Rotary lip seals are found in most machines containing 
              rotating shafts.  Failure of the seals can lead to equipment  failure and
              environmental damage.  During normal operation  the seal surface is protected
              by a thin liquid film that  separates it from the shaft.  However, during
              transient  conditions the film is not fully established and this will 
              eventually lead to damage to the lip, thereby limiting the  life of the seal. 
              In this project a numerical  elastohydrodynamic model of the transient behavior
              of the  liquid film will be developed, including fluid mechanics  analysis of
              the film, solid body contact mechanics between  asperities on the two surfaces,
              structural analysis of the  lip, and analysis of the meniscus that separates
              the fluid  from the atmosphere on the air-side.  The model will predict  time
              histories of film thickness distribution, contact force  and fluid pressure
              distribution, cavitation and starvation  regions, torque, etc.  The model will
              be validated with  experimental results and will be used for parametric studies
               to develop seal designs that limit damage and extend seal  life.  ***
