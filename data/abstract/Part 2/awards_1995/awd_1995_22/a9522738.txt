Abstract    :
                      9522738  Shawki  This analytical/computational/experimental study will
              improve the  understanding of material damage and catastrophic failure through 
              shear flow localization over a wide range of loading rates,  materials and
              observation length scales.  An energy based framework  as well as second strain
              gradients in the constitutive relations  will be employed in deciding when
              dynamic shear localization occurs  in thermally-sensitive and strain
              rate-sensitive materials that  also work harden.  The experimental phase, to be
              conducted at the  Ohio State University, will study the evolution of the
              spatial  deformation field.  ***
