Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to hold a workshop involving about a dozen  leading
              researchers from academia and industry to discuss:         1.     The type of
              part description for use in SFF definition;         2.     the nature of design
              tools to support SFF fabrication;  and,         3.     the formats for data
              interchange in solid free-form  fabrication.
