Abstract    :
              9522764  Wark         This grant provides $52,145 as partial support of  the
              costs of upgrading a JEOL 733 electron  microprobe (EMP) with a PC-based
              computer control  system, a new Be window for the energy dispersive 
              spectrometer, digital X-ray imaging software and  two crystals for wavelength
              dispersive analyses.  This upgrade will allow these PI's to continue and 
              improve their high quality an often innovative  research in igneous and
              metamorphic petrology, for  which the analytical capabilities of their EMP is 
              of fundamental importance.  Specifically, the  upgrades will facilitate
              improved ability for spot  analyses of light elements and generation of two- 
              dimensional element distribution maps.  ***
