Abstract    :
              9522145  Kareem  The Wind Engineering Research Council (WERC) is dedicated to 
              address wind hazard related issues with the purpose of:  improving the
              understanding of the extreme wind phenomena in  their interactions with
              buildings and structures, and of the  consequences of these events; identifying
              and prioritizing  research areas where improved knowledge is needed; assessing 
              the state-of-knowledge and the results of wind engineering  research; and
              integrating and enhancing the interactions  among research, education and
              practice.  Some of the  activities that WERC will undertake are workshops, 
              conferences, assessments, publishing a newsletter and  preparing special
              reports.  The council will help the wind  engineering community by providing
              substantive input into  the funding activities of NSF in order to achieve rapid
               advances in developing a strong knowledge base and effective  mitigation
              measures.  ***
