Abstract    :
              9522588  Duncan    This grant provides $34,650 as partial support of  the costs
              of acquiring a continuos CO2 laser  microprobe extraction system for
              40-Ar/39-Ar  geochronology.  The extraction system would enable  this
              laboratory to analyze microgram sized samples  thus allowing for single crystal
              40-Ar/39-Ar age  determinations and analyses of melt and fluid  inclusions. 
              Such a system would allow these PI's  to expand their research on the timing
              and  duration of flood basalt volcanism, age  determination for recently
              erupted Mid Ocean Ridge  Basalts (MORB's), lunar chronology, dating of  mineral
              separates from flood basalts and deep-sea  fans and single crystal
              tephrochronology.  This  laboratory serves as a regional facility for Ar/Ar 
              geochronology and provides analytical support for  a diverse graduate and
              undergraduate student  community.  ***
