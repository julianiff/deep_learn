Abstract    :
              9522519  Hass       To stimulate interest and activity in mathematical research,
               the National Science   Foundation each year supports a number of NSF-CBMS
              Regional  Research Conferences   in the Mathematical Sciences.  Each five-day
              conference features  a distinguished lecturer   who delivers ten lectures on a
              topic of important current  research in one sharply focused   area of the
              mathematical sciences.  The lecturer subsequently  prepares an expository  
              monograph based upon these lectures, which is normally published  by the
              American   Mathematical Society or the Society for Industrial and Applied 
              Mathematics, or jointly by   the American Statistical Association and the
              Institute of  Mathematical Statistics.  Certain   features differentiate these
              conferences from typical research  conferences.  These are: (1)   Focus on a
              single important and timely area of research by a  leading practitioner, (2)  
              Continued effect and local stimulation through regional emphasis,  (3) Panel
              review for   quality, breadth, and timeliness, and (4) Published monographs 
              for a wider audience.        This project will support an NSF-CBMS Regional
              Research  Conference in the   Mathematical Sciences on Normal Surfaces and
              Decision Problems in  3-Manifolds to be   held August 26-30, 1996 at the
              University of California, Davis.   Professor Hyam   Rubinstein of the
              University of Melbourne will be the principal  lecturer.
