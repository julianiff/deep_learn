Abstract    :
              This project, supported in the Directorate for Mathematical and  Physical
              Sciences by the Divisions of Chemistry and Materials  Research and by the
              Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, and  co-supported by the U.S.
              Department of Energy Office of Basic  Energy Sciences, enables the Consortium
              for Advanced Radiation  Sources (CARS) to design, build, and operate an
              allocated sector  dedicated primarily to structural and condensed matter
              chemistry  and materials research at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) 
              synchrotron X-ray facility.  During the tenure of this forty-  eight month
              continuing grant, Drs. Stuart Rice and James Viccaro  of the University of
              Chicago, Benjamin Chu of the State  University of New York at Stony Brook,
              Philip Coppens of the  State University of New York at Buffalo, Peter Pershan
              of Harvard  University, and Mark Schlossman of the University of Illinois at 
              Chicago will lead a team of experts to instrument the insertion  device
              beamline at Sector 18 at the APS that will enable research  in three areas: (1)
              surface and interfacial properties in soft  condensed matter, molecular
              liquids, and liquid metals; (2)  static and time-dependent interfacial and bulk
              properties of  novel polymers and composites, including properties of 
              supramolecular and mesoscopic structures; and (3) chemical  crystallography,
              with emphasis on anomalous scattering, time  resolution, and high spatial and
              energy dispersion.  In this project, it is intended that the sector to be
              developed  will serve as the primary access to the APS for scientists who 
              comprise the ChemMatCARS group of investigators within CARS, and  that there
              will also be made available 25% of beamtime to  scientists in the chemistry and
              materials research communities  whose research activities would benefit from
              this facility.
