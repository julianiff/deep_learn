Abstract    :
              The Fourth World Conference on Engineering Education, to be  held in
              Minneapolis, MN in October 1995, will bring together  scholars from all parts
              of the world to discuss current  international issues in engineering education.
               This grant  will provide a third of the funds to be used to bring up to  50
              international scholars to this meeting.    Presentations and discussions at the
              meeting will focus on  the increasing need to develop greater understanding of 
              engineering education in other countries and to seek  collaborators for
              educational initiatives that will enhance  their institution's program
              offerings.
