Abstract    :
              9522547  Pai    In spite of the achievements in model order reduction, the size 
              of power systems to be simulated for dynamic analysis are very  large.  Hence
              faster methods of simulation are needed.  A  promising method is the general
              minimal residual method in  conjunction with the simultaneous-implicit (SI)
              method for   differential algebraic systems.  It is guaranteed to converge in 
              almost n iterations and easy to parallelize.  We plan to  demonstrate the
              viability of this approach as an alternative to  LU decomposition method in the
              SI method.    A second objective of the research is to apply the rich results 
              of trajectory sensitivity analysis for judging if a system is  close to
              instability for a given stressed condition.  Finally we  will compare the
              structural stability, Lyapunov stability and  sensitivity theory as applied to
              power systems.  ***
