Abstract    :
              9522728  Smith   Gasoline is produced through a costly and complex chemical
              process which relies heavily on sulfuric acid to convert less desirable alkenes
              to more productive high octane components.  The acid is expensive in itself,
              and monitoring the acid concentrations to ensure peak performance is currently
              a rigorous task, compounding time and expenses.  This research is to develop a
              diode laser-based, full-spectrum Raman scattering instrument prototype to
              safely and precisely monitor the required acid concentrations and reduce the
              cost of gasoline production.  Fiber optic-coupling will allow for safe remote
              monitoring, and an inexpensive CCD array will offer full spectrum capabilities
              that can reduce or eliminate lag time.  Maintenance of this system will also be
              reduced in comparison to other sample handling systems.      The successful
              development of this instrument will allow for rapid, continuous on-line and
              remote monitoring of the sulfuric acid concentration in the presence of
              hydrocapbons.  This will minimize the use of excess acid in the production of
              gasoline, and therefore reduce material expenses, as well as the related costs
              of transportation and handling.
