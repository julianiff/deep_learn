Abstract    :
                      9522964  Liechti  This project is to determine the nature of and the
              force vs.  separation laws for crack faces where surface interactions may be 
              occurring.  One possibility is that contact electrification may be  taking
              place during the formation of the new surfaces.  A combined 
              experimental/numerical approach will be used to extract the force  separation
              data for freshly cracked interfaces and those interfaces  that have been
              brought into sliding contact and non-sliding  contact.  These will be
              complemented by measurements of charging  and electron emission in order to
              determine if electrostatic  effects are involved in the surface interactions. 
              The knowledge  obtained in this work is expected to be useful in predicting the
               durability of microelectronic devices, coatings and adhesively  bonded joints.
