Abstract    :
              95-22134  Ritchie    The proposed project is focused on developing a detailed 
              understanding and quantitative models of the physics and  fundamental
              mechanisms of cyclic fatigue damage and crack  advance in monolithic ceramics
              at elevated temperatures.  The central aim of the present study is to
              characterize and  model the cyclic fatigue behavior of ceramics at high 
              homologous temperatures  to examine the comparable damage  and crack advance
              mechanisms in both air and vacuum  environments.  The approach will utilize
              ultrahigh  temperatures (up to 1800C) creep and fatigue -crack growth  testing
              facilities to examine subcritical cracking in a  range of microstructures in
              monolithic alumina, silicon  nitride and silicon carbide ceramics, chosen to
              vary grain  size and morphology, the crystallinity of the grain-boundary 
              phase, etc., together with detailed microstructural  characterization (using
              both in situ imaging and pre- and  post-failure electron microscopy) of the
              cycle-dependent  degradation of shielding mechanisms behind the crack tip and 
              the accumulated microstructural damage by intrinsic creep  and fatigue
              mechanisms ahead of the tip.  %%%  With the scientific understanding gained,
              this work is  intended to provide guidelines for the design of improved 
              microstructures and compositions for flaw-tolerant ceramics  with optimal
              combinations of low-temperature  toughness and  elevated-temperature resistance
              to subcritical fatigue-crack  growth.  ***
