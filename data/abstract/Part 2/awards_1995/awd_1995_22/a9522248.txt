Abstract    :
              ABSRACT  CTS-9522248    Performed metal clusters will be exploited to produce
              probes ideally suited for service as coherent  sources for the fields-emission
              of electrons and probes capable of determining the morphology as well as the
              elastic compliance of delicate nanostructures.  These probes will be
              incorporated into two prototype instruments:  (1) a low-energy electron
              microscope for obtaining atomic resolution images of nanoscale objects and (2)
              a scanning force microscope capable of nanoscale lateral resolution and of
              measuring the elastic compliance of nanostructures.  ***
