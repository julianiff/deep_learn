Abstract    :
              9522943  Xu   Fast and objective determination of the basic properties of fibers
              like: length, diameter, maturity, medullation, color and yield is a way to
              improve the quality of finished textiles and as a way of providing feedback in
              development of natural fibers.  This project will use image processing
              technology and newly proposed algorithms to solve this technical problem. 
              Considering preliminary research in this domain, new image processing methods
              of segmentation are needed to measure fiber cross-sections.  New quantitative
              characterizations that are important to fibers need to be derived from the
              enhanced image, such as crimp or the waviness of fibers, trash content and the
              hollowness of natural fibers.  Cluster analysis will be investigated for
              classification into different fiber grades.  The long term impact of this
              research will be a measurement tool that can be used to improve fiber
              development, textile grading, development of automated textile processing, and
              ultimately world trade.  ***
