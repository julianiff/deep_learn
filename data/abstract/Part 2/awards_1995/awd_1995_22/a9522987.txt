Abstract    :
                  One of the problems with programming using  higher-order procedures  is the
              absence of formal tools for analyzing the time  and space  complexity of such
              procedures.   This absence is partially due to the  fact that the current
              mathematical models of computation for higher  types are  very divorced from
              the complexity-theoretic concerns.  The  aim of this project  is to work toward
              constructing a usable, realistic  complexity theory for  higher-order
              computation.    This research model is partially based on Cook and  Kapron's
              basic  feasible functionals (BFFs), which are a class of finite-type 
              functionals  that are intended to be the finite-type analogue of PF, the 
              polynomial-time computable functions.   At type-2 there is a reasonable  body
              of  work which appears to confirm that type-2 BFFs are a reasonable  type-2
              analog  of PF.  Natural non-sequential extensions of the type-2  BFFs are
              investigated  and a theory of non-sequential `polynomial-time`  functionals is
              constructed.  This extended theory of type-2 BFFs is  also used to develop a
              theory of  computational complexity for machine  learning.    Unlike the
              situation for  type-2, for type-3 (and above), there is  not the weight of
              evidence that the  BFFs are a reasonable analog of PF.  This research tests
              several models (partly  based on the type-2 complexity)  at type-3, by
              analyzing some higher-order  algorithms involving monads,  continuations, and
              other higher-order  constuctions.    An intermediate goal is to use the
              experience gained from this  work on  the complexity of finite-type
              functionals, to develop `complexity  theoretic` solutions to domain equations. 
              Such solutions have the  potential of  providing settings in which one could
              examine both  semantic and  complexity-theoretic features of languages such as
              ML.
