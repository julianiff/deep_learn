Abstract    :
              9522768  Mouring  This is a planning award.  IN 1993, the Committee of Marine 
              Structures concluded that research in advanced composites was  strongly
              recommended and crucial to the future competitiveness of  the U.S.
              ship-building industry.  This project will investigate  the feasibility of
              using advanced composites in one such area,  large surface ship hulls for both
              military and commercial use.  The knowledge gained would be useful to the
              construction industry  as well as the marine industry.  ***
