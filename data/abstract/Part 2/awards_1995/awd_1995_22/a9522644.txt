Abstract    :
              9522644  Glatz  This proposal is on research to establish a data base to aid in 
              the use of transgenic soy beans for the large-scale production of  recombinant
              proteins.  Of particular interest are the degradation  and purification
              processes involved when producing and isolating  a recombinant protein from
              transgenic soy beans.  Basic goals of  this research include two main
              activities: (1) to determine which  steps in conventional soy bean processing
              are likely to influence  the yield and activity of recombinant proteins from
              transgenic  soy beans, and (2) to investigate the feasibility of using 
              "purification fusion" technologies to aid in the recovery of  recombinant
              proteins from soy bean extracts.  The latter activity  is to be investigated
              using experiments by adding the proteins,  beta-glucuronidase and lysozyme, as
              well as experiments with  actual transgenic soy which will contain these
              proteins along  with the protein neomycin phosphotransferase II in beans
              supplied  by Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc. located in Johnstown,  Iowa.
