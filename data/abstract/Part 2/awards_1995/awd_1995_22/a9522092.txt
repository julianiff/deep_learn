Abstract    :
              9522092  Luther    This  project will investigate the oceanic response to wind
              forcing  in  the  vicinity of islands.  It is expected that  Island  Trapped 
              Waves  (ITW) will be an important part of this response at  periods  of  days 
              to weeks.  Existing sea level, current meter, and weather  observations  will 
              be used in the examination of  the  kinematics,  structure,  and  dynamics  of 
              ITW  around  the  Hawaiian  Islands.  Analytical models of increased complexity
              will be used to elucidate  basic physical principles.  Existing numerical
              models, modified  to  include  topography  of  increasing  realism,  will  be 
              used   for  simulation.  ITW  are  expected  to  transmit  energy   over   long
               distances,  contribute  to  local upwelling  and  downwelling,  and  perturb
              deeper flows. Thus, an improved understanding of ITW  would  benefit   shipping
               and  fisheries,  and  improve  predictions   of  contaminant  dispersal in the
              vicinity of islands. The  project  is  particularly timely due to the increased
              scope of the data sets now  available for analysis.  ***
