Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry  
              Program provides continued support to Dr. Michael Lattman of the   Chemistry
              Department, Southern Methodist University, for the   investigation of main
              group elements with macrocycles, that is, large   organic species which bind to
              the main group element through more than   one atom.  The macrocycles used in
              this project, calix(4)arenes, can bind   through up to four oxygen atoms,
              imposing constraints which result in   unusual types of bonding.  For example,
              six coordinate compounds of   phosphorus and silicon have been observed in
              these systems.  The goal of   this research is to prepare and characterize
              phosphorus and silicon   compounds of this type, including the synthesis of
              clusters of the   macrocyclic units.  In some cases, silicon-transition metal
              bonds will be   formed in the chain-links between the macrocyclic units.  In
              other cases,   transition metals may be able to be incorporated into cavities
              formed by   the macrocycle as sterically adjusted by association with
              phosphorus or   silicon.  This fundamental research is primarily designed to
              test the bonding   capabilities of silicon and phosphorus, but may result in
              improved   understanding of the action of transition metals in shape selective 
               catalysts or a new approach to catalyst design.
