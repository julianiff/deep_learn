Abstract    :
              Funds are requested to purchase a state-of-the-art 600 MHz  nuclear magnetic
              resonance spectrometer with triple-  resonance and pulse-field gradient
              accessories to be used by  three major groups in the Department of Chemistry
              and the  Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, and by several  minor
              users in the Department of Chemistry    This instrument is needed to provide
              high-resolution and  high-sensitivity homo-nuclear multi-dimensional NMR 
              capabilities for carrying out many new NIH-funded research  projects and
              several new directions derived from existing  NIH-funded projects.  Theses
              include structural and  functional studies of signaling proteins,
              transcriptional  regulation and DNA repair by proteins, and structural 
              immunology and virology, all of which rely on successful  determination of
              three-dimensional structures of biological  macromolecules in solution.
