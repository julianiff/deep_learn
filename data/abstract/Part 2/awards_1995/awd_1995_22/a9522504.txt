Abstract    :
              9522504  Singh    The  objective  of the proposed research  is  to  study  the 
              effect of the nature and amplitude of cyclic electric fields  on  crack 
              propagation.   Most  piezoelectric  leadzirconium  titanates  (PZTs)  are  used
               under  AC  fields,  where  the  combined   mechanical  and  electrical 
              loading  can   cause  component failure.  Finite element models developed  in 
              the  current   project   will  be  extended   to   describe   the 
              electromechanical  response  of  PZT  under  a  variety   of  boundary 
              conditions.   In addition, a  novel  technique  of  laser  Raman spectroscopy
              (LRS) will be applied to  directly  measure  the distribution of crack tip
              stresses produced  by  applied electric fields.  The results will be compared 
              with  stresses calculated using FEA models.  The proposed research  objectives
              will be accomplished by performing in situ  crack  propagation studies in PZT
              ceramics under static (DC) and  cyclic    (AC)    electric   fields,   directly
                 measuring  electricallygenerated crack tip stresses in situ using  LRS, 
              developing a finite element model to describe the effect  of  applied  electric
              field on crack propagation,  and  studying  the  influence  of  microstructure
              and  composition  on  the  induced phase transformations in PZT ceramics.  %%% 
              These   studies   will  lead  to  a  new   and   fundamental  understanding  
              of   the   electromechanical   response   of  piezoelectric   materials  under 
               combined   electric   and  mechanical  loads.  A new techniques using LRS for 
              directly  measuring crack tip stresses will be demonstrated along with  the 
              possibilities  of induced phase transformation  in  the  strontium-doped  PZT
              system.  ***
