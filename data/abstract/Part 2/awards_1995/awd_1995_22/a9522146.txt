Abstract    :
              9522146  Meyer    Abstract    Interface '95 is a conference which will bring
              together researchers and practioners in statistics and computing science, to
              discuss the theme of ``Statistics and Manufacturing,'' with a sub-theme of
              green manufacturing, the environment, and quantitative environmental science. 
              Many of today's environmental concerns are a consequence of past manufacturing
              decisions--decisions that were often made with statistical insight.  It is
              surely fair to suggest that in order to mitigate tomorrow's environmental
              problems we must begin by understanding today's manufacturing processes.  Here
              the combination of statistics, computing science, manufacturing, and the
              environment becomes particularly compelling.  The Interface conference provides
              a unique opportunity for professionals in statistics, computing science, and
              various application areas to interact on issues at the interface of these
              disciplines. The Symposium fills a critical gap between the activities of our
              large professional societies. The 1995 Symposium on the Interface of Computing
              Science and Statistics will be held June 21-24, 1995 at the Vista Hotel in
              Pittsburgh Pennsylvania.
