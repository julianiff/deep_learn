Abstract    :
              9522613  Zabaras   The project will pursue the development of inverse techniques
              that can be used for a systematic multi-design of bulk metal forming processes.
               Computational algorithms will be developed to design forming dies and preforms
              and to select optimal process conditions such that products of desired
              mechanical properties and geometry are obtained from given raw materials.   The
              work has a high probability of being used in practical engineering design.  If
              successful, it will benefit a significant number of manufacturing industries by
              providing a fresh outlook on design techniques and the means to optimally
              design forming processes that results in reduced deficiencies in the finished
              products.  Finally, the research methodology could be applied to a variety of
              scientific and engineering problems with significant contributions to the
              growing field of inverse problem theory.
