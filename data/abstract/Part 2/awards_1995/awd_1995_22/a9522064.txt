Abstract    :
                Non-technical Summary, Grubb T. IBN-9522064  Patterns and Processes in a
              Non-ecotone Hybrid Zone.         Recent advances in molecular genetics have
              spurred  interest in hybrid zones.  Work has focused on specifying  the width
              of hybrid zones, searching for correlations  between the locations of such
              zones and environmental  clines, and examining hybrid-zone dynamics through
              time.  Progress has been slower in describing behavioral and  genetic processes
              responsible for the observed patterns.  This proposal focuses on behavioral and
              genetic factors  maintaining the hybrid zone between two small passerine 
              birds, the Carolina chickadee (Parus carolinensis) and the  black-capped
              chickadee (Parus atricapillus).  The project  will assess experimentally
              whether a hybrid zone is  maintained by differential reproductive success of
              hybrids  to environmental factors or by genetic incompatibility of  hybrids.
              The findings of this study should elucidate  fundamental evolutionary processes
              involved in speciation.
