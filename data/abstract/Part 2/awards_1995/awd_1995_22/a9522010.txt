Abstract    :
                    9522010  Sadeghi  Failure of lubricated tribological contacts is in most
              cases  caused by debris in the lubricant.  This study will develop  analytical
              and experimental techniques to calculate and  measure the effects of debris on
              performance parameters such  as pressure, temperature, film thickness, and
              stress  distribution in the solid surfaces.  The stress calculations  will be
              used to model crack propagation in fatigue spall  development leading to
              mechanical failure.  A multi-purpose  tribotester will be used to obtain
              experimental data to  validate the model from tests with lubricants that
              contain  various concentrations and sizes of debris.  ***
