Abstract    :
              9522189  Tekula       The research conducted under this award will investigate a
              critical molecule detector for single biological cells.  This non-invasive,
              real-time, high resolution device employs stimulated Raman scattering to
              measure the concentrations and temporal evolution of several different
              molecular species.  The Raman scattering diagnostic technique offers an
              attractive alternative to the often used laser induced flourescence.  It allows
              the measurement of multiple species even in aqueous solutions, and signal
              enhancement is possible by utilizing resonance Raman techniques.   The proposed
              detection device has applications in many fields for the continuous measurement
              of several molecular concentrations in small samples.  This includes virus and
              cholesterol measurements, blood gas analysis, drug monitoring and
              manufacturing, and possibly environmental analysis.
