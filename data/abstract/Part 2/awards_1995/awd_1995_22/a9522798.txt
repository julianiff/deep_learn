Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CMS9522798  PI:  Kulatilake, University of Arizona    Satisfactory
              procedures are not available in rock mechanics  to quantify  joint roughness
              and to predict the peak shear strength of  natural rock  joints.  Experimental,
              theoretical and analytical procedures  will be  applied in this research to: 
              1) evaluate the accuracy of  the methods used  to calculate roughness
              parameters of both stationary and non-  stationary  profiles representing
              discontinuity interface roughness, 2)  find parameter  sets which have the best
              capabilities in quantifying  roughness of natural  rock joints in one
              dimension, and use those sets to quantify  roughness of  natural joint surface
              in two dimensions, and 3) develop new  peak shear  strength criteria for rock
              joints which are capable of  explaining the  anisotropic behavior of peak
              strength due to roughness, as  well as  quantifying the dependence of peak
              shear strength on the  effective normal  stress.
