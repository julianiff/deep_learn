Abstract    :
              9522537  Arnow     This project incorporates advances in distributed processing
              research into the entire undergraduate computer science (CS) curriculum,
              starting from CS 1. This involves constructing a vertical integration of this
              new programming methodology. As a result, (1) every student in CS will be
              acquainted with distributed processing; (2) students will have time to absorb
              key ideas introduced in elementary courses and these ideas will be reinforced
              in advanced courses; (3) the theory and techniques of distributed computing can
              be presented as the students' readiness permits and as appropriate applications
              are encountered in the curriculum.     At the outset, short modules addressing
              distributed computing issues will be incorporated into the two beginning
              programming courses. Subsequently, additional modules will be included in the
              discrete mathematics course, the shell programming course, and the operating
              systems course. Advanced courses will integrate distributed computing as part
              of the student's standard CS toolkit. Special topics courses, oriented towards
              challenging applications, will be revised to exploit the students' training.   
               In the third year of this effort, a faculty development workshop for CS
              faculty from around the country will be organized in order to disseminate the
              results of this effort.  ***
