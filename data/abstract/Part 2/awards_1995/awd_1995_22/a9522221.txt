Abstract    :
              9522221  Boland  This award provides funds to develop a dual-probe scanning 
              tunneling microscope (DP-STM) to investigate nanoscale material  and device
              properties.  DP-STM is essentially identical to  conventional single probe STM
              except that it enables two  independent STM probes to be positioned 10-100nm
              from each  other.  This capability will be achieved by the controlled  growth
              of nanowhiskers on each STM probe.  A method is  described to reliably position
              the whiskered probes within the  prescribed separation.  In contrast to
              conventional STM which  can only measure local static properties of materials,
              DP-STM  opens up whole new areas of investigation, particularly in the  area of
              non-local dynamical and relaxation phenomena.  By  selecting the locations of
              the STM probes it is possible to  measure transport and surface band dispersion
              along any  particular direction in the material.  A variety of novel pump- 
              probe experiments are also possible.  For instance, it is  possible to measure
              how charge injection at a particular  location affects the electrostatic
              potential and density of  states at some nearby location.  The latter is
              particularly  interesting since it amounts to a fundamental description of  the
              local chemical reactivity.  DP-STM also represents a  potentially powerfully
              technique to probe the characteristics  and performance of nanodevices.  ***
