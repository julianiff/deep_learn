Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS 95-22724   Higdon    The proposed work will address an important
              need for more information  concerning the dynamics of fluid interfaces and
              droplets.  There are numerous industrial applications that include
              distillation, liquid-solid extraction, drying, flow through packed beds and a
              variety of separation processes.   In general, multiphase   flows with fluid
              interfaces  and solid boundaries arise in a myriad of specific processes.  The
              proposed work   will provide a scientific basis for analyzing and controlling
              the dynamics of fluid interfaces across the full   range of applications.    
              The approach is a combined analytical/numerical treatment.  Four specific
              projects will be included in the   research program:     1. The stability of
              three dimensional drops attached to solid substrates will be studied using
              Boundary Element analysis combined with NewtonOs method.       2. Droplet
              displacement using acoustic excitation will be studied perturbation analysis in
              combination with the boundary element technique.     3. Strongly non-linear
              droplet oscillations will be studied utilizing a Galerkin/finite element 
              analysis of the Navier-Stokes equations.     4. droplet transport through
              capillaries and constrictions subject to strong acoustic forcing.  the final
              goal is to establish the mechanisms of enhanced transport rates that have been
              observed experimentally.
