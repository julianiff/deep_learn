Abstract    :
                  9522142  Gann  The Japanese building and construction industry is one that
              is  competitive with the U.S. industry, both in size and capability.   The U.S.
              last reviewed the status of the Japanese industry in 1990.  The Japanese
              industry was then seen as more progressive than that  in the U.S. and likely to
              become even more so in several ways.      A team of experts from industry,
              academia, and research  laboratories will review innovative construction
              projects and  construction-related R&D activities at government and company 
              research institutes; construction materials and new capabilities  facilitated
              by new materials; construction field operation &  automated equipment; building
              mechanical, control and safety  systems; types & design of structural systems;
              computing and  information sharing in design and construction technologies
              related  to environmental protection and energy conservation.  Within these 
              areas, the report will focus on the innovation process.
