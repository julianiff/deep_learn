Abstract    :
              9522301  Cypher  MIMD (Multiple-Instruction-Stream, Multiple-Data-Stream)
              parallel  computers are naturally asychronous.  Many MIMD computers use a 
              separate clock for each processor in order to avoid clock skew  problems. 
              Furthermore, even if all the processors use a common  clock, the timing of
              commulication events is not known in advance  due to factors such as data
              dependent processing times, processor  interrupts and variable network
              congestion.  This asynchrony has  a major impact on the design of the machine's
              communication sub-  system the semantics of the programming model, and the
              creation  of parallel algorithms.  This research studies principles for the 
              design and use of asynchronous parallel computers.    Specifically, three key
              areas of asynchronous parallel computing  are studied.         1. specifying
              the semantics of message-passing, shared  memory, and other, novel, programming
              models.         2. Creating efficient communication protocols that implement 
              the above programming models, and         3. evaluating metrics and models for
              the design of  algorithms for asynchronous parallel computers.    This research
              will result in more efficient communication in MIMD  machines, novel techniques
              for reasoning about and using  asynchronous parallel computers, and a better
              understanding of  how the theoretical community's body of knowledge in parallel
               algorithms can be applied to real machines.  ***
