Abstract    :
              9522207  Bernat   This award provides infrastructure support for a program
              designed to substantially increase the number of minorities, particularly
              Hispanics, who complete degree programs in the areas of computer and
              information science and engineering.  It involves both the Computer Science and
              Computer Engineering Departments at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). 
              The project is built around the concept of Affinity Groups, groups which are
              centered about a research area and which involve both graduate and
              undergraduate students and one or two faculty members at the center of each
              group.  Within the groups, emphasis is on developing social and communication
              skills as well as on research and technical skills.  A strong evaluation
              component is built into the project.  It is anticipated that the structure
              developed has the potential to become a model for the success of minority
              students at a wide range of similar urban, commuter institutions.  ***
