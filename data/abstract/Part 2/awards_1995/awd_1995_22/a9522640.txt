Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is to design artificial nucleases based on   quinone
              methides which hydrolyse the DNA phosphate backbone under mild   conditions. To
              determine the mechanistic details of action of quinone   methides, natural
              products, such as mitomycin C and daunamycin, will be   investigated by
              electrochemical studies, Nernst-Clark plots, pH rate   profiles and product
              studies. Cyclopropyl quinone methides will be   investigated by spectroscopic
              studies. Aziridinyl hydroquinones will be   studied to obtain a structure
              activity relationship for fate and   nucleophile selectivity of reduced
              aziridinyl quinones. With this award,   the Synthetic Organic Program is
              supporting the research of Dr. Edward B.   Skibo of the Department of Chemistry
              and Biochemistry at Arizona State   University. Professor Skibo will focus his
              work on the study of the   formation and fate of reactive species such as
              quinone methides.These   studies will impact areas including natural product
              chemistry and the   design of artificial DNA cleaving agents.
