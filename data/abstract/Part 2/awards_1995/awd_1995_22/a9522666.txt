Abstract    :
              The U.S. Navy will provide logistics support at Thule Air Base, Greenland for
              scientists conducting research projects on the Greenland ice sheet. 
              Ski-equipped C-130 aircraft will be provided to transport researchers to the
              site of glaciolgy and environmental geochemistry projects near Camp Century. 
              Those projects are investigating the history of the ice sheet and the
              environmental quality of the air over Greenland.  ??
