Abstract    :
              9522994  Whetten    This award provides funds to the American Vacuum Society for
               the partial travel support of 30 graduate students to attend  the 8th
              International Conference on Scanning Tunneling  Microscopy and Related
              Techniques. The conference will be  held in Snowmass Village, Colorado during
              July 23-28, 1995.  The aim of this conference is to enhance the interface 
              between material science, engineering, electronic, and other  areas.  Paper
              presented at this conference will be published  in the Journal of Vacuum
              Science and Technology.
