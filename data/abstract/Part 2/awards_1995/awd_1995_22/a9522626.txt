Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT  OPP-9522626    This workshop will bring together Arctic indigenous
              people and applied health scientists from the United States, Canada and Siberia
              to discuss ethical issues in health research. Many of these issues involve
              social and cultural communication and the linkages between rapid social change
              and health status. This linkage is recognized by the U.S. Arctic Research
              Policy Act of 1984 and the Polar Research Board of the U.S. National Academy of
              Sciences. The objectives of the workshop are to significantly extend the
              current dialogue between health researchers and indigenous peoples'
              organizations in the circumpolar north, to exchange information on health
              research ethics, to adopt principles on health research ethics which may be
              adopted by the circumpolar nations, and to ensure indigenous participation in
              the development of these prilciples. The workshop will take place in Inuvik,
              Canada on June 2-3, 1995. U.S. support is being provided for Alaskan and
              Russian participants. Canada is supporting Canadian, Greenlandic and European
              participation.  ***     ??
