Abstract    :
              With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Morton of the   Univ.
              of Cal. Riverside will investigate the mechanistic dynamics of gas   phase
              organic ion reactions. In this endeavor theory will be compared to   the
              results and classical reaction mechanisms. Specifically, the   structures of
              perfluorinated cations, the nature of vinyl cations, the   mode of
              decomposition of t-butyl ethers, isotope scrambling of primary   alkyl phenyl
              ethers, hydride shift vs oxygen bridging in ethanol and it   derivatives and
              the electrophilic attack of double bonds by protonated   acetaldehyde will be
              examined. The nature of these investigations, if   successful, should provide
              new insights into very fundamental organic   processes.  Reactions occurring in
              the gas phase have both a fundamental and a   practical value. The fundamental
              value results from the fact that the   reactants are unencumbered by solvent.
              Thus intrinsic data on a given   process can be obtained. The practical value
              in this case results from   the fact that these types of reactions occur in the
              atmosphere. Thus, our   understanding of such pathways  provide a platform for
              understanding a   variety of pollution problems. This proposal addresses both
              of these   concepts.
