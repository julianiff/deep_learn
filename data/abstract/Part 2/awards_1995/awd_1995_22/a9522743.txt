Abstract    :
                          9522743  DeVries  The general goals of this research are the
              development of bases for  better performance predictions, improved reliability
              of design  methods and to explore processes by which structure might be 
              altered to enhance polymer and composite material performance.   This project
              will study the combined effects of stress and common  industrial environmental
              agents on the structural integrity of  polymeric materials.  It also will
              explore and interrelate the  fracture/failure phenomena from the microscopic
              scale to the macro  level.  It is noted, for example, that the rate of
              degradation is  particularly severe for many very high strength oriented
              polymers.  ***
