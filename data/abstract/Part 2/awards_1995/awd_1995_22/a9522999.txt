Abstract    :
              The University of Southern California (USC) is collaborating with two
              institutions in Mexico City (ITAM and CINVESTAV) to advance the methodology of
              simulating complex systems, with especial application to neural models at
              different levels of analysis.  To provide multi-level simulation we integrate
              our present neural simulation language NSL with the facilities for
              object-oriented management of hierarchical structures called schemas provided
              by the abstract schema language ASL. This will be linked to work in databases
              for the representation of biological data underway at USC as part of the Human
              Brain Project supported by several US agencies. Additionally, the project
              complements a second NSF-CONACyt collaboration, between Georgia Tech and ITAM,
              that studies the technological issues of `Ecological Robotics: A
              Schema-Theoretic Approach`.  The methodology will provide simulation tools
              which will help neuroscientists gain a better understanding of the dynamical
              processes associated with biological phenomena, and a technology  with 
              implications far beyond the brain research community.
