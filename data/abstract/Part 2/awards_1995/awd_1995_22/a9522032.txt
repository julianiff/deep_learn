Abstract    :
              This award supports a research visit to Germany by Radoslov Goldman, a doctoral
              degree student of Professor Valerian Kagan at the University of Pittsburgh. 
              Mr. Goldman's dissertation research in biochemistry will be enhanced by the
              opportunity to work for ten weeks in the laboratory of Professor Wolf Bors of
              the Institute for Radiation Biology at the Research Center for Environment and
              Health in Oberschleissheim, Germany.  The general subject of his research is
              the mechanism of reactions of low energy radicals with proteins.  In
              particular, he is interested in the catalytic reactions of phenoxyl radicals
              with low molecular weight and protein sulfhydryl groups, which include
              processes in RNA cleavage.  Dr. Bors is an expert in pulse radiolytic studies
              of reaction rates and his recently developed technique for studying
              phenoxyl-radical reactions in aqueous solutions will be invaluable to Mr.
              Goldman's dissertation research.  In return, Dr. Bors will benefit from the
              extension of his technique to proteins and peptides.  The electronic structure
              of organic sulfur compounds determines their abilities as antioxidants and
              their roles in catalysis and enzymes.  This research will add to the knowledge
              of the factors which actually control the rates of these processes, through 
              experiments which link known structural characteristics to rates of oxidation.
