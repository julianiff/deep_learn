Abstract    :
              This program is the third year of a three year continuing grant  awarded to the
              Florida Institute of Technology.  The principal  investigator has transferred
              to the University of Central Florida,  and had no residual second year funding;
              thus, the one-year award  to UCF.    The project investigates the rotational
              bursting of F-coronal dust  particles to high density coronal mass ejections in
              the F-coronal  region.  Rotational bursting of F-coronal dust may take place
              due  to the tension caused by high spin rate, which can be driven by  four
              different spin mechanisms.  These mechanisms will be  investigated
              theoretically.    Repeated rotational bursting from the parent particle and its
               fragments will alter the size distribution of the dust, and  ultimately result
              in ejecting the resulting smaller particles from  the solar system by the
              action of solar radiation pressure  overcoming the gravitational attraction of
              the Sun.***
