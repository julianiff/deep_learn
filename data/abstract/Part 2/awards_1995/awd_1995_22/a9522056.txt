Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT 9522056 Sinai  Princeton University will host a conference "Prospects
              in Mathematics" on the occasion of the 250th anniversary of Princeton
              University.  The goal of the conference will be to discuss the most promising
              directions for the future development of Mathematical Science.  The areas to be
              covered include algebra and number theory; geometry; analysis; mathematical
              physics; and probability theory.  This award will provide funding attendance
              for less senior people and for women and  under-represented minorities.  Other
              sources are available for support of the speakers.
