Abstract    :
              9522274  Hjortso  This project is on research to study autonomous oscillations
              of  S. cerevisiae growing in a chemostat under glucose limitation.   The casual
              nature of such oscillations is unclear although  biological and mathematical
              models able to simulate the observed  behavior have been proposed.  A
              previously developed age  structured model will be used in this research.  This
              model can  use division age to explain the onset of oscillations.  A 
              simultaneous program of experimentation and model refinement will  be used to
              increase understanding with the ultimate goal of  bioprocess improvement.  ***
