Abstract    :
              9522208  Butler       The current research involves planning activities that
              will  lead to a subsequent proposal for funding of the research to  develop an
              incipient fault detection and predictive maintenance  method for power
              distribution systems.  The major objective of  the planning activities is the
              development of the architectural  framework for the incipient fault detection
              and prediction  scheme.  Also a scheme for predicting the useful remaining life
               of transformers will be developed.  Then the appropriateness of  extending
              this methodology to other distribution equipment will  be shown.  Also a
              thorough literature review of existing  distribution predictive maintenance
              systems will be written.         Mathematical techniques utilizing approximate
              and detailed  models, expert systems and neural networks will be employed to 
              develop the transformer remaining life prediction scheme.  The  development of
              this scheme is significant because transformer  failure can be catastrophic and
              expensive.  ***
