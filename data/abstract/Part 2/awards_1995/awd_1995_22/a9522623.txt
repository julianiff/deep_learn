Abstract    :
              In this RUI proposal from the University of Puerto Rico, Humacao, funded   by
              the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,  
              Alegria will study the photochemistry of quinones in aqueous phase.  The  
              specific goals are to determine the structural characteristics of   quinones
              necessary for water photooxidation; to measure relative quantum   yields for
              these systems; to determine the role, if any, of hydroxyl   radicals in the
              photooxidation; to determine whether superoxides are   formed during the
              photooxidation; and to determine the mechanistic   implications of the presence
              of oxygen on the photooxidation.  All   experiments are to be of the classical
              photochemical type using Hg-Xenon   lamps for irradiation and EPR for product
              determination.  Quinones are natural products which play important roles in
              bacteria, the   photosystems of green plants, and cell mitochondria.  Models
              with quinone   have been created to mimic photosynthesis and cellular
              respiration.  The   results on these studies of the photochemistry of quinones
              should be   useful in understanding naturally-occurring and artificial light  
              conversion and storage.
