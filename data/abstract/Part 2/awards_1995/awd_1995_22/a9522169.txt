Abstract    :
                      This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to develop
              a prototype instrument which combines pulsed-laser photoacoustic detection with
              optical measurements of fluorescence to determine fluorescence quantum yields.
              The instrument will be more accurate, easier to operate, and less expensive
              than existing methods for measuring quantum yields. In addition, this
              photoacoustic method will become a powerful tool for elucidating the
              photophysics of fluorescent and nonfluorescent chromophores. It will measure
              photo-induced molecular volume changes and provide important information of the
              disposition of electronic excited state energies into various pathways,
              including intersystem crossing, electron ejection, and other excited state
              reactions.  This project will attempt to design and build a sophisticated
              prototype and test it by measuring quantum yields of several dyes with
              different spectral properties.  The research will also examine photo-induced
              molecular volume changes in a series of common laser dyes with the intention of
              developing a molecular volume standard.  A relatively complex fluorescent,
              photochemical molecule, pyranine, will be analyzed for all aspects of its
              photophysics and photochemistry. Finally, the photophysics of chromophores
              bound to proteins will be examined.       If the project is successful, the
              instrument will become an important analytical tool providing quantitative
              information on molecular excited states for all those laboratories that make
              serious use of fluorescing chromophores as probes.
