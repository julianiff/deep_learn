Abstract    :
              9522642  Fuller  This proposal involves research into the dynamics and 
              structure of multi-component polymeric materials.  Several  problems will be
              investigated in the course of this work,  and will make use of a newly
              developed rheo-optical method  available in our laboratory:  polarization
              modulated Raman  scattering (PMRS).  The primary objectives of the work are 
              the following:  1. Development of Two-Dimensional Raman  Scattering (2D-RS), 
              2. Orientational dynamics of homopolymer melts near the  glass transition, 3.
              Dynamics of compatible polymer blends,  and 4. Flow-induced Migration in
              Polymer Solutions.  %%%  This work provides a molecular-level basis and
              rheo-optical  technique to understand flow phenomena and dynamics among 
              polymeric materials during flow, processing, molding, and  solidification.  ***
