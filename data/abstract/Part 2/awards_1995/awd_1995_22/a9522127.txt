Abstract    :
              Barbara Wyslouzil is funded by a Small Grant for Exploratory Research to   study
              the chemical enrichment which takes place on the surface of liquid   aerosol
              droplets.   The phenomenon to be studied, i.e., surface   enrichment in aerosol
              droplets of a binary liquid mixture, has been   predicted but never directly
              observed.  A supersonic nozzle which can   produce monodispersed aerosol
              droplets has been developed by Wyslouzil,   and will be used in a collaborative
              research efforts involving the use of   the Small Angle Neutron Scattering
              facility in Grenoble, France to   perform the studies.  Wyslouzil will also be
              collaborating with   researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories on
              the project.    Surface enrichment has an important effect on heterogeneous
              chemistry,   growth and evaporation kinetics, and nucleation.  Multicomponent, 
               nanometer-sized aerosols are produced by nucleation and condensation in   many
              industrial and natural settings.  Fine refractory aerosols form in   combustion
              and metallurgical processes while sulfuric acid  - water   aerosols are
              produced in stack gases, volcanic plumes, and as byproducts   of photochemical
              reactions in the atmosphere.  The surface composition of   these particles can
              strongly affect heterogeneous reactions, growth and   evaporation kinetics.
