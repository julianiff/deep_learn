Abstract    :
              CTS - 9522159  Robin Rogers  University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa      ABSTRACT    
                The goal of the proposed research is to obtain a fundamental understanding of
              the factors that affect metal ion partitioning in aqueous biphasic systems
              (ABS).  Thermodynamic parameters for metal ions in polymer/salt and
              polymer/polymer ABS will be used to predict partitioning values.  The effects
              of polymer hydrophobicity on metal ion distribution will be studied using
              polyethylene glycol/polypropylene glycol copolymers.  The investigation of
              temperature dependent ABS will focus on the differences in metal ion
              partitioning between polymer/salt and polymer/water systems.  This will help to
              define the role of water-structuring agents in determining metal ion supported
              chromatographic ABS will be compared.  The research may lead to an efficient
              separation process that will replace the use of toxic and hazardous organics
              for extracting metal ions.  Applications include waste remediation,
              hydrometallurgy and processing of radiopharmaceuticals.
