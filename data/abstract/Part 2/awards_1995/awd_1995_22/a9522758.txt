Abstract    :
              9522758  Tranquillo  This project is on research to provide a foundation for the
               fabrication and evaluation of magnetically-oriented tissue-  equivalents.  The
              investigator has previously developed an  anisotropic biphasic theory of
              tissue-equivalents which will  be used to optimize the fabrication parameters
              for the  construction of a magnetically-oriented arterial media-  equivalent. 
              Also, a magnetically-oriented collagen tube for  guided nerve regeneration will
              be developed.  This research  involves the use of a continuum mechanical model
              of tissue  equivalents describing the interplay between cell traction,  network
              deformation, and fibril and cell orientation to  optimize the research design.
