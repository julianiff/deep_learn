Abstract    :
              9522078  Tamir  The proposed work is a fundamental investigation into the 
              electromagnetics phenomenology of planar thin-film configurations  which serve
              as building blocks in a wide variety of optoelectronic  devices.  Both
              analytical and computational tools will be used, but  modal methods combined
              with network and leaky-wave concepts will be  emphasized because of their
              proven effectiveness in solving  microwave problems that are similar to those
              in the area of planar  optics.  Interface and junction discontinuities
              exhibited by thin-  film geometries will be explored in order to accurately
              assess  effects that occur when components form complex composite  structures. 
              This approach will clarify a host of unresolved  questions involving the
              operation of thin-film devices.  In  addition, it will serve to develop the
              systematic and accurate  design criteria that are needed to implement existing
              and future  optoelectronic components.  The proposed research program is thus 
              expected to advance the analytical state-of-the-art in planar  optics to a
              level that is comparable to, or higher than, that  already available in the
              microwave area.  ***
