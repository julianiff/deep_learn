Abstract    :
              Abstract    This award supports a project to lay the groundwork for  development
              of a reliable magnetostratigraphic record from drill  core collected by the
              international Cape Roberts Project (CRP).  A reliable chronostratigraphic
              framework is a prerequisite for  proper interpretation of the climatic and
              tectonic events that  are the focus of the CRP.  Magnetostratigraphy could play
              a major  role in development of that framework, but previous paleomagnetic 
              studies of sedimentary sequences from Antarctica have shown that  extracting a
              reliable magnetostratigraphy from the CRP cores may  not be easy and that
              sophisticated treatment of samples may be  necessary.  This project will
              undertake paleomagnetic and mineral  magnetic investigations of the lower part
              (Eocene and/or  Oligocene) of the CIROS-1 core, which was collected in 1984/85 
              from western McMurdo Sound.  In addition to useful information  bearing on
              paleoenvironments that can be extracted from this  core, this work provides an
              opportunity to gain paleomagnetic  experience with the lithologies present in
              the Cape Roberts  region and to address problems encountered in previous
              attempts  to recover paleomagnetic records.  This project will also utilize 
              Cretaceous to Paleocene drill cuttings from the Great South Basin  near New
              Zealand.  The results of this work will allow  determination of the most
              appropriate strategy for dealing with  samples during the drilling and basic
              characterization phase of  the CRP, when time and resources will be very
              limited.  In this  way, the efficiency of on site paleomagnetic investigations
              in  support of the basic characterization work on the core should be  greatly
              enhanced.
