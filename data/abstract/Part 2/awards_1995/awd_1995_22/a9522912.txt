                  9522912  Easterling  The conference provides the opportunity for researchers
              and  practioners from around the world to meet and exchange information  that
              is vital to this area of engieering practice in steel-concrete  composite
              structures that continues to grow and develop.  All  phases of design,
              construction and research related to both new  construction and to repair and
              strengthening of existing structures  will be discussed at the conference.
