Abstract    :
              9522955  Rogers    A critical facet of the U.S. Global Change Research Program 
              is its explicit effort to improve communications among scientists  conducting
              global change research and the decision makers in both  the public and private
              sectors who value and use such the results  of scientific research.  One of the
              most important settings for  this type of exchange have been the annual global
              change  conferences sponsored by the Environmental Research Institute of 
              Michigan (ERIM).  This award provides partial support to cover  publication
              costs of this year's conference proceedings,  the title of which is
              "Understanding Earth:  Retrospectives and  Visions."  As has been true of past
              ERIM conferences, this year's  gathering will bring together scientists and
              decision makers to  examine new knowledge and critical issues related to global
               change.  Previous conferences have been well attended, and the  proceedings
              have become valuable statements of the "current  state of understanding."  The
              conference will be held in  Washington, D.C. in early April.         Because of
              the valuable role that the ERIM conference plays  in fostering dialogue among
              scientists and decision makers in  both the private and public sectors, NSF has
              provided support in  the past.  Publication of the proceedings will provide a
              tangible  record of conference publications and discussions, thereby  enhancing
              the value of the conference for those in attendance and  for others.
