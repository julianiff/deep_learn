Abstract    :
              9522072  Nerem  An International Conference on Cellular Engineering is to be
              held  in San Diego, California, from August 19th to August 22nd, 1995.  The
              objective of this Conference is to present recent advances in  the emerging
              area of Cellular Engineering.  The Conference will  span the spectrum from
              basic research to commercial applications,  and include biologists, material
              scientists, and engineers from  both academe and industry.  One-page abstracts
              of all papers  preselted at the Conference will be available to attendees at
              the  Conference.  A selection of ten full-length papers from the  Conference is
              to be published in a special issue of the Journal  of Biomechanical
              Engineering.  ***
