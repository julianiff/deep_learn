Abstract    :
              9522981  Musavi   Lignin holds wood fibers together, and must be removed to
              produce high strength pulp for kraft paper.  The Kappa- or K-number indicates
              the degree of lignin removal by a pulping process, and is probably the key
              variable for measuring quality in this process.  A difficulty is that it is an
              off-line measurement.  More importantly, there is usually a four hour process
              delay between when raw materials enter a pulping digester and when the K-number
              is measured.  This makes modeling and control difficult.  This Grant
              Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry project uses neural network
              models to predict K-number as a function of a number of more readily available
              process parameters.  This is a first step in improving the control and
              responsiveness of this process to changes in chip feed stock.  The research
              team from the University of Maine and S.D. Warren Company will develop
              characterization and prediction models using data from an operating plant, and
              compare their long term predicative capability when integrated into digester
              operations.  Throughout, seminar and workshops are part of the technology
              transfer and model improvement.     The impact of this research will be more
              uniform quality of pulp, even with variable feed stock, and more uniform
              quality in subsequent bleaching and papermaking processes.
