Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the Department of Chemistry at CUNY-City College acquire a Digital
              Equipment Corporation Supermini Computer.  This equipment will enhance research
              in a number of areas including the following: 1. compute properties of
              molecules on a variety of non-biological surfaces, 2. molecular modeling using
              Gaussian 92 or its updated versions to interpret SERS Surface Enhanced Raman
              Spectroscopy data, 3. semi-empirical theoretical approaches to interpreting
              spectroscopic data on small molecules interacting with proteins, 4. Monte Carlo
              simulations on water in pores, with biological and non-biological applications,
              5. molecular mechanics and numerical electric field calculations to understand
              the behavior of small molecules in a binding site, and 6. detailed quantum
              mechanical electronic structure calculations to interpret data on small metal
              clusters.  A workstation of fast, modern computer workstations is a new way to
              satisfy the computing needs of chemistry departments.  Such a computer network
              also serves as a developmental environment for new theoretical codes and
              algorithms, provides state-of-the-art graphics and visualization facilities and
              supports research in state-of-the-art applications of parallel processing.  f8
