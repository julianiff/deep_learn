Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Harvey Greenspan  CTS-9522703  MIT    This research is based on the
              development of a method of centrifugal spectroscopy by which particles of any
              size can be separated from a mixture and sorted according to sedimentation
              velocity.  The concept applies to the separation and fractionation of particles
              across the size spectrum from the larger plastic beads used in technology to
              the minute proteins and viral factors used encountered in bioprocessing.  This
              final phase of the program will encompass a three pronged approach:    1.  An
              experiment to examine the basic flow properties of the centrifugal spectrometer
              that was developed with prior NSF support.  The sorting efficiency of the
              device will also be established.    2.  Development of a broadly applicable
              numerical program for the accurate simulation of the non-linear, axisymmetric,
              time-dependent motion of a mixture in any disk stack in the centrifuge.    3. 
              Theoretical analysis of the flow, sediment and boundary layer instabilities and
              their effect on the separation process.    This fundamental research will set
              the stage for industrial development of an ultra centrifuge with varied and
              wide spread applications.
