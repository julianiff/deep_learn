Abstract    :
                        9522829  Man  The objective of this project is to develop theories for
              the  separation of "texture induced" from "stress induced" anisotropy.   The
              results will be implemented in experiments that employ  ultrasonic measurements
              and the birefringence method.  Two cases  will be considered: (a) the initial
              deformations of the  crystallites are elastic, and (b) those deformations are
              elastic-  plastic.  By using the language and methods of quantitative texture 
              analysis, the effect of texture on birefringence will be made  explicit.  In
              addition, a parallel to the acoustoelastic theory of  Man and Lu will be
              developed for viscoelastic materials.  ***
