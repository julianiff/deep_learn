Abstract    :
              9522079  Giguette   This award provides support for a comprehensive program that
              will make substantial infrastructure changes to the computer science and
              related disciplines at Xavier University.  The goals of the program are 1) to
              increase the number of majors in CISE disciplines by 50%, 2) to increase the
              number of CISE majors who go to graduate school by 100%, and 3) to expand the
              research activities of all of the CISE students and faculty.  These goals will
              be addressed by revising and significantly expanding the current summer
              outreach programs, expanding the undergraduate research and mentoring programs,
              and establishing new teaching and research laboratories.  This project builds
              on the very successful similar efforts in the health sciences at Xavier.  It is
              anticipated that comparable results can be achieved in the computing
              disciplines as well and that the model developed in this project has the
              potential to become a national model for minority student success at other
              similar institutions.  ***
