Abstract    :
              9522297  El-Haggan  The Baltimore City Community College requests support from
              NSF for  connection of two college campus networks to SURAnet.  SURAnet, a 
              midlevel network will provide operations management and information  services
              and it will give the two campuses access to the Internet,  a collection of
              interoperable networks that connect most research  and education organizations
              in the United States.    The campuses need the Internet connections to be able
              to access  information resources throughout the state, the nation and the 
              world.  The connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of  the
              Baltimore City Community College campuses as well as the  community in general.
