Abstract    :
              9522801  Pitchumani   Liquid molding with processes like resin transfer molding,
              is a way to fabricate relatively high volumes of complex, high performance
              composite products at reasonable costs.  A key to the success of liquid molding
              is uniform and complete filling of a closed and vented mold with resin. 
              Because the inside of the mold is a labyrinth of composite preforms and
              inserts, the flow permeability is difficult to model and predict.  This project
              uses an analytical and experimental investigation of fractals as a way to
              describe pore structure.  This allows calculation of the permeability inside
              the mold.  With fratal models for the tortuous length and capillary size, the
              permeability can be determined using Darcy's law so the flow in the closed mold
              can be calculated using existing numerical codes.  An experimental setup to
              verify this approach uses a three-part Plexiglas mold, and a video and image
              processing system to document the flow pattern and determine the fractal
              dimensions of the composite mat.  Passing a current through conductive fibers
              that are part of the preform is a process innovation that will be investigated
              to improve the uniformity of curing.  The impact of this research will be
              improvements in the design of venting systems and uniform filling in liquid
              composite molding processes, leading to lower costs and more opportunities for
              use of these high performance materials.  ***
