Abstract    :
                      9522541  Frangopol  The workshop will cover modern concepts and methods
              in assessment,  maintenance and design of civil infrastructure systems and
              their  role in the development of optimal methodologies for the  intelligent
              renewal of these systems.  Research needs will be  identified and prioritized. 
              The documents of this workshop will be  widely distributed over the United
              States to ensure transfer of  engineering knowledge in the field of optimal
              performance of civil  infrastructure systems.  This will enrich the bases of
              assessment  and intelligent renewal of the nation's civil infrastructure 
              systems.
