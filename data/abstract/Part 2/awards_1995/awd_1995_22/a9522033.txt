Abstract    :
              9522033  Curtis  This proposal is on research to develop reactor design and 
              operational principles for large-scale cultivation of root  cultures for the
              production of biologically active chemicals such  as pharmaceuticals,
              pesticides, and flavors.  Preliminary studies  have indicated that oxygen
              delivery is the fundamental design  constraint for reactor scale-up.Therefore,
              the primary measures  of reactor performance will be tissue respiration and
              biomass  accumulation which are assessed by off-gas analysis and nutrient 
              depletion correlations, respectively.  Experiments will elucidate  the role of
              gas dispersion, liquid mixing and diffusion of oxygen  within the root tissue
              on reactor performance.  Gas dispersion  will be measured by argon tracer
              analysis/mass spectrometry,  while liquid mixing will be assessed by dye
              tracers for both  submerged and trickle-bed reactor operations.  Also, oxygen 
              diffusion within the root axis has been shown to limit  respiration; therefore
              a study of root growth and respiration for  a range of root species will be
              performed to experimentally  validate a diffusionally controlled model for root
              biological  oxygen demand.  ***
