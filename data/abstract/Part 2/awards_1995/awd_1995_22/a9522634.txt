Abstract    :
              9522634   Zhao  The potential for SiC is based upon its high breakdown field
              strength, high temperature operation (due to its wide bandgap) and good thermal
              conductivity.  However, this potential will not be realized unless fundamental
              studies are carried out on SiC surfaces and with ohmic constacts, especially to
              p-type regions.  The research is directed towards the realization of a Gate
              Controlled Thyristor (GCT) which is an important device for SiC Power
              Electronics.  A Plasma-Etched (ECR) U-Groove vertical GCT structure fabricated
              in 6H-SiC is proposed which requires (1) high quality gate oxides over p-type
              regions and (2) good ohmic to the p-type regions.  ***
