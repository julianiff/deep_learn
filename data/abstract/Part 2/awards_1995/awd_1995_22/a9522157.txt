Abstract    :
              9522157  Alo  This award provides for infrastructure designed to substantially
              increase the numbers of minority students going into and completing degrees in
              the computing disciplines at the University of Houston-Downtown.  The project
              has three primary components: Students, Academic Program, and Research with
              strong recruitment, mentoring, curriculum enhancement, and research development
              activities as parts of the project.  Collaboration with Rice University has
              been established and will be an important part of the overall effort. 
              Community college linkages will be initiated, a Saturday Academy for high
              school students has been established, research experiences for undergraduates
              will be expanded, and the faculty research environment will be enhanced.  It is
              anticipated that this project has the potential to become a model for
              development of programs for minority success at other similar urban
              universities.  ***
