Abstract    :
              Researchers at the Marine Biological Laboratory will collaborate with Swedish
              scientists to determine how boreal-tundra ecosystems in northern Sweden respond
              to climate change.  A manipulative field experiment will be conducted to
              examine the effects of a warming and doubling of the carbon dioxide on the
              health of a dwarf shrub ecosystem.  The ecological response to the increased
              "greenhouse" conditions will be incorporated into a model that will allow
              assessment of the changes from the molecular to whole-ecosystem scale. 
              Feedbacks from the ecosystem and soil to the atmosphere under the warmed,
              carbon dioxide enriched condition will also be examined.  This study will
              facilitate predictions of the response of a sensitive Arctic ecosystem to
              climate forcing under postulated increased "greenhouse" conditions that might
              occur if atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are doubled at the same time as
              global temperatures are warmed.
