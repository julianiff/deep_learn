Abstract    :
              9522745  Goodwin   This research is to develop a method for measurement of the
              refractive index (RI) of very small volume liquid samples. This measurement is
              achieved by launching light into one end of an optical fiber with a necked
              region that is interacting with the sample, and measuring of the amount of
              light lost from the fiber at the other end.  The loss of light at the fiber
              waist provides a direct measure of the RI of the sample.  Placing the fiber
              waist within a coaxial flow cell enables RI measurements in volumes of thirty
              nanoliters or smaller, making measurement suitable for use in either liquid
              chromatography (LC) or capillary electrophoresis (CE).  Additional refinement
              of the process, such as the development of fabrication procedures, and
              identifying and minimizing noise sources will also be accomplished.   This
              technology will allow the use of  RI measurements as a routine detection method
              in very low sample volumes in LC and CE.  These unique characteristics make the
              detector employable in the various markets for RI detectors.
