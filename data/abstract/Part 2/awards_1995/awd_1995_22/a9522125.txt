Abstract    :
              9522125  Maragakis  Railway bridges are a critical  component of the
              transportation  infrastructure.  Many of them are  located in densely populated
              areas  with high seismic risk.  A basic  knowledge of the seismic response 
              characteristics and performance of  these structures is important. An 
              important feature of railway bridge  dynamics is the rail-ties-ballast  system
              which extends over the  adjacent roadbed and probably  provides additional
              strength to the  structures.  A recent dynamic test  of a ballasted railway
              bridge sheds  some light into the complexity of  the dynamic interaction
              involved in  rail-ballast systems.    In this project a series of 
              identification studies will be  performed by using the available  field data in
              order to identify  important stiffness parameters of  various elements of the
              bridge.  The data from the failure tests  conducted at the University of 
              Nevada on ballasted and unballasted  systems will be used for the  development
              of failure elements and  their incorporation into nonlinear  models.  The
              developed models will  be used for the prediction of the  response of typical
              railway bridges  to earthquake excitations.  A study  of these responses will
              indicate  needs for retrofitting.    This project will improve the  capability
              of modeling the  nonlinear dynamic response of  railway bridges which are a 
              critical component of the nation's  transportation networks.  ***
