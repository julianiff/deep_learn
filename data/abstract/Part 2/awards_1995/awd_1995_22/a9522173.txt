Abstract    :
                  9522173  Bosart and Knight     Under this award, Drs. Bosart and Knight will
              conduct an observational and modeling study of South American cold air
              outbreaks and the role that the Andes Mountains play in the modulation and
              control of these events.  As part of this study, the PI s will examine how the
              presence of the Andes barrier affects the processes of synoptic and mesoscale
              cyclogenesis, anticyclogenesis, and frontogenesis.  Unlike the major mountain
              barriers of North America or southeastern Australia,  the distance, with
              latitude, between the Andes and the east coast of the continent varies almost
              linearly.  This may allow the PIs to separate orographic and coastal effects on
              the above processes.  The results of these studies is likely to provide
              important insights for better understanding cold air outbreaks in other parts
              of the world, including over the U.S.     The observational portion of the
              study will consist of analyses of composite climatologies of cold air outbreaks
              over South America and detailed studies of individual cases, using primarily
              the gridded data sets being produced by operational centers as part of the
              reanalysis effort.  The numerical simulations will be done with the NCAR
              mesoscale model (MM5).    ***
