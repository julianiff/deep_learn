Abstract    :
              952989   Zhang   This project will develop methods to design, build and test a
              positioning stage with resolution of 5 nanometers, repeatability of 20
              nanometer over a 300 mm range of travel, while moving at speed of up to 50
              mm/s.  The drives are linear piezomotors,  eliminating ball screws and their
              associated backlash problems.  This drive and a flexure design increase the
              stiffness of a positioning stage.  The research approach will cover the dynamic
              modeling, control system design, and error budgeting to  predict the design
              targets.  In cooperation with an industrial partner, they will build and test a
              high precision, X-Y-Z-theta stage.      The impact of this research will be in
              the precision manufacturing industries, where the analysis tools will be used
              to take advantage of the precision and high stiffness of this type of stage,
              allowing  fast, accurate positioning.    Semiconductor lithography equipment,
              and other precision mechanical position systems, require both the design
              methods and this technology to be able to manufacture higher density
              semiconductors economically.
