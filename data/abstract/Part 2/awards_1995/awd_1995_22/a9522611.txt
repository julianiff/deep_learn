Abstract    :
              9522611  Brand      This project establishes a Network Information Center at two
              campuses of the Navajo Community College, and will work toward developing a
              virtual campus linking all seven campus sites in the Navajo Nation.  The
              eventual goal is to enable "attendance" at Navajo Community College at any of
              the 111 communities within the Navajo nation.  Connectivity to the Internet for
              the Community College is being provided by Westnet and New Mexico Technet under
              another award.  Duration of this award is two years.
