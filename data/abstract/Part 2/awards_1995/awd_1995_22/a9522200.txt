Abstract    :
              9522200  Winick  The current trend in optical communication systems is towards 
              higher bit rates and longer distances, where fiber chromatic  dispersion
              becomes a performance limiting factor.  For example at  1.55 micron with a 20
              ps gaussian pulse will expand to 60 ps after  propagating through only 17 km of
              fiber.  Recently passive optical  components have been fabricated to compensate
              for these pulse  spreading effects.  The design and fabrication of more
              complex,  grating-based, waveguide filters remains an area of active  research.
                 As part of this proposal, new classes of planar optical waveguide  devices
              will be developed in glass and lithium niobate.  Both  active and passive
              devices will be considered.  These will include  miniature, erbium-ytterbium
              co-doped, single frequency lasers,  chromium-based vibronic, lithium niobate
              waveguide lasers, and  grating-based, waveguide filters, such as dispersion
              compensators.   The research on chromium-doped vibronic lasers is particularly 
              significant, since it offers the possibility of producing  integrated, broadly
              tunable (or ultrashort pulsed) sources.   Related technologies such as dual
              frequency, distributed Bragg  reflector lasers, second harmonic generation in
              poled fused silica  waveguides, and the elimination of spatial hole burning
              effects in  rare earth-doped glasses will also be explored.  ***
