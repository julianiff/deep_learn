Abstract    :
                      9522693  Gilat  This project is part of a combined
              theoretical/experimental study  of shear flow localization, a form of
              catastrophic failure.  A  novel implementation of he torsional split Hopkinson
              bar  technique will be used to obtain detailed information on the  evolution of
              the spatial deformation field.  It is hoped that a  better understanding of the
              mechanisms underlying the material  damage can be obtained over a wide range of
              loading rates,  materials and length scales.  ***
