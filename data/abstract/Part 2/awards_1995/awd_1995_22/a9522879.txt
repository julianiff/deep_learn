Abstract    :
              9522879  Kerner   This research is to develop a nondestructive prototype system
              to be used at manufacturing sites for measuring surface contamination on
              silicon wafers by light elements.  A soft x-ray source will be used to optimize
              the anode material and electron beam focus.  A monochromator will be designed
              to efficiently deliver radiation to the specimen for maximum signal intensity
              and minimal spectral "noise".  Additional research will be conducted using very
              bright x-ray sources to maximize the efficiency of the technique by clarifying
              the limitations and guiding future developments.   As the requirements for
              surface contamination become more strict, existing commercial instruments
              become less adequate. The development of the Surface Contamination Analyzer for
              Light Elements (SCALE) will meet the semiconductor industry's present and
              future needs for measuring light elements, and can be used in other industries
              to analyze trace elements in solution.
