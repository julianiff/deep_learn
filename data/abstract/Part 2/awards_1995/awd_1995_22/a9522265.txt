Abstract    :
              9522265  Maurer     This project is to enhance the quality of undergraduate
              courses by incorporating new research in hardware design, and design automation
              software. Three new courses will be introduced, and a fourth is being planned.
              Three existing undergraduate hardware courses will be revised to included new
              information on the use of design tools, and design automation theory. The first
              objective is to teach students how to use design tools, while the second is to
              teach students how to actively participate in the development of new tools. The
              final products will be a set of course outlines with detailed guidelines and
              design-oriented exercises; a set of laboratory manuals providing exercises in
              creating complex designs and making modifications to existing designs; a set of
              complex designs to be used either as examples or as the basis for exercises in
              design modifications; a set of highly sophisticated and completely integrated
              design tools that will carry the student from the initial inception of an idea
              through to its implementation; and a set of new textbooks aimed at the problems
              of design and the use of design automation. Results will be made available
              through scholarly publications, Internet newsgroups and anonymous FTP, and
              through a series of summer workshops.  ***
