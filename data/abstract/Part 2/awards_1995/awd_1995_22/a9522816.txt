Abstract    :
              This two-year award will investigate the electrodynamic coupling of 
              tropospheric and mesospheric regions of the atmosphere due to  intense short
              duration electromagnetic pulses and quasi-  electrostatic pulses originating in
              tropospheric lightning  discharges.  The PI will develop and apply a computer
              model  describing changes in the electron density, chemistry and optical 
              emissions in the upper atmosphere due to the simultaneous action of  all three
              mechanisms stimulated by electrical energy released in  tropospheric lightning
              discharges.  Expected results of this  research include:  (1) three-dimensional
              configurations of the  disturbed regions within which significant changes occur
              in  temperature, airglow, electron density and chemical processes; (2) 
              determination of the fraction of electromagnetic energy from  lightning
              deposited in the lower ionosphere and the dominant sinks  of such energy; (3)
              determination of dependence of the resulting  disturbances on the type of
              lightning discharges; (4) assessment of  the effects of the lightning
              electromagnetic pulses on the thermal  and chemical balance of the upper
              atmosphere on a global scale; (5)  investigation of ways in which the existing
              CEDAR data bases may be  used to better understand upward discharges; and (6)
              preparation of  a theoretical basis for a new CEDAR campaign aimed at the 
              investigation of electrodynamic coupling of tropospheric and  mesospheric
              regions, particularly as driven by thunderstorms.***
