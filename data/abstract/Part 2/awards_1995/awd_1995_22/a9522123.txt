Abstract    :
                  Actions for the Mathematical Sciences: Adapting to the Changed Environment  
                                                Project Abstract      The Board on
              Mathematical Sciences will convene a two-day forum of roughly 40   
              participants to explore emerging opportunities for mathematicians to have   
              impact    on science and technology as well as indicate new directions for both
              pure and    applied mathematical research.  With input by representatives from
              outside the    mathematical sciences community, it will examine what steps
              mathematics should    take to build upon existing connections with such areas
              as materials science,    the    biological sciences, and medical science, and
              determine what actions the    community should take in response to the changed
              environment to change the way    mathematical research is pursued in the United
              States.  A summary report of    the    forum that details specific action
              guidelines will be generated and rapidly    transmitted to the mathematical
              sciences research community to stimulate    unified    and coordinated action
              in beneficial directions that respond to the new    imperatives facing the
              community and the nation.  This document will be    primarily    directed
              toward the mathematical sciences community, and will particularly    target   
              the sizeable part of the research community that does not yet fully appreciate 
                how pervasive and far-reaching are the changes underway.  It will also
              provide    information on resources, and spotlight what actions are needed and
              how to    commence them.  The last 6 months of the 15 month project will be
              devoted to    dissemination efforts, including presentations at professional
              meetings,    having    articles describing the actions published in flagship
              news journals for the    profession, and making the summary report available
              electronically on the    Internet.
