Abstract    :
              9522809  Endres   The final size and shape of precision ceramic components are
              usually generated by grinding, a process that can handle the high strength of
              these materials, but risks causing micro cracking that can lead to functional
              failure of these parts.  The alternative that will be investigated in this
              research is termed hard-tool machining, where a controlled geometry cutting
              edge is used to machine ceramics.  Models that are based on the more realistic
              large radius cutting edges found on real tooling, modeling the material removal
              mechanism for ceramics by fracture, rather than plasticity, and how the heat
              generated may affect the machined surface layer will be considered by and
              interdisciplinary team of experts in machining dynamics and kinematics, micro
              mechanics, fracture mechanics and tribology.  Modeling will consider: mechanics
              at the micro scale to predict the chip separation, the numerical methods, and
              the resultant topography and stress state related to the integrity of the newly
              generated surface.  An experimental program to verify the modeling results with
              a special purpose experimental setup, as well as techniques like scanning
              electron microscopy, will be used to  verify and improve the model.       The
              major impact of this research will be in a fundamental and more detailed model
              for machining ceramics by machining, that can increase the productivity and
              reduce the cost of high performance ceramic materials  The model is need to
              supplement the experimental work that would normally be necessary to evolve
              tools and systems that are needed to enable broader use of high performance
              ceramic materials.  ***
