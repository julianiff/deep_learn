Abstract    :
                    9522661  Hsia  This combined theoretical/experimental study involves the
              modelling  of brittle-to-ductile transition (BDT) in cleavage fracture.  The 
              intrinsic mechanisms controlling the BDT will be studied by  examining two
              competing processes that occur at crack tips:  cleavage crack propagation which
              results in brittle fracture and  dislocation generation which occurs during the
              inherent plastic  deformation that develops during ductile fracture.  A novel 
              experimental technique will be employed which involved growing a  cleavage
              crack in a temperature gradient field and measuring the  crack arrest due to
              dislocation generation.  Three pieces of  information essential to the
              fundamental understanding of this  phenomena will be sought: the transition
              temperature, the crack  velocity when the transition occurs, and the
              dislocation structure  at the crack tip which accompanies the transition.  ***
