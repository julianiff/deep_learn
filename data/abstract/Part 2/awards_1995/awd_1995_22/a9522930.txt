              CONACyT:  Advanced Communication Technology in Robotics and  Flexible
              Manufacturing Cells      This is the first year of a two-year standard award. 
              The field  of manufacturing is on the verge of a revolution in the level of 
              intelligence which will become possible and necessary during the  next decade. 
              This award under the NSF/CONACyT Initiative funds a  collaboration between
              robotics investigators at the University of  Texas at Austin and researchers at
              the Instituto Tecnologico y de  Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM)
              laboratories at  Cuernavaca and Mexico City to develop foundation technologies 
              needed for high performance, reconfigurable, and fault tolerant  robots and
              manufacturing cells for the next generation production  facilities.    The
              laboratory at Austin will concentrate on the foundation  technologies for
              highly reliable, fault tolerant, and  reconfigurable communications within
              production systems.  This  includes the creation of the best software structure
              and  standardized reconfigurable interfaces at all connections in the  system. 
              The appropriate level of granularity, multiplexing,  protocols, etc.  will be
              developed to provide configuration  management schemes to most rapidly and
              reliably avoid a fault in  the data transfer including buffers to allow for
              transition time  without loss of control information.  The ITESM labs at Mexico
               City and Cuernavaca will focus on hardware and operational  software for the
              manufacturing cells.
