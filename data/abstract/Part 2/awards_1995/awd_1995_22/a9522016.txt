Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Graham Fleming in the Chemistry Department and Lauren Mets
              in the Department of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology at the University of
              Chicago will conduct experimental and theoretical studies of photosynthetic
              energy- and electron-transfer.  The PIs will investigate the transfer of
              excitation among pigment molecules in photosynthetic antenna molecule,
              processes which occur on the femtosecond time-scale and longer, using ultrafast
              nonlinear spectroscopy.  Theoretical models will be constructed to help explain
              such dynamical data as the vibrational energy and phase relaxation rates.  The
              goal of this research is to characterize the interactions between chromophores,
              the light-absorbing parts of molecules, as well as the strength of these
              interactions and the time scales on which they occur.  These studies should
              help in the understanding of the remarkable efficiency of photosynthesis in
              both plants and photosynthetic bacteria.
