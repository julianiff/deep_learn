Abstract    :
              9522734  Idriss  Cracking is among the most important parameters that adversely 
              influences the structural design and durability of concrete  elements.  More
              advanced nondestructive testing methodologies are  needed for applications to
              bridge structures.  Proper testing  methodologies for early detection of cracks
              are either non-  existence or not readily applicable to large concrete bridge 
              systems.  Research is needed for the development of embedded  sensors for
              real-time detection, and measurement of displacements  associated with crack
              openings and propagations.  The research  will examine the feasibility of using
              a system of optical fiber  sensors for integration in an experimental full
              scale bridge  structure.  The optical fiber sensing system will be employed in 
              detection of cracks and measurement of displacements associated  with their
              progression.  Research studies will be performed  through a series of research
              and development activities,  addressing optimization with respect to three
              important issues,  namely, practicality, sensitivity of measurements, and
              capability  in simultaneous detection of cracks emanating from different 
              locations in the structure.  Simultaneous measurement of  displacements, at
              several location, will be achieved in a time  domain, through interrogation of
              reflected optical pulses.  The  study will involve a series of experiments at
              small, as well as  full scale implementation in a bridge structure.  The full
              scale  structure will be a 40 ft simple span, reinforced concrete slab,  steel
              girder bridge.  Conventional displacement measuring  devices, such as strain
              gauges, and LVDT's will be employed in  the examining the data acquired from
              embedded optical fibers.  ***
