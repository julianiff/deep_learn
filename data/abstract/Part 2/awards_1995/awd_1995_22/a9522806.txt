Abstract    :
              9522806  Shapiro  Solid modeling technology is rapidly becoming the primary
              means for creating, exchanging, and maintaining information across all
              engineering functions and applications.  Existing solid modeling  systems have
              been developed in response to specific applications, and hence rely on a
              variety of representation schemes as well as new representations and
              engineering languages that combine elements of distinct representations in ad
              hoc fashion.  The goal of this research is to develop a comprehensive,
              mathematically sound, and standard technology for maintenance of solid models,
              representations, and systems in support of diverse engineering applications. 
              The proposed approach and methods are based on the established and
              experimentally verified theory of space decompositions.  In the short term, the
              results of this research should further the acceptance, integration, and
              standardization of solid modeling technology in mechanical design and
              manufacturing.  It should lead to significant productivity gains and
              improvements in feature-based and parametric design methods.  More generally,
              the establishment of rigorous computational connections between different solid
              model representations has been cited by a recent National Research Council
              report as a key component of the information technology that will be needed for
              manufacturing in the future.    The work will potentially lead to more
              efficient methods for designing and representing parts.  Such a method will
              allow the interchange of design data among different design systems.
