Abstract    :
              This is a Dissertation Improvement project which will examine how child
              condition plus other  factors, including maternal age, sibship composition,
              maternal marital status and access to  resources, influence maternal
              reproductive decisions. From a biological perspective, how might a  mother
              allocate her limited time, energy and financial resources among the premature
              child  whose outcome is questionable, her other children and/or her next
              pregnancy?   The mother's  decisions will impact the timing, outcome and total
              number of her children over her life course.  An estimated 135 mothers  who
              gave birth to surviving, premature, very low birth weight infants  14 to 18
              years ago and who have been followed by the investigators from birth will be
              interviewed  by phone or in person.  Care will be taken to include  mothers in
              rural areas plus mothers who  represent diverse ethnic backgrounds. This unique
              population provides a rare opportunity to  conduct natural experiments to test
              predictions based upon parental investment and life history  theory.  This
              study will contribute to our understanding of the relationships between early
              maternal  decisions and lifetime reproductive outcomes.  In addition, this
              information will provide  information which can be employed in health care
              policy decisions.
