Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  9522075       This work focuses on the coupling between the
              thermodynamic cycle of a reciprocating kinematic engine and its mechanism
              section using the newly-available techniques of finite time thermodynamics. The
              goal is a global understanding of the entire thermodynamic process and its
              limitations, rather than a detailed geometry-specific description of the
              performance of the engine.
