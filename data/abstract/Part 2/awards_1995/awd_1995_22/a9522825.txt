Abstract    :
                  9522852  Gantry  The use of non-metallic concrete reinforcements made of
              fiber-  reinforced plastic composites will enhance the long-term durability  of
              reinforced concrete structures subject to environmental  exposure.  Though
              plastic composite reinforcements do not corrode,  they may not be thermally
              compatible with concrete. If the two  materials prove to be thermally
              incompatible, the bond between them  may be degraded by long-term exposure to
              temperature fluctuations.   The transverse isotropy of composite reinforcements
              exacerbates  considerations of thermal incompatibility.      To quantify the
              influence of this potential thermal incompatibility  and to verify
              manufacturer's claims regarding the thermal  compatibility, it is planned to
              experimentally determine the  longitudinal and transverse coefficient of
              thermal expansion of  composite rebar.  The potential for bond degradation due
              to thermal  cycling will then be explored using simple pull-out tests of 
              concrete/composite rebar specimens that have been thermally cycled.   Finally,
              the effect of bursting stresses caused by transverse  expansion of the
              composite reinforcement in concrete will be  explored using beam specimens with
              varying levels of clear cover  over the composite reinforcements.
