              Abstract  ATM-9522681  Schlesinger, Michael E.  University of Illinois  Title:
              Research on Greenhouse-Gases-Induced Climate Change    This project will focus
              on the following studies:    The Last Glacial-Interglacial Cycle.  The
              objective of this research is to simulate  and understand the
              Glacial-Interglacial Cycle.  Following his success in simulating  glacial onset
              from 115kya to 105kya, the PI will continue to use his 2-layer  atmospheric
              general circulation/mixed-layer-ocean/ice-sheet/asthenosphere (AO/ISA)  model,
              first to refine the onset-simulation temporally, and second to continue the 
              simulation from 105kya to the present.    Estimation of  the Climate
              Sensitivity,  T2x.  The objective of this research is to  obtain the
              best-possible estimate of the sensitivity of the climate system,  T2x.  The  PI
              will do this by simulating the geographical distributions of aerosol
              concentrations,  optical depths, radiative forcing and climate for two years
              following the Pinatubo  eruption.  He will incorporate into his 24-layer
              stratospheric/tropospheric GC/PC-  aerosol model with his 12-layer ocean GC
              model.  He will perform 5 experiment  simulations including the eruption, and 5
              control simulations excluding it; the  members of each simulation set differing
              only in their atmospheric initial conditions.   In this way the PI will be able
              to estimate the contribution of natural internal  variability to the
              post-Pinatubo temperature changes.  He will compare the simulated  and observed
              post-Pinatubo temperature changes to determine  T2x.    Anthropogenic Sulphate
              Aeroqol Induced Climate Change for Integrated  Assessments.  The objective of
              this research is to simulate the equilibrium climate  change induced
              individually and collectively by the radiative forcing of 5 regional  sources
              of anthropogenic sulphate aerosols for use by integrated assessment models.  
              For this objective, the PI will perform 6 equilibrium climate-change
              simulations with  his 7-layer tropospheric GC/MLO model.      This researc h is
              important because it seeks to add new knowledge about climate  processes with
              the goal of improvements in climate predictions.
