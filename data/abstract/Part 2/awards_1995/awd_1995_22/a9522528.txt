              ABSTRACT  The research project focuses on the measurement of key parameters for
              chromatographic (adsorptive) separation of proteins. NMR will be used to obtain
              intraparticle diffusion coefficients and develop predictive correlations for
              the performance of the adsorption column.  Non-unifopm flow, both on a scale of
              particle dimensions (connective dispersion) and at a macroscopic level
              (channeling), will be studied using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  The
              investigators will also examine the interaction of thermodynamics and transport
              at high column loadings using MRI.  Anticipated benefits include enhanced
              quality control, lower costs of manufacturing proteins and shorter development
              times from drug discovery to clinical application.  These benefits will result
              primarily from improved design procedures for bioseparations using
              chromatography.
