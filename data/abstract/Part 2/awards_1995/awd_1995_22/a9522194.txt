Abstract    :
              9522194  Poulson  Olivet College requests support from NSF for connection of the
               campus networks to MichNet.  MichNet is the midlevel network  located in the
              north central United States. It will provide  operations management and
              information services and it will give the  college a 56KB connection to the
              Internet connection, a collection  of interoperable networks that connect most
              research and education  organizations in the United States.    The College
              needs the Internet connection to be able to access  information resources
              throughtout the state, the nation and the  world.  The connection will benefit
              the faculty, staff students of  Olivet College.
