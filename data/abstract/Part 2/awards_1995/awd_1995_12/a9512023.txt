Abstract    :
              The PIs propose to develop a methodological tool for ranking risks.  Since the
              society has   a limited ability to reduce all risks, there is an obvious
              benefit in prioritizing the risks that   must be confronted.  The tool to be
              developed will include both public values and   experts  ratings as components
              of the risk assessment technique.  The ranking process   will involve
              categorization of the risks and identification of the attributes upon which the
                risks will be evaluated.  Each group of assessors will both perform
              reductionistic and   impressionistic ranking procedures in order to minimize
              the influence of procedural and   framing effects on the assessment of risk. 
              The PIs will also conduct a series of studies to   help determine whether the
              procedure they develop will yield reproducible results.
