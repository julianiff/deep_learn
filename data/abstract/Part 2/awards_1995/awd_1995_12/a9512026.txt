Abstract    :
              In the aftermath of the Cold War, politicians and citizens call for more direct
              and immediate public benefits from public investments in research.  A case in
              point is the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), with its mandate to
              `combine and interpret data from various sources to produce information readily
              usable by policy makers attempting to formulate effective strategies for
              preventing, mitigating, and adapting to the effects of global climate change.` 
               This project is a response to current difficulties in accessing the relevant
              literatures and communicating across specializations.  The project will
              identify, develop, and integrate the accumulated concepts, theories and methods
              of the policy sciences and the broader policy movement in ways that will allow
              researchers, staff and administrators involved in global change research to use
              them to produce accessible information for practical policy purposes.   Over
              the last half century, the policy sciences have contributed toward integrating
              ethics, science and policy.  While policy specialists have not achieved
              concensus, the intellectual tools have survived decades of practice and peer
              review and  converged on a common outlook that is contextual, problem-oriented,
              and multi-method.  Its methods involve translation among functional equivalents
              in the specialized vocabularies of the disciplines; historical, case, and
              comparative methods; and the methods of applied ethics.  Using these concepts
              and methods, the principal investigator will develop a book and presentations
              and articles that will assist a wide variety of specialists and lay persons
              with research and policy mandates concerning global change to address practical
              policy issues.
