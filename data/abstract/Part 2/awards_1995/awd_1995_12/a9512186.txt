Abstract    :
              9512186  Clark    This proposal is an equipment request (Academic Research
              Infrastructure  ARI  Submission) by Cornell representing the various
              universities which comprise the NNUN (Cornell, Stanford, Penn State, UC Santa
              Barbara and Howard).  The NNUN is supported by three directorates (ENG, MPS,
              BIO) and provides a pooling of specialized skills and instrumentation into
              distributed user facilities (i.e. a network') to facilitate world-class
              research/education across a wide range of user disciplines.  The NNUN is  a
              unique experiment to provide researchers access to sophisticate equipment  for
              the purpose of innovative discovery in the area of nanostructure materials and
              devices.  The network provides leading edge research tools in the area of
              nanostructures to explore the frontiers of knowledge' for an extended user
              community which would here-to-fore have had little opportunity to participate
              in the process.  The proposal request support for the acquisition of major
              state-of-the-art equipment {Electron Beam Lithography System, Support
              Equipment, Plasma Etch System, Magnetron Sputtering System and Chemical Vapor
              Deposition  CVD  reactor enhancements to improve research and eduction over the
              network for both graduates and undergraduates, scientists and engineers, and
              promote partnerships between academic researchers and private sector instrument
              developers.
