Abstract    :
                  9512362  Zavaliangos  This Academic Research Infrastructure
              (Instrumentation) Award is to  assist in the purchase of several components of
              an automated  specimen preparation facility for mechanical and metallurgical 
              testing.  This equipment will greatly improve the testing  efficiency and
              quality in the area of processing-structure-property  relationships by
              permitting changes in the microstructure to be  accurately measured.  It will
              be used both in research and in  senior design projects.  It will be used for
              metals, polymers,  ceramic and composite type materials.  ***
