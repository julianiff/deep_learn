Abstract    :
              With support from the National Science Foundation, the University of Chicago
              Committee on Cognition and Communication will purchase: a video digitizing
              PowerMac 9500/132, 4 Silicon Graphics Indigo2 ZX workstations, 3 DigitalLinear
              Tape 20 GB backup systems and a Young Minds CD-ROM recorder. This equipment
              will permit the group to digitize multimedia recordings of communication
              situations and to code and analyze various properties of each digitized
              recording. It will also establish the groundwork for the creation of a large
              multimedia database of communication situations. The database will contain
              coded and measured information about each communicative situation. It will
              include classifications of gestures made qualitatively by researchers
              acoustical measurements of speech, and measurements of gesture movement using
              image processing tools.   The goal of this research is to investigate the
              cognitive mechanisms that mediate processing in conversational interaction, and
              utterance production and comprehension. To fully understand verbal
              communication, language use must be studied in natural communicative contexts
              such as conversations, arguments, narratives, recall of emotional events and
              parent-child interaction. Natural communicative contexts contain rich sources
              of information that govern the dynamics of language processing in ways that
              cannot be observed in standard laboratory situations. The analysis system which
              the Chicago group will employ, will allow studies of this type to be conducted.
              The instrumentation system will also be used in teaching situations and be
              available to graduate and undergraduate students.
