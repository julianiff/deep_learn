Abstract    :
              Under the Academic Research Infrastructure Program the Principal Investigators
              have submitted a request that  consists of three parts: (1) centralized four
              processor computer and data server; (2) computer-based teaching and  research
              laboratory; (3) distributed workstations to support software development.  This
              system will be utilized for  both multidisciplinary research and education in
              the fields of hydrology, botany, microbiology, geography, civil  engineering,
              environmental science, computer science and zoology.***
