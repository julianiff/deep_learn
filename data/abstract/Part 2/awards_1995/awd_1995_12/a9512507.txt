Abstract    :
              9512507  Messina    The Concurrent Supercomputing Consortium (CSCC) which is led
              by the California Institute of Technology proposes to acquire a large-scale
              data storage facility with a parallel I/O architecture and integrate it with
              the consortium's existing computing resources. It will undertake a CSCC Archive
              and Parallel Resource Interface (CAPRI) project which will enable new,
              data-intensive applications to be carried out. The facility will provide the
              ability to store terabytes of data and to access the storage system with
              multiple parallel interfaces. It will serve as a key research instrument for
              the scalable I/O research initiative. The results of the research project will
              enable the scientists at the Consortium to achieve unprecedented performance on
              data-intensive computational problems. The project will greatly enhance the
              Consortium's computing environment by creating storage capability commensurate
              with the prodigious ability of the computational resources to generate data.   
              The major components of the proposed system are (1) the high-performance
              storage system (HPSS) software package, (2) a 64 Gigabyte on-board disk cache,
              (3) 16 HIPPI nodes for supporting parallel network I/O, (4) 80 Gigabytes of
              RAID disk caches, (5) a 15 Terabyte archival storage system including four IBM
              3490-C2A tape drives and robotic tape handling, and (6) a HIPPI switch.  ***
