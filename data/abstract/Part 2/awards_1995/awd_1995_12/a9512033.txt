Abstract    :
              SBR-9512033  Andrew E.G. Jonas  Thomas A. Scott  University of  California
              Riverside    Property Rights, Political Fragmentation and the Endangered
              Species Act    This project develops a political analysis of local
              implementation of the U.S. Endangered Species Act.  Specifically, the research
              investigates the roles of stakeholders in developing and approving a habitat
              conservation plan as mandated by the Act.  The research design entails an
              intensive, quantitative and qualitative, case study focused on the habitat
              conservation plan for the Stephens' kangaroo rat in western Riverside County,
              California.  This case study includes the circumstances of rapid suburban
              development and associated environmental change, and political fragmentation. 
              Political fragmentation is manifested in the number of general-purpose
              municipalities and special-purpose districts that have a role in developing and
              approving land-use plans and conservation plans.  Archival data of the plan's
              development will be augmented by geographic analysis of the affected area to
              determine land-ownership and land interests in the affected area,  and by
              participant observation of the public components of the conservation planning
              process.  The study attempts to evaluate the sustainability of this kind of
              local policy formulation in the face of rapid development, wide variation of
              interests, and shifts in public discourse on ecological preservation.
