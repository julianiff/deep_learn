Abstract    :
              9512547  Ebeling  The acquisition of a networked infrastructure of imaging 
              equipment will enhance the potential and cohesiveness of  interdisciplinary
              research activities being conducted in the  College of Engineering and
              Architecture at North Dakota State  University.  The scope of the research
              includes materials,  processes, engineered structures, and is aligned with and 
              embodied in the mission of the College.  Specific activities  include material
              quantification and analysis, flow and combustion  imaging, visualization and
              animation of dynamic systems, real-  time imaging, and infrared imaging.  The
              faculty group in the  college is a distinctly multidisciplinary body engaged in
               interdisciplinary research.  The equipment will be used to  enhance
              interdisciplinary connectivity between researchers and  projects, creating
              technological channels for sharing image data  and processing routines relevant
              to visualization,  characterization, and analysis.  Through this imaging
              network,  the convergence of traditional civil, mechanical, electrical, 
              agricultural, industrial, construction, and architectural  engineering research
              expertise will yield new findings in surface  image evaluation, pictorial
              integration of design and analysis,  motion, estimation, interferometry,
              intelligent processing,  visualization of sound, displacement, thermal flow,
              and robotic  control.  ***
