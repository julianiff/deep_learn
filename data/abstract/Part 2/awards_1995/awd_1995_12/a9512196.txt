Abstract    :
                                          Abstract  9512196  Barwick  This Academic Research
              Infrastructure (ARI) award provides funds  for equipment to instrument
              approximately one cubic kilometer of  ice at the South Pole Station to make the
              largest detector on Earth  for energetic particles.  An array of optical
              detectors will be  buried more than a kilometer deep in the very clear ice to
              detect  Cherenkov radiation from particles passing through the ice.  The 
              resulting Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array (AMANDA Mark  2) will have
              several scientific uses: most importantly it is  expected to be the first
              detector capable of routinely measuring  particles produced by energetic
              neutrinos from astrophysical  sources.    There are two ARI awards, one to the
              University of California,  Irvine and one to the University of Wisconsin.  Both
              universities  have agreed, in accordance with ARI proposal requirements, to 
              provide matching funds.  The AMANDA project is a collaborative  effort of the
              University of Wisconsin, the Universities of  California at Irvine and
              Berkeley, the University of Stockholm, the  University of Uppsala (both in
              Sweden) and DESY in Germany.  ***
