Abstract    :
              This project proposes acquisition of instrumentation for image analysis  and an
              inverted microscope to provide three research teams with the  technological
              capability to rapidly and accurately analyze various  organismal and tissue
              parameters. The instruments requested are the  Leica Quantimet Q-500MC Image
              Analysis system with an Optronics Video  Camera, and an Olympus IX-70 inverted
              microscope.  The projects proposed involve both faculty research and research 
              training primarily of undergraduates. The research experience is widely  used
              as a teaching tool in our department. The research activities  planned include
              a study of programmed cell death and cell cycle control  in plants, study of
              muscle cell development and culture in fish, and a  analysis of feeding
              behavior and movement in anostracans (fairy  shrimp). Activities of these
              projects involve making large numbers of  measurements from light and electron
              microscope data, analyzing  labeling density, position and/or intensity in
              protein localization  work, and assessing characteristics of organisms'
              three-dimensional  morphology as it relates to movement. Currently some of the 
              measurements required may be made by hand, other analyses are  impossible
              without the computer capability. Acquisition of the image  analysis system with
              archiving capability and the inverted microscope  will enable us to rapidly and
              accurately obtain and analyze the data  these studies require.
