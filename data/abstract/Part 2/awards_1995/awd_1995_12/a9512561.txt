Abstract    :
              9512561  Enjeti    This proposal requests advanced instrumentation,
              computational and test equipment to support research,  education and training
              in a new Power Quality Laboratory under the direction of the PI.  This
              laboratory will be able to simulate a wide variety of power delivery equipment
              (i.e. transformers, motors, capacitor, cables, etc..), distribution fault
              relays, inverters and power supplies.  In addition, the laboratory will perform
              research on active filter technology to cancel generated harmonics, correct for
              power disturbance in real time and stimulate the advancement  of clean' power
              converts which do not generate harmonics and are immune to power disturbances.
