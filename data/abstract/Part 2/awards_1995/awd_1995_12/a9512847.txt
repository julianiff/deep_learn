Abstract    :
              Purchase of an automated 15N, 13C analyzer for the University of Texas  Marine
              Science Institute to replace a >25 year old isotope ratio mass  spectrometer
              and associated high vacuum sample preparation lines is  proposed. Although tens
              of thousands of samples have been analyzed  using the present system, it is
              currently inoperable and requires a  major overhaul. However, because of the
              system's age, its relatively  primitive technology, and demand by several
              users, any repairs to the  instrument are unlikely to be cost effective over
              the long term or meet  the expectations of the scientific research staff at the
              Institute.  Instead, the purchase of a new analyzer represents a substantial 
              advance in technological capabilities which will open additional  avenues of
              research for the scientists at the Institute as well as  providing isotopic
              data for currently funded research programs. The  proposed and currently funded
              research avenues include microbiological,  ecological, physiological and
              chemical studies. This research will use  the stable isotope compositions of
              bioactive elements, such as C and N,  to delineate metabolic pathways,
              understand food webs in natural  environments, and determine the sources,
              transformations and fates of  these elements in ecosystems. The proposed
              analyzer is a compact  instrument which determines the carbon and nitrogen
              isotopic ratios of  gases, solids and liquids in their natural state with
              minimal sample  preparation. Expensive and time consuming sample preparation on
              high  vacuum lines with subsequent transfer of purified sample gases to a  mass
              spectrometer is avoided in the proposed system since sample  processing and
              isotopic analysis are integrated into one unit. An  additional advantage of the
              proposed system over those presently  available to Institute scientists is that
              samples with natural  abundance of the 13C and 15N isotopes as well as
              isotopically amended  samples used in tracer studies can be analyzed on one
              instrument.
