Abstract    :
              IBN-9512113  Roberts, James L.        Classical chemical messengers in the
              central nervous system are  simple molecules which upon release are rapidly
              removed from the  site where their actions are exerted.  The brain and other
              bodily  tissues also use small protein molecules called peptides as  messenger
              molecules, but the mechanisms in place to terminate their  effects are relative
              unknown.  Dr. Roberts and Dr. Glucksman  identified a soluble peptide
              processing and degrading enzyme known  as EP 24.15 and established its
              potential role in modifying peptide  actions.  However, this enzyme has several
              unique features, notably  that it does not contain a sequence that will allow
              it to be  secreted by classical pathways, and it is located in the nucleus of 
              the cell as well as on the cell surface.  These unusual features  form the
              basis for the investigations to be performed by Drs.  Roberts and Glucksman. 
              They will examine the intercellular pathway  involved in the secretion of EP
              24.15 and the mechanisms used by a  protein lacking a sequence involved in
              secretion, to be targeted  for secretion.  Multiple forms of this enzyme have
              been identified  and the relationship of these forms will be investigated. 
              These  exciting studies will reveal novel mechanisms involved in peptide 
              processing and secretion within neuroendocrine cells and have  implications for
              secretory biology, in general.
