Abstract    :
              This proposal for continuation of, "Fundamental Studies of  Visible
              Superfluorescence and Atom-Field Interactions in an  Optical Resonator", calls
              for continued development and use  of the first working microlaser.  This
              devise is a laser  oscillator in which coherent light is generated by means of 
              the interaction of a single, excited two-level atom with a  single mode of the
              radiation field.  The objective of the  ongoing research is to develop an
              improved microlaser with  controllable features and study its quantum
              mechanical  behavior.
