Abstract    :
              9512161  Costello   The award provides funds for the acquisition of a shrink
              small outline integrated circuit (SSOIC) board production facility at Cooper
              Union.  This facility will allow research and education surface mount
              transistors or surface mount technologies.  These technologies enable the
              fabrication of integrated circuits that are about one-fourth of the size of
              previous dual-in-line integrated circuits.  Dual-in-line circuits can be placed
              in sockets and hand wire-wrapped into an electronic circuit.  Surface mount
              devices are too small to be hand wired.  Instead, they must be soldered onto a
              multi-layer circuit board with lead spacing as small as 0.5 mm.  This equipment
              will support research in blood velocity sensing, phase analysis of EKGs, smart
              telephone control systems, and advanced communication devices including a
              digital-signal-processor-based voice identification/verification system.    
              This facility will enable Cooper Union's electrical engineering faculty and
              student to remain in the forefront of current technology and better contribute
              to the nation's technological infrastructure and global competitiveness.  ***
