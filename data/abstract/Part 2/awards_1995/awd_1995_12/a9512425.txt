Abstract    :
              9512425  Gilliland    An advanced materials processing facility will be
              established at  Emory University which will complement existing surface, 
              electrical, and optical characterization capabilities in the  physics and
              chemistry departments.  The processing  instrumentation, consisting of an
              electron beam evaporator, a  lithographic mask aligner, and a surface
              profilometer, will be  utilized to process and fabricate simple devices and to 
              characterize small structures based on compound semiconductor  thin films. 
              Research programs which will make use of the  processing instrumentation
              include electric field effects on  photoexcited carriers in III-V compound
              semiconductors,  fundamental studies as well as fabrication of high speed 
              photodetectors,  processing and characterization of wide bandgap  III-V nitride
              films grown by organometallic epitaxy, and  development of multiple point metal
              film probes for thermal  anemometry studies of turbulence.  %%%  Emory has
              established sizable research efforts focused upon the  optical and electrical
              characterization of semiconductor  structures.  Despite this investment in
              human resources and in  characterization equipment,  a materials preparation
              and  processing capability is lacking.  The processing instrumentation  will
              provide the researchers with the necessary tools to conduct  a vigorous
              research effort focused on the physics and chemistry  of semiconductor
              microstructures.  ***
