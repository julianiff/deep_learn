Abstract    :
              9512867  Lazen  This award will provide partial support of an 18 month study by
              a study committee to be convened by the National Research Council. The study
              committee will construct a comprehensive data profile of the career paths of
              recent Ph.D. recipients in the life sciences.  The committee will use the
              profile to identify trends and potential implications, if any, for both the
              government and institutions in development of new policies and practices
              intended to foster research and education in the life sciences.  ***
