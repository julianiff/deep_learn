Abstract    :
              9512916  Schilling    This U.S.-Brazil collaborative research project will carry
               out synchrotron radiation research using VUV spectroscopy  and EXAFS,
              including establishment and characterization of a  soft x-ray spectroscopy
              workstation and the conducting of  experiments in small-angle x-ray scattering.
               The project  will take advantage of newly created laboratory facilities 
              installed at Louisiana State's Center for Advanced  Microstructures and Devices
              (CAMD) and Brazil's Laboratorio  Nacional de Luz Sincrotron (LNLS) in Campinas,
              Brazil.  The  project will be headed by Paul Schilling, Volker Saile, and  Paul
              Russo at LSU and by Aldo Craievich at LNLS.    The facilities at the two sites
              were each built with  attention to compatibility with those at the other, 
              including a toroidal grating monochromator beamline at LNLS  and a joint
              LNLS/CAMD beamline at CAMD using a double  crystal monochromator. Besides
              carrying out their own  experiments, the PI's will train students and younger 
              scientists in the use of the equipment.    ****
