Abstract    :
                                                        This award from the Academic Research
              Infrastructure Program will help the Department of  Chemistry at Michigan
              Technological University acquire a 300 MHz NMR Spectrometer.  The  research
              activity to be supported includes: areas of synthetic organic chemistry,
              natural product  chemistry, bioorganic chemistry, ceramics synthesis, physical
              chemistry, and polymer chemistry.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              Spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to the  chemist for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown 
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
              to study the  dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access
              to state-of-the-art NMR  spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying
              out frontier research.  The results from  these NMR studies are useful in areas
              such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
