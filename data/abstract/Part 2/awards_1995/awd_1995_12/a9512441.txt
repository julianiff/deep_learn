Abstract    :
              ***  9512441  MONTASER  This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure
              Program will help   the Department of Chemistry at George Washington University
              acquire a   Phase-Doppler Particle Analyzer.  The research activity to be
              supported   includes: (1) investigation of novel nebulization systems and  
              high-temperature helium plasmas in analytical spectrometry for elemental  
              analysis, (2) investigation of plumes generated by laser ablation from  
              metals, insulators, and high-transition temperature superconductors, (3)  
              investigations of the production and monitoring of pollutants in   diffusion
              flames, an area of interest for the gas industry, (4)   development of
              efficient practical high-order computational methods for   the simulation of
              physical phenomena described by unsteady nonlinear   three-dimensional partial
              differential equations.    The Phase-Doppler Particle Analyzer (PDPA) is a key
              diagnostic instrument   which is used when studying nebulization systems and
              high temperature   helium plasmas in analytical spectrometry for elemental
              analysis.  It   gives information on particle-size and particle-velocity
              distribution of   sample aerosol.    ***
