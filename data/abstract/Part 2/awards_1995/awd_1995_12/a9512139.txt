Abstract    :
              With partial support from the National Science Foundation, the MIT Economics
              Department Computer Cluster will upgrade its computing facility. As a result of
              an explosion in the role of computation in economic research, the Department
              has reached the limits of existing hardware. To alleviate this situation, it
              will undertake a three part program to upgrade its current instrumentation.
              This includes: the purchase of a substantially upgraded departmental
              workstation and fileserver; the upgrading of PC facilities and increased
              connectivity of PCs in graduate student offices; purchase of an IBM RS/6000
              workstation, a dedicated file server, and 10 gigabytes of additional disc
              space.   Three groups of faculty members and their affiliated graduate students
              will be the primary beneficiaries of this upgrade. Many of these researchers
              are working on data-intensive empirical micro- and macro-economics questions;
              others employ simulation methods to solve problems in economic theory while a
              third group is engaged in developing new econometric tools. The expanded
              facilities will also benefit numbers of both graduate and undergraduate
              students and serve to further teaching as well as research.
