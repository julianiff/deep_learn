Abstract    :
              9512856  Ying    A U.S.-Brazil collaborative research effort will be carried 
              out by See-Chen Ying, John Kosterlitz, and Tapio Ala-Nissila  of Brown
              University and Enzo Granato of the Instituto  Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais
              in Sao Paulo to study the  transport properties of adsorbed layers and
              superconducting  Josephson-junction arrays, considering both linear and 
              nonlinear regimes. The investigators will apply a two-  dimensional version of
              the Frenkel-Kontorova model to  understand sliding friction of an adsorbed
              layer under a  steady external force in the plane.  In addition, they will  use
              numerical simulations to study the effect of pinning in  the melting of
              Abrikosov vortex lattices in the context of a  Josephson-junction array in a
              magnetic field.      The work will deepen our understanding of one of the
              growing  fields of condensed matter science. The U.S team brings an  excellent
              record of research in surface diffusion and  Josephson-junction arrays, while
              the Brazilians contribute  considerable expertise in numerical simulations. The
               international collaboration, supported in Brazil by CNPq,  will benefit both
              sides as well as the field in general.    ****
