Abstract    :
              9512363  Kam    This proposal request equipment requests equipment for
              hierarchial and distributed industrial control centered around a new Honeywell
              TDC-3000 process control system,  which has been donated to Drexel University. 
              This equipment  will help the PI's expand their research and education into
              power systems, robotics and manufacturing.  The TDC-3000 is a real-time
              industrial control system which is currently operating in power-generation
              stations, oil refineries, chemical factories and manufacturing plants.  The
              architecture of the system permits sensing (monitoring) and control of various
              processes with special purpose programs for optimal control.  The request is to
              acquire and configure the TDC-3000 system (with Honeywell participation) and to
              design, construct and install new process-control and robotic plants which will
              be controlled by the configured system.  This equipment will establish a
              facility for industrial process control at Drexel and extend their E4
              curriculum to the junior and senior level as well as first-year graduate
              school.  ***
