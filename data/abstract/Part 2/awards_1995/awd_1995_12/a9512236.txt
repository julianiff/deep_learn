Abstract    :
              9512236  James  This award is to provide for the purchase of scientific 
              instruments that will strengthen and unify the research and  research training
              activities of the institution's Orthopedic  Research Group.  The equipment
              obtained through this award  will provide enhanced capability to the twelve
              faculty of  the Group who are conducting research on polymers for total  human
              joint replacements, analysis of retrieved orthopedic  implants, new designs and
              materials for external fixation  pin technology, fracture repair with calcium
              phosphate bone  cement, and other related projects.    The proposal leading to
              this award was submitted in response  to the National Science Foundation's
              Instrumentation  Development and Acquisition Solicitation, NSF 94-156, 
              Academic Research Infrastructure Program.  Results of this  program are
              expected to improve the accessibility of modern  research instrumentation for
              use by the institution's  faculty in conducting research on important topics of
               significance to progress in biomedical engineering,  particularly in the area
              of improved prostheses for human  use.  ***
