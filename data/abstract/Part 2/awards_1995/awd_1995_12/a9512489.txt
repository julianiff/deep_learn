Abstract    :
              Abstract  Pepigger  9512489      This proposal is for the acquisition of an
              ultra high speed diagnostic system which consists of the following:  (1) a high
              rep-rate (76 MHz) Ti-Sapphire laser with 80 femtosecond pulse width, (2) a 30
              kHz rep-rate copper vapor laser with 10 to 40 nanosecond pulse width, (3) a
              high speed video camera (5kHz), and (4) a dedicated image
              analysis/visualization computer system.  The requested system will enable the
              production, visualization and analysis of phenomena that exhibit disparate
              characteristic time scales and that are commonly encountered in plasma,
              combustion, and surface physics phenomena.  Research application areas include
              laser induced plasmas, combustion, non-linear optics and time resolved
              spectroscopy, photodetectors, single molecule detection, arcjet thrusters,
              laser welding, solidification, laser-induced joining and coating, laser
              machining, transient fluid mechanics and real-time image analysis.
