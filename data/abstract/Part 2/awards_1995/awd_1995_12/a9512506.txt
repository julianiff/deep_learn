Abstract    :
                  9512506  Griffin    A suite of thermoanalytical equipment will be acquired
              and  utilized by a group of scientists working in the Structure and  Dynamics
              cluster of the Mississippi EPSCoR (Experimental  Program to Stimulate
              Competitive Research) Program. The  instrumentation includes a differential
              scanning calorimeter  with photocalorimeter accessory, a thermogravimetric
              analyzer,  a dynamic mechanical analyzer, a polarized light thermal  microscopy
              system, an infrared imaging camera, and controlled  heating accessories for an
              existing infrared spectrometer. The  instruments will be used for the thermal
              characterization of  materials synthesized by the research group. Much of the 
              research involves thermal studies of liquid crystals, such as  thermodynamic
              and kinetic data of phase transitions,  photocalorimetry, spectroscopic and
              mechanical behavior as a  function of temperature. Other research involves
              diverse topics  such as traveling front polymerization, structuring in 
              semifluorinated alkanes, and amorphous organic glasses.  %%%  The proposed
              instrumentation will fill a critical need of a  group of EPSCoR scientists,
              thus enhancing their ability to  conduct first-line research which will take
              them to the next  level of competitiveness. The instrumentation will also serve
               an active program in organic and polymeric materials that has  traditionally
              involved a large number of undergraduate and  underrepresented minority
              students.  ***
