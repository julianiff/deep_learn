Abstract    :
                                                                                        This
              award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will help the
              Department of  Chemistry at the University of Oregon acquire an X-ray
              photoelectric spectrometer (LXPS).   The research activity to be supported
              includes: the areas of molecular self-assembly, polymer  modification and/or
              degradation, semiconductor photocorrosion, chemical sensing, fabrication  of
              non-linear optical devices, and the preparation and characterization of new
              solid state  nanostructures and materials.    The X-ray photoelectron (XPS)
              spectrometer is used for chemical analysis.  It irradiates a  sample with a
              beam of monochromatic X-rays and the energies of the resulting photoelectrons 
              are measured and are related to specific elements
