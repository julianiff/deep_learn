Abstract    :
              9512210  Oden    This proposal requests the acquisition of a mid-scale parallel
              computing system consisting of 32 to 64 processing elements with high bandwidth
              interprocessor communication to insure scalability into the teraflop regime.
              The system will have parallel I/O to a disk system of around 100 gigabytes
              capacity. The facility will provide for the development of new computational
              algorithms, new software tools and mathematical techniques which will have a
              broad impact across a multitude of scientific and engineering disciplines. The
              proposed facility supports broad research activities across a variety of
              disciplines in engineering and sciences, in such tasks parallel computing play
              an important role. These research activities span the entire spectrum of
              computational modeling, ranging from computational chemistry to engineering
              mechanics, and to astrophysics.  ***
