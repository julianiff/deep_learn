Abstract    :
              With partial support from the National Science Foundation, the Institute for
              Mathematical Behavioral Sciences at the University of California, Irvine will
              purchase a Digital Equipment Corporation AlphaServer 2100 4/275. The RISC chip
              in this server runs at 275 MHz and the operating system is the Open Software
              Foundation version of Unix, OSF.  The server has 256 Mbytes of main memory with
              8.3 Gbytes of disc space. This equipment will supplement and significantly
              upgrade the group's current system and will permit a broader range of analyses
              of large data sets.  The Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences is a
              multidisciplinary research center that draws its faculty from the Departments
              of Anthropology, Cognitive Sciences, Economics, Mathematics, Philosophy and
              Sociology and from the Graduate School of Management. The experience and
              expertise of the faculty cover much of the spectrum of formal and computational
              approaches to behavioral science. The equipment provided will further research
              in several areas that include cognitive sciences, economics, social networks
              and anthropology, and visual perception. This project has a strong educational
              component and the equipment will help graduate students in the Institute's M.A.
              and Ph.D. programs and graduate students in other Departments in the School of
              Social Sciences. The equipment will help with computer-aided learning for
              undergraduates in anthropology, economics and cognitive sciences.
