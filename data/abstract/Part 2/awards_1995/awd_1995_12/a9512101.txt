Abstract    :
                   This grant will support the writing of a detailed phonological  and lexical
              reconstruction of the Chamic languages of mainland  Southeast Asia. In addition
              to the reconstructions, the basic paths  of development from Proto-Chamic (=
              PC) to the modern languages  will be laid out in detail.       The
              justification for the project lies in the contributions  such a reconstruction
              will make to our understanding of several  areas of interest (a) the history of
              the Austronesian language  family, (b) the history of the Chamic languages, (c)
              the paths of  development involved in radical restructuring of phonological 
              systems, and (d) the effects of contact on the directionality of  language
              change.
