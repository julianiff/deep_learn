Abstract    :
              A broad program of research in atomic, molecular, and  optical physics and
              related areas will be carried out at  JILA at the University of Colorado.  The
              research activities  to be conducted include:  laser cooling and trapping, 
              precision measurements, quantum optics, nonlinear optics,  photonics, simple
              atomic and molecular systems, and larger  molecular systems and clusters.  The
              recently announced  first experimental observation of Bose-Einstein
              condensation  is one example of the research which forms a part of the  JILA
              program.
