Abstract    :
                This grant provides partial support for Dr. Edou-Minko, a geologist with the
              University of Science and Technology of Masuku, in Gabon, West Africa, to
              collaborate with Erik Brown, Assistant Professor of Geochemistry at the Large
              Lakes Observatory with the University of Minnesota, on the use in-situ produced
              cosmogenic nuclides to determine long-term weathering rates at various
              watershed sites in the Mississippi Valley.  Dr. Edou-Minko is a specialist in
              the geochemistry of laterites and lateritic gold deposits, and has had
              extensive field experience in tropical and equatorial West Africa. The multiple
              approaches to examination of weathering dynamics offered by Professor Brown and
              Dr. Edou-Minko will provide insights into the effects of the differing
              geological settings.  The importance of attempting to quantify weathering rates
              is fundamental to an overall understanding of all surficial processes of the
              Earth.  Furthermore, through time the overall chemistry of the ocean is
              influenced by differences in weathering rates caused by variations in rock type
              and climate.  The researchers expect to be able to make a comparison of
              quantitative weathering rates within different latitudes, which could lead to a
              better understanding of weathering processes in different climatic regimes.
