Abstract    :
              9512229  Peyghambarian    This proposal request an electron-beam (e-beam)
              lithography system for micro and nanolithography.  The system consists of a
              modified  scanning-electron microscope (SEM) (with the necessary software and
              hardware) and will be installed in a clean-room area within the Optical
              Sciences Center.  The system is required for the fabrication of optoelectronic
              components, such as nonlinear gratings, circular grating lasers,
              photorefractive polymer waveguides, organic LEDs and laser diode devices, and
              quantum wire and dot semiconductor lasers.  ***
