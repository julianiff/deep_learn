Abstract    :
                The objectives of this research are to develop and empirically test a more
              encompassing theory of investment under uncertainty that may better describe
              the actual investment behavior of firms, and to assess its implications for
              aggregate investment. The research project has both theoretical and empirical
              components. The empirical component implements with firm-level data the
              framework developed under the previous grant, in which firms may face various
              costs of adjusting their capital stocks. The goal of the theoretical component
              is to further develop analytically the role played by various types of
              adjustment costs in the investment dynamics of the firm. This framework
              emphasizes the fact that firms may pay a higher price for capital purchases
              than they receive for capital sales. One such case is examined in detail and an
              analytic solution obtained. It is shown that even a small discount on resale
              prices relative to purchase prices may have a substantial impact on investment
              behavior. This analysis is extended to a firm with any number of factors that
              may have resale discounts. A two-factor example can be interpreted as a firm
              facing irreversibility of capital investment and costs of firing workers. These
              features have been examined separately before, but this framework shows that
              when considered together, the importance of each type of irreversibility
              declines. Finally, it is shown how a continuum of bubbles can arise in the
              context of a firm's optimization problem.      - -    9512088  Abel  The
