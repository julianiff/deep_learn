Abstract    :
              9512376  Pahlavan    The proposed project is to develop an experimental wireless
              network with ATM connectivity for multi-media applications. An experimental
              wireless campus test-bed will be used to construct a wireless classroom
              environment. In this classroom environment, the instructor presents his/her
              lecture material that is prepared on a personal computer through the electronic
              projector and an electronic board. Multi-media services including voice, text,
              and bit-mapped images will be provided to students dispersed over a small
              geographical area on the campus. The results of the experiment will have a
              multifold impact including the feasibility of access multi-media information
              using portable wireless terminals, the development of benchmarks specific to
              multi-media wireless network applications for future comparative performance
              evaluation of different wireless technologies, and the development of
              multi-media wireless networking protocols and mobility management algorithms.
