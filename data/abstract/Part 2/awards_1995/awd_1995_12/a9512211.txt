Abstract    :
              9512211  Symons  This is an award to provide support for purchase of analytical 
              equipment to be used in support of the University of Houston's  environmental
              engineering program in its Civil and Environmental  Engineering Department. 
              The research equipment obtained through  this award will provide enhanced
              analytical capability to five  faculty and the staff chemist who are conducting
              research on  water disinfection byproducts, groundwater treatment to remove 
              organic solvent contaminants, groundwater flow and quality  modeling,
              ion-exchange methods for removing metal contaminants  from soil and water, and
              modeling of interfacial phenomena for  decontaminating soil.    The proposal
              leading to this award was submitted in response to  the National Science
              Foundation's Instrumentation Development and  Acquisition Solicitation, NSF
              94-156, Academic Research  Infrastructure Program.   Results of this award are
              expected to  improve the accessibility of modern research instrumentation for 
              use by this institution's faculty in conducting research on  important topics
              of environmental significance and in educating  students.  ***
