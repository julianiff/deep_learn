Abstract    :
              9112251  Wang   This grant provides funds for the acquisition by Florida State
              University of a resin transfer molding (RTM) technology testbed.  The RTM
              instrumentation will consist of four integral components: an RTM machine,
              process tooling and molds, an intelligent process controller, and sensors.  The
              RTM instrumentation will support four research programs, RTM process modeling,
              process design, process control, and an integrated RTM product and process
              development environment.  This instrumentation will build upon traditional
              materials projects to create an infrastructure that will consider life cycle
              issues of new composite materials from initial concept and design to prototype
              production and in-field practice.     This instrumentation will enhance the
              research and educational facilities of Florida State University, which seeks to
              increase the pool of minority engineering and science students educated in this
              discipline.  The facility development will include the establishment of a
              specialized RTM research and training facility, training of faculty and
              students, recruitment of minority students and development of new courses.  ***
