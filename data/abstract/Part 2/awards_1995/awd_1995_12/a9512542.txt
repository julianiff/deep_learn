Abstract    :
                                                                                              
               This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will help the
              Department of  Chemistry at Rutgers University at Camden, New Jersey acquire a
              SGI INDIGOZ and four SGI  Indy R4600SC workstations.  The research activity to
              be supported includes investigations into  the mechanism of doping in
              electronically active polymers, the design and synthesis of  quaternary
              inorganic compounds with unusual electrical and magnetic properties, the 
              mathematical modeling of chemical reactions, the synthesis of membrane ion
              channel models,  and the analysis of environmental contaminants.    A
              workstation network of fast, modern computer workstations is a new way to
              satisfy the  computing needs of chemistry departments.  Such a "computer
              network" also serves as a  development environment for new theoretical codes
              and algorithms, provides state-of-the-art  graphics and visualization
              facilities and supports research in state-of-the-art applications of  parallel
              processing.
