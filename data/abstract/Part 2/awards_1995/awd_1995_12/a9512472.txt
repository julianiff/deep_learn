Abstract    :
              9512472  Parker      This Academic Research Infrastructure grant provides
              $250,000 as  one-half support of the development of an experimental facility 
              for the study of large scale river morphology, stratigraphy and  landscape
              evolution.  The facility will be constructed at the St.  Anthony Falls
              Hydraulic Laboratory, University of Minnesota in an  existing indoor basin that
              is 14.3 m long and 7.3 m wide.  The  main elements of the basin will include, a
              rainmaker for  simulating various hydrologic regimes, a hinged floor to
              simulate  tectonic uplift and subsidence, a zone of ponded water and feed 
              points for water and sediment along the basin.  All elements of  the basin are
              to be computer controlled and monitored by a data  acquisition system.  The
              main subsystems of the data acquisition  system will be two computer controlled
              laser profilers for  precision measurements of microrelief, a particle imaging 
              velocimetry system for instantaneous measurement of surface flow  velocities,
              an optical imaging system for instantaneous  determination of channel depth and
              a stereoimaging system for  determination of overall topography.  This project
              is to be  constructed and utilized by an interdisciplinary team consisting  of
              a civil engineer, a sedimentologist,  an environmental  engineer, an
              agricultural engineer and an engineer with  considerable knowledge of
              electronics.  The basin is to be  operable in both subaerial and subaqueous
              mode allowing for  studies of both riverine processes and terrestrial landscape
               evolution and studies of continental shelf, slope and rise  evolution.  An
              automated mesocosm of this kind allows for the  control of governing variables
              and monitoring on time and spatial  scales that are not easily observed in
              field situations.  This  facility should provide a bridge between simulation
              and field  research that hastens the development of new predictive tools and 
              it is intended that the facility be made available to a broad  spectrum of
              outside researchers.    ***
