Abstract    :
                  9512868  Ginter    This award will provide travel support, over a period of
              two  years, to assist a team of four American investigators under the 
              leadership of Prof. Marshall Ginter, Institute for Physical  Science and
              Technology at the University of Maryland, to  conduct collaborative research
              with a team of researchers from  the Research School of Physical Sciences and
              Engineering at the   Australian National University under the direction of  
              Dr. Kenneth Baldwin.  The project focuses on vacuum ultraviolet  (VUV)
              photoabsorption measurements.      The researchers are all active investigators
              working with  UV and VUV spectroscopy.  It is anticipated that the 
              collaboration will provide important new information on the  importance of
              these spectroscopic studies in both atmospheric   applications and the more
              fundamental sciences and will assist in  identifying and reducing systematic
              instrumental errors which  limit the accuracy of current metrology in the VUV. 
              Among the  tools to be used in this study are long focal length  spectrographs,
              Fourier transform spectometers, synchrotron  radiation sources, and precision
              laser systems.  The work in  Australian is supported through the Department of
              Industry,  Science and Technology.
