                      9512721 Harvell   This is a three year dissertation enhancement award
              proposed by Dr. Drew Harvell and Ms. Laurie Raymundo, Cornell  University. The
              funds requested are to support primarily Ms. Laurie Raymundo, a Ph.D. student
              whose project involves developing optimal procedures for coral reef seed
              transplantation, survival and growth, and recruitment and colonization on bare
              substrates in the Philippines.  Silliman University in the Philippines will
              provide the logistical support for this project.  Coral reefs are important to
              coastal productivity, but susceptible to damage from human activity.  The
              extent of coral reef degradation throughout Southeast Asia has accelerated
              throughout the past 20 years.  The goal of this project is to test two methods
              for coral transplantation as a means of accelerating restoration of coral
              reefs.  The results can provide the basis for new and improved technology.  It
              can also help coral reef ecologists and related scientists in the U.S. and the
              Philippines to better understand how coral reefs regenerate.        @
