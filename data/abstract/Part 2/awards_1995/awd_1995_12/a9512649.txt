Abstract    :
              9512649  Kashyap    The goal of this project is to explore, along both
              theoretical and empirical lines, the role of banks in the transmission of
              monetary policy.  On the theoretical front, the project aims to develop a new
              fully specified model of the banking sector that demonstrates how the adverse
              selection problems banks face in raising uninsured, non-deposit external
              financing can affect the determination of interest rates on both bank loans and
              open-market securities.  The model will show how the same sort of capital
              market frictions that can make non-financial firms spending overly sensitive to
              cash flow can influence bank portfolio decisions and the equilibrium level of
              interest rates.  Empirically, bank-level data will be used to test the model. 
              One of the most useful aspects of the model is that it makes a number of
              clear-cut cross-sectional predictions.  For example, if a set of banks can be
              identified that are a priori more likely to be constrained by adverse selection
              problems in raising non-deposit finance, the model predicts that the lending
              behavior of these banks should be particularly sensitive to changes in the
              stance of Monterey policy.  There are potentially a number of variables that
              can be used as proxies for such constraints, including bank size, "excess" cash
              and securities on hand, levels of capital, etc.    It should be emphasized that
              the bank-level data set that this project constructs will be unique in terms of
              its coverage over time and across banks.  Therefore, in addition to the narrow
              focus on monetary transmission, the data set will no doubt very useful in
              addressing a number of other related issues.
