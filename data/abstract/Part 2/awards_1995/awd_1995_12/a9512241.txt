Abstract    :
              9512241  Henderson        The proposed project is to acquire an SGI Power Onyx
              graphics engine front end, and a SGI Power Challenge computational engine for
              large-scale computational steering. Computational steering permits users to
              interactively change boundary conditions, model geometry, and computational
              parameters via a graphical user interface. It allows the visualization to guide
              or steer the design and computation phases of the simulation or computation.
              The computational steering model is applicable to a wide range of applications
              including medicine, genetics, image analysis, CAD/CAM, telerobotics, and
              virtual reality. Software is being developed in different application areas to
              "close the loop" to replace the typical simulation model in which the user
              manually sets input parameters, computes results, stores data, visualizes the
              results via a separate visualization package, and then starts again at the
              beginning. The proposed equipment will permit interactive modeling and
              scientific visualization supported by parallel computational systems.  ***
