Abstract    :
                9512299  Ratchford    This award provides funds to permit Dr. J. Thomas
              Ratchford,  Director, Center for Science, Trade, and Technology Policy,  George
              Mason University, to conduct with Dr. Dr. Young Gul Kim,  Director, Research
              Center for Catalytic Technology, Pohang  University of Science and Technology,
              Korea, the Second U.S.-  Korea Joint Seminar on Science and Technology Policy. 
              This joint  seminar will be held in two sessions, the first, in December  1995,
              at George Mason University, the second, in the spring of  1996, in Daeduk
              Science Town, Korea.  Eight U.S. scientists from  outside the Washington area
              will be supported for the first  session, while 12 U.S. participants will be
              supported for the  second session, in Korea.  The joint seminar will have three
               major foci, namely: R&D strategies of industries; the promotion  of basic
              research in universities; and increasing U.S.-Korea S&T  cooperation.    The
              December 1995 session will be timed to immediately precede  the Third
              U.S.-Korea Science and Technology Forum, a major annual  event held in
              Washington, D.C., and financed by the Korean  Ministry of Science and
              Technology.  This timing should attract,  at little additional cost, a number
              of concerned U.S. and Korean  specialists who will participate in the Forum. 
              The second  session of the joint seminar will be made to coincide with the 
              time period (probably March 1996) in which representatives of  U.S. companies
              will be attending a joint meeting of the  Industrial Research Institute (IRI)
              and its Korean counterpart,  the Korea Industrial Technology Association
              (KITA).  U.S.  participants in the second session will tour major manufacturing
               industries, industrial and government research laboratories, and  research
              universities, in order to provide them a first-hand  exposure to Korea's S&T
              activities.  The IRI Executive Director  is expected to participate in both
              sessions.    The collaborators are exceptionally well qualified to organize 
              and conduct such a joint seminar.  The pa rticipants supported by  this award
              are recognized experts whose presentations will be of  mutual interest and
              benefit.  This project is relevant to the  objectives of the U.S.-Korea
              Cooperative Science Program which  seeks to increase the level of cooperation
              between U.S. and  Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of 
              scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through 
              collaboration on problems of mutual interest and benefit.  Korean 
              participation is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering  Foundation
              (KOSEF).
