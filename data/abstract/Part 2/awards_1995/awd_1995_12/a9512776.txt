Abstract    :
                This three-year award supports U.S.-Sweden cooperative research on grassland
              microbial ecology between R. Peter Herman of New Mexico State University and
              Anna Martensson of the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences.  The award
              adds an international dimension to the Jornada LTER (Long-term Ecological
              Research) site on desert grasslands and allows for comparative research with
              pasture grasslands near Uppsala, Sweden.  The objective of the research is to
              study: (1) changes in microbial community structure and function associated
              with woody plant invasion intograsslands; and (2) the transfer of nitrogen
              between legumes and non-legumes and the role that mycorrhizal fungi play in the
              transfer.  The investigators will compare juniper and rose shrub invasions of
              pasture grasslands with creosote invasions of desert grasslands. They will also
              study questions related to mycorrhizae mediated nitrogen transfer.  This
              international project connects two long-term ecological research sites with two
              distinctive ecosystems.  It allows for comparative investigations and for the
              development of long-term data sets collected in the United States and Sweden.
