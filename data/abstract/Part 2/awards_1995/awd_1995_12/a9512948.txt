Abstract    :
                   Funds are requested for three ultracentrifuges (Beckman L7-80) and  eight
              ultracentrifuge rotors (two each of NVT65, 60Ti, SW-55Ti, and  SW-41Ti) to be
              located in the molecular biology core facility that  serves laboratories in the
              three departments of Biology, Molecular  Biology and Biochemistry, and
              Chemistry at Wesleyan University. The  ultracentrifuges will replace two
              instruments that have recently become  non-operational due to age related
              circumstances. Acquisition of the  three new instruments will bring to four the
              number of ultracentrifuges  on campus although use of the fourth machine will
              be limited due to its  age. The instruments will be used by the laboratories of
              seven major  and four minor users. They will also be used by two new faculty to
              be  hired in the areas of cell biology and molecular biology.         The
              instruments are required for standard methods in molecular  biology and
              biochemistry including a number of different subcellular  fractionation methods
              for membrane preparations, and to separate  protein or protein/RNA complexes. 
              Ultracentrifugation is also required  for certain DNA preparations where purity
              and yield are important.  These methods will be applied to several different
              projects.  These  include studies of: Mechanisms of protein localization in E.
              coli;  Identification of novel antigens for Lyme disease diagnosis; Topology 
              of a membrane associated regulator of prokaryotic DNA replication;  Dissection
              of Drosophila Paired protein function; Formation of the  mammalian visual
              cortex; Analysis of the cell division cycle in yeast;  Regulation of the 2(1)
              collagen gene in chick embryonic cartilage  cells; and the role of ferritin in
              defense against oxygen radical  toxicity.         Matching funds from Wesleyan
              University will pay for 50% of the  cost of the instruments.
