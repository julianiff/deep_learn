Abstract    :
                    Partial funding (50%) is requested for purchasing a 500 MHz NMR 
              spectrometer to be shared by ten research groups. Michigan State  University
              will provide a 50% match for the acquisition of the  instrument. The
              spectrometer will be dedicated to the structural  analysis and mechanistic
              studies of biomacromolecules, including  proteins (H. Yan, W. Wells, R.
              Hausinger, R. Hollingsworth, J. Preiss,  S. Triezenberg and J. Frost), nucleic
              acids (K. Dunbar and D. Nocera),  carbohydrates (R. Hollingsworth and F.
              Dazzo), and metabolites (J.  Frost). It will be located in the Max T. Rogers
              NMR Facility, a shared  resource open to the University research community. The
              NMR Facility  staff will be responsible for the maintenance and operation of
              the  instrument.        Acquisition of the requested instrument will greatly
              enhance the  research infrastructure at Michigan State University. It will
              impact  all the research projects that require NMR characterization, facilitate
               development of collaborative research in biomolecular NMR, enhance  graduate
              and postdoctoral training, and help recruitment of new  faculty, graduate
              students and postdoctoral fellows. It will also  impact the expanding
              activities in structural biology and biotechnology  on the campus.
