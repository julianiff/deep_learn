Abstract    :
              9512326  Fillo    This proposal requests equipment for chip assembly, such as a
              direct chip attachment station, a liquid solder and epoxy dispensing system, a
              programmable furnace for solder reflow experiments, oven, a laser
              cutting/ablative tool for circuit boards, and an electroplating station.  The
              equipment  university will provide unlimited access for all the students and
              the versatility of the equipment will enable more innovative research
              approaches to chip assembly and packaging.  ***
