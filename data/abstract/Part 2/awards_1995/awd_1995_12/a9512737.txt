Abstract    :
              This is a renewal proposal for studying "Antiprotons, Mass  Spectroscopy and
              Recombination".  It continues work on the  comparison of the antiproton and
              proton change-to-mass ratio  as a test of CPT invariance.  This provides one of
              the few  accurate tests of CPT invariance for a baryon system.  A  better
              comparison of the charge-to-mass ratios remains the  first goal of this
              research program.  The hope is to compare  the charge-to-mass ratio of a
              negative hydrogen atom with  that of an antiproton to achieve this goal.
