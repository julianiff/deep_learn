Abstract    :
              9512900  de Fontaine    This award will support the travel of twelve
              participants (including five postdoctoral researchers and graduate students) to
              a U.S.-France workshop on the theory of alloys to take place in Strasbourg,
              France, October 1996.  The co-organizers of the workshop are Didier de Fontaine
              at the University of California, Berkeley and Hugues Dreysse at the University
              Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg, France.  The objectives of the workshop are to
              discuss the current state of theory, problems areas, and to develop an agenda
              for future research.  The discussion topics will include atomic displacements
              and multicomponent systems.
