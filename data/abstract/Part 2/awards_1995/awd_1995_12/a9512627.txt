Abstract    :
              9512627  Cohen   This award provides partial funding (70% of total cost) for the
              acquisition of a computer system with large memory and fast memory access time
              that will be installed and operated in the Geophysical Laboratory at the
              Carnegie Institution of Washington. The Carnegie Institution is committed to
              providing the remaining funds needed for the purchase. The principle
              investigator and colleagues at the Geophysical Laboratory are engaged in
              research in the field of theoretical mineral physics to calculate the physical
              and chemical properties of bulk condensed matter and molecules under the
              extreme temperature and pressure combinations existing in the Earth's deep
              interior. The calculations involve first principles methods, which are
              independent of parametric fits to experimental data, but use theories such as
              the Density Functional Theory, electronic structure methods, or ab initio
              models, all of which require very intensive computer calculations.  ***
