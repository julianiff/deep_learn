Abstract    :
              9512448  Mataric    The proposed project is to establish and support a new
              laboratory for adaptive behavior which will be equipped with mobile robots; and
              the computational, electronic, and mechanical equipment. The laboratory
              supports interdisciplinary research involving engineering and cognitive science
              in behavior and learning on autonomous agents. Studies to be carried in areas
              of directed and emergent programming, reinforcement learning, neural network
              learning, and evolutionary and genetic programming approaches. A set of related
              research projects in multi-agent and multi-robot will be initiated for dealing
              with a variety of agents, environments, and tasks; for selecting control
              strategies; and for simplifying the task of designing complex multi-agent
              systems. The laboratory will also be used for student projects in advanced
              computer science courses.  ***
