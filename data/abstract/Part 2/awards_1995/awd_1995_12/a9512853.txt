Abstract    :
              9512853  Galligan    This Americas Program award will support collaborative 
              research between Dr. James Galligan, University of  Connecticut, and Dr. Arkady
              Krokhin, Universidad Autonoma de  Puebla, Mexico.  The objective is to provide
              a new and basic  approach to the fundamental problem of relating the 
              interaction of electrons to defects in metal crystals.  The  research will
              involve experiments designed to measure and  delineate the interaction of
              electrons with dislocations.  Theoretical analyses of the experimental results
              will  follow.    This project will help to extend our understanding of how a 
              material plastically deforms, providing fundamental  information on microscopic
              aspects of plasticity.  Experimental results will be obtained using a 
              Superconducting Quantum Interference Detector (SQUID) at the  University of
              Connecticut to measure the alteration of  energy states of electrons.  These
              results will then provide  the basis for calculations to be carried out by Dr. 
              Krokhin's group in Mexico.  *** .
