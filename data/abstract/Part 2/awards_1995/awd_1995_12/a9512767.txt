Abstract    :
                  9512767  Starmer      This award will support the travel costs for Dr.
              William Starmer  and Dr. Larry Wolf from the Biology Department at Syracuse 
              University to conduct collaborative research with   Prof. J.S.F. Barker of the
              Department of Animal Sciences at the  University of New England in Armidale,
              New South Wales,  Australia.  The focus of this work will involve field studies
              of   a unique insect-microorganism-plant system in Australia.    The system
              involves drosophilid flies that live in native  Hibiscus flowers.  The flies
              rely on nutrients provided by yeasts  that grow in the closed blossoms, while
              thee yeasts rely on the  flies for transport to newly opened flowers.  The
              mutual benefits  between fly and yeast make this system appropriate for studies
              on  ecological and evolutionary genetics.  The studies will include 
              investigations of the population genetic structure of flies and  microbes, the
              determinants of reproductive characteristics in the  flies, and the community
              ecology of the yeasts.  This cooperative  research bpings together
              investigators with complementary  interests and skills in the fields of
              population genetics,  microbial ecology and behavioral ecology.  The work in
              Australia  is supported through the Department of Industry, Science and 
              Technology (DIST) under the US-Australia Cooperative Science  Program.
