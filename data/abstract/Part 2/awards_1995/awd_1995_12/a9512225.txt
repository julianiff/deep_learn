Abstract    :
                9512225  Klein    A new, high intensity filter-analyzer neutron spectrometer 
              (FANS) will be designed, constructed, and operated at the  National Institute
              of Standards and Technology (NIST) by a  consortium of scientists from the
              University of Pennsylvania,  the University of California at Santa Barbara,
              NIST, Hughes  Aircraft, DuPont, and Allied-Signal. The throughput and 
              sensitivity of the new FANS will exceed by a factor of at least  fifty that of
              a heavily oversubscribed prototype which is  already unique in the US. When
              completed, FANS will be the most  sensitive neutron spectrometer in the world
              for studies of  vibrational modes in the 10-100 millielectron-volt range by 
              inelastic scattering of neutrons. The FANS instrument will be  used to study
              intra- and intermolecular vibrations in molecular  crystals and liquids, 
              polymers, guest-host systems such as  hydrogen in metals and hydrocarbons in
              zeolites,  to  characterize novel forms of carbon such as fullerenes and 
              tubules, and novel candidate molecules for environmentally safe  refrigerants. 
              %%%  The development of the FANS will fill an urgent  need of the  country's
              scientific infrastructure. There are currently only  two such instruments in
              the world, one in France and one  prototype at NIST, and they are both heavily
              subscribed. The  FANS will have a wide impact on molecular spectroscopy 
              research, as current neutron facilities in the US are  inadequate for studies
              of molecular dynamics.  ***
