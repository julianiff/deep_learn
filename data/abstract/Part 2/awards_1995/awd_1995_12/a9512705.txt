Abstract    :
              9512705  Doughty       Research will be carried out in high energy electron 
              scattering and photonuclear reactions at CEBAF to study the  structure of the
              nucleon and excited states.  Included is work on  the spin structure of the
              proton and test of the Gerasimov-Drell-  Hearn sum rule.  The structure of
              excited baryons will be carried  out at high momentum transfers, where there is
              significant model  dependence at the quark level.    Research in these areas
              will  advance our understanding of the quark structure of the nucleon  and of
              the nucleon's complex spin structure in terms of  constituent and sea quarks
              and gluons.  These topics are high  priority activities in contemporary nuclear
              physics.  Technical  development of the CEBAF CLAS detector will also be
              carried out,  with specific responsibility for development of the event-trigger
               subsystem and other hardware and software subsystems of the  overall CLAS
              detector data acquisition system.  Education of  undergraduates and
              masters-level graduate students is a central  component of this grant.***
