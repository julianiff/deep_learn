Abstract    :
              9512787  Moncrief    This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative 
              research in mathematical physics between Vincent Moncrief at  Yale University
              and Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat at the University  of Pierre and Marie Curie (Paris
              VI).  The main objective of  their project is to obtain new results on the
              global  behavior of large classes of cosmological solutions of  Einstein's
              equations.  The investigators aim to characterize  the maximal Cauchy
              developments of such spacetimes by  proving the analogue of global existence
              theorems for  general relativity.  They will also study the boundary  behavior
              of singular solutions and classify spacetime  singularities themselves in a
              geometrically natural way.  This research will benefit from the extensive
              expertise of  the U.S. and French investigators in the area of  mathematical
              general relativity.  ***
