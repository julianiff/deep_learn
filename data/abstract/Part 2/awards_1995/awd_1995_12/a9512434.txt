Abstract    :
              9512434  Gosink  Geomechanical problems are characterized by large amounts of 
              data, significant variability, and lack of experimental control.  Analysis is
              frequently dependent upon remote sensing of various  types, including
              geotomography, and acoustic and microwave  methods.  Computationally intensive
              models, discrete element  methods, and inversion techniques, are employed to
              determine soil  and rock properties, and their response to civil works, 
              contaminant dispersion and seismic loading.  At CSM,  investigators have been
              actively involved in both experimental  and computational studies of
              geomaterials; these studies now  require enhanced computational capability and
              instrumentation for  continued success.    The research strategy advances a
              systems approach to the analysis  of geomaterials.  Rather than focusing on
              computation without  data acquisition or the reverse, we are proposing a suite
              of  computers and instruments which, working together, can  substantially
              increase our understanding of fundamental  properties and processes in soils
              and soil/rock mixtures, as well  as in other material applications.  This
              information has  relevance to problems of the civil infrastructure, contaminant
               transport and fate in soils, construction issues, design for  seismic
              considerations, transportation technologies, energy  technologies and pollution
              minimization and waste management.  ***
