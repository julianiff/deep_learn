Abstract    :
              9512873  Plohr    This U.S.-Brazil collaborative research project will develop 
              mathematical models and techniques to study the propagation  and noninvasive
              magnetic detection of electrochemical waves  in cardiac tissue and also develop
              the theory of fundamental  solutions of three-phase flow in petroleum
              reservoirs.  Led  by Bradley Plohr of SUNY Stony Brook and Dan Marchesin of 
              Instituto de Matematica Pura e Aplicada (IMPA) in Brazil, a  group of 6 to 10
              U.S. scientists and as many Brazilian  scientists will collaborate on these
              problems.  Several  graduate students in each country will also be involved in 
              the endeavor.      The project is both international and interdisciplinary, 
              bringing together mathematicians, physicists, doctors, and  engineers in two
              countries.  Building on established  collaborations, new avenues of research
              including new  investigators will be opened.  An established emphasis on 
              development of graduate students will also be continued.      ***
