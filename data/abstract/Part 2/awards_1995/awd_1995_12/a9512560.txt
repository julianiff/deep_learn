Abstract    :
              9512560  Sadra    This proposal requests a laser-patterned system for the
              in-situ fabrication of III-V semiconductor devices.  The system consists on an
              ArF/F2 excimer laser with patterning optics, etching chamber and hardware to
              couple with an existing molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) facility.  The additional
              equipment  will extend the PI's research program into promising areas, such as
              new devices and semiconductor fabrication equipment.  The advanced device
              structures which might result from this effort are devices needing multiple
              regrowth operations.  The ability to perform growth, patterning, etching and
              overgrowth in a reliable manner without removing the substrate from the vacuum
              would provide an important step forward in the use of MBE technology.  ***
