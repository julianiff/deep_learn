Abstract    :
              9512540  Mathys    The proposed project requests major research instrumentation
              which consists of an RF channel simulator; microwave equipment for frequencies
              up to 40 Ghz including a spectrum analyzer, mixers, phase shifters, etc.; a
              frequency agile signal simulator; spread spectrum modems, fast A/D converters,
              fast DSP boards, and three workstations with simulation software. The equipment
              supports research and education in wireless and mobile communications. Planned
              research projects are in areas of channel modeling, microwave transmitter and
              receiver design and implementation, design and analysis of new modulation
              methods including transmission and reception diversity, implementation of novel
              concepts of detection, equalization and demodulation, design of multi-access
              protocols, and adaptation of routing and flow control algorithms for wireless
              environments.  ***
