Abstract    :
              9512852  Akylas    This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research
              in applied mathematics between Triantaphyllos R. Akylas at the Massachusetts
              Institute of Technology and Frederic Dias at the Nonlinear Institute of Nice,
              French National Center for Scientific Research.  The objective of their
              research is to investigate classical, hydrodynamic wave problems and explore
              solutions involving finite-amplitude asymmetric waves (such as those found in
              the ocean or in the atmosphere).  They propose to tackle these problems through
              combined analytical and numerical studies.  The collaboration takes advantage
              of complementary expertise of the U.S. and French investigators.     ??
