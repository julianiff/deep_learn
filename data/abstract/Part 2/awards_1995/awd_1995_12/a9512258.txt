Abstract    :
                  9512258  Mitchell    A comprehensive ensemble of thermal analysis equipment
              will be  acquired in support of researchers in several departments at  Tulane
              University. Thermo-gravimetric, thermo-mechanical ,  differential thermal , and
              dynamic mechanical analysis  instrumentation will be used for
              interdisciplinary, advanced  materials and polymer-related research.
              Characterization of  materials such as catalysts, membranes, colloids, 
              superconductors, and enzymatic polymers will be performed with  this equipment.
              Many of theses materials are the products of  advanced-materials processing
              research, including sol-gel and  melt-processing technologies. In addition,
              some of the  materials to be characterized have direct applications in the 
              civilian infrastructure, such as calcia-alumina fibers for  reinforcement of
              Portland cement. Still other materials will  have applications in environmental
              remediation, for example,  specialized separation membranes. The thermal
              analysis  equipment has an educational component to it as well, as it  will pay
              a key role in the implementation of an  interdisciplinary materials laboratory
              course devoted to the  synthesis, characterization, and processing of
              materials.  %%%  The thermal analysis instrumentation will impact a variety of 
              research and education programs. It will be installed,  maintained and operated
              by a coordinated instrumentation  facility, ensuring that the equipment will
              achieve its maximum  potential for university-wide use.  ***
