Abstract    :
                                    A major recent thrust in research has  focused on
              ecosystem emission, deposition, and           uptake of greenhouse and trace
              gases. This research  is needed because predictions forecast that           a
              doubling of carbon dioxide (CO2) will have a  significant impact on ecosystem
              processes and           productivity, and because the natural emission or 
              deposition of gases is critical in regulating air           pollution. To
              achieve understanding of processes in  both areas, efforts are being made to   
                     evaluate the effect of alteration od ecosystems in  the vicinity of
              industrial, urban, and agricultural           areas. As a result, many
              scientific and government  agencies have formed programs to support          
              research on the interaction between the soil,  biosphere, and atmosphere in
              relation to greenhouse           and trace gas production, consumption, or 
              deposition.                 Duke University proposes to develop a mobile 
              laboratory that will be used for both basic           and more applied research
              on the mechanisms of the  emission and uptake of gases between the          
              soil-biosphere and the atmosphere. The integrated  laboratory will include
              state-of the art trace           gas analyzers, water vapor and CO2 gas
              analyzers,  ultra-sonic anemometers, leaf-level           porometery, a
              geoprobe, time domain reflectometers,  xylem heat flux systems, and a wide
              range           of environmental monitoring devices such as net  radiometers,
              short and long-wave radiation           sensors. The data from this instrument
              array will  be collected by a central work station within           the mobile
              laboratory. Instruments will be housed  in a research vehicle containing two
              movable           towers and a soil probe which will permit a rapid 
              installation of the sensors at remote sites high           in tree canopies and
              deep in the soil regolith. The  great advantage of a mobile facility is that   
                     it can support research at many experimental s ites  and can be used
              concurrently for several           projects, each of which requires periodic
              gas flux  measurements rather than continuous           monitoring.            
                  With its flexibility and enhanced  capabilities, this facility will allow
              researchers both           within the School of the Environment and throughout 
              the research community to address key           scientific questions that range
              across the  physical, biological, and chemical sciences in new           ways.
              It will enhance the investigation of such  fundamental questions as 1) how
              environmental           conditions (e.g., mean meteorological conditions, 
              energy, and moisture content) control leaf-           level gas diffusion, 2)
              how the air flow inside the  forest canopy interacts with the air flow above   
                     the car,opy to disperse or deposit greenhouse and  trace gases, 3) how
              atmospheric pressure and           subsurface soil processes control gas and
              moisture  storage and flux in a variety of ecosystems.           Questions
              about the amount of biogenic or other  trace gases emitted or consumed by
              ecosystems           will be directly measured by the equipment  requested for
              this facility.                 We believe that the mobile laboratory will  have
              a profound impact not only on the           interdisciplinary research but on
              teaching at Duke  University's new School of the Environment.          
              Students interested in ecology, biogeochemistry,  ecotoxicology, water
              resources, air quality,           forestry, and wetlands will benefit from the 
              opportunities of using the new technology in           research projects and
              coursework, analyzing data  from a wide range of ecosystems, and          
              acquiring experience in multidisciplinary field  experiments. These students
              include           undergraduate environmental science majors, young 
              graduate-level environmental management           students, mid-career
              professionals in Duke's  continuing education program, and future Ph.D         
               researchers.  Finally, we expect that the laboratory  will attract further
              funding from DOE and           EPA and open new sources for funding from
              private  industry research interests, the Forest           Service, the
              Agriculture Research Service of the  United States Department of Agriculture   
                     (USDA), and the National Science Foundation (NSF).
