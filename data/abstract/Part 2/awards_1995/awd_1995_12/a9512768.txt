              proposal requests funds in partial support of a symposium to be held on the
              campus of Indiana University, Bloomington from October 12 15, l995. The
              symposium is entitled  The Exploration of Sequence Space: Selecting Functional
              Molecules from Combinatorial Libraries.  This conference represents an
              acknowledgment of the fact that the interface between chemistry and biology has
              become increasingly integrated, and that scientists from both areas have begun
              to contribute to a new interdisciplinary field, combinatorial chemistry.
              Although combinatorial techniques are still in their infancy, they are
              nonetheless becoming increasingly important in exploring biological complexity
              and diversity, in understanding how chemical and biochemical self organization
              can occur, and in the design and discovery of new drugs. The meeting is the
              ninth in an annual series presented under the auspices of the Indiana Institute
              for Molecular and Cellular Biology at Indiana University. The objectives of the
              organizing committee are to bring together an international group o
