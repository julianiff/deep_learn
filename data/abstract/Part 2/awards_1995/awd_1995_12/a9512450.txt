Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Kirti N. Ghia  Univ. of Cincinnati  Proposal No. CTS-9512450    The
              Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics and the
              Department of Mechanical, Industrial and Nuclear Engineering at the University
              of Cincinnati will purchase Silicon Graphics high-performance graphics computer
              systems, which will be dedicated to support research activities of faculty in
              computational fluid dynamics and thermal sciences and the scholarly pursuits of
              graduate students.  The proposed instrumentation will be used in projects for
              studying fundamental flow physics of high-Reynolds number flow phenomena,
              namely general instabilities, transition, turbulence and chaos, using
              large-eddy and direct numerical simulations, as well as applied engineering
              problems such as pressure distortions on an engine fan plane on a subsonic
              inlet in presence of cross-wind.  It will also be used for interdisciplinary
              research involving problems in areas of fluid dynamics, flight mechanics and
              structural mechanics, such as maneuvering body and aeroelasticity problems.
