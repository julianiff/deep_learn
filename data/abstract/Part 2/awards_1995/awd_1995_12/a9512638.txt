Abstract    :
              95-12638  Malcinski  This award provides renewed support for the IU Axlotyl
              Colony, a collection of axlotyls at the Indiana University first established
              over 50 years ago.  The axlotyl is of particular interest in understanding
              aspects of animal development and certain mechanisms of sensory perception. 
              Certain mutant lines established by the Colony, such as those lacking
              pigmentation, permit experimental approaches that would otherwise be difficult.
               Each year the Colony provides approximately 80,000 axlotyls at various
              developmental stages for use in basic biological research and for education in
              primary and secondary schools and in colleges. The Colony also acts as a
              resource for information about a variety of methods and techniques for use of
              axlotyls in research, and publishes an annual newsletter that provides
              information about use of axlotyls in education as well as research.  ***
