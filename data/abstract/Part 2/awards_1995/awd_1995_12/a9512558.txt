Abstract    :
              9512558  This project will support planning activities pertaining to  the
              remodeling of research facilities in the building  housing the Center for
              Environmental Studies, Romberg  Tiburon Centers.  The Center for Environmental
              Studies is a  marine laboratory and field station on San Francisco Bay 
              operated by San Francisco State University.  The tasks to be  undertaken with
              the support are essential precursors to  remodeling and expanding laboratory
              facilities and enhancing  the research capabilities of the Center for
              Environmental  Studies.  The specific tasks are: 1) design a fire  suppression
              system for Building 36; 2) evaluate the  structural limitations and seismic
              safety of the building;  3) perform a geotechnical evaluation of slope
              stability and  drainage around the building; and 4) produce a detailed plan 
              for remodeling a portion of the building.  The research  facility is excellent
              and continues to accumulate an  admirable record of research productivity.
