Abstract    :
              Abstract  9512360  Gabitto      This proposal is for funds to develop a chemical
              vapor deposition facility to investigate the deposition of silicon thin films. 
              The objective of the proposed research is to build a diagnostic experimental
              apparatus to study plasma and photo CVD.  This proposal requests funds for a
              CVD reactor system.
