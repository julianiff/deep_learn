Abstract    :
              A major need exists in the training of minority students in the  sciences.
              Delaware State University, a public land-grant institution,  provides an ideal
              setting for initiating a significant change in the  number of appropriately
              prepared students. With the opening in 1995 of  a new Science Center (750 sq.
              ft. new laboratory space dedicated to  this training facility), we propose to
              develop programs that will train  students, both undergraduate and graduate, in
              the uses of molecular  biology techniques. We selected this area due to its
              broad application  in biological sciences and the anticipated benefit to
              minority students  in particular who have been traditionally under-represented
              in  molecular biology fields. The expertise of the faculty is well suited  to
              train students in the diverse uses of the techniques of molecular  biology.
              Although the listed investigators will be the initial users,  the facility will
              be open to all faculty in order to develop the  scientific expertise needed for
              the students to become competitive in  their career advancement. Obtaining this
              equipment and the  establishment of the training facility for students will
              also form the  basis for additional research grant moneys to enhance minority
              training  in the sciences and allow us to more aggressively pursue industrial 
              collaborations. The proposal specifically describes the needs and  rationale
              for the equipment and the broad principles of training that  will be used.
