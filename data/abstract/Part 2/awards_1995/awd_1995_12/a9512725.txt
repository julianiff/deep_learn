Abstract    :
              Sophisticated experimental techniques are used to measure  the electron-impact
              coherence parameters and magnetic sub-  level collision cross sections from
              excited Ba.  The details  at which these processes will be examined will
              provide the  first experimental information which will allow comparison  with
              available theoretical models.  In addition, the results  are needed for plasma
              modeling and plasma polarization  spectroscopy.
