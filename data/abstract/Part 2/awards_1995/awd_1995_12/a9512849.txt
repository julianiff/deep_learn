Abstract    :
              9512849  Danyluk    This award provides funds to permit Dr. Steven S. Danyluk, 
              Department of Mechanical Engineering, Georgia Institute of  Technology, to
              conduct with Dr. Soo Wohn Lee, Department of  Materials Science and
              Engineering, Sun Moon University,  Choongnam, Korea, a U.S.-Korea Joint Seminar
              on Tribology.  This  joint seminar will be held in Seoul, Korea, October 24-28,
              1995.   The participation of ten U.S. scientists/engineers will be  supported
              under this award.  The joint seminar will address  several topics of current
              concern in the field of tribology,  including wear modeling, lubricants,
              micro/nanotribology, surface  polishing, and subsurface damage generation.  In
              addition to  formal seminar sessions, the U.S. delegation plans to learn about 
              and evaluate the status of tribology research conducted in Korea  through
              discussions on research results at the seminar and  through site visits to
              evaluate tribology research capabilities  in Korea.  The U.S. participants will
              return to the U.S. by way  of Japan where they will participate in the
              International  Tribology Conference, Yokohama, from October 30 to November 2, 
              1995.  The field of tribology is of great importance in  manufacturing
              processes and in maintenance of machinery.  The PI  and his Korean collaborator
              are well qualified to organize and  conduct such a joint seminar, as both are
              well known scholars in  the related field of research.  This project is
              relevant to the  objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which
               seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and  Korean scientists
              and engineers through the exchange of  scientific information, ideas, skills,
              and techniques and through  collaboration on problems of mutual interest and
              benefit.  Korean  participation is supported by the Korea Science and
              Engineering  Foundation (KOSEF).  ***
