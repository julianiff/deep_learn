Abstract    :
              9512230  Huber    This proposal requests equipment to upgrade the existing
              Microfabrication laboratory facility at the university of Utah, which is
              operated by the College of Engineering and used by 5 departments.  The
              laboratory was created in 1977-8 by a grant from the HEDCO Foundation and UU
              institutional funds with further help from the DoE in the late 80's to improve
              the facilities and, more recently, from the Whitaker Foundation in the area of
              MEMs technology.  A variety of fabrication equipment is requested, such as a
              back-side' mask aligner,  flip-chip' aligner/bonder, furnaces, sputtering
              system, RTA  system, SPM, and general repair/modifications to existing process
              equipment.  The focus of the research is with sensors for medical applications
              which involves MEMS technology.  ***
