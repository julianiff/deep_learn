Abstract    :
              This is a request for a Liquid Scintillation Counter and a  Luminometer in
              support of research at the University of  South Florida.  The instrumentation
              will be used in studies  of  (1) nucleolar 2'-0-methyltrnasferase, (2)
              regulation of  assimilatory nitrate reductase, (3) expression of protein 
              kinase CB, and (4) molecular mechanisms regulating HMG-CoA  reductase gene
              expression.
