Abstract    :
                   A synapse is a functional contact between two nerve cells (neurons). 
              Chemical synapses utilize compounds called neurotransmitters, which are
              molecules that are released from the pre-synaptic cell to cross the tiny cleft
              between the cells, and so transmit signals from one neuron to another. This
              project utilizes synapses within the compound eye of a fruitfly, Drosophila, as
              a model system to identify proteins responsible for synaptic signaling in the
              visual pathway.  The Drosophila eye offers the clear advantage of its
              well-known genetics to exploit mutations in visual deficiencies that are easy
              to screen.  A novel combination of biochemistry and genetic techniques is used
              here to identify proteins that are important in the basic functions of
              neurotransmitter synthesis, packaging and release.  Identifying molecules
              involved in transmitter release and localization is a first step in
              understanding the complex series of events in signal transmission across a
              synapse.  Results will have impact not only on understanding synaptic
              mechanisms at the molecular level, but also on the genetic control of such
              mechanisms, on understanding visual function in the eye, and on processes in
              general cell biology involving cellular carrier vesicles.
