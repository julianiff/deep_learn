Abstract    :
              The analysis of motion is crucial in understanding the biomechanical basis  of
              fundamental physiological processes. Funds are requested to purchase a 
              high-speed imaging system that will allow the quantitative analysis of the 
              musculoskeletal system in both vertebrates and invertebrates. The criteria  for
              selection of a high-speed imaging system is followed by the direct  comparison
              of the top three systems currently available. The imaging system  chosen is the
              NAC HSV-SOOHSG. This video system can operate in low light  conditions, has
              dual camera capabilities, can film at rates up to 500  frames per second in
              standard VHS format for 43 minutes, and has direct  analog overlay. All these
              features are required for the proposed research.  Questions to be addressed
              include: (1) Are phylogenetic constraints  controlling the evolution of a novel
              feeding system in fish? (2) What is  the effect of temperature on skeletal
              muscle performance? (3) What role  does chemoreception play in the modulation
              of a stereotypical behavior in  lobsters? (4) Can biomechanical models be used
              to test the direction of  evolution in functional novelties? (5) Can kinematic
              analysis of wing  movement in flies be used to generate models of character
              evolution?          All behaviors that are the subject of this research occur
              at very  high frequency and are beyond the scope of study using conventional
              film or  video. Furthermore, these projects require the analysis of complex 
              movements in three dimensions, thus, the NAC HSV-500 best meets our needs.  A
              university contribution of 50% matching funds towards the purchase of the 
              video equipment has been provided.
