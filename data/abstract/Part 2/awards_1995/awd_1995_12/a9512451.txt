Abstract    :
              With partial support from the National Science Foundation, the Geography
              Department at Ohio State University will acquire a departmental research server
              (SGI Power Challenge L), 2 graphic workstations (SGI Indigo XZ) and related
              storage, peripherals and software which allow integration with existing
              equipment and make the system immediately useful for research by faculty and
              students.  The Geography Department specializes in the analysis of large data
              sets and focusses on flows of people and goods. The instruments will assist in
              research in visualization and exploratory data analysis and specific research
              projects include studies of transportation, migration, trade and information
              flows. The common tools developed in the course of this work will then be
              applied to related domains. These include research in time series of air
              passenger flows, simulation of major interruptions in transportation networks
              and models of issues related to regional economics and structural change.  
              Recently new large spatial flow data sets have become available and these
              involve flows of air passengers and urban traffic. However their utility is
              limited by the lack of optimal analytic techniques. New methods of data
              exploration and analysis have been proposed, developed and partially tested.
              However progress has been limited by the lack of computer hardware and
              software. This award will remove these constraints.
