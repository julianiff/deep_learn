Abstract    :
                                              9512131  Hsu                                   
              This is a two year award proposed by Dr. Pei-Feng Hsu,  Florida Institute of
              Technology and Professor Chih-Yang Wu,  National Cheng Kung University. The
              investigators  propose  to compare the integral, YIX and Monte Carlo solutions
              for a  rectangular and axisymmetric geometry.  Nonhomogeneous  distributions
              are the key element of this study.  The  objective of this project is to
              develop benchmark solutions  of radiative heat transfer. This proposal requests
              funds to  enable a U.S. Ph.D. graduate student to spend one semester  at the
              National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan to work with  Professor C.Y. Wu and
              for the  P.I.'s travel.  Benchmark  solutions for this system are important in
              view of  increasing trend toward high temperature manufacturing,  materials
              processing and energy production.  There is a  strong need for computation
              solutions taking into account  the effects of radiation on the total transport
              phenomena.  This project can advance a computation method for estimating 
              radiative transfer and provide opportunities for a U.S.  graduate student 
              international experience to research and  study at a university in Taiwan for
              one semester.
