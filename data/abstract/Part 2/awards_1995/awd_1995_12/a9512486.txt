Abstract    :
              From cells to populations, an organism's world is three dimensional and 
              dynamic.  Organismal analysis is on the verge of a revolution. Never in history
               has the equipment and computing power been sufficient to allow most 
              organismal biologists to move rapidly and quantitatively from one level  of
              organization to another. We are entering an era of Integration that  is simply
              unprecedented. To this end, we propose the creation of a  unique facility for
              organismal biologists which consists of equipment  that will allow acquisition,
              analysis, presentation and world-wide  exchange of three-dimensional (3D)
              structure, function and behavior. We  request four major, state-of-the-art
              pieces of equipment in the present  proposal: a 3D stereo-microscope
              ("real-time", large depth-of-field,  resolution-enhanced), 3D laser digitizer
              (capable of whole organismal  scans in 15 sec at 14,580 points/sec with 0.05 mm
              resolution), 3D  high-speed imager (capable of capturing 58,000 split images in
              5 sec  directly into memory) and a graphics computer cluster to process, 
              analyze and exchange the images and data. Projects greatly facilitated  or made
              possible include: the neural basis for behavior, biomechanics  of morphogensis,
              gut-chemical reactor modeling of digestion, 3D musculo  skeletal modeling of
              tetrapods to the earliest hominids, 3D dynamic  whole-body modeling of insect
              locomotion (which has provided biological  inspiration toward the design of
              autonomous legged robots), dinosaur  behavior and the fluid movements that
              affect organisms in the world's  oceans. The proposed infrastructure equipment
              will promote: the  utilization of approaches across disciplines, cross
              fertilization of  ideas, the creation of new fields of investigation, new
              approaches for  museum data collection and distribution, new collaborations
              with  engineers, computer scientists and the private sector, and novel 
              training of future organismal biologists.
