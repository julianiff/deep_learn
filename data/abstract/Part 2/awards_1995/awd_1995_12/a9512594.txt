Abstract    :
              9512594  Stubbs    Silicon technology has revolutionized astronomy by giving us 
              near perfect CCD light detectors that have very high quantum  efficiency and
              linearity compared to the old standard:  photographic plates.  However,
              individual CCD detectors are  very small compared to photographic plates and
              cover only a  small amount of sky so that most of the light gathered by  the
              telescope mirror is wasted.  This program will develop a  powerful wide-field
              CCD camera system for the Apache Point  Observatory (APO) 3.5 meter telescope
              that will be as large  as any yet built (67 million pixels), and will have
              state-of-  the-art read-outs and data processing capability.  This  versatile
              instrument will make possible a wide range of  astrophysical observing
              programs, particularly those that  attack pressing open questions in
              observational cosmology  such as: How fast is the universe expanding?; Will
              this  expansion continue forever?; what is the nature and  distribution of the
              dark matter that is the gravitationally  dominant component of the universe?;
              and What is the role of  particle physics in the birth and evolution of the
              universe?  ***
