Abstract    :
              Description:   This project supports a cooperative project by a U.S. scientist,
              Dr. Howard Pickering, Department of Metals Science and Engineering at the
              Pennsylvania State University, University Park, and Dr. B.G. Ateya, Department
              of Chemistry, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.  The two propose to study the
              problem of de-alloying in corrosive environments, to understand the prevailing
              mechanisms and to identify and characterize the various rate processes
              involved.  The work involves physical and mathematical modeling and
              experimental measurements.  Scope:  This project meets the objectives of the
              Division of International Programs:  it allows cooperation of two eminent
              scientists whose capabilities complement each other to do important scientific
              work; it allows for a foreign scientist in a developing country to validate his
              analytical work using experimental techniques and facilities not available in
              his country; and it helps understand the causes of one of the most common, and
              most  serious, problems that affect industry, and consumers of various
              commercial products that are made of alloys.  The P.I. is one of this country's
              most renowned scientists in the field of corrosion.  The Egyptian team has an
              excellent capability and exceptional record of publications in the field.
