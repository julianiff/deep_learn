Abstract    :
              9512284  Collins  This is an award to provide support for purchase of analytical
               equipment to be used in support of Clarkson University's  environmental
              engineering program.  The research equipment  obtained through this award will
              provide enhanced analytical  capability to five investigators who are
              conducting research on  long-term environmental effects on land to which
              sludges derived  from treatment of domestic wastewater are applied, dynamic
              fluid-  particle interactions on contaminant phase partitioning in  aqueous
              systems, incineration of Kraft process pulp and paper-  making sludges, thermal
              desorption for remediation of  "manufactured" gas plant sites, metabolism of
              trichlorethylene in  suspended growth bioreactors, and entrapment and
              dissolution of  nonaqueous phase liquids in heterogeneous media.    The
              proposal leading to this award was submitted in response to  the National
              Science Foundation's Instrumentation Development and  Acquisition Solicitation,
              NSF 94-156, Academic Research  Infrastructure Program.   Results of this award
              are expected to  improve the accessibility of modern research instrumentation
              for  use by this institution's faculty in conducting research on  important
              topics of environmental significance and in educating  students.  ***
