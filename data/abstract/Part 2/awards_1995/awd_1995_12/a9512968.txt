Abstract    :
              9512968  Farkas    This U.S.-Argentina collaborative research effort will  carry
              out computer simulation studies of the effects of  impurities in intermetallic
              alloys.  More specifically,  the effects of interstitial impurities in causing
              defects  will be simulated, first with hydrogen in intermetallics,  then with
              carbon in metals and intermetallics.  The  project will be led by Diana Farkas
              of Virginia  Polytechnic Institute and State University and Eduardo  Savino and
              J. Abriata of the Comision Nacional de Energia  Atomica (CNEA) in Argentina,
              building on an established  collaboration.    Savino works at CNEA Buenos
              Aires, where the Centro  Atomico Constituyentes has expertise in interatomic 
              potential development, whereas Abriata works at CNEA  Bariloche, contributing
              expertise in the area of hydrogen  effects in metals. Combined with the
              computer simulation  skills of the PI, the collaboration provides greater 
              potential than the individuals alone.  ****
