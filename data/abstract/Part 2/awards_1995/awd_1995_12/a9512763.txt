Abstract    :
              9512763  Bower    This  award  provides  three  years of  support  for  the 
              annual  Computation  and  Neural  Systems  meeting.  The  meeting  brings 
              together experimental and theoretical neurobiologists along  with  engineers, 
              computer scientists, cognitive scientists, physicists  and  mathematicians 
              interested in understanding  how  biological  neural systems compute. Equal
              emphasis is placed on experimental,  model-based  and  more  theoretical
              approaches  to  understanding  neurobiological   computation.  Speakers 
              include   both   senior  scientists  as  well  as young scientists.  This 
              meeting  is  an  important  venue for introducing new computational techniques 
              to  the   neuroscience  community  and  for  the  formation  of   new 
              collaboration  in  this  relatively new highly  interdisciplinary  field. This
              award provides travel costs of post-doctoral fellows,  graduate students and
              young faculty without grant support. It  is  the  creative  energy of new young
              scientists that will  generate  new theory in this field.
