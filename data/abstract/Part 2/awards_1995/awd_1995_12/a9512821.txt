Abstract    :
              9512821  Channell    This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research in marine geology and geophysics involves J.E.T. Channell at the
              University of Florida and Carlo Laj and Catherine Kissel at the Center for
              Radioactivity, French National Center for Scientific Research, Gif Sur Yvette,
              France.  The main objective of their research is to carry out rock magnetic
              studies of ten Late Pleistocene piston cores from the Labrador Sea and
              Northwest Atlantic. These magnetic studies will advance understanding of marine
              detrital events associated with ice sheet variability.  The project takes
              advantage of a unique French instrument a high resolution pass-through
              magnetometer and French expertise in global paleoclimatology.
