Abstract    :
              9512106  Pakes    Industries and firms evolve over time.  The object of the 
              proposed research is to model what firms and industries look like  at a
              particular point of time and how they change over time.   Firms and industries
              are affected by the characteristics of the  firms, the competitors and
              consumers.  The model deals with the  common existence of differentiated
              products.  Plant, product, and  detailed consumer demand data are integrated
              into the model,  which is applied to the automobile and consumer electronics 
              industry.  The dynamic model is an exploratory model, as the  model is
              complicated by the number of possible changes in the  firms and industries over
              time.  An attempt is made to make the  dynamic model more tractable, by
              determining what frameworks are  most relevant and concentrating on models with
              those features.    Investment strategies and the cost of entering and exiting
              an  industry are part of the dynamic model.  In principle, a general  dynamic
              model could be used to determine the future course of a  significant number of
              firms and industries from any initial  condition.  The proposed research will
              examine ways to generalize  the more specific model by used advanced
              computational methods.   If the research is successful, the model could be
              applied to a  much wider range of industries.
