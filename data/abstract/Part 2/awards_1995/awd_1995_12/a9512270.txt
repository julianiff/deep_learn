Abstract    :
              9512270  Nicol    The proposed project is to acquire a parallel graphics
              computer, a Silicon Graphics Onyx symmetric multiprocessor, that will support a
              wide variety of computational science research activities. This computer will
              provide a focal point for the initiation of new inter-disciplinary research in
              computational fluid dynamics, flow visualization, materials science,
              geophysics, and parallel algorithms for the simulation and analysis of complex
              discrete systems in addition to supporting existing research. This
              computational science environment will have the following joint attributes: (1)
              a parallel architecture of basic research interest to computer scientists, and
              (2) memory, computational power and sophisticated high-speed graphics
              capabilities sufficient to support the contemporary computational and data
              visualization requirements of physical scientists.  ***
