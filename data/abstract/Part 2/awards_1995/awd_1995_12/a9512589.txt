Abstract    :
                    9512589  De Long    A Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) 
              magnetometer will be acquired and installed as part of the  Materials
              Characterization Facility of the University of  Kentucky. The requested system
              is configured to accommodate a  variety of applications in materials science
              and engineering,  chemistry, and solid state physics. Immediate users of the 
              SQUID magnetometer will utilize it to investigate vortex  dynamics in
              anisotropic superconductors, thermodynamics of low-  dimensional conductors
              with charge-density or spin-density  waves, synthesis and properties of novel
              fullerene-based  compounds and polymers, and nanoscale magnetic particles for 
              use in catalysis. The principal investigator in this project  will develop
              novel, public domain software for the analysis of  nonlinear susceptibility
              data (higher harmonics) which the  current instrument does not have. This
              capability is  increasingly important for the study of high temperature 
              superconductors and of magnetic vortex dissipation. The SQUID  manufacturer has
              agreed to cooperate fully in this endeavor.  %%%  A unique strength of this
              research is the software development  which will be made available to the
              general community. The data  analysis package will enable a large number of
              current SQUID  magnetometer users to easily add this important capability 
              without having to build or buy whole systems.  ***
