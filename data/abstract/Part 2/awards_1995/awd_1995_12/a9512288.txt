Abstract    :
              9512288  Mora         This award provides one-half the funding required for the 
              acquisition of an isotope ratio gas source mass spectrometer system  to be
              installed and operated in the Department of Geological  Sciences at the
              University of Tennessee-Knoxville.  The University  of Tennessee is committed
              to providing the remaining funds  necessary for the acquisition.  The equipment
              will be used  primarily in the research and teaching activities of the
              principal  investigator and colleagues who require its analytical capabilities 
              in graduate training and in research projects including isotopic  studies of
              soil carbonates and clays to interpret paleoclimatic  changes, biochemical
              studies of the Arctic marine environment and  groundwater research.  ***
