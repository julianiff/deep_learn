Abstract    :
              ***  9512739  Li    This proposal requests funds to support a planning visit to 
              China on ecological planning for sustainable development of  urban ecosystems.
              The topic is an important concern for both  the U.S. and China which face rapid
              economic growth and  urbanization.  The need for a comprehensive ecological 
              analysis and modeling approach that supports sustainable  development of urban
              and regional systems is universal;  assuming productive relationships are
              established though  this project, the potential is great for both countries to 
              benefit.    The visit of the US PI, Dr. Bai-Lian Li of the Center for 
              Biosystems Modeling at Texas A&M University to the  Department of System
              Ecology, Research Center for Eco  Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of
              Sciences, will  provide the opportunity for two centers with acknowledged 
              expertise in urban ecology and systems modeling to define a  research program. 
              China has large data bases collected over  a ten year period that cover
              environmental and socioeconomic  issues of significance for the research topic
              proposed.  Texas A&M's Center for Biosystems Modeling has been working  on a
              number of new modeling approaches such as neuro-fuzzy  based ecological risk
              assessment which will be further  refined through the cooperative project
              envisioned using the  large data bases available in China.  ***
