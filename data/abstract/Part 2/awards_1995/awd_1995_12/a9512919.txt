Abstract    :
              9512919  Hagedorn    George Hagedorn of VA Polytechnic Institute, a mathematical
               physicist, will team up with two Argentineans from the  Universidad Nacional
              de Cordoba, Guido Raggio in chemical  physics and Roberto Fernandez in
              statistical mechanics, to  study and improve existing algorithms used for
              computing non  adiabatic effects in certain quantum-mechanical systems.  They
              will also apply mathematical and numerical approaches  to the study of these
              same phenomena.  The work will analyze  surface-hopping techniques in a study
              centered on collisions  and other interactions between two systems of widely 
              different mass.  The investigators will try to supply a  rigorous mathematical
              basis for computational techniques  used in these studies, and will also search
              for new or  improved algorithms related to the surface-hopping  techniques.   
              The problems addressed are important conceptual ones in    theoretical physics.
               Results may come in the theory, the    development of techniques, and in the
              understanding of the    systems studied. The collaboration is a new one for the
                 three researchers and will include a graduate student from    VA
              Polytechnic.    ****
