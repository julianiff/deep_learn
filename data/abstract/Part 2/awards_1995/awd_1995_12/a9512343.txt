Abstract    :
              9512343  Jaeger    This proposal requests equipment to upgrade the research
              equipment that directly supports the packaging research activities of the
              Alabama Microelectronics Science and Technology Center (AMSTC).  The AMSTC
              concentrates on monolithic integrated circuits with an electronic packaging
              focus and emphasis in the AMSTC facility is the multichip module (MCM) assembly
              capability to test and package high pin-out MCMs which operated over an
              extended temperature range.  ***
