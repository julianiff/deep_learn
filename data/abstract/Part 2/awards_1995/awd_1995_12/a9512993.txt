Abstract    :
              Three ABI 377 automated DNA sequencers are requested to  fulfill the needs for
              DNA sequencing and genescan analyses  at the basic sciences of the Johns
              Hopkins School of  Medicine.  The approximately 100 basic science laboratories 
              at this institution are pursuing a wide range of research  topics which depend
              heavily on these techniques.   The range  of ongoing projects span from
              developmental, cell and  molecular biology, biochemistry and neurobiology.  The
               proposed instruments would be managed by our non-profit DNA  core facility,
              experienced in a variety of DNA analysis  services, and would be available to
              the entire basic science  community at cost.  The Dean of the School of
              Medicine has  committed co-funding for this project.
