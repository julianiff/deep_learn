Abstract    :
              9512427  Coveney      This grant, as part of the Academic Research
              Infrastructure(ARI)  program, provides $139,000 as partial support of the costs
               acquiring an inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-  MS) and
              peripheral supplies for the Department of Geosciences at  the University of
              Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC).  This instrument  will support research and
              teaching within several academic  departments at  and will permit the
              acquisition of high-quality  spectrographic data for more than 60 chemical
              elements of  interest, including all major components of silicate rocks and 
              soils and minor and trace constituents of particular concern to  the geological
              and environmental sciences as well as to the  material and chemical sciences.
              The ICP-MS will be the only  spectrographic equipment available on the UMKC
              campus and will be  used in numerous investigations including:  (1) the
              distributions  of metals in black shales in the Midwest, (2) groundwater 
              contamination from naturally metal-rich shales in the Midwest,  (3) the geology
              of hazardous waste sites, (4) deterioration of  building stones by
              environmental agents, (5) paleoclimates  related to Quaternary basins and
              pluvial lakes in the Pacific  Northwest, (6) the genesis of iron sulfide
              minerals, (7) the  origins of uniquely bedded Ni-Mo deposits in Cambrian shales
              from  China, (8) lead-zinc mineralization in country rocks of the  Midwest, (9)
              impurities held by large organic molecules being  imaged by atomic force
              microscopy and (10) compositions of bones  and teeth.  Eight faculty, drawn
              from five academic departments,  have needs for this equipment for research and
              teaching.  The  establishment of this ICP-MS laboratory at UMKC will facilitate
               research by faculty while, at the same time, permitting UMKC  students to
              become proficient in a modern spectrometric  technique. The lab will be an
              essential resource for the training  of M.S. students enrolled in the Urban
              Environmental Geology  program at UMKC, as well as for students from  the
              UMKC's  innovative interdisciplinary Ph.D. program, for graduate students  from
              the other sciences at UMKC, and for undergraduates from the  physical and
              environmental sciences.      ***
