Abstract    :
              The use of stable isotopes as tracers in environmental, climatic  and
              paleoclimatic research continues to expand.  In particular, the  stable
              isotopes of oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen in carbonates and  water serve as
              "work-horse" tracers of meteorologic, climatic,  oceanographic, geologic, and
              biologic processes in the natural  environment.  Many new paleoclimatic and
              monitoring studies now  require the analysis of larger numbers of samples
              because of the  need of more detailed climatic and environmental
              reconstructions.   There is a clear demand, therefore, for more automated
              Isotope  Ratio Mass Spectrometry (IRMS) facilities that are capable of 
              analyzing the greater sample load of new research projects.  This  award
              supports the purchase of IRMS equipment at the State  University of New York at
              Albany.  This equipment will form the  centerpiece of the university's
              multi-functional isotope laboratory  within the new Environmental
              Geochemistry-Global Change research  and teaching initiative.***
