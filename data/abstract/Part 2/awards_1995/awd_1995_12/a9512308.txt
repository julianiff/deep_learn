Abstract    :
                  9512308  Cadieu    A pulsed laser deposition (PLD) system and ancillary thin
              film  characterization  equipment will be acquired and used to  fabricate and
              examine magnetic and optical films. Three  research programs will make use of
              the PLD facility. One  program aims at developing metallic magnetic films that
              exhibit  highly specific textures and optimal magnetic properties. As  part of
              this effort, textured films of rare earth transition  metals and of ferrites
              will be fabricated and their magnetic  properties will be examined. A second
              program will utilize the  PLD facility to explore new approaches to
              photoinduced gradient  index formation, tailoring sol-gel glasses, and
              photodeposition  in microporous glass.  A third program evolves around the 
              structural and compositional characterization of the PLD-grown  films. In this
              effort, the defect and stacking fault densities  of the laser deposited
              magnetic films will be examined by  transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and
              their stoichiometry  will be probed by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). 
              %%%  Pulsed laser ablation allows for the deposition of a wide range  of
              dissimilar materials with exceptional intrinsic properties.  The pulsed layer
              deposition system will be utilized to  synthesize new types of super magnet
              systems that are important  for microwave device development. It will also be
              utilized for  photodeposition and photopatterning processing with  applications
              in optical waveguides and diffractive optics. The  instrumentation will benefit
               researchers from several  departments in a predominantly undergraduate
              institution.  ***
