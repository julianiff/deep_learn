Abstract    :
                  9512396  Kash    A shared equipment facility will be established in support
              of  research programs in optical materials and devices. There are  five major
              components to the facility: an ultraviolet  photolithography laboratory; a
              device processing laboratory  consisting of a reactive ion etcher, thermal
              evaporator, and  sputtering system; a materials preparation section with tools 
              for sawing and polishing; a display cell fabrication  laboratory; and a device
              and materials characterization  laboratory for electrical and thermal
              measurements. Three core  programs in optical materials share the
              infrastructure needs  and research interests. One program will use the facility
              for  fabrication and electrical characterization of semiconductor  structures
              of reduced dimensionality  with applications in  linear and nonlinear optics. A
              second program studies organic  and polymeric nonlinear optical materials, and
              requires the  facility for characterization of the glass transition in  optical
              polymers as well as for fabrication of devices and  substrates. A third program
              emphasizes optical studies of  liquid crystals and complex fluids, and requires
              the display  fabrication and characterization facilities. The  instrumentation
              will be housed in central facilities and will  be available to other
              researchers both on-campus and at  collaborating institutions.  %%%  The shared
              equipment facility will benefit three major programs  which form the core of an
              optical materials concentration  within the department. These programs,
              studying semiconductor  materials of reduced dimensionality, liquid crystals,
              and  polymeric materials,  encompass materials with important  applications in
              linear and nonlinear optical devices.  ***
