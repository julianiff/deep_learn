Abstract    :
              9512296  Lewandowski   This request is for equipment and instrumentation that
              will be used to assemble an Advanced Materials Deformation and Manufacturing
              Process Simulator (AMDMPS).     The broad range of manufacturing processes that
              can be performed with the AMDMPS facility will enable the response of advanced
              materials to realistic manufacturing conditions to be determined with great
              accuracy.  Such experimental data are required as inputs into advanced process
              control models.  In addition to generating constitutive equations capable of
              predicting the deformation behavior of a material, the AMDMPS facility will
              serve as the focal point of a Rapid Prototyping Laboratory where new techniques
              in computer integrated manufacturing and process automation will be
              investigated.
