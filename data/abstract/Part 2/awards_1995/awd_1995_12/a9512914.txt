Abstract    :
              9512914  Brasseur    This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative
              research in atmospheric sciences between researchers at Pennsylvania State
              University and at the Center for Acoustics, Ecole Centrale de Lyon, France. 
              The projects involves graduate students and researchers at both institutions
              and is led by James G. Brasseur at Penn State and Philippe Blanc-Benon in
              France.  The investigators propose to study acoustic propagation using
              realistic models of atmospheric boundary layer turbulence for short and
              long-range propagation.  The research is directed at applications where rapid
              predictions of spatial distribution and local intensities of sound are needed. 
              The project takes advantage of the combined expertise of U.S. and French
              researchers in turbulence, atmospheric dynamics and acoustics.  The topic is
              important to studies of atmospheric and oceanic turbulence and radiowave and
              light propagation.
