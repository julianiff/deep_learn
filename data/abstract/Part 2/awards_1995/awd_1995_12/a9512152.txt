Abstract    :
              Abstract  Zhao  9512152      This proposal is for the development and testing of
              an inductively-coupled plasma (ICP) etching and deposition system for advanced
              material and device processing.  A class-100 clean room will be used in which
              etching of stable semiconductors such as 6H-SiC and GaN among others will be
              carried out.  A major goal of this research is to provide feedback and
              suggestions to the industrial partner regarding possible improved design for
              final commercialization of the ICP system.  Efforts will include the setting up
              of a prototype ICP system and evaluate its etching capabilities and its
              comparison with other available systems such as RIE and ECR.
