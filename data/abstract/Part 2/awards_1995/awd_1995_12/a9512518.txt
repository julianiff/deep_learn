Abstract    :
              With matching funds from the National Science Foundation and the University of
              Maryland, Dr. Frederick Suppe will purchase a Silicone Graphic UNIX scientific
              workstation. This will permit him to analyze data collected during a year-long
              study of Princeton University's Structural Geology group. Dr. Suppe is an
              historian of science  and wishes to understand how the process of scientific
              discovery works. He has noted that today much research does not proceed in a
              standard theory driven context but rather proceeds through the construction of
              models which derive from the computer analysis of very large masses of data.
              Data are reduced, refined and manipulated by further modeling. The end-products
              are increasingly in the form of models and not theories. Dr. Suppe notes that
              the philosophy of science has paid relatively little attention to such
              contemporary modeling practices.  Since 1991 Dr. Suppe has been studying
              computationally intensive science and how massive data sets are changing the
              way science is done. He has worked as a participant, observing a Princeton
              structural geology group which utilizes extremely large data sets and search
              for patterns using computer visualization techniques. During the period of
              study, the group refuted the prevailing models of Venus by showing that the
              planet is geologically active today. In the course of this work, Dr. Suppe has
              amassed a large set of electronic data and with the NSF provided equipment he
              will trace the discovery process using them. This work is important because it
              will shed new light on the research process.
