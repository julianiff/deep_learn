Abstract    :
              9512894  Pullin    This U.S.-Argentina collaborative research between Jorge 
              Pullin of Penn State University and Reinaldo Gleiser of  Universidad Nacional
              de Cordoba in Argentina addresses the  use of higher order perturbation theory
              in the analysis of  the collision of two black holes. They will work with 
              Richard Price, known for his work on higher order  perturbation theory.  The
              general problem of the coalescence  of binary star systems and black hole
              binaries for  prediction of gravitational wave forms is the subject of an  NSF
              Grand Challenge.    Pullin is a young PhD who has published several works on 
              black holes and gravitation.  Most work to date in this area  has depended on
              supercomputer simulations which are hard to  check theoretically.  The proposed
              work, although  approximate, can serve as a check on other methods.  It 
              extends earlier first order calculations to obtain the  accuracy needed for
              prediction.  ***
