Abstract    :
              With partial support from the National Science Foundation, the SUNY Albany
              Center for Social and Demographic analysis will complete the installation of a
              UNIX network. Major items include a module upgrade for a Sun Sparcstation 20 to
              a model 514 MP, and 4 SunSparcstation 20 Model 1 with 60 MHz SuperSparc
              processor with SuperCashe SX 24-bit Color Accelerated graphics imaging
              workstations. The instrumentation will provide an interdisciplinary group of
              social science researchers with a computing infrastructure suitable for
              projects that require the manipulation and analysis of extremely large data
              files. It will also provide access to state of the art statistical analysis
              procedures that are memory intensive. Researchers involved include
              anthropologists, economists, geographers and regional planners, psychologists,
              sociologists and public health specialists.  The researchers will address a
              number of topics. These include, for example, a study of segregation and
              neighborhood change between 1970 and 1990 which will examine trends in
              metropolitan racial and ethnic segregation, multiethnic patterning and the
              spatial concentration of poverty and wealth. Other projects will focus on
              family patterns of southern migrants to northern cities, the relationship
              between specific aspects of nutrition and mortality, and adolescent behavior
              and parent-teen communication. The center involves many students in its
              research and the equipment provided will serve an important educational as well
              as research function.
