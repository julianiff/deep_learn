Abstract    :
              The relationships between brain cell metabolism and functional  activity,
              studies of amino-acid metabolism and the effects of  pharmacological agents
              basic studies of glucose metabolism and  mechanisms of glucose homeostasis. New
              NMR-based functional brain  imaging methods for assessing neuronal activation
              in response to  specific cognitive and sensory stimuli. Susceptibility contrast
              effects  from alterations in blood oxygenation in the microvasculature that can
               be used to detect regional brain activation. This application is unique  in
              that it involves the combined efforts of scientists who are leaders  in
              spectroscopic studies of metabolism and physiology, in imaging of  brain
              functional activity and other aspects of MR imaging science, as  well as
              leading neuroscientists. A high degree of synergy will occur  between the
              spectroscopic and imaging studies, and the resource will be  the primary system
              for advanced NMR applications serving an experienced  community of users.
