Abstract    :
              With partial support from the National Science Foundation Dr. Daniel Kersten
              will purchase an instrumentation system which will permit him to study how
              individuals use visual clues to locate the position of objects. The
              instrumentation consists of: 1. a 3D Graphics computer to synthesize
              high-quality images and animations in which the clues to depth and shape are
              precisely controlled; 2. a robot arm to position, orient and move real target
              objects; 3. an infrared tracking device for precise measurement of hand and
              other motor movements. The robot arm will position real objects to coincide
              with the virtual target objects created by the computer whose screen is seen
              through a mirror. Reach and grasp movements of the hand and fingers will be
              monitored with the infrared motion measurement system.   Although human beings
              and other primates have the remarkable ability to use vision to program and
              control skilled movements directed at objects in their environment, scientists
              do not understand how individuals process multiple clues such as size, shading
              and shadows to arrive at this knowledge. With the equipment provided, Dr.
              Kersten will be able to vary these clues and change, for example the size and
              position of shadows, and determine how the subject's perception varies
              accordingly. The equipment will also be used to train students and thus serve
              an educational as well as research function.
