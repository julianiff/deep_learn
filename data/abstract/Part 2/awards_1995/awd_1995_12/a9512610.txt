Abstract    :
              This project will allow the Oregon Institute of Marine  Biology (OIMB) to
              improve its local area computer network  and enhance its link to the University
              of Oregon campus  network. The research program at OIMB has expanded 
              considerably in the past five years and has doubled the  number of faculty
              positions and corresponding support staff.  Incremental changes have been made
              to the local area  network, but such piecemeal improvements have not been able 
              to keep up with current technological developments. By  improving the computer
              network and software packages the  facility will provide all visiting and
              resident researchers  with access to the Internet, utilizing appropriate
              graphical  user interfaces, and will enhance our ability to store,  manipulate
              and analyze data. The improvements will also  allow OIMB to share locally
              significant databases with the  larger scientific community via an OIMB Mosaic
              Homepage on  the World Wide Web.  This project fits well with the  philosophy
              of advancing computing and communications  capabilities of field research
              facilities.  It will place  OIMB well within the framework of current
              technology.
