Abstract    :
              A unique type of apparatus will be developed jointly by the  University of
              Michigan and Notre Dame University that will  permit studies of low-energy
              nuclear reactions key to better  understanding the production of energy and
              synthesis of the  elements in astrophysical processes.  The latter include 
              BigBang nucleosynthesis and the production of energy and  heavy elements in
              stars and supernovae (exploding stars).  Improved nuclear measurements will
              help clarify some of the  outstanding mysteries that exist in astrophysics. 
              The  proposed apparatus will consist of a small but highintensity 
              electrostatic ion accelerator coupled to a specially  designed, high-efficiency
              magnetic detection device.  The  latter will consist of two large
              superconducting magnets  which will be designed and built in the U.S. as a 
              collaborative effort with a U.S. industrial partner. The  apparatus proposed
              will be part of a Midwest low-energy  nuclear accelerator facility located at
              the University of  Notre Dame.  A unique feature of the facility will be the 
              production of relatively intense, short-lived unstable  nuclear beams for the
              study of reactions related to  explosive nucleosynthesis.  The new apparatus
              will also be  available for new types of applied research in atomic  physics,
              biophysics and materials science.  It will serve a  dozen or more universities
              and colleges in the immediate  area with extensive participation by
              undergraduates,  graduate students, and faculty from those institutions (U. 
              Michigan, U. Notre Dame, Oberlin College, Ohio State U., U.  Indiana-So. Bend,
              U.W. Kentucky, Hope College, MSU, U.  Illinois,...).
