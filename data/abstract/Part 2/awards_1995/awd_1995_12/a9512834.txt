Abstract    :
              9512834  Faust    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research in polymers between Rudolf Faust at the University of Massachusetts in
              Lowell and Jean-Pierre Vairon at the University Pierre and Marie Curie, Paris,
              France.  The objective of their research is to enable the synthesis of polymers
              with well-controlled structures by generating mechanistic understaning and
              kinetic information of living cationic polymers. The U.S. investigator brings
              to this collaboration expertise in polymer synthesis.  This is complemented by
              French expertise in ionic polymerization.  The collaboration also takes
              advantage of specialized equipment developed by the French group to study the
              kinetics of polymerization.
