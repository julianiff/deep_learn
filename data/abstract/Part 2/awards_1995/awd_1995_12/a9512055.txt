Abstract    :
              9512055  Smith    This award supports the preparation and publication of four 
              issues of China Exchange News (CEN) over a two year period.  CEN is a quarterly
              publication which provides information on  scholarly developments in China,
              research access and  opportunities for US researchers, and general information
              on  science and education policies and institutions.  CEN has  been published
              since 1972, and serves a wide audience of  readers, many of whom are not
              familiar with China but who  wish to pursue research collaboration in China.   
              Despite the proliferation of contacts between the US and  Chinese scientific
              communities, the development of initial  contacts, research plans, and joint
              projects is still a  daunting task for scientists who have not worked
              previously  with Chinese colleagues.  CEN is noted for serving  a vital 
              function for the US scientific community and for performing  an invaluable
              service in fostering international research.
