Abstract    :
                       The Kansas Ecolgical Reserves (KER) includes a wide  variety of managed
              natural and  experimental areas in the tallgrass prairie-eastern  deciduous
              forest ecotone.  Recently ecological  research at KER has grown to include a
              diverse assemblage of  individual and collaborative  research efforts with a
              trend toward developing long-term  projects and experimentally manipulated 
              ecosystems, both terrestrial and aquatic.  Development was  assisted by funds
              from institutional,  private, and federal sources.  This project will enhance 
              research facilities in three ways: (1) to  install a surveyed field grid for
              georeferencing study sites  and field research facilities throughout  KER, (2)
              to expand the database management system and GIS by  adding key equipment, such
              as a  UNIX workstation, software, etc., and by establishing a set  of core map
              coverages, and (3) construction  of a lath house that will be used for plant
              population and  aquatic studies.  The enhancement will  supportvongoing
              research programs, make the field station  more attractive for outside
              investigators,  and foster research aimed at larger spatial and temporal 
              scales.
