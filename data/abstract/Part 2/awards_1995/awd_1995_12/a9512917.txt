Abstract    :
              9512917  Glander  This award provides renewed support for maintenance of a
              collection of prosimian primates maintained at the Duke University Primate
              Center.  These animals are of particular interest for research in animal
              behavior and in evolutionary biology.  The collection includes a number of rare
              and endangered species, including aye-ayes and sifakas, most of which are now
              only found in the wild in Madagascar.  The Duke Primate Center was established
              in 1966 with the help of an NSF award.  Since then, the number and species
              diversity of prosimians represented in the collection has grown from the
              initial 80 individuals to approximately 500 individuals representing
              approximately 17 species of lemurs and loris.  Approximately 85% of the animals
              were bred at the Center.  Funding provided through this award helps make these
              animals available for study by investigators from other institutions.  Although
              it does not support them directly, this award facilitates a vigorous program of
               educational and conservation activities carried out by the Center.   ***
