Abstract    :
                This ARI award provides funds for the acquisition of high-capacity, on-line
              data storage and computer visualization systems for improved access to deep
              submergence data collected by the National Deep Submergence Facility at WHOI
              and for multibeam sonar and marine seismic data obtained by other groups within
              the Institution.  The goal for this project is to modernize their data
              retrieval and archiving capabilities and to markedly improve the ability of
              investigators and educators both within the Institution, and in the US academic
              community to access these datasets for processing, analysis and interpretation,
              and educational use by students and teachers. To achieve this goal, the PIs
              request funds to acquire a Metrum Super VHS mass storage system, and associated
              peripherals, to provide (1 terabyte of on-line data storage for deep
              submergence, Sea Beam and marine seismic data collected by several different
              groups within WHOI.  They also are requesting a number of I/O devices will
              significantly improve access to deep submergence and geophysical data both
              locally and via the Internet.
