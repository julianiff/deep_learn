Abstract    :
              9512795  Chollet    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research in plant biochemistry and physiology between Raymond Chollet at the
              University of Nebraska and Jean Vidal at the Plant Biotechnology Institute of
              the University of Paris, Orsay campus.  The investigators propose to continue
              their collaborative studies on signaling pathways for the regulation of C4
              photosynthesis.  They propose to investigate the role of a key enzyme -
              phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) in the protoplasts of C4 and
              Crassulacean-acid-metabolisim (CAM) plants.  The French investigator provides
              expertise in cell biology while the U.S. investigator provides expertise in
              protein kinases.
