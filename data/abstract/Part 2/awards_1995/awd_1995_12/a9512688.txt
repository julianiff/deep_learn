Abstract    :
              Laser cooling and trapping experiments with ultracold  samples of Li atoms are
              undertaken to study 1) quantum  statistical effects in a weakly interacting,
              degenerate gas  and 2) photoassociation into bound molecular states.  Li is 
              well suited to these studies since it possesses stable  isotopes obeying both
              Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac  statistics.
