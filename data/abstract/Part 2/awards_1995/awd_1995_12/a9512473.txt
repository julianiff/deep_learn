Abstract    :
                                                      This award from the Academic Research
              Infrastructure Program will help the Department of  Chemistry at University of
              Mississippi acquire a SGI Power Challenge L with four R8000  processors and
              128MB of memory.  The research activity to be supported includes high level  ab
              initio and density functional calculations on a variety of molecules and
              reaction surfaces and  rotational spectral modeling and fitting of weakly bound
              molecules.    A workstation network of fast, modern computer workstations is a
              new way to satisfy the  computing needs of chemistry departments.  Such a
              "computer network" also serves as a  development environment for new
              theoretical codes and algorithms, provides state-of-the-art  graphics and
              visualization facilities.
