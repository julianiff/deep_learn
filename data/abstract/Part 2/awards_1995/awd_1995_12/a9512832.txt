Abstract    :
              9512832  Lee       Research will be carried out in accelerator physics.  The
              work focuses on beam dynamics in circular accelerators  with emphasis on the
              effects of non-linear guide elements  and on coherent instabilities associated
              with high beam  intensities.  The Indiana University Cyclotron Facility  (IUCF)
              will be used for this research.  It provides a  particle beam which is very
              well defined in terms of  position in phase space and tracking of individual
              beam  packets can be done for thousands of turns.  Studies will  also be
              carried out in high-energy electron-proton cooling  and in beam emittance
              growth and halo development.  In  addition, the high intensity polarized beam
              will be used in  polarized-beam transport studies, with emphasis on avoidance 
              of depolarization resonances.  Benefits of the research will  extend from
              improved performance at IUCF for nuclear physics  experiments to high
              performance in future colliders, neutron  spallation sources, and synchrotron
              light sources.  Research  in the above areas will advance our understanding of
              the  performance and limitations of high intensity circular  particle
              accelerators.  These are high priority topics in  accelerator physics. 
              Education of graduate students and  postdocs is integral to this activity.  ***
