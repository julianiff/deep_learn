Abstract    :
                9512282  Rocca    This research proposes to develop a unique table-top soft
              X-ray  laser for photochemistry and photophysics studies. This  innovative
              instrument is made feasible by a recent  demonstration by the researchers of
              large soft X-ray  amplification in the plasma created by a compact electrical 
              discharge. This breakthrough offers the opportunity for the  development of a
              new type of soft X-ray laser of significantly  reduced size and increased
              simplicity that can operate  repetitively. The laser will provide high peak
              power beams  (circa 10 microjoules per nanosecond pulse) of high energy 
              photons (26.5 electron volts) that will permit extension of  laser
              photochemistry and photophysics studies of molecules,  clusters, and surfaces
              to the soft X-ray region.  %%%  The development of this innovative soft X-ray
              laser will  benefit numerous applications and open new areas of research. 
              These applications include the diagnostics of material  surfaces, the testing
              of optical coatings and soft X-ray  optics, diagnostic of dense plasmas and of
              nuclear detector  materials, and high resolution imaging. The compact soft
              X-ray  laser source can also impact basic studies in atomic physics  and
              nonlinear optics.  ***
