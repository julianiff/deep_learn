Abstract    :
              With partial National Science Foundation support, the University of Utah will
              purchase an ABI 3377 automated DNA sequencer, an Perkin-Elmer 9600 PCR machine
              and a Sun SPARCstatioon 20. This equipment will be shared by four evolutionary
              geneticists. Acquisition of this equipment will greatly increase the speed and
              fidelity of DNA sequencing and nuclear genotyping and enable the scientists to
              remain at the cutting edge of human evolutionary genetic research.  Initially,
              the equipment will be used in at least 13 major research projects. These
              include research on the evolutionary genetics of south Indian caste
              populations, Micronesian populations, the Altai Siberian population, Native
              American populations and African and African-American populations. To provide a
              long-term temporal perspective, ancient DNA samples from the U.S. Southwest,
              the Great Basin region, North China, the circum-Arctic, and Austro-Hungary will
              be analyzed. The role of founder effect in the evolution of von Willebrand
              disease will be investigated. Mutation rates in mitochondrial DNA will be
              measured by comparing large-scale sequencing results with `DNA chip`
              technology. Worldwide genetic variation will be analyzed to test hypotheses
              regarding the origins of modern Homo sapiens.   In addition to aiding in
              research, this equipment will help students and postdoctoral fellows to learn
              the most modern molecular methods in the course of their training in
              evolutionary genetics. Each of the researchers' laboratories has a number of
              students and fellows.
