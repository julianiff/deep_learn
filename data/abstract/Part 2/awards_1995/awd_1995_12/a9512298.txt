Abstract    :
              9512298  Delfyett    This proposal request state-of-the-art material and device
              processing equipment for a new clean-room located in a research facility
              dedicated to optical science and engineering at the University of central
              Florida.  The specific equipment is for (1) the deposition of mental al films
              and (2) the etching of waveguide and mesa structures in semiconductor
              substrates.  An important part of the research and education program is to
              fabricate the photonic devices and to perform detailed device modeling and
              characterization.  ***
