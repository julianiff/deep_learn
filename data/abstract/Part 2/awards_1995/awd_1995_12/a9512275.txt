Abstract    :
              9512275  Plummer    A low energy, high resolution photoemission beam line will
              be  developed at the synchrotron at the Center for Advanced  Microstructures
              and Devices (CAMD) of Louisiana State University.  This is a joint effort of
              scientists and educators from the  University of Michigan, the University of
              Nebraska, the  University of Texas, Southern University, the University of 
              Tennessee, and Louisiana State University.  The high momentum and  energy
              resolution will be utilized to uncover new physical and  chemical phenomena at
              the surface or in thin films, such as the  existence of charge density wave
              distortions at the surface,  Fermi surface instabilities, and metal-nonmetal
              transitions in  thin films.  The low photon energy will be used to investigate 
              the development of collective excitations in thin films and to  probe the bulk
              properties of correlated electron systems  containing transition elements or
              rare earths.  The high momentum  resolution will facilitate dispersion
              measurements for molecular  solids and reconstructed semiconductor surfaces. 
              The low photon  energy variable wavelength capabilities are essential for 
              investigating molecular photochemical processes.  %%%  Synchrotron-based
              angle-resolved photoemission is the only  experimental technique capable of
              directly mapping the energy  bands of a solid over an extended energy range. 
              The challenge  and the opportunity for the future is to push the energy 
              resolution of angle-resolved photoemission to limits where the  energies
              involved are significantly less than thermal energies.  The experience of this
              group of researchers in the design of  synchrotron radiation analysis
              instrumentation can lead to  significant improvements over existing
              high-resolution beam  lines.  ***
