Abstract    :
                      The Edmund Niles Huyck Preserve and Biological Research  Station has
              supported research and education in biological  sciences since 1937.  Since
              then more than 300 scientists  have produced over 250 published papers,
              dissertations, and  theses based on work on the Preserve.  From 1988 to 1995,
              40  Ph.D. level scientists and 32 graduate students and 275  teachers to
              practice hands-on environmental education.  The  Preserve's laboratory building
              can no longer accommodate the  researchers and students utilizing its
              resources.  The Huyck  Preserve's five year development plan calls for a three 
              phased effort to upgrade its facilities and this proposal  represents Phase 1. 
              The Preserve will construct and  addition to its laboratory building that will
              more than  double office, laboratory and teaching space.  The addition  will
              also include a library and collection room.  Additional  funds will come from
              Huyck Preserve operating budget, the  Huyck Foundation, previous researchers. 
              Also the Preserve  will finish the buildings' interior walls and doors. 
              Finally a data manager will help the Preserve develop GIS  capability using the
              software and hardware also purchased to  match this request.
