Abstract    :
              9512805  Schwartz  Two related projects will be carried out to address problems 
              raised by "traditional" employment of Ph.D. physicists.  The  first is a local
              pilot program to be carried out at City  University of New York.  This program
              consists of 3 parts: 1) a  number of supplemental mini-courses to the
              traditional Ph.D.  program in the areas of communication skills, computational 
              skills and the business aspects of high technology; 2) a regular  seminar
              series on traditional and non-traditional careers; and,  3) workshops on job
              and career seeking skills for graduate  students in the Ph.D. program.  The
              proposed program at CUNY will  be developed with the input and cooperation of
              the department  chairs, senior faculty and graduate students.  The second
              project  is a national program involving direct interaction with the  faculty
              and students at universities in various regions of the  nation.  This project
              will nurture local programs to improve and  widen career opportunities for
              Ph.D. physicists.  This second  project involves working with the faculty and
              students to  identify and develop a series of actions and programs and courses 
              which will maximize and focus the use of local resources.  A  career seminar
              series and strategies for supplementing and  enlarging the scope of courses for
              Ph.D. physics students will  also be encouraged.  ***
