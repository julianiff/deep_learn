Abstract    :
                   Brevard Teaching and Research Laboratories is seeking assistance  in the
              acquisition of  a Perstorp Flow Solution III dual channel autoanalyzer to
              perform  automated nutrient  analyses. There are currently several research
              projects underway which  would be greatly  enhanced by the acquisition of this
              instrument. These projects focus  upon the evaluation of  water quality
              conditions within the Indian River Lagoon ecosystem, an  estuary located on the
               east coast of Florida. At present, Brevard Labs must rely upon tedious, 
              obsolete, manual  techniques to perform nutrient analyses, greatly limiting the
              scope and  success of these  research activities. Brevard Labs operates as a
              joint-use facility, and  all instrumentation is  available to the entire
              regional research community through an  open-door policy. As a direct  support
              organization of Brevard Community College, research training of  graduate and 
              undergraduate students, as well as visiting scientists, is one of the 
              principal missions of  Brevard Labs. As autoanalyers such as that proposed
              herein are  considered standard to  performing many research activities, the
              training made possible with  this instrument  acquisition will have wide-spread
              applicability.
