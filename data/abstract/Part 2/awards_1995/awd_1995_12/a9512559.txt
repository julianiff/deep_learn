Abstract    :
              9512559  Scully  This action will provide partial support for a group of
              minority  undergraduate physics majors to attend a one-week summer school,  and
              then a one-week workshop, on the foundations and applications  of quantum
              mechanics.  This will help these students participate  in the most recent
              activities in theoretical physics, and will  enable them to be better placed to
              consider future careers in  science.  ***
