Abstract    :
                                                                  This award from the Academic
              Research Infrastructure Program will help the Department of  Chemistry at
              Indiana University at Gary acquire a Hewlett-Packard Automated LC System with 
              an autosampler, a quaternary pump and a variable wavelength detector.  The
              research activity  to be supported includes: Photocatalytic Degradation of
              Textile Dyes and Product Analysis by  HPLC Sonochemical Destruction of Organic
              Pollutants in Aqueous Solution.      High performance Liquid Chromatography
              (HPLC) is employed for the separation of mixtures  of diverse chemical
              composition, and the use of high pressure liquids allows for the separation  of
              more complicated materials.
