Abstract    :
                  9512564  El-Batanouny    This research will develop a versatile
              multi-technique/multi-  detection system to be used in conjunction with a newly
               developed dual atomic beam (DAB) monochromator to be used for  surface
              studies. The instrument will be capable of measuring  the magnetic and
              spin-dependent electronic structure of solid  surfaces, as well as the related
              dynamical properties. The DAB  monochromator can generate a mono-energetic beam
              of either  ground-state helium atoms or spin-polarized metastable helium 
              atoms. The heart of the detection system is a miniaturized  angle-resolved
              hybrid detector which can provide dispersive  atom-velocity analysis as well as
              detection of metastable  atoms. Magnetic measurements to be performed involve 
              determining the long-range order of surface electron spin  polarization and the
              dynamical properties of surface spin waves  (magnons). The dual atomic beam
              mode of operation permits to  distinguish between surface magnons and surface
              phonons, as the  spin-polarized atom beam couples to both surface magnons and 
              phonons while the ground state atom beam couples only to  surface phonons. The
              technique is suitable for the study of  materials with highly correlated
              electron systems, such as high  temperature cuprate superconductors and other
              transition metal  compounds.  %%%  The implementation of this novel and unique
              system will open a  new area of research involving the properties of surface 
              electron-spin states and their dynamics, which remains  inaccessible to
              existing techniques. The proposed system is  simple, innovative, and
              user-friendly enough that it is  expected to have a wider use, with the
              potential for commercial  production.  ***
