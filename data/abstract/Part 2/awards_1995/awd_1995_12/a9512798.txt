Abstract    :
              9512798  Boyanovsky    This U.S.-Brazil collaborative research effort will study
               dynamic properties of certain systems out of equilibrium;  in particular, the
              non-equilibrium dynamics of phase  transitions and transport phenomena of
              solitons and  vortices.  The collaboration between Daniel Boyanovsky of  the
              University of Pittsburgh and Carlos Aragao de Carvalho  of Universidade Federal
              do Rio de Janeiro will focus on  real-time descriptions of the systems,
              including the  dynamics of reheating and thermalization.  The work will  also
              extend to tunneling and thermal activation,  developing methods that can be
              applied to nucleation and  quantum tunneling in condensed matter, particle
              physics,  and cosmology.    The proposed work is timely and innovative,
              addressing  issues of concern in several overlapping fields. The  collaboration
              is supported in Brazil by CNPq, and both  sides will include graduate students
              and post-docs in the  research and travel.  The visiting senior scientists will
               interact with graduate students to provide special  educational experiences.
