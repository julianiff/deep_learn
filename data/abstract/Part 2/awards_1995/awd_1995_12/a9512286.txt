Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Gary L. Leal  University of Cal Santa Barbara  Proposal No.
              CTS-9512286    The Department of Chemical and Nuclear Engineering at UCSB has
              become world renowned for experimental and theoretical studies of the dynamics
              of microscale flow systems relevant to understanding and controlling
              interfacial and tribological phenomena at the molecular scale, as well as the
              dynamics and coalescence of microbubbles and drops.  The studies of interfacial
              and tribological phenomena are carried out in the Surface Forces Apparatus,
              developed in the laboratory of Professor J. Israelachvili.  The dynamics and
              coalescence of very small gas bubbles is being studied by Professor L. G. Leal
              in collaboration with scientists at JPL-NASA, using state of the art acoustic
              Levitation techniques.
