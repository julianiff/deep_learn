Abstract    :
              9512926  Bigelow    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research between Nicholas P. Bigelow at the University of Rochester and Michele
              I. Leduc at the Kastler Brossel Laboratory, Ecole Normale Superieure, Paris,
              France.   The main objective of this project is to generate and explore high
              density samples of ultra-cold, trapped metastable helium atoms.  Their aim is
              to expand, accelerate and diversity the current state of laser cooling research
              on the helium system through a series of coordinated experimental and
              theoretical efforts.  This research will benefit from U.S. and French expertise
              in quantum optics, laser studies, atomic optics and laser cooling.
