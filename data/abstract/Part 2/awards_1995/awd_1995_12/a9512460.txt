Abstract    :
                  Pi  9512460      This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. So Young Pi,   
              Department of Physics, Boston University, to pursue with   Dr. Hyunsoo Min,
              Department of Physics, Seoul City University,  for a period of 24 months, a
              program of cooperative research on  field theories in various dimensions.  Dr.
              Jae Hyung Yee,  Department of Physics, Yonsei University, will serve in an 
              advisory capacity with Dr. Min so as to facilitate Dr. Min's  entry into
              collaborative research with the U.S. scientist.  This  research will address
              three principal subjects, namely: (1)  finite temperature field theories; (2)
              dynamics of particles and  solitons in Chern-Simons gauge theories; and (3) low
              dimensional  gravity theories.  The collaborators expect to use the functional 
              Schr dinger method, which they will further develop in the  direction of
              renormalization group, entropy, and bound-state  calculations.    The
              collaborators expect to produce new and important  understanding of the
              theoretical structured for field theories in  various dimensions.  Potential
              benefits include advances in  physical theory and strengthening of the Physics
              Departments at  both universities.  A special benefit is the likelihood of 
              attracting outstanding Korean graduate students to do research at  Boston
              University.  This project is relevant to the objectives of  the U.S.-Korea
              Cooperative Science Program which seeks to  increase the level of cooperation
              between U.S. and Korean  scientists and engineers through the exchange of
              scientific  information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through 
              collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Dr. Min's  participation in the
              project is supported by the Korea Science  and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).
