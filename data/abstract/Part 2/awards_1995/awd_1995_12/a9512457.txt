Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                               This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program
              will help the Department of  Chemistry at Colby College acquire a SGI
              two-processor power challenge L desktop  supercomputer and associated software.
               The research activity to be supported includes: (1)  Computer Aided Molecular
              Design program that supports curriculum and student-faculty  research programs
              (2) transition state molecular orbital calculations for small organics and (3) 
              molecular dynamics calculations.    A workstation network of fast, modern
              computer workstations is a new way to satisfy the  computing needs of chemistry
              departments.  Such a "computer network" also serves as a  development
              environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides state-of-the-art
               graphics and visualization facilities.
