Abstract    :
              9512811  Lyttle  The Segregation distorter (SD) system of meiotic drive in
              Drosophila melanogaster is important for several reasons: 1) It is involved in
              the regulation of an important developmental process which is relevant to many
              eukaryotic organisms, 2) It involves the interaction of regulation of chromatin
              structure in products from genetic elements in both euchromatin and
              B-heterochromatin and thus can be considered a model for such interactions, 3)
              Knowledge of the physical and genetic map of the responder region (Rsp) can
              provide information on the centromere and adjacent DNA sites regulating
              position effect variegation and 4) because the SD system exists in a stable
              polymorphic equilibrium, it offers an excellent model for the evolution of
              meiosis and spermatogenesis.  Two groups of experiments designed to answer
              questions about the structure and function of the SD system in Drosophila will
              be done.  The first will focus on DNA mapping and cloning of the Rsp region of
              the 2R heterochromatin. The map will be used to define both genetic deletions
              and heterochromatic DNA clones which will be introduced.  The constructs will
              be used to quantitate the dependence of SD-mediated sperm dysfunction on Rsp
              structure.  The second is designed to introduce DNA "tags which will allow
              E(SD) to be cloned.  %%%  Cytogenetic, molecular and population genetic
              information will be integrated to provide a dynamic picture of the SD system,
              its effect on the evolution of gametogenesis and chromosome structure, and its
              potential as a tool for artificially controlling sex ratio in biocontrol
              schemes as a long term goal.  The more immediate goal is to characterize the
              DNA structure and function of the second chromosome heterochromatin of
              Drosophila melanogaster in as much detail as possible.  **(
