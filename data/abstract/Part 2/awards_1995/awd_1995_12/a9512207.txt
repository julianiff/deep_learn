Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  9512207  WEBB    A request has been made for funding to help provide
              partial travel assistance and accommodations for five U.S. researchers in the
              field of radiative transfer in order for them to participate in the First
              International Symposium on Radiative Transfer to be held August 14-18, 1995 in
              Kusadasi, Turkey.  This symposium is being sponsored by the International
              Center for Heat and Mass Transfer (ICHMT).  The Symposium will assemble for the
              first time scientists and engineers from a broad range of disciplines for the
              purpose of interdisciplinary cultivation of technical ideas related to
              radiative transfer.  For example, it is anticipated that related fields such as
              remote sensing and astrophysics will be represented.    The invited
              participants selected for support by the requested funds will include three
              established and two emerging scientists in the field of radiative tpansport. 
              Their attendance will lend stature to the Symposium, provide exposure to the
              multidisciplinary group, and ensure that the US is adequately represented in
              such a significant technical event.
