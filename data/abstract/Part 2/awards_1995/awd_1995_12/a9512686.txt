Abstract    :
              A new research program in theoretical gravitational physics  will be undertaken
              by Prof. Anderson.  He will address three  important issues relating to the
              study of black holes.  These are the questions:  What is the end point of the
              black  hole evaporation process?  What happens to the information  about how a
              black hole formed?  How do quantum fields alter  the thermodynamic properties
              of a black hole?  The  investigations will center around the ways in which
              quantum  fields alter the spacetime geometry both inside and outside  of a
              black hole.  These alterations affect the thermodynamic  properties of the
              black hole.  They also have a strong  influence on what is left after the black
              hole finishes  evaporating.  What happens to the information about how a  black
              hole formed may depend on both the spacetime geometry  inside its event horizon
              and what is left after the black  hole finishes evaporating.  Another proposed
              investigation  is the development of a practical way to make computations  in
              quantum field theory when the mode equation for free  quantized fields is not
              completely separable.    The results should significantly enhance our ability
              to  study the details of processes such as black hole  evaporation, the decay
              of a strong electric field due to  particle production, and particle production
              due to heavy  ion collisions in nuclear physics.
