Abstract    :
              Molecular techniques have revolutionized many areas of  biological oceanography.
              Research on topics ranging from  genetic biodiversity of viruses and fishes,
              the molecular  regulation of photosynthetic carbon fixation, and stress 
              responses in foraminifera is being conducted by  investigators at the
              University of South Florida's  Department of Marine Science. Instrumentation is
              requested  to augment these ongoing studies and to stimulate new areas  of
              research on the genetics and molecular biology of marine  organisms. The
              instrumentation requested includes a  Molecular Imaging System for quantitative
              molecular probing,  Fluorescence Microscopy Imaging Systems for rapid analysis 
              of fluorescently stained or autofluorescent samples, and a  Preparative
              Ultracentrifuge for a myriad of uses in cell,  micro- and molecular biology.
              None of the requested  instrumentation currently exists on our campus and its 
              acquisition will greatly improve our capabilities to  understand molecular
              aspects of life in the oceans.
