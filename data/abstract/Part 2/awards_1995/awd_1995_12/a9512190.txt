Abstract    :
              9512190  Jupina    This proposal request characterization and CAD tools for  the
              design of Microwave Monolithic Integrated Circuits (MMICs), which find
              application in radar systems and miniature, mobile wireless personal
              communications.  There is a planned future (1997) engineering laboratory
              building at Villanova which will have dedicated space for this equipment in a
              new anechoic chamber test facility.  The specific request is for a microwave
              probe station, a high-end network analyzer and computer workstations to provide
              shielded' 4-port test capability overs an extended temperature range.  ***
