Abstract    :
              9512864  Constable    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research in marine geology and geophysics between Steven C. Constable at the
              University of California, San Diego and  B. Ildefonse and D. Mainprice,
              Monpellier University.  The investigators will conduct electrogeophysical
              studies of the Oman ophiolite, which is an exposed ancient ocean surface.  The
              primary objective of the research is to study bulk physical properties and
              subsurface structure.  The field work and data interpretation will be conducted
              in collaboration with the French group, in order to take advantage of their
              structural and petrophysical knowledge of the Oman ophiolite.
