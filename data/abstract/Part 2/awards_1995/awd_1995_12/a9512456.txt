Abstract    :
                    9512456  Sutton  This Academic Research Infrastructure (Instrumentation)
              Award is to  partially fund the development of a materials characterization 
              facility with emphasis on testing in an aggressive environment.   The long
              range goal of the research involved is life-prediction  methodologies using
              mathematical models which incorporate accurate  material parameters.  Much
              existing data shows that safety  throughout the lifetime of a structure is
              extremely sensitive to  the environment, however except in very special cases
              there is  inadequate ability to predict how safety changes as structures age.  
              This facility will contribute to providing better experimental data  in this
              area.  ***
