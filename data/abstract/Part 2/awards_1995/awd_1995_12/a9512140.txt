Abstract    :
                    9512140  Penumadu  This Academic Research Infrastructure (Acquisition)
              Award is made  to partially fund the purchase of a combined axial force-torsion
               closed loop loading frame with appropriate electronic control  interfaces. 
              This testing apparatus will produce biaxial states of  stress and will be used
              in four ongoing research projects involving  clay soils, polycrystalline
              metals, electrical conduction in  reinforced cement composites and cold region
              research.  Graduate  and undergraduate research students will be able to
              tremendously  improve their research training with this equipment.  ***
