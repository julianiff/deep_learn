Abstract    :
              9512746  Brand  This award renews support of a project aimed at development of
              improved methods for cryopreservation of single-celled algae, and use of these
              methods for the freezing of strains now found in the UTEX collection of
              freshwater algae.  The collection includes a variety of algae, both prokaryotic
              and eukaryotic.  The use of cryopreservation allows more confidence that the
              unique genetic characteristics of organisms are being preserved than does the
              use of serial transfer, the most common method for maintenance of stocks of the
              kinds of algae found in the UTEX collection.  In addition, the development and
              use of such methods should lessen the time and expense required for routine
              storage of such strains by collections and by individual investigators who work
              with these organisms.  ***
