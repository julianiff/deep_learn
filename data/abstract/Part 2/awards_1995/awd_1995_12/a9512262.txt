Abstract    :
              The University of Wisconsin-Whitewater is committed to enhancing the  research
              experiences of undergraduates. During the past two years this  commitment has
              been reflected in substantial expenditures to improve  the science research
              laboratory facilities. This proposal requests  $97,932 in funding to obtain new
              research instrumentation for the  University's Biotechnology/Molecular
              Physiology and Biochemistry  Laboratory. A matching fund has also been pledged
              by the University.  The growth chambers, centrifuges and the protein
              purification and  measurement systems detailed in the proposal are currently
              being used  in every modern biotechnology laboratory in the United States. The 
              equipment that would be purchased will significantly strengthen  faculty
              research and instruction in biotechnology and protein  biochemistry analysis.  
               This equipment will also provide our students with hands-on  experience with
              state-of-art technology in scientific analysis and  research. The experience
              and education made possible by this  modern research instrumentation will
              significantly enhance the  productivity of teachers and scientists educated at
              the University.  Acquiring this equipment is the next logical step in the
              continuing  development of research facilities in the Departments of Biology 
              and Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater.
