Abstract    :
              9512857  Collins    This award supports a three-year cooperative research 
              project between George Collins, Colorado State University  and Professor Shiro
              Sakai, Tokushima University.  The  investigators will explore the feasibility
              of fabricating  light emitting diodes operating in the blue/UV spectral  region
              using a new material, GaPN, grown by a new technique.  They propose a study of
              GaPN because the suitability of  AlGaN/InGaN devices for lasers is in some
              doubt due to the  weak bond between In and N which causes quick device 
              degradation at temperatures higher than 80 degrees  Centigrade and at currents
              above 100 A/cm squared, both of  which are required for injection lasers. 
              Tokushima  University is a world leader in GaN material growth, having  already
              achieved over 100 micron thick high quality and well  characterized GaN films
              on sapphire substrates.  Dr. Sakai's  group will be introduced to a new
              materials growth technique  being pioneered at Colorado State University and as
              yet  untried in the III-V Nitride arena.  Hence, the  investigators will
              exchange and transfer scientific  knowledge through this international
              collaboration.  ***
