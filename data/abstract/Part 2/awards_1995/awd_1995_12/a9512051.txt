Abstract    :
              This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will help the
              Department of  Chemistry at University of Dayton acquire an upgrade of an
              existing 270 MHz NMR  Spectrometer.  The research activity to be supported
              includes: the study and development of  transformations of aromatic compounds
              via electronically "benign by desien" electrochemical  methodologies, and DNA
              reactive drugs in cancer chemotherapy.     Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              Spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to the  chemist for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown 
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
              to study the  dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access
              to state-of-the-art NMR  spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying
              out frontier research.  The results from  these NMR studies are useful in areas
              such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
