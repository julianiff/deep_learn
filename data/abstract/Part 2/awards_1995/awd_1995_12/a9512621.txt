Abstract    :
              9512621  Ja Ja    The project proposes to establish an ATM-based high speed
              communication network connecting six research laboratories to the UMIACS
              Parallel Processing Laboratory (PPL). The six laboratories reside in the
              Departments of Computer Science, Geography, and Physics, and the Institute of
              Physical Science and Technology. The proposed network will consist of seven ATM
              local area networks connected by multimode fiber to four additional switches
              managed by the campus Computer Science Center. High-speed off-campus
              connections will be established to SURAnet and the NSF-funded National Scalable
              Cluster Project (NSCP). The UMIACS PPL provides approximately 20 Gigaflops of
              computational power and 400 Gigabytes of online disk storage to these
              laboratories.    The proposed network will serve as a research instrument for
              addressing critical issues in networking research, operation and management
              network computing using distributed shared memory, distributed multimedia
              databases, and scalable I/O. The network will substantially enhance a number of
              collaborative research activities including (1) the development and evaluation
              of transport layer services over ATM LAN's, (2) the development of
              methodologies and tools for creating wide-area DSM, (3) experimental high
              energy physics requiring statistics-intensive data analysis, (4) visualization
              in scientific computations for chaotic dynamics and computational mechanics,
              (5) the application of remotely sensed images in the analysis of the Earth's
              environmental systems, and (6) techniques for creating and manipulating
              multimedia databases and scalable parallel I/O.  ***
