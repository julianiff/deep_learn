Abstract    :
              9512216  Kwitter, Karen B.    The funds are requested for a performance-upgrade
              package for the Williams College 24-inch telescope and for a computer system
              that will significantly enhance the ability of the faculty and undergraduates
              to analyze and interpret observational data.  The work will install a new focus
              housing on the 24-inch DFM telescope to allow high resolution focus readout,
              thereby increasing the speed and efficiency of all observations, especially
              multi-filter CCD observations.  Also, a DEC Alpha 3000/900 will be purchased on
              which to run IRAF (Image Reduction and Analysis Facility, a package from the
              National Observatories that has become the standard astronomical analysis
              tool), and auxiliary equipment for data transfer and storage.  The new
              instrumentation will substantially improve the ability to conduct on-campus
              research, and to continue the student research participation-often involving
              data acquired  at national observatories-that is a hallmark of the Williams
              College astronomy curriculum.
