Abstract    :
                                                                    Project  Summary        
              This project will provide equipment to enable the  Hawaii Institute of  Marine
              Biology  to serve as a center for diverse research on UV radiation in  the
              tropical marine environment.  An international workshop on UV radiation in the
              sea (Aug.,  1994) concluded that HIMB's  history of such research and its
              sub-tropical location make  it the most logical site in the U.S.A.,  or the
              world, for such a center.  A scanning  spectroradiometer will allow precision
              measurement  of radiation in the laboratory and the field.  A UV- 
              sensitive/visible wavelength remote controlled  television will allow visual
              perception and measurement of  portions of the sensory world of  marine 
              animals of which humans are dismally unaware.  Visitors will  be encouraged to
              use these facilities  and several leading investigators in the field have firm 
              plans for participation.
