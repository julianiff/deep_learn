Abstract    :
              9512858  Iglesia        The proposed research will establish a working
              collaboration  between a catalysis research group at UC Berkeley, headed by 
              Enrique Iglesia, and a solid-state synthesis research group  at the Universidad
              Nacional del Litoral in Santa Fe,  Argentina under Carlos Apesteguia.  The
              research will focus  on understanding the problems in catalytic approaches for 
              the synthesis of isobutanol from synthesis gas.  The  mechanism of the process
              will be analyzed and various  catalysts will be evaluated in order to find a
              method which  works effectively under lower temperatures and pressures  than
              currently known methods.    The research group in Argentina is recognized for
              research  in the synthesis and structural characterization of new  materials,
              while the U.S. group complements this expertise  with emphasis on the kinetics
              and mechanisms of organic  reactions at catalytic surfaces.  The project
              leaders will  also involve graduate students and a post doctoral scientist  as
              integral parts of the project.    ****
