Abstract    :
              INT 9512791  Richards      This U.S.-Czech research project between Dr. Mercedes
              Richards of the University of Virginia and Dr. Pavel Koubsky of the
              Astronomical Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences will focus on testing
              the utility of a proposed model for binary Be stars (B-type stars with emission
              lines).  If they are successful, results should contribute to a unifying
              picture of two classes of Be stars, eclipsing Algols (typically viewed edge-on,
              in the orbital plane) and non-eclipsing Algols.  In this effort, the
              researchers will undertake extensive optical and ultraviolet spectroscopic
              studies of classical Algols to interpret the spectra of non-eclipsing Algol
              candidates.  They expect to prove that the present apparent paucity of
              non-eclipsing Algols is a selection effect.  Overall, these findings should
              increase our understanding of the three-dimensional structure of circumstellar
              matter in these interacting binaries, above and beneath the orbital plane.   
              This project in stellar astronomy fulfills the program objective of advancing
              basic scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and
              Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in
              areas of mutual interest and competence.     ??
