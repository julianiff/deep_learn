Abstract    :
              9512327  Lush   This is a project to establish a modern laboratory for the
              non-destructive characterization of the optical and electrical properties of
              materials and solid state devices.  The tools to be acquired are (1) a
              CCD-camera-based spectral imaging system to observe luminescence and reflected
              light with spatial resolution; and (2) a Kelvin probe station that measures the
              spatial dependence of surface potentials and of surface and bulk electronic
              states in materials and devices.   Establishment of this laboratory (1) fills a
              void in the ability to properly characterize materials and devices fabricated
              in laboratories under existing research projects; (2) allows research in novel
              techniques for the characterization of CdTe/CdS polycrystalline, thin-film
              solar cells (and other thin films); (3) supports development of advanced
              techniques for the non-destructive testing of optical and electronic materials;
              (4) provides research training for graduate and undergraduate students in solid
              state physics, materials, image processing, and class selection; and to (5)
              attract underrepresented minorities (Hispanics and women) to pursue both
              undergraduate and graduate degrees in science and engineering.
