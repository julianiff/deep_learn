Abstract    :
              `The following proposal is a multi-departmental effort requesting funds  for the
              acquisition of a new scanning electron microscope (SEM) with  X-ray
              microanalyzer (EDX) and cold stage to replace the outdated SEM at  Northern
              Arizona University (NAU). The new SEM will incorporate  numerous technical
              features necessary for research and teaching not now  available at Northern
              Arizona University.    The Electron Microscope Facility services the NAU campus
              and Northern  Arizona community. Since the current SEM (an Amray 1000) was
              acquired  in 1974, it has been continuously used in teaching and in a variety
              of  primary research investigations and has been operated under regular 
              maintenance contracts. Recently, maintenance calls have become more  frequent,
              down time has increased, and replacement parts are becoming  more difficult to
              obtain. The number of research faculty (40), graduate  and undergraduate
              students (25), and courses (10), making regular use  of the facility in the
              past few years has sharply risen. The AMRAY 1000  is no longer capable of
              providing the services required of a rapidly  growing university community now
              exceeding 18,000 students and 550  faculty.    This proposal incorporates the
              present and future needs for a modern  SEM facility wit integrated X-ray
              capabilities and cryostage unit. The  principle investigators listed are 9
              faculty members representing 6  university departments.    This proposal is
              being submitted to the ARI Program for the following  reasons:    1) The EM
              facility is used by the entire NAU community and thus exists  as an
              interdisiplinary center. 2) a number of the co-PI's, and the PI  himself, are
              not presently funded by the NSF and as stated in the ARI  Program brochure
              (page 1), to qualify for ARI funding, "research  activities... need not be
              supported by NSF or the Federal Government".  3) acquisition of the instrument
              requested herein is the first major  step in a modernization effort planned for
              the NAU EM facility. The  long term plan is for an inte grated imaging facility
              in which digital  images from light, fluorescence, confocal, scanning and
              transmission  microscopes will be stored (TIFF format) in an EM Image library
              and  made available to NAU researchers, teachers and students, located both  on
              campus and at the 9 NAU remote sites via the Internet (see Section  I, EM
              facility Vision Plan).
