Abstract    :
              9512931  Jenkins    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative 
              research in mechanics and statistical physics between  Cornell University and
              the University of Rennes.  The  investigators are James T. Jenkins and Michel
              Louge and  Daniel Bideau and his research group at Rennes.  The  investigators
              propose studies on granular materials.  They  will  focus on a simple problem
              of determining the motion of a  single particle moving on or near the surface
              of a bumpy,  frictional, inclined plane. The project has important  industrial
              applications and takes advantage of complementary  expertise in physics of
              granular materials at Rennes and  mechanics expertise at Cornell.  ***
