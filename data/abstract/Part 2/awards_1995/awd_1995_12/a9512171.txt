Abstract    :
              9512171  Dow   This award provides funding to acquire two measuring instruments
              at the Precision Engineering Center at North Carolina State University.  The
              equipment to be purchased includes an RTH Form Talysurf mechanical profilometer
              with an extended vertical range of 6mm and a resolution of 10nm, and an optical
              profilometer system consisting of a Zyro Maxim GP/New View 100 Surface Analyzer
              and a GPIxps Laser Interferometer with a 2 mm field of view and 1A resolution
              over a 100 micron vertical range.  The Precision Engineering Center conducts
              research and educates students in the area of high-technology precision
              manufacturing.  Research conducted at the facility encompasses measurement and
              fabrication of optical, electronic, and mechanical devices where high precision
              is required.  Projects include diamond turning and the fabrication of ceramic
              and glass surfaces.   These instruments will improve research on a number of
              ongoing projects ilvolving optical and structural components in glass and
              ceramic materials, diamond Turing of brittle materials for infrared optics,
              measurement of surface finish and wear of diamond films for tool coatings and
              tribological surfaces, and measurement of rotationally asymmetric surfaces for
              electronic and optoelectronic spherical optics.
