Abstract    :
              CTS-9512485  Tsapatsis  U of Massachusetts    A Powder X-ray Diffractometer
              (PXRD) will be procured for research in material characterization.  The PXRD
              will have capabilities for in situ high temperature, controlled environment and
              thin film XRD.  Uses for the equipment include characterization of synthetic
              zeolites, polymeric materials and amphiphilic association structures, as well
              as identification of layered silicates and other minerals in geological
              samples.  It will support various research projects in advanced materials
              processing and manufacturing.  The PXRD will also be used for training of
              graduate students.
