Abstract    :
              9512191  York    The proposed project requests a terabyte storage system from 35
              to 100 terabyte capacity over a high performance network. The proposed system
              is a high performance research infrastructure for high speed remote access to
              multi-terabyte databases. It will be shared by scientists in several diverse
              disciplines including research in climate studies, turbulence, cosmic ray air
              showers, and x-ray crystallography with the advanced photon source. All these
              tasks require terabyte databases. The proposed project is a collaboration
              between the University of Chicago, Argonne National Laboratory, IBM, and
              Ameritech.  ***
