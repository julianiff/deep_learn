Abstract    :
              A group of scientists from several academic disciplines will  form a new
              laboratory at the University of Maryland-College  Park, to house and operate a
              new laser facility of use to  them all.  The instrument will be a unique
              resource, and  will deliver a wide range of pulse energy, intensity, 
              repetition rate, and optical frequency to match the range of  requirements of
              the investigators.
