Abstract    :
              9512334  Edwards      This grant, as part of the Academic Research
              Infrastructure(ARI)  program, provides $500,000 as one-half support of costs of
               acquiring three new mass spectrometers for the Minnesota Isotope  Laboratory. 
              Total costs are jointly supported including $420,000  from the Earth Sciences
              Instrumentation and Facilities Program's  ARI allocation, $80,000 from the
              Division of Ocean Sciences  Marine Geology and Geophysics Program and $500,000
              from the  Unitersity of Minnesota.  This group's research focuses on high 
              resolution studies of global and regional climate change as  recorded in the
              isotopic composition of marine and freshwater  carbonates including, coral
              skeletons, calcareous sediments,  speleothems and ostracod tests. 
              Specifically, the instruments  that will be purchased include a gas source
              stable isotope ratio  mass spectrometer (SIRMS) equipped with a Kiel device, a
              high  transmission efficiency thermal ionization mass spectrometer  (TIMS) and
              an inductively coupled plasma sector mass spectrometer  (ICP-SMS).  
              Additionally, the TIMS and ICP-SMS will provide the  necessary analytical
              capabilities for continued development of  high-resolution dating techniques
              (U/Th) and new proxies for  climatic variables such as temperature and
              precipitation (Sr/Ca  and U/Ca ratios in corals, speleothem growth rate, Sr/Ca,
              Mg/Ca  and stable isotope composition of ostracods).   Furthermore, the  TIMS
              will allow developmental work on recent breakthroughs in  chronometry using the
              Uranium/Protactinium (U/Pa) system.  Taken  as a whole, these instruments will
              be provide the necessary  sensitivity and analytical speed to retrieve the next
              generation  of high resolution local and regional climate records for testing 
              theories about the causes of climate change and for testing  models designed to
              simulate past and future climatic conditions.    ***
