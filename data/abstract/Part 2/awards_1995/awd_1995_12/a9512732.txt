Abstract    :
              9512732  Cvetic       This proposal encompasses the study of theoretical 
              elementary particle physics including theories of supersymmetric  gravity. 
              Supersymmetry is an invariance which relates bosons and  fermions.  Solutions
              of these theories describing black holes  will be investigated, and the general
              framework of supergravity  theories will be analyzed.  ***
