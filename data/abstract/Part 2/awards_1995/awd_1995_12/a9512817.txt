Abstract    :
              9512817  Maltzman  The broad discretion exercised by U.S. Supreme Court justices
              has led scientific students of the Court to recognize that the justice who
              write a majority opinion had a disproportionate ability to shape outcomes and
              establish precedents.  In particular, the Chief Justice's ability to assign the
              majority opinion is considered one of the Chief's most important sources of
              power.  Previous research has demonstrated that the each justice's assignments
              depend on such factors as the experience of the justice, the ideological
              relationship between the justice and the Chief Justice, and the size of the
              majority coalition.  The P.I.s previous work is to date the only study to model
              the relative influence of these factors.  This research will extend the
              previous work by capturing variation over time.  The study will examine the
              extent to which assignments made by the Chief Justice reflect personal policy
              preferences and organizational needs of the Court.  It will use original
              conference data on assignments from 1953-1009.  %%%%  The broad discretion
