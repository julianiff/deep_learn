Abstract    :
              9512045  Cypess  This award renews funding of the Bacteriology Collection of the
              American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).  The collection includes over 15,000
              strains representing most of the known species of bacteria.  Approximately 500
              strains of bacterial viruses are also included in the collection.  About 20% of
              the bacterial strains are type cultures particularly useful as reference
              strains in identifying new isolates, performing microbiological assays and
              other uses where repeated use of the same strain is critical.  Samples of
              collected organisms are available to researchers in universities, research
              institutes and industry for a small fee.  In the last five years, the size of
              the collection has increased by about 7%, and over 200,000 samples have been
              distributed.  Funding provided through the award will support continued growth
              in the size of the collection, improvements in the quality-assurance
              procedures, and progress in providing detailed, current information about the
              collection through the internet and a printed catalogue.  ***
