Abstract    :
              9512044  Morton   This award provides partial funding (69% of total cost) for
              the acquisition of an X-ray diffraction spectrometer system to be installed and
              operated in the Department of  Geology at the University of Minnesota-Duluth .
              The institution is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for the
              acquisition of the equipment. X-ray diffraction is used as a basic analytical
              tool in many research applications of the earth sciences to identify mineral
              phases and to characterize their molecular structural states. The new X-ray
              diffractometer will be the only such instrument on the Minnesota-Duluth campus
              and will be available for use as a campus-wide facility.     ***
