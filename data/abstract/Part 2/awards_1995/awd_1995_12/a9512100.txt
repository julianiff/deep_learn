Abstract    :
              9512100  Chu       Nonperturbative theoretical and computational methods will 
              be developed and applied to the dynamics of atoms in external  electric and
              magnetic fields.  The systems studied are  nonseparable and provide interesting
              examples of the  manifestation of regular and chaotic behavior in atomic and 
              molecular physics.  ***
