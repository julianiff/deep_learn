Abstract    :
              SBR-9512111  Peter Lindert, University of California at Davis    This project is
              an extention to Indonia of current NSF-sponsored research into the soil history
              of China.  This work is motivated by the rising concern voiced in many Asian
              countries about the loss of productive agricultural lands.  Up to now the
              evidence has been sporadic and anecdotal.  There is no historically-based
              evidence using agreed upon scientific criteria to evaluate properly what has
              been happening to soil in this quickly growing area of the world.  This project
              promises a quantum leap in our understanding of trends in soil loss and its
              affects on agricultural productivity.  The primary data consists of thousands
              of soil samples taken between the 1920's and the 1980's in both China and
              Indonesia.  By statistically comparing the recent and early soil data, the P.I.
              aims to determine the sustainability of agriculture in the twm countries.
