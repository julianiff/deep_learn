Abstract    :
              9512272  DeFanti    The main focus of the proposed project is to create
              virtual-reality and virtual-prototyping instrumentation for viewing scientific
              and engineering data. The University has been involved in an ongoing
              development of the CAVE virtual-reality theater, a room-sized, high-resolution,
              projection-based system that enables users to experience good immersion in full
              3D imagery. The goal of this proposed project is to broaden the scope for
              making the CAVE both smaller and larger. A smaller, software compatible,
              drafting-table format version, called ImmersaDesk, is being designed. It uses a
              high-end graphics system and projector for each ImmersaDesk, and a ATM gear to
              allow remote ImmersaDesk to ImmersaDesk collaborative design sessions.    A
              larger high-resolution (1600 x 2048) stereo screen, called NII/Wall is being
              developed for large audiences. The NII/Wall will serve as a portal into
              networked scalable computers located around the country so scientists and
              engineers can interact with simulations running on distributed clusters of
              shared-memory processors.  ***
