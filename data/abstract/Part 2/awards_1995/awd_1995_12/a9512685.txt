Abstract    :
              Abstract/Kostinski           The objective of this research is to examine
              time-series  simulations and measurements of hydrometeor backscatter 
              polarization matrices in order to investigate their potential  meteorological
              applications.  Previous results show that a deeper  understanding of the
              microphysics is possible by interpreting the  polarization scattering matrix as
              an operator rather than a list of  polarimetric variables derived from the
              associated covariance  matrix.  In particular, it is now known that the
              time-series of the  polarization matrix eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be
              used to  define meteorologically useful variables related to the shape and 
              canting of the hydrometeors.  Our goal then is to further extend  this research
              in order to achieve the clearest possible separation  of size, shape, and
              orientation information.  Such knowledge may  well have implications with
              respect to the application of  polarization techniques to several practical
              problems including,  for example, the discrimination among hydrometeor types
              (e.g., rain  vs. hail), improved characterization of raindrops for better 
              rainfall estimation.
