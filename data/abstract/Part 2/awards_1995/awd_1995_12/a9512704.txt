Abstract    :
              9512704  Palm      This U.S.-Mexico award will support a trilateral North 
              American research workshop on mycology and sustainable  development in
              conjunction with the annual meeting of the  American Institute of Biological
              Sciences in San Diego, CA.  The workshop is being organized by Dr. Mary Palm of
              the  Mycological Society of America and Dr. Joaquin Cifuentes  Blanco of the
              Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, UNAM,  in Mexico City.    Mexico, the
              U.S., and Canada are undergoing rapid changes,  central to which is a pressing
              need for devising and  implementing concepts of sustainability into economic 
              practices.  Fungi are key to sustainability in agricultural,  forest and
              wild-land management.  The goals for this  workshop are to facilitate an
              exchange of ideas and  experiences, analyze current practices, and chart future
               projects of mutual interest, concentrating on the role of  mycology in
              sustainable development.  Panelists will present  each country's perspective as
              well as regional concerns.  Among the expected outcomes of the workshop will be
              written  proceedings available in printed and electronic format with  each
              participant's overview, as well as information on  anticipated collaborations
              and future goals .  ***
