Abstract    :
              9512402  Kumar   This grant provides funding to purchase equipment for a new
              Center for Customized Production Systems (CCuPS) at the University of
              Pennsylvania.  The purpose of this center is to draw together an
              interdisciplinary team of academics and industrial leaders to develop
              engineering technologies and management practices that will support the rapid
              design and production of customized goods and services that are tailored to the
              needs of a specific consumer.  Through a variety of educational initiatives,
              CCuPS will be the nexus of training and information on customized production
              technology and management.  The research is interdisciplinary.  The main
              technical foci include:  Data Acquisition:  Measurement of the User, Task, and
              Environment, Virtual Prototyping, Product Design for Customized Production,
              Rapid Production and Logistics Technology, Life-Cycle Product and Process
              Development, Systems Integration and Concurrent Engineering.  To assure that
              problems of fundamental importance to industry are addressed, a partnership
              with a variety of organizations will be developed.   The main benefit from the
              research will be the development of a technological base of knowledge needed
              for rapid design and manufacture of customized goods and services.  In
              addition, the research will result in a better understanding of the product
              development and management practices required to move production systems from
              the traditional mass production model to systems where products and services
              can be customized to the individual needs of a consumer.
