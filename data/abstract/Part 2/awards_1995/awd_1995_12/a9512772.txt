Abstract    :
                This three-year award supports U.S.-Italy cooperative research between Russel
              Caflisch, Bjorn Engquist, and Stanley Osher of the University of California at
              Los Angeles and Giovanni Russo at the University of Aquila, and Maurizio
              Falcone, University of Rome, `La Sapienza,` in Italy, on analytical and
              numerical methods for simulation and control of fluids.  Their research will
              focus on five topics -- singularity formation,  level set methods for capturing
              multivalued solutions and for computing unstable fronts, numerical
              homogenization, bubbly flow, and approximation schemes for Hamilton-Jacobi
              equations and control applications.  The two research groups possess
              complementary areas of expertise in scientific computation, fluid mechanics,
              and partial differential equations.  The level set and shock capturing methods
              developed at UCLA will be extended and applied to control problems as
              formulated in Rome.  Particle methods developed in L'Aquila will be applied to
              vortical flows to look for singularities and validation of the level set
              method.    The credentials of the L'Aquila group in the study of particle
              methods will contribute to the integration of the expertise of the UCLA group
              on conservation laws into active CFD codes.  The cooperation of these two
              groups should lead to an expansion of the understanding and the numerical
              methodology in several important classes of problems in fluid dynamics.
