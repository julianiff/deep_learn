Abstract    :
                  ABSTRACT      Proposal: 9512467  PI: Cave, R.J.       Institution: Harvey
              Mudd College    This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program
              will help the Department of Chemistry at Harvey Mudd College acquire several
              workstations (two IBM RS600, two SGI Indigo, three SGI Indy and a DEC Alpha
              300) to establish a computational facility.  The research activity to be
              supported includes studies of phthalocyanine thin-films on silicon and gold, ab
              initio studies of electron transfer processes, fluorescence studies of
              chromophores in micelles, synthetic and physical organic treatment of reactive
              intermediates, the characterization and phase-behavior of liquid crystalline
              materials, and the study of self-assembling monolayers.    A workstation
              network of fast, modern computer workstations is a new way to satisfy the
              computing needs of chemistry departments.  Such a "computer network" also
              serves as a development environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms,
              provides state-of-the-art graphics and visualization facilities.
