Abstract    :
              It is proposed to purchase a multi-processor supercomputing  resource capable of
              1.8 Gigaflops / 1597 SPECfp92 peak  computational performance.  The system will
              serve a group of  six researchers and their students in Biophysics, Chemistry 
              and Physics departments working in the area of  biomacromolecular structure,
              dynamics and folding research.  The proposed system will enable them to carry
              out, amongst  other things, ab initio computations to produce more precise 
              biomolecular force field for use in and RNA structures based  on NMR data, to
              theoretically simulate the dynamics of  proteins, to refine Xray protein
              structures and to  characterize the geometry of enzymatic transition states. 
              The purchase of the supercomputing resource will provide for  the training of
              theoretical and computational biochemists  and biophysicists, as well as
              furnish an introduction to  modern computational methodologies for students
              interested  in experimental biochemistry and biophysics.
