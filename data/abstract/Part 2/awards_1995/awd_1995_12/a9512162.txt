Abstract    :
                9512162  Li    This award supports initiation of cooperative research  between
              Dr. Xiaorong Li, University of New  Orleans,  Department of Electrical
              Engineering, and Wang Shuning,  Huazhong University of Science and Technology,
              and Han  Chongzhao, Xian Jiaotong University, on set-valued hybrid  state
              estimation with applications.  Set-valued estimation  is a
              generalization/extension of the traditional optimal  point estimation.  It
              emphasizes the feasibility, rather  than optimality, of the solution to the
              estimation problem.  This research has ever increasing applications in various 
              fields of systems and manufacturing engineering research,  because it is
              insensitive to modeling errors, and therefore  can provide more reliable and
              robust solution to failure  detection problems.    The US and Chinese co-PIs on
              this project are well known  researchers in set-valued estimation, and bring 
              complementary expertise to the research.  Experimental work  will be carried
              out at the National Key Laboratory of  Manufacturing System Engineering to test
              the validity of the  techniques developed  during the project.  Both Huazhong
              University and Xian  Jiaotong University have received increasing funding from 
              various Chinese government agencies and industry in recent  years for work in
              the area of systems and manufacturing  engineering research.  This is an
              extension of work funded  under ECS 9496319.
