Abstract    :
                                       PROJECT SUMMARY  The Darling Marine Center is the
              marine laboratory of the  University of Maine System.  Since 1991, the
              University has  made an unprecedented financial commitment to modernize the 
              facility and to expand teaching and research programs to  benefit both
              University faculty and visiting researchers.  Lab and office space for visiting
              scientists has been  increased  5 fold, nearly all of the Center's 16 original 
              building have been renovated or improved, visitor housing  has been increased
              by 65%, a new dining hall has been built,  a shoreside Dive & Field Staging
              Building has been erected  to support SCUBA work, two additional classrooms
              have been  constructed including a new shoreside Visiting 
              Investigator/Classroom building, and the research library  has been expanded. 
              The inauguration of a formal Visiting  Investigation program in 1991 has
              resulted in an unexpected  surge of visitors that is increasing annually.  A
              concerted  effort has been made to involve visitors in planning future 
              facility improvements and, based on their evaluations, the  University has
              targeted three areas of facility weaknesses  at the Darling Center, two of
              which are the focus of this  proposal: 1) additional improvements to the small
              vessel  operation and  2) the upgrade of research instrumentation  for
              visitors.  This project will support the purchase of a  24' research vessel
              with enclosed cabin space for conducting  all-weather research and teaching
              activities, as will the  purchase of several research instruments that are most
               frequently requested by visiting investigators will be  supported. The
              University will provide no funds to construct  a shoreside 40 x 50' x 20'
              Vessel Operations building that  will be used for repair, maintenance and
              storage of  the  Center's boat fleet.
