Abstract    :
              9512579  Kelly    A high resolution field-emission scanning electron microscope 
              (FESEM) will be acquired and installed at the Materials Science  Center of the
              University of Wisconsin, Madison campus.  The  proposed FESEM has two features
              that make it an essential tool  for advancing several areas in materials
              science.  First, the  high image resolution capability makes it possible to
              study  microstructural features at the nanometer scale (above 1.2  nanometers)
              and to examine large sample areas.  This allows for  the study of materials
              that are difficult to prepare for  transmission electron microscopy (TEM).  The
              high resolution  capability will be used to study the microstructure of high 
              critical current superconductors, of surfaces modified by ion  implantation,
              and of nanocrystalline ceramics.  Second, the  instrument is equipped with an
              electron backscatter diffraction  pattern (EBSP) detection and analysis system
              which makes possible  the determination of the orientation of individual grains
              in a  sample.  This capability will be used to map the grain  orientation in
              high temperature superconductors and can provide  information on the critical
              current path in these materials.  %%%  The high resolution scanning electron
              microscope will serve  several research groups on campus working in materials
              related  problems.  It replaces an instrument which has five times lower 
              resolution and which is eighteen years old.  The new instrument's  ability to
              image large samples at high resolution will make  possible routine
              characterization of advanced materials and will  impact a broad range of
              ongoing programs in materials science.  ***
