Abstract    :
                  9512369  McDowell  This Academic Research Infrastructure (Acquisition) Award
              is made  to partially fund the acquisition of an integrated simulation and 
              test control capability that will be used to study deformation,  fatigue and
              fracture of high temperature structural materials.  The  Mechanical Properties
              Research Laboratory has a long history of  modeling materials propepties that
              are used both for performance  predictions and processing/forming techniques. 
              The new equipment  will allow better studies of the changing microstructure
              which in  turn contributes to a better understanding of material behavior.  ***
