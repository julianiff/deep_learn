Abstract    :
              9512790  Steinfeld    This U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Workshop grant will 
              support travel expenses of 12 U.S. scientists to take part  in a workshop
              organized by Jeffrey Steinfeld in  conjunction with the Chemistry Department of
              M.I.T. and  Roberto Fernandez-Prini with the Instituto de Quimica  Fisica de
              los Materiales, Medio Ambiente, y Energia  (INQUIMAE) at the University of
              Buenos Aires, Argentina.  The workshop will be organized around the topics of 
              preserving the atmosphere; environmentally benign chemical  processing; water
              resources and aquatic chemistry; new  energy technologies; and initiatives in
              environmental  education. Anticipated results include new cooperative  research
              programs in a variety of environmentally  important areas of chemistry and the
              establishment of  electronic network links among the participating 
              institutions. Part of the funding for this grant comes  from the Theoretical
              and Computational Chemistry Program  of the Division of Chemistry.  ***
