Abstract    :
              9512008  Weiss  This is a proposal for a three-day interdisciplinary workshop of
              leading scholars to develop a systematic program of research dealing with
              nontreaty mechanisms, that is, nonbinding legal accords, for dealing with
              important problems of international environmental or global change.  The
              workshop will identify questions, develop and refine hypotheses, critically
              examine assumptions underlying existing work in the field, and consider
              alternative research methodologies.  It will also identify key players in and
              establish links to the policy community.  The workshop will yield publishable
              papers that will set out the research agenda developed.  %%%%  This is a
