Abstract    :
              9512504  Maldonado    This proposal requests advanced instrumentation for 
              characterizing  new optical materials (nonlinear biaxial crystals  organic and
              inorganic ) and wave guide devices.  The instrumentation (i.e. laser systems,
              ellipsometer, spectrum analyzer, etc..) would be used to verify experimentally
              the theoretical' studies and predictions of the Electro-Optics Group at the
              University of Texas in Austin.  In particular, the propagation constants of
              hybrid modes in planar and channel biaxial waveguides are to  examined as well
              as waveguide devices,  such as guided-model resonance filters.  ***
