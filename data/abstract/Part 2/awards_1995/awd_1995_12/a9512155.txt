Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT      Proposal: 9512155  PI: Cole, R.       Institution: University of
              New Orleans    This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program
              will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of New Orleans acquire
              triple quadrapole Mass Spectrometer which will be used in research.  The
              research activity to be supported includes:       1. direct mixture analysis of
              bacterial toxins, and lipid portions  2. structural analysis problems involving
              novel glycosphingolipids  3. energy-resolved tandem mass spectrometry
              experiments  4. thermodynamic properties of organometallic compounds  5. amino
              acid sequence of light harvesting proteins  6. collisionally-activated
              reactions  7. reactivity of Zintl phase materials    Mass Spectrometry (MS) is
              a technique used to probe intimate structural details and to obtain the
              molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic and
              organometallic molecules.  The addition of the technique of electrospray
              extends the range of MS to protein and nucleic acid molecular weights far
              beyond any other technique.  The use of electrospray ionization is combination
              with high resolution provides the latest techniques available in mass
              spectrometry.  It affords the chemist one of the most powerful tools available
              for the characterization of compounds.  The acquisition of this capability in
              mass spectrometry is essential for the prosecution of frontier research in many
              fields of chemistry.
