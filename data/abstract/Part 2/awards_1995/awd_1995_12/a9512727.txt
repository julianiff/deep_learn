Abstract    :
              9512727  Stark  The Symposium on "Activation of Transcription in Response to
              Extracellular Signaling Proteins" to be held under the auspices of the American
              Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB) October 6-9, 1995, in
              Keystone, Colorado.  Participation will be 200-250 scientists (including
              speakers and moderators), selected on the basis of their expertise and interest
              in this area, and their expected contribution to the success of this scientific
              program.  The meeting will begin with broad discussion of each of the two major
              pathways of transcriptional activation in response to extracellular signals:
              the ras-MAPK pathway and the JAK-STAT pathway.  understanding transcriptional
              signaling is vital to understanding processes such as cell growth control, the
              functioning of the immune system and development and so has a central place in
              modern biology.  The pace of progress in this area has been very rapid in
              recent years, and it is important to bring scientists working on diverse
              systems together so that the interrelationships of these systems can be fully
              appreciated and so that new clues about the mechanisms and functions from one
              system can be applied in others. The meeting is designed to be highly
              interactive and to give ample time for discussion and for presentations by
              younger scientists. This meeting will serve as a catalyst to stimulate the
              interest of scientists who may have novel tools in hand to approach these
              problems, with a focus on those younger scientists, who have yet to initiate a
              major program of independent research.  %%%  The Symposium on "Activation of
