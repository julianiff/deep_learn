Abstract    :
              This grant will provide equipment for enlarging the  capabilities of the FIREFLY
              Free Electron Laser at Stanford  University.  This includes beam handling, beam
              conditioning,  optical detection, data acquisition, and fast optical  switching
              of the infrared beam.  This will allow a broad  class of experiments in
              condensed matter and surface physics  by the user community.
