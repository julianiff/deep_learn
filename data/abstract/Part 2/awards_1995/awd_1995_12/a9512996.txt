Abstract    :
                This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at University of Oklahoma in the
              purchase of an Electron  Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Spectrometer.  This
              equipment will enhance research in a  number of areas including the following: 
              analysis of allosteric transition metal complexes,  electronic structures of
              Cytochrome P-450 model compounds; characterization  of stable  free
              radical/cations and anions, and paramagnetic metallocenes; determination of the
               distribution of spin density and molecular structure of organocobalt radicals;
              study of spin  states and oxidation states of both porphyrin and nonporphyrin
              Fe(II) and Fe(III)  complexes; photo-EPR, to probe the photogeneration of
              charges in photoconducting  polymers; analysis of nitroxide spin-labeled
              proteins, and copper-labeled proteins, as a  measure of polypeptide structure,
              folding and conformational dynamics.    An Electron Paramagnetic Resonance
              (EPR) spectrometer is an instrument used to obtain  information about the
              molecular and electronic structure of molecules.  It may also be used to 
              obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals which are often
              essential for the initiation  of tumor growth and/or a variety of chemical
              reactions.
