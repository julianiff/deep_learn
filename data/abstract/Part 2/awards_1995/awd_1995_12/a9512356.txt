Abstract    :
              9512356  Vitter    Duke University proposes the establishment of an ATM-based
              network cluster of high-performance 64-bit workstations for supporting
              collaborative research and applications. Three fundamental systems performance
              concerns are considered for supporting a wide mix of workloads and applications
              of these collaborative activities: locality management, resource conflicts, and
              resource reduction. Seven specific projects have been identified: (1) toolkits
              and interfaces for explicit control of disk resources, (2) parallel file
              system, (3) virtual memory support for memory-intensive computations, (4)
              distributed shared memory, (5) cluster virtual storage, (6) data compression,
              and (7) predication for locality management. The workstation cluster
              instrumentation is necessary to perform state-of-the-art experimental research
              on methods to make the cluster viable for next-generation collaborative
              computing. The proposed cluster testbed is indispensable for conducting the
              research. The instrumentation is both the vehicle for and the subject of
              research.  ***
