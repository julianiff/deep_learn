Abstract    :
              9512708  Cummins    The proposed U.S.-Brazil collaborative research will use 
              experiments with a class of materials closely related to  metallic alloys to
              test a recently advanced non-steady-state  theory of interface evolution. 
              Based on materials  discovered in 1965 but using techniques of videomicroscopy 
              and computerized image analysis, the relevant  characteristics of the interface
              profile and solute  concentration field will be observed, extracted, and 
              analyzed.  The project, led by Herman Cummins at CUNY in New  York and Oscar
              Mesquita at the Universidade Federal de Minas  Gerais in Belo Horizonte,
              Brazil, will use equipment  available at both sites.  A second objective will
              be to  investigate the nature of the planar-to-cellular  bifurcation, with
              potential implications for materials  preparation and design.    The research
              addresses a question of both theoretical and  practical importance using the
              latest methods.  The ability  to attack complex, non-linear problems of the
              nature  proposed has only developed in the past few years, opening  the way for
              the proposed research.  The project pairs U.S.  and Brazilian investigators
              with experience in related  problems, promising valuable results.    ***
