Abstract    :
                   This proposal is submitted for funding the purchase of a tabletop 
              ultracentrifuge. This type of centrifuge is particularly useful for the 
              isolation of cellular fractions and purification of nucleic acid  samples,
              where small volumes, high speed and short spin times are  required. The
              instrument will be used in three major projects:    (1) Membrane preparation:
              isolation and reconstitution of bacterial  membrane fractions will be performed
              in the context of the  electrophysiological study of Escherichia coli porins
              and other  bacterial ion channels.  (2) Isolation of RNA by cesium gradient
              centrifugation will be  performed from embryonic explants in the context of the
              study of gene  regulation during neural induction of Xenopus embryos.  (3) RNA
              will be isolated by cesium gradient centrifugation from  zebrafish pineal
              glands in studies of gene regulation by light and the  circadian clock        
              The productivity and success of our research efforts will be  greatly enhanced
              by the acquisition of the proposed instrument, which  will allow us to perform
              procedures that are not feasible with the  present state of our
              instrumentation.
