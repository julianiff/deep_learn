Abstract    :
              This proposal is for studies in, "The Nonstationary  Nanoworld:  The Mechanical
              and Optical Properties of  Localized States in Molecules".  The program calls
              for  investigations of the optical and mechanical properties of  nonstationary
              states in small molecules that exhibit both  classical and quantum behavior. 
              The states will be created  in the vibrational degree of freedom of a diatomic
              molecule  using ultrashort pulse laser technology and will be detected  via the
              time- and frequency-resolved spectrum of spontaneous  emission.  This will be
              used to completely reconstruct the  quantum state.
