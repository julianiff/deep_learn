Abstract    :
              The investigator proposes an interdisciplinary (i.e., aeronomy,  atmospheric
              chemistry, environmental engineering, etc.)  research/teaching laboratory to be
              developed at the University of  Michigan for long-term, experimental studies of
              global change.   This laboratory has two major goals:  (1) to provide a
              long-term  data base of comprehensive surface, lower atmosphere, and upper 
              atmosphere parameters measured from a single location, providing a  unique
              "cross sectional" and interdisciplinary record of the  changing environment,
              and (2) to provide a teaching laboratory for  both graduate and undergraduate
              levels, enabling important hands-on  experiences in global change research.***
