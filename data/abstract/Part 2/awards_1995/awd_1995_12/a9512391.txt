Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to purchase a Fisons Plasma 54 mass spectrometer
              (MS) which will offer rapid analysis and high precision for a variety of
              isotope ratio studies. The PI's are particularly interested in using the MS for
              large numbers of  U/Th and Sr/Ca ratio determinations in coral reef samples and
              of anthropogenic Pb in urban environments. The Fisons MS is capable of greatly
              increasing the speed of analysis, while maintaining the high precision of
              thermal ionization mass spectrometry which is normally used to analyze such
              samples. In addition, the ICP source's higher ionization temperature greatly
              increases the ionization of the more refractory elements, thereby allowing the
              analysis of many elements that were not susceptible to this type of analysis
              before. Analysis of these samples will contribute to our understanding of
              paleoclimates, global change, and environmental contaminants.
