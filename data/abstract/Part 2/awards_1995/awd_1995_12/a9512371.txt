Abstract    :
              The San Francisco State University (SFSU) Department of Physics  and Astronomy
              will acquire a versatile dilution refrigerator  system dedicated to the testing
              of low temperature elementary  particle detectors fabricated by physics
              Master's students at  SFSU and by collaborating researchers and Ph.D. students
              at  nearby institutions including Stanford University (SU), Lawrence  Livermore
              National Laboratory (LLNL), and the University of  California at Berkeley
              (UCB).  These novel detectors will  achieve unparalled sensitivity and
              resolution by sensing  quasiparticles, phonons, and electron-hole pairs
              generated by  collisions of incident particles with nuclei and electrons in 
              superconducting and insulating crystals.  The initial goals of  the research
              effort are to develop detectors for dark matter  searches, neutrino
              experiments, and X-ray astronomy  measurements.  As the technology matures,
              additional  applications are likely to include  measurements of ultralow alpha
              radioactivity in bulk materials,  Xray fluorescence for trace elements.
