Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT      Proposal: 9512197  PI: Lynn, D.G.       Institution: University
              of Chicago    This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will
              help the Department of Chemistry at the University of Chicago acquire consoles
              for a 500 MHz, 300 MHz, and 400 MHz NMR.  The research activity to be supported
              includes:     1.  mechanism of protection by heat shock proteins   2. 
              Chameleonic Amphiphilic Peptides   3.  the structure and mechanism of
              nucleic-acid binding proteins (including metal-binding            motifs such
              as Zn fingers) and of nucleic acid   4.  basic chemistry of homogeneous
              catalysis   5.  Synthesis, Structures, and Properties of Catenated Group 14
              Molecular Frameworks   6.  Conformationally Well-Defined Polymers and
              Micro-phase Separated Block Copolymers      Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              Spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to the chemist for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
              to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to
              state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out
              frontier research.  The results from these NMR studies are useful in areas such
              as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
