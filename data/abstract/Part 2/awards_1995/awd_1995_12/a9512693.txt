Abstract    :
              This proposal calls for the development of a, "Femtosecond X-  ray Source for
              Probing Structural Dynamics of Materials on  an Atomic Scale".  The scientific
              objective of this proposal  is to develop a prototype tunable ultrafast x-ray
              source  generating 200 fs pulses with 106 photons per second in the  1A
              wavelength regime.  This new instrument will enable one  to directly probe the
              structure of materials on an atomic  spatial dimension with ultrafast time
              resolution.  The  ability to directly observe the movement of atoms associated 
              with phase transitions, coherent vibrational motion,  chemical reactions, and
              surface phenomena, will provide a  fundamental new understanding of the
              mechanisms which drive  these processes.
