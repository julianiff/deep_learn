Abstract    :
              9512428  Chin       The scope of this proposal covers the study of the 
              energetics, structures, excitations, impurity distribution  and final-state
              interactions in helium droplets, the  thermodynamics, quark condensate, and
              collective modes in a  hot pion gas, the collective excitation and dynamic 
              structure function of finite nuclei, and the development of  new algorithms for
              sampling wavefunctions with cusps.  Students in this project will not only
              learn physics, but  will also be trained in the highly useful art of doing 
              quantum Monte Carlo calculations on parallel supercomputers.  ***
