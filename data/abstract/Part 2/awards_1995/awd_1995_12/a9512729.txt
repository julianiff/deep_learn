Abstract    :
              9512729  Aizenman       It is common experience that physical structure found 
              on one scale, is a manifestation of collective modes of a  much finer complex
              system with many more degrees of freedom.  Fluids which microscopically consist
              of particles, Brownian  motion, etc.       Remarkably, often the physics of the
              coarser scale is  expressed through simple autonomous laws, and symmetries not 
              found in the finer description.  The proposed research will  analyze
              mathematically the emergence of such "scaling  limits",  in the context of a
              number of models of  statistical mechanics, and field theory.  Particular 
              attention will be devoted to the mathematical analysis of  the large scale
              features seen in critical systems.       Another topic of study will concern
              the effects of  quenched disorder, which quite often modifies the 
              characteristics of vibration modes, electrical conduction  properties, and the
              nature of phase transitions.       The study aims at reaching both physical
              understanding  and mathematically satisfactory means of analyzing  significant
              phenomenon these fields.  ***
