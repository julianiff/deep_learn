Abstract    :
              9512454  Adjouadi    This proposal requests a confocal microscope, a high-speed
              video motion analyzer, and two dedicated processors which will complement the
              existing Onyx multiprocessing supercomputer with four R8000 RISC processors.
              The integrated equipment will bring new research dimension in real-time vision,
              cognition, and 3-D modeling with real-world applications. Research
              collaboration has been established with Coulter Corporation in analysis and
              classification of blood cells, with Baptist Hospital of Miami in surgical
              planning and nuclear medicine, and with the University of Florida's Center for
              Intelligent Machines in robot vision, motion analysis, and telerobotics. New
              visual/sensing techniques will be developed and used in these projects for high
              sensitivity and resolution, real-time motion analysis, real-time 3-D rendering
              and visualization, and on-chip 3-D surface reconstruction and depth extraction.
