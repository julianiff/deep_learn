Abstract    :
              The Institute for Mathematics and its Applications at the  University of
              Minnesota will hold a three week conference on  Molecular Minimization Aspects
              of Large-Scale Optimization.  The third week will be devoted to molecular and
              structural  optimization, in particular, the global minimization  problem. The
              conference will bring together two scientific  communities (the biological,
              biochemical and biophysical and  the mathematical programmers) which have much
              to discuss  together but have yet to develop a common language and  conceptual
              framework. Issues which will be addressed  include:         1. New algorithmic
              advances for global minimization in          protein folding;       2. Global
              molecular conformation problems;       3. Electrical impedance tomography;     
               4. Problems with multiple local minima; and       5. Parallelization and the
              use of high performance          computers.    The discussions will attempt to
              (I) identify the precise  physical problems from the practioners point of view;
              (ii)  determine the available methods for attacking these  problems; and, in
              the long term (iii) narrow the gap between  the two.
