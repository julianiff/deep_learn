Abstract    :
              9512266  Jordan    The proposed project is to provide a central,
              high-performance, and network-based computational facility with high-quality
              graphics, visualization and animation capabilities for the needs of faculty and
              graduate students in sciences. The facility supports a large number of diverse
              research projects in scientific and mathematical disciplines. Four general
              types of research are identified, namely; (1) compute-intensive, (2) algorithm
              development and applications, (3) data analysis, visualization and animation,
              and (4) modelling simulation. The computational environment encourages an
              interdisciplinary approach which brings together the common elements of
              research projects in the Departments of Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics,
              Geology and the multi-disciplinary Center for Complex Systems. An important
              consequence of the proposed project is that it will not only enhance the
              current faculty and student research and education but that it will act as a
              catalyst for new collaborations with the College of Science.  ***
