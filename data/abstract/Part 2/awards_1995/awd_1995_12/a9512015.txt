Abstract    :
              IBN-9512015  Simon, Neal      The expression of aggressive behavior by males is
              regulated through  the activity of hormonal and neurochemical systems within
              the  brain.  The key messenger molecule in the brain involved in  aggressive
              behaviors appears to be the indolamine, serotonin, which  decreases aggression.
               In addition, a key hormonal component  involved in aggression is the
              androgenic hormone, testosterone,  which facilitates behavioral expression.  
              Dr. Simon will define  whether and how testosterone modulates the ability of
              serotonin to  decrease aggression.  To determine the relationship between these
               important messenger molecules the ability of testosterone to  modulate the
              behavioral effects of serotonin, the site of  testosterone action within the
              central nervous system, and the  ability of this potent androgen to alter
              serotonin binding  characteristics will be investigated.  These investigations
              will  produce exciting new information about the neurochemical and 
              neuroendocrinological  interactions involved in aggressive  behaviors in
              animals and humans.
