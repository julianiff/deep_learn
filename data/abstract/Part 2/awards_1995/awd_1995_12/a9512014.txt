Abstract    :
                This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in numeric
              computation with researchers Shantanu Dutt, Vipin Kumar at the University of
              Minnesota and Catherine Roucairol at the Rocquencourt campus of INRIA (the
              French National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Applied
              Mathematics).  The objectives of their research are to develop highly parallel
              branch-and-bound algorithms for solving combinatorial optimization problems
              (COPs) and software for optimization computations on parallel computers. 
              Branch-and-bound algorithms are used widely in solving combinatorial
              optimization  problems that appear in a variety of applications  like computer
              vision, robot motion planning, and integer programming and computer-aided
              design of very large scale integrated circuits.  These problems take a long
              time to solve.  The U.S. investigators propose to develop time and memory
              efficient techniques for solving these problems using parallel processing.  The
              U.S. investigators bring to this research their expertise in parallel computing
              and techniques for solving COPs using distributed memory machines and
              workstation clusters.  This is complemented by the French investigator's
              expertise in operations research and her work on branch-and-bound algorithms
              techniques suitable for shared-memory multiprocessors.
