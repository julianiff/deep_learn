Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9512541    A three-component fiber optic Phase Doppler Particle
              Analyzer/Laser Doppler Velocimeter (PDPA/LDV) which will be acquired for
              non-intrusive measurements of two-phase flow.  The PDPA/LDV system will enhance
              current research projects at the university, and will provide opportunties for
              a multitude of new collaborative and interdisciplinary efforts.  Research
              programs include gas-solid flows and the modulation of gas-phase turbulence in
              the presence of particles, turbulence studies using Planar Laser Induced
              Fluorescnence, combustion research and turbulent mixing phenomena, chemigation
              research, and flow characterization in plasma etch systems.  ***
