Abstract    :
              9512807  Sen  Description:  The US-Indo Workshop, "Deccan  Trap Volcanism and
              its Impact on Climate", will  take place at the Mahabaleshwar hill station 
              from January 25-30, 1996.  The co-organizers  are Gautam Sen, Florida
              International  University and K.V. Subbarao, Indian Institute  of Technology,
              Bombay.  The Deccan Trap giant  lava formation marked the end of the Mesozoic 
              (Dinosaur) era and the dawn of the Cenozoic  (Mammal) era.  There is worldwide
              interest in  studying the origin of Deccan Trap lavas and  the impact of this
              major event on the earth's  climate and ecology.  The workshop will access  the
              current state of Deccan Trap research,  identify research priorities, and form
              working  groups for the appropriate research areas.    Scope:  The event is
              locally sponsored by the  Geological Society of India.  Indian  participants
              include the National Geophysical  Research Institute, the Physical Research 
              Laboratory, and the Geological Survey of India.   NSF will provide support for
              six key  U.S.  participants who are considered critical to the  success of the
              workshop.  Proceedings will be  published.   ***
