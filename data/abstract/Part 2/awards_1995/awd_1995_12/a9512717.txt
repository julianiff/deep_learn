Abstract    :
                                                                              This is a three
              year award proposed by Dr. Chung-Chiun Liu,  the Case Western University and
              Dr. Yao Cheng, the  Synchrotron Radiation Center (SRRC) in Hsinchu, Taiwan.
              This  proposal requests travel funds to support research  cooperation between
              these two institutes for exploring and  developing the application of deep
              X-ray lithography in the  formation of microsensors and other microstructures. 
              The  LIGA process, first developed in Germany, has demonstrated  unique
              capabilities for creating a wide variety of  microstructures through precision
              lithography.  It is an  important technology and can have a major impact on
              many  aspects of modern life.  The integration of LIGA, sensors  and actuators
              can benefit a large range of microfabrication  industries.   The number of
              investigators engaged in this  area of research is limited in the United
              States.  Dr. Liu  is an expert in the microfabrication of sensors, uniquely 
              suited for carrying out this cooperation.   The synchrotron  system in Taiwan
              is a state-of-the-art facility and will  provide beam time and structure
              flexibility for this  project.  This is a unique opportunity not generally 
              available from the U.S. facilities.   This project is  jointly funded by the
              Taiwan National Science Council, which  is providing the logistical costs,
              while the NSF supports  the investigator's travel.
