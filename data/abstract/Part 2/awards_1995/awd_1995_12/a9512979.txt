Abstract    :
                  Abstract  9512979  Joseph             The aim of this planning grant is to
              identify genes which are uniquely expressed in response to agents which
              activate the sphingomyelin pathway.   The sphingomyelin is degraded to ceramide
              which then activates a protein kinase that is involved in the immune response,
              inflammation and apoptosis.  In this proposal the technique of differential
              display reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction will be used to isolate
              the genes that are induced or altered in response to treatment with ceramide.  
              These genes will then be amplified, cloned and identified.          This
              research will attempt to identify the genes expressed in response to the
              activation of the sphingomyelin pathway, which in turn will permit further
              studies on the role of this path.  ***
