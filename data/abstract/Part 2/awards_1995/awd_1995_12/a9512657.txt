Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Paul Ho  University of Texas Austin  Proposal No. CTS-9512657      Two
              Central facilities will be created on campus, the Ultra High Vacuum facility
              (Scanning Electron Microscopy, Scanning Tunneling and Atomic Force Microscopy
              with development of Nearfield Scanning Optical Microscopy) and the ambient
              probe system (including Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy) for studying wet
              surfaces.  Sixteen faculty are involved for seven departments, which cut across
              both science and engineering.  Some of the proposed state-of-the-art
              instruments were originally developed by the principal investigators, and
              development of new extensions are proposed.    The Ultra High Vacuum Facility
              will be used to investigate fundamental properties of semiconductor devices and
              chemical catalysis.  The ambient probe facility will characterize materials
              which cannot be fabricated under vacuum, such as polymer films.  Both photonic
              and magnetic materials with implications for information storage will be
              investigated.  Another area of focus will be biological research.  The project
              will establish state-of-the-art imaging capabilities for advanced materials
              research and education.
