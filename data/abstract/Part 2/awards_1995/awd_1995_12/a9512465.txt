Abstract    :
                9512465  Penzien    This award provides funds to permit Dr. Joseph Penzien,
              Professor  Emeritus, Department of Earthquake Engineering, University of 
              California, Berkeley, to conduct with Professor Chang-Koon Choi,  Department of
              Civil Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of  Science and Technology (KAIST),
              a U.S.-Korea Joint Seminar on  Civil Infrastructure System (CIS) Research. 
              This joint seminar  will be held in Seoul, Korea, September 25-28, 1995.  The 
              participation of fourteen U.S. scientists/engineers will be  supported under
              this award. The joint seminar will have several  major interest areas including
              the following: structural analysis  and design; better performing structural
              materials;  transportation systems; tunnel and underground structures; 
              lifeline systems; sensoring, monitoring and control; management,  maintenance,
              and rehabilitation; and social and economic  considerations.    CIS research is
              one of NSF's seven primary strategic research  areas.  It is an area of
              increasing importance, especially in  East Asia where infrastructure
              development is expected to keep  pace with growing economic power.  The PI and
              his Korean  collaborator are exceptionally well qualified to organize and 
              conduct such a joint seminar.  Both are top scholars who are  internationally
              renowned for their academic and professional  achievements.  The PI has been a
              member of the National Academy  of Engineering since 1977.  Dr. Choi recently
              received the  prestigious National Engineering Medal awarded by the Korean 
              government.  Both collaborators have successfully organized past  international
              meetings.  This project is relevant to the  objectives of the U.S.-Korea
              Cooperative Science Program which  seeks to increase the level of cooperation
              between U.S. and  Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of 
              scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through 
              collaboration on problems of mutual interest and benefit.  Korean 
              participation is supported by the Korea Science and  Engineering  Foundation
              (KOSEF).  Other East Asian participants will be  supported from other sources.
