Abstract    :
              9512831  Zelevinsky       The proposed research is aimed at clarification of key
               problems in collective phenomena and quantum chaos.  Quantum  chaotic dynamics
              is a common phenomenon in many branches of  physics.  The knowledge accumulated
              in the model studies has  to be applied to realistic quantum systems.  The
              first steps  are already carried out in physics of atoms, molecules and 
              disordered solids.  Nuclear structure and reactions give a  generic example of
              a quantum many-body system with strong  interaction where we can make progress
              both in understanding  quantum chaos and in specific problems of nuclear
              physics.       The applications include onset of chaos in nuclei;  common
              features and differences between "one-body" and "many-  body" chaos;
              coexistence and complex interplay of regular  and chaotic dynamics; damping of
              collective motion; phase  transitions, thermalization and decoherence in a
              closed  mesoscopic system with no external heat bath; chaotic  dynamics and
              collectively in an open system with finite  lifetime and in loosely bound
              nuclei; enhancement of weak  interactions in compound states.  Application to
              other  systems including random meson fields and the structure of  physical
              vacuum also should be explored.
