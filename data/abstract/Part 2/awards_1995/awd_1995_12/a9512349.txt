Abstract    :
                                                     This award from the Academic Research
              Infrastructure Program will help the Department of  Chemistry at Columbia
              University acquire upgrades for a 300 MHz and a 400 MHz NMR  Spectrometer.  The
              research activity to be supported includes: designing, synthesizing, and 
              analyzing the reactivities of synthetic analogues of such molecules;
              synthesizing inorganic,  organic, and organometallic materials whose structures
              and properties are novel, and analyzing  new photochemical and metal-mediated
              processes.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most
              powerful tool available to the  chemist for the elucidation of the structure of
              molecules.  It is used to identify unknown  substances, characterize specific
              arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the  dynamics of
              interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR 
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. 
              The results from  these NMR studies are useful in areas such as polymers and
              catalysis, and in biology.
