Abstract    :
                  9512324  Kumar    A scanning electron  microscope and x-ray diffractometer
              will  be acquired and utilized for multi-disciplinary research and  education
              at the University of South Alabama. These are two  basic pieces of
              instrumentation for materials research. The  scanning electron microscope
              permits analysis of the  microstructural characteristics of materials whereas
              the X-ray  diffractometer identifies their crystallographic structural 
              properties. The instrumentation will be used in support of  several research
              programs which include laser deposition and  processing of hard coatings and of
              high temperature  superconductor films, synthesis and characterization  of 
              molecular sieve zeolites and of metal doped glassy carbon for 
              electrocatalysis, and development of crystal growth inhibitors  for medicinal
              purposes. The instruments will also be used to  support curriculum development.
              Students in the Materials  Science Laboratory will utilize the instruments for
              several  experiments on the relationship between structure, properties,  and
              processing of materials.  %%%  The scanning electron microscope and X-ray
              diffractometer are  essential instruments for materials research. Both are
              entry  level instruments, quite appropriate for undergraduate and  masters
              level education and research programs. As such they  will have a substantial
              positive impact upon the infrastructure  at the University of South Alabama.
