Abstract    :
              9512438  Veblen    This Academic Research Infrastructure grant provides $680,000
              as  one-half support of the costs of acquiring and installing a new 
              high-resolution transmission electron microscope with a field  emission gun
              (FEG-HRTEM) at The Johns Hopkins University.  Matching funds will be provided
              through the Keck Foundation.  Funding is split between the Earth Sciences
              Facilities and  Instrumentation Program's ARI allocation and Engineering's
              Civil  and Mechanical System's ARI allocation in amounts of $570,000 and 
              $110,000, respectively.  The need for HRTEM facilities at Johns  Hopkins
              University extends beyond traditional departmental and  divisional boundaries
              and includes a broad range of engineering  and scientific disciplines.  This
              microscope will be the keystone  of an interdepartmental/interdivisional
              electron microscopy  laboratory that will benefit Hopkins researchers in
              biomedical  engineering, chemical engineering, chemistry, earth and planetary 
              sciences, environmental engineering, materials science and  engineering,
              mechanical engineering, and physics.  Specifically,  a 300 keV atomic
              resolution TEM with a field emission gun capable  of point-to-point
              characterization of material at the nanoscale  (<0.2 nm) and equipped with a
              high current probe capable of  extremely high resolution (~ 1 nm) chemical
              analyses will be  acquired and installed.  Development of many advanced
              materials  and the advancement of fundamental understanding in environmental 
              chemistry, geochemistry, and physics are occurring at nanometer  or even atomic
              dimensions and research in these areas is highly  dependent on the ability to
              observe and characterize solids at  these length scales.  Examples of specific
              research projects that  will be conducted in the new electron microscopy
              facility are  processing and characterization of nanoscale materials, 
              dislocation core structures in intermetallic alloys,  environmental chemistry
              (addressing sorption of toxic metals and  other pollutants on soil minerals), 
              development and  characterization of rare-earth magnetostictive materials, 
              nanoscale observations of porous semiconductors, the  identification of failure
              mechanisms in materials with  applications to manufacturing processes, and
              investigations in  crystal chemistry and geochemistry.      ***
