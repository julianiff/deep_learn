Abstract    :
                                              9512730  Chuang      This is a two year award
              proposed by Dr. Steven Chuang, the  University of Akron and Professor Ivan Lin,
              the Fu-Jen  Catholic University in Taiwan.  This proposal requests funds  to
              support a Ph.D. graduate student for one month at the Fu  Jen University in
              Taiwan to work with Professor Ivan Lin,  and for the P.I.'s travel to Taiwan. 
              The investigators  propose to use in situ infrared spectroscopic techniques to 
              analyze reaction mechanisms of carbonylation. This is an  important project for
              developing the highly active and  selective catalysts for carbonylation of
              nitrocompounds.  The chemical industry considers the carbonylation reaction 
              the most promising environmentally benign process to replace  the conventional
              method of isocynate synthesis from the  reaction of phosgene.  The development
              of environmentally  benign chemical processes has been a priority area in the 
              NSF.  Furthermore, this project also provides opportunities  for a U.S.
              graduate student to have international research  experience at a university in
              Taiwan .
