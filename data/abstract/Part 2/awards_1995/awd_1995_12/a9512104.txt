Abstract    :
              9512104  Becchetti  Studies of nuclear reactions induced by unstable,
              short-lived  nuclear particles will be carried out, providing insight into how 
              the elements are formed in supernova and in the Big Bang.  The  latter takes
              place on short time scales and involve the type of  nuclear reactions to be
              studied in this work.  These studies bear  on the origin and nature of dark
              matter.  The synthesis of yet  unknown types of nuclei an atoms will be pursued
              and their  characteristics studies.  These are topics of great current 
              interest within the field.  The experiments will be performed  primarily at the
              National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory  (MSU, E. Lansing, MI) and at the
              University of Notre Dame Nuclear  Science Laboratory (South Bend, IN). 
              Specially designed large  superconducting magnets and associated nuclear
              particle imaging  detectors will be utilized in the experiments.  Both graduate
              and  undergraduate students will participate in the development and 
              utilization of this equipment.  The students trained in this  research will
              acquire a broad range of "hands-on" scientific  skills to permit them to pursue
              careers in any of several areas  related to academic and industrial research,or
              teaching.  ***
