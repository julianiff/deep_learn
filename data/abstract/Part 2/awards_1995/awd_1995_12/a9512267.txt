Abstract    :
                    This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will help the
              Department of  Chemistry at Creighton University acquire a 300 MHz NMR
              Spectrometer with variable  temperature control and broad-band detection
              capabilities.  The research activity to be supported  includes: (1) extended
              conjugate addition chemistry; (2) Structural/conformational studies of 
              ring-expanded nucleosides; (3) Si-Csp interactions in silylalkynes; (4) The
              reactivity of S2 with  organometallic complexes; (5) Mechanism-based
              inactivation of phospholipase A2; (6) Synthesis  of calcitonin gene-related
              peptide, (7) Synthesis of bicyclic octahydroisoquinolines as  thromboxane A2
              antagonists, and (8) Synthesis od saturated and bicyclic dopamine receptor 
              ligands.      Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most
              powerful tool available to the  chemist for the elucidation of the structure of
              molecules.  It is used to identify unknown  substances, characterize specific
              arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the  dynamics of
              interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR 
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. 
              The results from  these NMR studies are useful in areas such as polymers and
              catalysis, and in biology.
