Abstract    :
              9512841  DiSalvo    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research in solid state chemistry and materials research between Francis J.
              DiSalvo at Cornell University and Jean Rouxel at the Institute of Materials,
              University of  Nantes.  The objective of their research is to determine the
              structure and properties of sulfide compounds.  The project also involves the
              chemistry of the Mott insulator and synthesis of a new compound with a linked
              network of metal clusters.  The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration
              expertise in the synthesis and characterization of new compounds.  This is
              complemented by French expertise in the structure and properties of solid state
              oxides and chalcogenides.
