Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9512517    Caltech has established the Center for Quantitive
              Visualization (CQV) which serves as a focus organization and coordinates
              imaging developments and applications.  The personnel participating in the
              Center, who will be involved in this project, represent an interdisciplinary
              team with expertise in many areas of imaging, high-speed data-acquisition and
              storage, and  imaging-processing.    The development and acquisition of
              advanced imaging instrumentation falls in two broad categories:  (1) high-speed
              image acquisition systems, and (2) advances in image-processing, storage, and
              graphics systems.  It is intended to extend the presently-available, state-
              of-the-art in this field, resulting in new, nationally and internationally
              unique capabilities.    An attempt is made to balance the greater risks of
              development versus acquisition by the much more capable technology that would
              result.  This endeavor is shared by industrial and governmental partners, such
              as the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, EPIX, Inc., General Pixels, Inc., Boeing Co.
              and Baxter Healthcare, Inc.    The activities of the CQV and the proposed
              infrastructure project form an integral part of the educational and research
              environment at Caltech, with broad and intense participation by students,
              faculty, visitors, and staff.  Furthermore, this center will serve equally as a
              bridge between university and industry by providing the means for transfer of
              technology and science, between academia and industry, and by preparing
              students for the industrial work environment.         ***
