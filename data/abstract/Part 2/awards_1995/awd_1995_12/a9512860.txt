Abstract    :
              9512860  Cuenca    This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research
              in soil hydrodynamic modeling between Richard H. Cuenca at Oregon State
              University and Rafael Angulo-Jaramillo at the Laboratory for Hydrology Transfer
              and Environment, French National Center for Scientific Research, Grenoble,
              France.  The investigators propose to develop an accurate model for soil water
              content and soil hydrodynamic characteristics at different scales and in
              conjunction with experimental programs.    The U.S. and French teams will use
              data from experimental projects, including HAPEX-Sahel (Hydrologic-Atmospheric
              Pilot Experiment) and BOREAS  (BOReal Ecosystem-Atmospheric Study).  The
              results from this research are applicable to flood control, drought alleviation
              and monitoring of water resources.  The project takes advantage of French
              expertise and access to important and unique data.
