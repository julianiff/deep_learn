Abstract    :
              9512751  Frankel  Recent technological advances in genetic techniques have now
              made  it possible to begin to analyze the biology of complex mammalian  traits.
               The aim of this conference is to bring together  researchers with knowledge of
              different complex trait systems to  formulate ideas for defining a realistic
              strategy for advancing  this emerging field. The Jackson Laboratory, a renowned
              center for  genetic research, which will be the site of the workshop.  The 
              organization of the workshop will offer the opportunity for the  participants
              to engage in discussions concerning the latest  technologies, their own work
              using these methods, and the potential  impact of complex trait analysis on the
              field of Developmental  Biology and Neuroscience.
