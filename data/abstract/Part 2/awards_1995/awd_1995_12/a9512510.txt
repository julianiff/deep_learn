Abstract    :
                This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will help the
              Department of  Chemistry at Texas A&M University acquire upgrade Bomen DA3-002
              Spectrometer, upgrade  and components for Bomen DA8-002, and IBM RS6000/550
              computer.  The research activity  to be supported includes:  (1) Potential
              Energy Surfaces of Non-Rigid Molecules; (2)  Rovibrationally Resolved FTIR
              Supersonic Jet Spectroscopy of Weakly Bound Complexes  Transient Species and
              Chemical Reactions; (3) Molecular Modeling from Infrared  Spectroscopic Data.  
               A tunable infrared spectrometer can provide important information about
              chemical reactivity.   Its use may enable breakthroughs in our understanding of
              the properties of reactive and  nonreactive molecules.
