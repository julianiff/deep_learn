Abstract    :
              9512264  Doyle    A multi-technique surface analysis system  with initial 
              capability for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and  scanning Auger
              microscopy  (SAM) will be acquired by the  University of Alabama-Tuscaloosa. 
              This fundamental capability  does not now exist at the Tuscaloosa campus and is
              part of the  University commitment to its materials science program.  The 
              equipment will be located in a central analysis facility which  serves major
              materials research programs at the University, most  notably the Center for
              Materials for Information Technology  (MINT).  The MINT is a multidisciplinary
              research program  focusing on new materials for flexible magnetic media and
              heads,  two areas in which the power of SAM/XPS will be directly  beneficial. 
              The combination of XPS and SAM in one instrument  allows for the determination
              of near surface chemical composition  (SAM) and composition gradients (SAM),
              depth profiling (SAM),  chemical bonding (XPS), chemical states (XPS), and
              functional  groups (XPS).  The instrument will support research programs in 
              high magnetization and high coercivity films and particles,  coupling in
              magnetic trilayer structures, giant magnetoresistance  in multilayered
              structures, wear and corrosion of magnetic media,  and metal matrix composites,
              among others.  %%%  The multi-technique surface analysis system will fulfill a 
              fundamental need of several programs in materials research on  campus and will
              thus have a large impact on the academic  infrastructure.  It will allow
              faculty to propose more  comprehensive, and therefore more competitive,
              materials research  proposals, and will provide students with hands-on training
              with  a state-of-the-art tool.  This instrument will also expand  opportunities
              for cooperative research with industrial sponsors.  ***
