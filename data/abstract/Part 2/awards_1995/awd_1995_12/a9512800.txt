Abstract    :
              9512800  Manchester    This U.S.-Eastern Europe workshop on paleobotanical
              topics will  precede the fifth "International Organization of Paleobotany" 
              conference being held in Santa Barbara, California, during June  30-July 5,
              1996.  Organized by Dr. Steven Manchester of the  University of Florida,
              Florida Museum of Natural History, the  workshop will feature definition and
              development of new joint  research projects between U.S. participants and
              counterpart  Hungarian, Czech and Polish scientists who are attending the same 
              conference.  The topics to be discussed will feature floristic  evolution and
              biogeographical interchange through geologic time.  The workshop is expected to
              yield ideas for new collaborative  research that will extend and promote the
              U.S. research  community's access to unique geologic sites and paleobotanical 
              expertise in Eastern Europe.  Resulting international research  proposals will
              be considered by the National Science Foundation  on a competitive basis.  ***
