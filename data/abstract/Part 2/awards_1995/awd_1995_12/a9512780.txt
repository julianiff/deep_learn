Abstract    :
                  9512780  Xu    Modern information technology has reduced the distance
              between  American and Chinese colleagues in terms of scholarly  exchanges,and
              it is predictable that a lot more future scholarly  communication between the
              two parties will occur through the  international computer network or
              information highway.  Language  barriers present severe problems in
              communication because the  Chinese language is incomprehensible to the majority
              of American  colleagues and most Chinese people do not speak English.  
              Bilingual (English-Chinese) database management systems provide a  solution to
              overcome the language barrier because such systems  can simultaneously present
              the same piece of information in two  language formats, while archiving the
              original data without  distortion.  Co-funded by the U.S. National Science
              Foundation  (#INT9312146) and the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation 
              (#39410121144), a prototype of English-Chinese botanical database  system has
              been developed by the investigators of this proposal,  and a sample of
              bilingual collection data from Sun Yatsen  University herbarium (SYS) has been
              made on line through the  Southeast Regional Floristic Information System
              (SERFIS) at the  University of Alabama since March 1995.  Users can query this 
              bilingual data set through the Internet computer network.  Most  American
              botanists are not aware of bilingual database management  systems, and the
              majority of Chinese colleagues are still  isolated from the modern information
              world.  Therefore, a joint  workshop for bilingual botanical information
              management between  American and Chinese colleagues is proposed at the
              University of  Alabama by the end of 1995.  The workshop will present to 
              participants the concepts and proven practices in bilingual  botanical
              information management, in addition to several existing  botanical information
              systems in the U.S., including Specimen  MAnagement System for California
              Herbaria (SMASCH), SERFIS, and  Biodiversity Information Management Sy stem
              (BIMS/INBio).  It is  expected that this workshop will promote the development
              of  botanical information systems in both U.S. and China, and it will 
              facilitate the scholarly exchanges between American and Chinese  botanists.
