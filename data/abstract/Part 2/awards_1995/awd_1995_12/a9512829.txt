Abstract    :
              9512829  Dawes    This Americas Program award will fund collaborative research 
              between Dr. Clinton J. Dawes, University of South Florida,  and Dr. Daniel
              Robledo, Centro de Investigaciones y de  Estudios Avanzados del I.P.N., Mexico,
              on the physiology and  cultivation of the seaweed Gracilaria cornea.  The
              species,  occurring along the Yucatan coast of Mexico and in the lower  Keys of
              Florida, contains a commercially important  phycocolloid, agar.  As a result of
              experiments to be  conducted, strains showing high growth rates, useful 
              morphotypes, and high yields of quality agar will be  selected.  It is expected
              that the information resulting  from the proposed research will benefit those
              countries  where algae are used as food or as raw material for the agar 
              industries.    There is a potential need for developing new sources of high 
              quality agar in the world.  More than 80% of the raw  material for agar used in
              the U.S. is imported from distant  countries.  Thus, there is an important
              demand for agar from  adjacent countries such as Mexico.  This project,
              combining  the expertise of the U.S. scientist in seaweed physiology  and
              cultivation, with the knowledge of local seaweeds of his  Mexican counterpart,
              may lead to the development of a new  seaweed mariculture industry, that could
              provide the raw  material for North American agar production.  ***
