Abstract    :
                                    Physical maps of whole chromosomes  have placed an
              essential role in a number of           fundamental breakthroughs in genetics.
              The  completion of high resolution physical maps of           three model
              genetic systems, Aspergillus nidulans,  Neurospora crassa, and Magnaporthe     
                   grisea, and of other fungi such as Nectria  haematococca, is likely to
              open up new avenues of           research on the molecular and evolutionary
              genetics  of fungi. By building a 29 kilobase (kb)           resolution
              physical map of the A. nidulans genome,  we have made the striking observation 
                       that there is an alternating banding pattern in the  distribution of
              repeated sequences along the           chromosomes of A. nidulans. This
              observation has  implications for development, functional          
              organization of genomes, chromosome structure and  function, recombination, and
              genome           evolution. In this proposal we plan to specify and  acquire a
              robotics system for physical           mapping which will enable several
              laboratories to  ascertain whether or not other filamentous           fungi,
              such as N. crassa and M. grisea, share this  banding pattern in repeated
              sequences           along their chromosomes. This robotics system will  be
              maintained by the Fungal Genome           Resource (FGR) at the University of
              Georgia and  will serve the fungal genetics community           as a whole by
              providing an array of new  experimental strategies to address a broad class of 
                       problems in fungal ,genetics.
