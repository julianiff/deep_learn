Abstract    :
              With partial support from the National Science Foundation Dr. Roger Koenker will
              establish an econometrics laboratory at the University of Illinois. Equipment
              to be purchased includes 1 Sparc 20-612 Unix Workstation, 6 Sun xterminals, 2
              Pentium 102, 1 HP printer and related software. The proposed laboratory would
              significantly expand the existing computing resources available to both faculty
              and students in econometrics. This is particularly true for graduate students,
              many of whom are currently severely constrained. Faculty would also benefit
              from this increased computing power which would facilitate research on
              questions such as semiparametric econometric models, problems of robustness in
              estimation and inference, and nonlinear time series analysis. Econometrics is a
              computer intensive science and provision of this equipment will significantly
              strengthen a first rate research and teaching group.
