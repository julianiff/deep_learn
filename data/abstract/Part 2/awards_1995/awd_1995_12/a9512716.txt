Abstract    :
              ***  9512715  Johnson  This grant supports research in particle physics by a 
              faculty member, a graduate student and an undergraduate  student.  They are
              members of a team studying neutrino-  nucleon interactions at the Fermilab
              Tevatron accelerator.  The goals sought are precision determination of basic 
              electroweak interaction parameters, tests of certain  predictions of
              strong-interaction quantum chromodynamics and  extended information on the
              structure of nucleons.  ***
