Abstract    :
              9512783  Hanlin    This Americas Program award will support collaborative 
              research between Dr. Richard Hanlin of the University of  Georgia, and Dr.
              Miguel Ulloa Sosa of the Universidad  Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), to
              conduct studies on  the taxonomy and distribution of Mexican ascomycetes.  The 
              ascomycetes constitute the largest of the major group of  fungi and are
              important ecologically as primary decomposers  of plant debris, and
              economically as the causal agents of  serious crop and human diseases.  It is
              proposed to study  the distribution and occurrence of ascomycetes in tropical 
              forests of southern Mexico, with emphasis on species  associated with higher
              plants.    These studies are of great urgency in view of the rapid  destruction
              of tropical habitats.  The data obtained from  this project will add to our
              knowledge of the distribution  and identity of tropical ascomycetes, and will
              permit  comparison of the Mexican forest mycobiota with that of  other tropical
              areas similarly studied.  In addition to  contributions to mycology, ecology,
              and plant pathology, the  results from this work will help to increase our 
              understanding of the biodiversity of tropical forests.  ***
