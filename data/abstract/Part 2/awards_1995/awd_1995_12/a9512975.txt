Abstract    :
              9512975  Genack    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research in condensed matter physics between research groups at Queens College,
              City University of New York, and University of Nice.  The collaboration is led
              by Azriel Z. Genack in the United States and Patrick Sebbah in France.  The
              objective of their research is to measure the intensity and actual field
              distribution in microwave propagation in disordered solids.  They propose to
              relate their research to the interconnectedness of diverse phenomena such as
              atmospheric communication, medical imaging, and electronic conduction in
              disordered solids.  The French theorists are experts in quantum chaos while the
              U.S. investigators are experimentalists with expertise in wave localization .
