Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Dendy E. Sloan  Colorado School of Mines  9512228    The Colorado
              School of Mines proposes to establish a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              Laboratory to meet the growing teaching and research needs of the CSM campus. 
              The proposed NMR laboratory will be primary exemplar of the way a major
              instrumental resource can inter-relate research of scholars in diverse fields. 
              The facility will both serve a thriving research community and be used to
              enrich undergraduate and graduate education.  In addition it will be a resource
              facility for local industry.    It is proposed to acquire a dual probe
              solids/liquid NMR spectrometer:  on probe assembly will support liquid phase
              samples while the second will support solid state samples.  This arrangement
              will provide the most economical method of studying both types of instrument
              will be upgraded and brought on line.  The later instrument will be used in
              several courses offered on campus.
