Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to evaluate, purchase and test a Coastal Circulation
              Radar System (CCRS), a portable land-based radar system for measuring surface
              currents in the coastal ocean.  This is a system is capable of providing near
              real-time maps of surface current over the coastal ocean as frequently as once
              every 20 minutes.  Depending on its mode of operation, the radar has a maximum
              range of 45 km with 1 km resolution or 12 km range with 250 m resolution.  This
              system will support various projects including studies in the GLOBEC and CoOP
              programs. Funding is provided by the ARI program with cost sharing by OSU.
