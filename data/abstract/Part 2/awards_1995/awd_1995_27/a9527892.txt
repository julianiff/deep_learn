Abstract    :
              9527892  Luo   In a CAREER project with both research and education components,
              Dr. Zhexi Luo of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History and the University of
              Pittsburgh is studying new fossils of early mammals, mostly from China, and
              using Computer Tomography (CT) methods to acquire internal anatomical
              characters for comparative phylogenetic analyses. The three-dimensional
              graphical CT methods allow non-destructive sampling of fossils that might
              otherwise be rare or inaccessible to detailed study. Reptilian forms usually
              placed in the "cynodonts" are thought to represent animal groups from which the
              first true mammals evolved. New fossil findings in China have provided much new
              material of these animals, some with cranial remains that provide features of
              the nasal, orbital, sphenoidal, and ear regions. Changes in the structure of
              the skull attendant on the evolutionary transition to mammals likely relate to
              functional changes in feeding, respiration, olfaction, and hearing. With access
              to these new fossils through colleagues in China and elsewhere, the PI is in an
              excellent position to acquire new and potentially decisive data bearing on
              structural and functional changes in the early evolution of mammals from
              reptilian cynodonts.   This paleontological research is to be conducted with
              the help of undergraduate students enrolled in programs both at Carnegie Museum
              and at University of Pittsburgh, where the PI will be working with colleagues
              in biology and geology to establish new teaching and research programs in
              systematic biology and vertebrate paleontology. Students will have access to
              the impressive collections at the Carnegie Museum, along with associated
              curatorial expertise, while retaining valuable pedagogical links at the
              University.
