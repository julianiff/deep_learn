Abstract    :
              9527667  Muench         The proposed project is a multi-institutional integrated
               study of the outflow of newly formed bottom water from the  Weddell Sea and
              its dispersion into the South Atlantic Ocean.  It  builds upon earlier
              successful studies of the inflow of  intermediate water masses into the Eastern
              Weddell Sea, their  modification within the Weddell Gyre, and their interaction
              with  bottom water formation processes in the western Weddell Sea.  The  study
              is called Deep Ocean Ventilation Through Antarctic  Intermediate Layers
              (DOVETAIL) and includes six components  involving hydrographic measurements,
              natural tracer experiments,  and modeling studies.  The study will be centered
              east of the  Drake Passage where water masses from the Weddell Sea and the 
              Scotia Sea come together in the Weddell-Scotia Confluence, and  will be carried
              out in cooperation with the national antarctic  programs of Germany and Spain. 
                   The study has four related objectives.  The first is to  assess the
              quantity and the physical and chemical characteristics  of  Weddell Sea source
              waters for the confluence.  The second is  to describe the dominant processes
              associated with spreading and  sinking of dense antarctic waters within the
              Weddell-Scotia  Confluence.  The third is to estimate the ventilation rate of
              the  world ocean, and the fourth is to estimate seasonal fluctuations  in the
              regional ocean transport and hydrographic structure and to  assess the likely
              influence of seasonal to interannual  variability on rates of ventilation by
              Weddell Sea waters.       Ventilation of the deep ocean -- the rising of
              sub-surface  water masses to the surface to be recharged with atmospheric 
              gases and to give up heat to the atmosphere -- is a uniquely  antarctic
              phenomenon that has significant consequences for global  change by affecting
              the global reservoir of carbon dioxide, and  by modulating the amount and
              extent of seasonal sea ice in the  southern hemisphere.       This component of
              DOVETAIL will make the hydrogr aphic  observations along various transects
              through the region, and  deploy moored current meter arrays in the confluence
              zone in  cooperation with complementary German and Spanish moorings.  ***
