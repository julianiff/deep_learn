Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT    K. Mopper & D. Kieber  OPP 9527255 & OPP 9527314    PHOTOCHEMICAL
              AND OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF ANTARCTIC WATERS IN  RESPONSE TO CHANGING UV-B FLUXES
                 The decrease in stratospheric ozone over the Antarctic  results in an
              increase in the UV-B flux in the euphotic  zone. The increase leads to cellular
              damage to aquatic  organisms, as documented by photo-inhibition and decreased 
              productivity. Cellular damage can occur either  intracellularly, or externally
              at the cell surface from  biomolecular reactions with externally-generated
              reactive  transients. The extent of this extracellular damage will  depend on
              the photochemistry of the seawater surrounding the  cell. Until recently,
              nothing was known about the type of  photochemical processes, rates, and steady
              state  concentrations of transients in Antarctic waters. It is  proposed that
              field experiments be performed which will  allow the construction of predictive
              models of photochemical  production rates in surface waters and with depth.
              These  studies will involve further quantum yield measurementts,  development
              of a sensitive underwater actinometer system,  and use of a new underwater
              multichannel photometer. The  model will allow the prediction of the impact of
              varying  levels of UV-B on the photoproduction and steady state  concentration
              of several key reactive transient species in  the upper water column. In
              addition to this effort,  experiments will also be performed to study the 
              photodegradation of dissolved organic matter and to  determine whether
              biologically utilizable substrates that  are formed photochemically can enhance
              secondary  productivity in Antarctic waters.
