Abstract    :
              ***  9527453  Newman    The fields of developmental and evolutionary biology are
              both undergoing ferment. The vast progress in the last few years in
              characterizing the genetic mechanisms involved in embryonic development has
              demonstrated unexpected degrees of functional redundancy and overdetermination
              in these processes. In addition, evolutionary studies have revealed surprising
              extents of homoplasy and other forms of parallel morphological evolution in
              disparate lineages, as well as evidence that extensive morphological diversity
              appeared much earlier in the history of multicellular life than previously
              thought. These phenomena have raised new questions concerning the relationship
              between gene activity and the generation of biological form, and have suggested
              to some that the solution to these puzzles will emerge with the development of
              a new parardigm for understanding the evolution of developmental systems. It is
              the purpose of this symposium on "Determinants of Morphological Evolution" to
              bring together investigators in the areas of developmental and evolutionary
              biology whose work evidences an appreciation of the connection between these
              disciplines, and physical scientists working in the areas of morphogenesis of
              condensed materials, to discuss questions of the genetic, epigenetic, physical
              and life history determinants of the evolution of biological form. The
              invitation by the organizers of the Fifth International Congress of Systematic
              and Evolutionary Biology to present a symposium on these subjects represents an
              encouragement to such interdisciplinary activity, and the site of this meeting,
              in Hungary, will help foster communication among groups of scientists with
              traditionally different approaches to the study of biological form.  ***
