Abstract    :
              Peck       In this multidisciplinary project, the investigator at Ithaca 
              College and his colleagues Guckenheimer and others at Cornell  University focus
              upon studies of the stomatogastric ganglion.  This  small neural network with
              approximately 30 neurons is a central  pattern generator that coordinates
              movement of the gastric mill  and pylorus of crustacea.  The investigators
              construct  compartmental models of individual neurons based upon experimental 
              measurements and amalgamate these into models for subnetworks.  These systems
              provide a testbed for the development of algorithms  to explore the
              bifurcations of dynamical systems.  Particular  attention is given to those
              aspects of the systems that involve  multiple time scales.       The goal of
              the project is to improve understanding of  dynamical processes in biological
              systems, with an emphasis upon  neural systems.  The investigators work in a
              multidisciplinary  setting, combining experiment and mathematical modeling,
              giving  due attention to both mathematics and neuroscience, and ensuring  that
              the two interact at all times in the work.  The larger goals  are pursued in
              the context of specific systems, namely the study  of a small neural circuit
              that controls rhythmic motions in the  foregut of lobsters.  This model system
              has been chosen for its  modest size and accessibility for experimental
              manipulation.  The  project aims to understand how neural systems switch among
              motor  patterns and how they regulate these patterns.
