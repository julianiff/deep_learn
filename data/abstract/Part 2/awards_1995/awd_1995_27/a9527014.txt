Abstract    :
              9527014  Watson  The objective of the proposed research is to increase our
              understanding of accessory minerals (particularly zircon) in the physiochemical
              environment of the mid- to lower-crust.  This project will include a
              combination of experiments, analyses of natural materials and numerical
              modeling.  Several sub-projects are planned, including: (1) continuation of
              lattice diffusion measurements by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy on the
              parent and daughter isotopes of key isotopic systems (U-Pb, Sm-Nd, Lu-Hf); (2)
              calibration of geothermometers involving zircon coexisting with a phosphate
              mineral; (3) numerical modeling of crystal growth and dissolution and the
              processes that lead to chemical zoning; (4) imaging of internal structures
              (e.g. zoning, overgrowths) and correlation of these features with in situ
              isotopic analyses; and (5) development of cathodluminescence spectroscopy (CL)
              in combination with electron microprobe analysis as a means of identifying and
              distinguishing the origin of various growth regions within individual zircons. 
              The proposed work will provide the tools and insights needed to take full
              advantage of accessory minerals as recorders of the timing and temperature of
              crustal events.
