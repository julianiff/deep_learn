Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Shannon  9527983    The PI plans to investigate the validity of
              Planck?s Law in the presence of high electrical fields.  Blackbody emission
              from a concentric cylinder Hohlraum with applied steady and high-frequency
              voltage will be measured.  Applications to temperature measurement during high
              power and fast transient laser materials processing are envisioned.
