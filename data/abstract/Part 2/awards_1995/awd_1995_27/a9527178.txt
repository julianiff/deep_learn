Abstract    :
                The Virtual World Data Server is a multi-user, distributed, real-time data
              server intended   for very large virtual environment simulations. The heart of
              this system is the Real-Time   Storage Server (RTSS). The RTSS is designed to
              efficiently store and retrieve large   amounts ( > 1 terabyte) of spatially
              distributed heterogeneous data. The RTSS   communicates over high speed
              asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) connections with   multiple interactive
              real-time simulations. It establishes a two-way link with each active  
              simulation in order to determine where the current viewing position is and
              where the viewer   is headed. The RTSS makes a determination of what
              3-dimensional information is needed,   retrieves that information from disk in
              an optimized fashion and delivers it to the simulation   in a just-in-time
              manner.  The RTSS is complemented by an advanced three-dimensional   visual
              simulation system. Together these two systems are capable of supporting a
              variety of   demanding applications including (but not limited to) urban
              planning, medical, emergency   response, physics, architecture and urban
              design. This system promises to dramatically   improve the way that cities are
              planned and scientific and medical experiments are   visualized. It allows
              community members and interested citizens to understand and evaluate   the
              impact of policy and planning decisions and it provides capabilities for
              scientists to   visualize datasets over 100 times larger than that which is
              possible today.
