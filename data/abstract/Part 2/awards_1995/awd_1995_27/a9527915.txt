Abstract    :
              Ants are among the most abundant and ecologically dominant animal groups in the
              majority of terrestrial ecosystems, in terms both of numbers of species and of
              individuals. In addition, ants are relatively taxonomically well known among
              invertebrate groups. This sytematic and ecological importance confers upon ants
              a high status among biodiversity indicator taxa. In leaf litter, there may be
              as many as 150 species of ants per hectare; this number is sufficient to allow
              for calculation of standard biodiversity measures. The ALL (Ants of the Leaf
              Litter) workshop, funded by this award from the Biotic Surveys & Inventories
              and International Programs of the NSF in cooperation with the International
              Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI), the Species Suvival Commission
              of the World Conservation Union (SSC-IUCN) and other sources, will build a
              collaboration among 19 experts from all parts of the world  (9 from the US)
              that will 1) optimize and standardize quantitative collecting techniques, 2)
              prioritize the tasks involved in cataloging and describing leaf litter ants, 3)
              formalize a comprehensive research agenda for the future, 4) set up a global
              network of leaf-litter samples in order to build a comparative database on the
              Internet, and 5) produce a handbook to assess the biological diversity of ants,
              especially leaf-litter ants.  The workshop will be held in Brazil, and will be
              followed by a separately funded training course for local students, in which
              the protocols developed by the group of experts during the workshop will be
              immediately communicated. The protocols, handbook, and database that emerge
              from the workshop will be made available via the Internet.
