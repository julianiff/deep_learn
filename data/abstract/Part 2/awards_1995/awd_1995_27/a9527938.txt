Abstract    :
              9527938  MAYDEN   The sturgeon family of bony fish (Acipenseridae) includes
              several species of commercial value, long sought after by humans of many
              cultures.  Nearly all of these species are in need of immediate conservation
              measures.  Among the most imperiled are sturgeon species in the subfamily
              Scaphirhynchinae, genera Scaphirhynchus and Pseudoscaphirhynchus.  The
              subfamily is endemic to North America and Central Asia.  Conservation efforts
              are hampered by an inadequate knowledge of the taxonomy, systematics and
              ecology of these fish, in particular by the uncertainty of species boundaries
              and the likelihood that undescribed species are present.   This proposal is an
              international partnership among scientists of the United States, Russia and
              Uzbekistan.  Principal investigators Mayden and Birstein, with their
              colleagues, will examine morphological characteristics of sturgeon in the
              subfamily Scaphirhynchinae, and use these characters to evaluate, and revise
              where necessary, the taxonomy and systematics of these fish.  The revised
              taxonomy will then more effectively inform conservation activities.
