Abstract    :
              9527439  Small  Partial support is provided to sponsor the '96 Hole-Burning  and
              Related Spectroscopies" (HBRS) meeting to be held in  Brainerd, MN during
              September 13-17, 1996. This conference  will be the fifth in a series which
              began in 1987 but the  first request to NSF for funding. It is the major 
              international gathering for researchers who use hole burning  and related
              frequency and coherent time domain  spectroscopies to understand the
              relationships between  disorder, electronic/vibrational structure and various 
              dynamical processes in complex solids and those who use the  basic science to
              develop advanced application concepts. The  conference will address several
              important issues. They  include a firmer understanding of the physics
              associated  with practical high temperature hole burning and better  approaches
              to the design and fabrication of the "ideal" hole  burning medium, a
              microscopic description of the two-level  systems which dictate the properties
              of glasses at low  temperatures, convincing demonstration that the 
              spectroscopic and dynamical properties of "single" molecules  are consistent
              with those of an ensemble and further  demonstration of how line-narrowing and
              single-molecule  spectroscopies combined with external fields can improve our 
              understanding of intermolecular interactions. The conference  topics reflect
              the interdisciplinary and fundamental-applied  nature of the HBRS meeting.  The
              meeting provides a superb  learning experience for graduate students and
              postdoctoral  fellows. Not only do they interact with leading scientists  from
              around the world, they will be exposed to science from  several disciplines and
              are stimulated to think about the  applications of basic research.  %%%  The
              technological impact that is resulting from these  studies of structural
              disorder and electronic structure and  dynamics in glasses, polymers and
              proteins is large.  Advanced applications such as frequency and time domain 
              optical storage, and chemical sensing are examples of  sign ificant
              developments.  ***
