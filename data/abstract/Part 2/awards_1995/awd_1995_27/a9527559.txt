Abstract    :
              SBR-9527559  Upton/Chattopadhyay     This doctoral-dissertation-improvement
              award supports archival and field research into the mid-nineteenth-century
              change in the reality and perception of Calcutta as a city.  Earlier research
              has allowed the investigators to propose that the change coincided with
              socio-economic changes in the city (namely, the rise of a Bengali middle class)
              that affected the urban morphology and image.  These changes, in turn, may have
              affected subsequent city planning and investment patterns.     The research
              will be carried out via archival research in London and in Calcutta, using
              travel journals, letters, newspaper and journal articles in English and in
              Bengali, along with photographs and sketches to provide insights into the
              natures of the built environment in nineteenth-century Calcutta.  In addition,
              the research will entail field observation of historic buildings in
              representative sections of contemporary Calcutta.   The project should result
              in a case study of the interaction of social change, land-use change, and
              popular image in a colonial setting.  These interactions have relevance to
              contemporary urban social change in culturally heterogeneous settings.
