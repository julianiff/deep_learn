Abstract    :
              9527754  Sites    This award will support the incorporation of 4.5 million
              specimens of aquatic invertebrates collected over 33 years by the Missouri
              Department of Conservation into the Wilbur R. Enns Entomology Museum of the
              University of Missouri.  These specimens are the basis for a database that
              associates invertebrate species presence and density with a suite of habitat
              characteristics.  The specimens and the associated database are an extremely
              important resource for systematic, faunistic, and ecological studies of Ozark
              Plateau wetlands; for analysis of water quality; and for documentation of the
              invertebrate biota. Funds from this award will provide specimen housing and
              curation, as well as updating of the database. Both specimens and database will
              be used by the University of Missouri Entomology Department (in both research
              and education), the USDA Biological Control of Insects Laboratory, the Missouri
              Departments of Agriculture, Conservation, and Natural Resources, and the
              National Park Service. Funding of this project is by NSF in partnership with
              the University, the Missouri Department of Conservation, and the National Park
              Service.
