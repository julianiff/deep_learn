Abstract    :
              This award supports a study to determine the sequence and  chronology of events
              that led to the development of the Antarctic  ice sheet.  A continental-scale
              ice sheet probably first  developed in East Antarctica close to the
              Eocene-Oligocene  boundary under temperate climatic conditions.  The purpose of
               this project is to determine, from landscape analysis (with a  numerical
              chronology), when (and why) these early temperate  conditions gave way to a
              polar environment in Antarctica.  From  previous field work and recent
              photographic analysis, an  extensive relict landscape (older than 17 million
              years) with  landforms and erosional features characteristic of temperate 
              glaciation has been delineated.  This relict landscape has been  called the
              Sessrumnir erosion surface and it extends over three  degrees of latitude and
              covers almost 10,000 km2 in three fault  blocks of the Transantarctic Mountains
              (Convoy, Dry Valleys,  Royal Society).  It is on this relict land surface that
              data will  be collected which record Middle and Early Miocene glacial  history
              and paleoclimate.  The results should allow an  identification of the
              transition from temperate to polar  conditions.  This work will involve
              landscape analysis,  stratigraphy of glacial deposits, and Argon-40/Argon-39
              dating of  volaanic ashfalls.  Denudation rates will come from fission-track 
              analyses and from exposure-age analyses of bedrock surfaces and  erratic
              boulders.  The overall results will elucidate the origin  and stability of the
              polar Antarctic cryosphere.
