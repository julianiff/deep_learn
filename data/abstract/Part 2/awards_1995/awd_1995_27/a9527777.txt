Abstract    :
              9527777  Francois       This project will generate global maps of deep-sea
              calcite  burial over the last 30,000 years, using fluxes of calcite  calculated
              from 230-Th accumulation.  The results combined with  models of alkalinity will
              be used to evaluate the role of deepsea  burial of calcite in the global carbon
              cycle.  ***
