              -------------------------------  Hi Cliff --    Here is my stab at the abstract
              you requested.  Mike Pace and I are still   working on the budget.    Bob   
              DEB-95-27405:  "Do top-down and bottom-up controls interact to exclude  
              nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria from the plankton of estuaries?"             
              Eutrophication and phytoplankton production are frequently limited  by nitrogen
              in estuaries and by phosphorus in lakes.  One reason for this   striking
              differences is a difference in nitrogen fixation.  In lakes when   nitrogen
              availability is low, nitrogen-fixing organisms bloom and help   alleviate the
              nitrogen deficit by fixing molecular nitrogen into   biologically available
              forms.  In most estuaries, no such response occurs.   This proposal tests the
              hypothesis that low availabilities of trace metals   (Fe and Mo) in estuaries
              relative to lakes leads to slow growth rates of   nitrogen-fixing organisms,
              leaving these organisms vulnerable to   consumption by animals, and thereby
              preventing nitrogen fixation.  In   preliminary experiments with tanks full of
              seawater, the investigators   successfully grew nitrogen fixing organisms by
              keeping animal populations   low.  This was the first time nitrogen-fixing
              organisms of the sort common   to lakes were found in estuarine water anywhere
              in North America.  The new   research will build on these tank studies to more
              completely test the   hypothesized difference between lakes and estuaries.
