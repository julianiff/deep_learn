Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9527118  Howes    This award is to establish a collaborative
              research effort between the University of Connecticut Center for Grinding
              Research and Development and Rutgers University Center for Ceramic Research. 
              The research has the goal to generate fundamental scientific and engineering
              understanding of low cost, low damage abrasive micro-machining for ceramics. 
              The aim is to conduct studies to improve the speed and efficiency of the
              abrasive micro-machining process and to increase the quality of the surface. 
              Well characterized high-tech ceramic materials are being subjected to grinding
              using several techniques.  The effects of maching characteristics, such as
              energy input and grinding rate are being determined.  The effects of grinding
              on the mechanical properties of the ceramics are being determined.  The effects
              of the grinding on the surface of the ceramic are being measured using electron
              microscopy, x-ray diffraction, laser Raman, fractography, and field emission
              scanning electron microscopy.
