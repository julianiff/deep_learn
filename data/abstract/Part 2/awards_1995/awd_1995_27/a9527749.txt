Abstract    :
                9527749  Schimel  The proposed research investigates the impact of plant
              chemical inputs on soil microbial processes in the Alaskan taiga forest. 
              Studies will focus on tannins produced by alder and balsam poplar, two species
              that form part of the successional sequence in the floodplain forests of
              Alaska.  Tannins of varying chemical structure will be isolated from these
              species and added to soils from both alder and poplar sites. Their effects on a
              suite of microbial processes including respiration, nitrogen mineralization,
              and enzyme activities will be measured.  The specific structure of the
              chemicals will be linked with their biological activities to improve our
              understanding of the ecological function of these chemicals.  Tannins will be
              applied from each species to each soil to determine whether the microbial
              communities can adapt to the chemicals coming in.  These studies will greatly
              improve our understanding of how plants affect the soil processes that control
              nutrient availability and therefore plant succession in the Alaskan taiga.  We
              will improve our understanding of forest community dynamics, controls on litter
              quality and decomposition, plant-microbe interactions, and the role of
              microbial community composition in ecosystem function.
