Abstract    :
              9527781  Lovett  This project addresses the role of insect outbreaks and
              nitrogen deposition in controlling the cycling and loss of nitrogen from forest
              ecosystems. Crucial long-term data sets on gypsy moth abundance, forest
              defoliation, and nutrient cycling in upland oak forests of southeastern New
              York State will be maintained. These forests are subject to periodic gypsy moth
              outbreaks as well as elevated atmospheric deposition of nitrogen from nitrogen
              oxide pollution. In addition, an experiment is proposed which will clarify the
              role of nitrogen availability and defoliation in regulating nitrogen loss, and
              will hasten the effects of nitrogen accumulation that would occur over a much
              longer time period from atmospheric deposition. The hypothesis being tested
              states that because of their nitrogen limited vegetation and high
              immobilization potential in the soil, oak forests will initially show only
              small nitrogen losses after defoliation. However, as nitrogen accumulates in
              the forests from atmospheric deposition or fertilization, the amount of
              nitrogen lost after defoliation events will increase. The results of this study
              will elucidate the role of ecosystem nitrogen accumulation in controlling
              nitrogen losses after defoliation, and will help evaluate the interactive
              effects of insect defoliation and elevated nitrogen deposition, two
              simultaneous stresses affecting northeastern forests.
