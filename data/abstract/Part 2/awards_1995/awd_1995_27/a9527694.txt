Abstract    :
              This research deals with the development of a new scalable volume  visualization
              architecture and its associated algorithms.  The  architecture, called Cube-4,
              exploits parallelism and pipelining to  achieve real-time rendering of
              high-resolution images from volume  data.  The architecture is based on an
              algorithm for ray casting of  a volume buffer of voxels which is stored as a
              skewed distributed  memory to support conflict-free access to voxel structures.
               It  performs interpolation of sampled points, shading, and compositing  to
              generate the pixel values.  Computations are done using limited  communication
              between processors, so that the architecture is  scalable over a wide range of
              performances and image resolutions.   This project encompasses algorithm
              development, architecture  research, and construction of a reduced-resolution
              prototype.
