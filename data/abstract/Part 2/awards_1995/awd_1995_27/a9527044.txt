Abstract    :
              9561604  Kendall     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is
              involved with the direct electrosynthesis of two types of commercially
              important, high value-added carbohydrate intermediates. The first
              transformation to be studied is the oxidative decarboxylation of a sugar acid,
              as exemplified by conversion of D-gluconic acid (or salts thereof) to
              D-arabinose. The second transformation is the cleavage of a 1,2-diol to a
              dicarbonyl compound, as exemplified by the conversion of mannitol diacetonide
              to 2,3-isopropylidene-D-glyceraldehyde; this reaction is customarily
              accomplished using sodium periodate, but a direct synthesis would be preferable
              from both cost and environmental standpoints. Both D-arabinose and
              isopropylidene glyceraldehyde are important and useful intermediates in their
              own right, but in order to demonstrate the generality of the processes studied,
              each process will be extended to another substrate.  For each of the specified
              processes, a number of anode materials will be evaluated in Phase I; in
              addition, the effects of solvent and pH will be examined. Some small-scale
              optimization studies will also be carried out on a selected process. Upon
              successful completion of the Phase I work, Phase II studies would include
              further optimization and evaluation of the processes in flow cells, as well as
              extension to other substrates.   The availability of clean, efficient methods
              for the synthesis of aldopentoses and for the cleavage of 1,2-diols will allow
              for the cost-effective manufacture of a wide range of valuable chemical
              intermediates. This will provide benefits to the US chemical and pharmaceutical
              industries.
