Abstract    :
              9527749  Bultman  The presence of an endophytic fungus is often associated with
              enhanced survival and reproduction of the host grass.  Because insect
              herbivores often cause less damage to grasses infected by the fungi compared to
              grasses lacking the fungal associates, the grass-fungus association has been
              described as a defensive mutualism.  A hypothesized mechanism for this defense
              may be fungal-produced alkaloids that can be toxic to insects.   The proposed
              study specifically tests if the advantage of endophyte infection to grasses is
              due to enhanced resistance to insects following plant damage.  Laboratory
              experiments manipulating nutrient levels, plant damage, and fungal infection
              will be conducted using Chewings, hard, and tall fescues and perennial
              ryegrass.  Plant tissue will be fed to fall and true armyworm larvae and their
              growth and survival monitored to assess the presence and magnitude of base
              level and wound-induced resistance in fungal-infected and fungal-free plants. 
              The level of plant protein nitrogen and alkaloids will also be monitored to
              help interpret differences in insect performance among experimental treatments.
               Biomass gain and consumption of the two insect herbivores will be assessed to
              further evaluate mechanisms responsible for treatment effects on insect
              performance.  The economic significance of fungal endophytes of grasses is well
              documented.  The fungi, and the toxins they produce, have detrimental effects
              on livestock that translate to annual revenue losses of over $600 million in
              the US.  The proposed research, by providing information on the basic ecology
              of grass endophytes, should assist efforts to manage them in agricultural
              settings.
