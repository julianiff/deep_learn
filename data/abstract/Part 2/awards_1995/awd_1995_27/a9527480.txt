Abstract    :
              Abstract  EEC-9527480    This award provides funding to Boston University for
              support of a Combined Research-Curriculum Development Program entitled, "PRIDE:
              Photonics Research in Interdisciplinary Education."  The CRCD program
              emphasizes the need to incorporate exciting research advances in important
              technology areas into the upper level undergraduate and graduate engineering
              curricula and stimulates faculty researchers to place renewed, equal value on
              quality education and curriculum development. This three year program will
              create three levels of photonics modules to enrich standard core, specialized
              elective, and design courses of the upper division undergraduate and early
              graduate curricula.  The interdisciplinary faculty team along with industry
              collaborators, will develop integrative learning experiences using modern
              research in holistic problems, requiring analysis, innovation, synthesis, and
              integration.  Modules will be based on and demonstrated by recent photonics
              research, including photonic materials and devices, optical data storage,
              optical communications, displays and photonics systems.  ***    ??
