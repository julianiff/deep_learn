Abstract    :
              9527467  KNOX  The Research Vessel NEW HORIZON, owned by the University of 
              California, San Diego, is operated primarily in support of NSF  funded
              oceanographic research.  The ship requires a mid-life refit  to ensure
              continued productive service throughout her planned  service life.  Placed in
              service in 1978, the ship has operated in  excess of 17 years.  This project
              will support improvements and  upgrades to the vessel in the following areas:  
               Resolution of long term stability restrictions,    Replacement and overhaul of
              obsolete or deteriorated equipment,  machinery and systems necessary to ensure
              reliable operations,    Upgrades of science equipment and support systems to
              allow conduct  of increasingly complex missions, and    Habitability
              enhancements.    The project is under the direction of Dr. Robert A. Knox,
              Associate  Director, Ship Operations and Marine Technical Support and Captain 
              Thomas S. Althouse, Marine Superintendent, Scripps Institution of 
              Oceanography.  ***
