Abstract    :
              9527304  Scalapino  This project is for work on the physical properties of 
              strongly interacting many electron systems.  It includes  numerical (using
              variety of techniques, MonteCarlo, density  matrix renormalization group and
              transfer matrix  diagonalization) calculations for the Heisenberg, Hubbard  and
              t-J models describing fermions confined to coupled  chains and/or planes.  The
              goal of this work is to obtain a  clearer physical understanding of the basic
              mechanism  responsible for the magnetic, charge-density and pairing 
              correlations and how these correlations give rise to the  observed physical
              properties of strongly correlated  materials.  There are further proposals for 
              phenomenological analyses that help elucidate the insights  gained from the
              numerical calculations.  %%%  Some of the recently discovered magnets and
              superconductors  are either chain-like (fibrous) or planar (flake) in their 
              properties.  The underlying materials are often the novel-  synthetic
              materials.  This theoretical study will help  understand the properties and
              will be critical to potential  applications of the novel synthetic materials.
