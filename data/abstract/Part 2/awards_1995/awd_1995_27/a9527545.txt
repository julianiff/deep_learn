Abstract    :
                EEC-9527545  Muller    This award is to establish a cooperative/collaborative
              research program between The Pennsylvania State University Center for
              Dielectric Studies Industry/University  Cooperative Research Center and the
              University of California at Berkeley Sensor and Actuator Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center in the area of lead zirconate titanate dielectrics
              for microelectromechanical devices.   The center at the University of
              California is working on surface micromachined devices and the design of
              microsystems and components.  The center at The Pennsylvania State University
              is working on the physics of thin-film dielectric, piezoelectric and
              ferroelectric materials.  In this program the institutions are sharing
              expertise and facilities with the goal of improving the performance of
              piezoelectrically-activated microdevices through the implementation of highly
              active piezoelectric films in microelectromechanical devices.
