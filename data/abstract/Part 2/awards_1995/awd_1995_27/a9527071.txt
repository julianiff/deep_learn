              Upgrade of UCLA's UNIDATA Node    Funds will upgrade the Internet Data
              Distribution (IDD) node at the  Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the
              University of California  at Los Angles (UCLA).  Upgrading the computer power
              and memory will  allow better support of existing and future sites with minimum
               impact on activities locally at UCLA.  UCLA will serve as a short  term data
              archive sight to provide the community with data in the  event of services
              interrupted at other sights.
