Abstract    :
                Kyle  OPP 9527329    Abstract  The Cape Roberts Project is an international
              drilling project to  obtain a series of cores from the sedimentary strata
              beneath the  sea floor off Cape Roberts in the Ross Sea.  The project is a 
              joint venture by scientists from the national Antarctic programs  of Germany,
              Italy, New Zealand, the United Kingdom., Australia,  and the United States. 
              Drilling will continuously core a  composite section of sediments over 1500 m
              thick which is  expected to represent parts of the time period between 30 and 
              more than 100 million years ago.  The principle objectives of  this component
              of the project will be to examine the record of  igneous material in the drill
              core and provide high precision  40Ar/39Ar dates from tephra (volcanic ash)
              layers, disseminated  ash,  feldspars and epiclastic volcanic detrital grains
              to  constrain depositional age and provenance of the sediments in the  cores. 
              This project will contribute to general geologic logging  of the core and will
              characterize any igneous material using  electron microprobe, x-ray
              fluorescence (XRF) and instrumental  neutron activation analysis (INAA)
              analyses.  The presence of  alkalic volcanic detritus from the Cenozoic McMurdo
              Volcanics  will constrain the initiation of this phase of volcanism and 
              improve our understanding of the relationship between volcanism  and tectonism.
               The influx of sediments eroded from Jurassic  Kirkpatrick Basalts and Ferrar
              Dolerites will be used to time the  unroofing and rates of uplift of the
              Transantarctic Mountains.  Geochemical analyses of core samples will examine
              the  geochemistry and provenance of the sediments.
