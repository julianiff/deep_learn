Abstract    :
              We propose a three year project to investigate the role and consequences of
              changes  in climate, land use, vegetation, and soils of the temperate grassland
              ecosystems of Asia and North  America.  The objective of this study is to
              characterize the factors controlling ecosystem integrity  relative to changes
              in climate and land use of North American and Asian grasslands, and to
              understand  these changes relative to the presence and distribution of C3 and
              C4 species in these two regions.  Although plant productivity tends to be
              greater for the same amount of rainfall in the Asian  continent, the occurrence
              of C4 species in the Asian grasslands is greatly reduced compared to the  North
              American grasslands.  They will incorporate isotopic analysis of soils and
              vegetation across a  gradient of rainfall and temperature in Asia and compare
              these to similar  analyses collected in North  America.  This information will
              be integrated using the CENTURY ecosystem model to investigate 
              climate-soil-land use interactions on soil and vegetation dynamics.  Isotopic
              signature  813C will be  compared across sim ilar topo-edaphic positions of
              plant communities in different regions of the two  continents.  Remote sensing
              will provide the land cover template to evaluate the degree of changes  from
              natural vegetation.  These differences will be used in conjunction with the
              CENTURY model to  evaluate net changes in ecosystem properties at the regional
              scale and the susceptibility of these  grasslands to climate change and human
              activities.
