              Experiences for Undergraduates:  Undergraduate Internship Program in
              Biophysical Computing and Computational Dynamics    This Research Experiences
              for Undergraduates project will support nine students per year in programs
              carried out during the summers, for three years.  The program's objective is to
              promote and help support undergraduate involvement in ongoing and new research
              in biophysical computing and computational dynamics and new software
              development efforts for scientific computing and graphics support for such
              research, as well as to carry out interesting and useful research. 
              Undergraduates will work with faculty on a wide variety of projects.  The
              Supercomputer Institute, an interdisciplinary research program spanning all
              colleges of the University, provides a focal point for the project and arranges
              sessions at which the students working on various subprojects share their work,
              visit each others' labs, and learn about related work.  ***
