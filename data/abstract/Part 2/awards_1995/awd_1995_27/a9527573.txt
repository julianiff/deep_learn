Abstract    :
              The PI will experiment with a variety of atmospheric phenomena,  such as
              aurorae, Venus nightglow, lightning and space vehicle  reentry, particularly
              pertaining to the lowest excited state of  nitrous oxide.  He will measure loss
              rate coefficients for a  variety of quenchers over a large range of vibrational
              levels.   Further, the PI will investigate details of energy transfer 
              processes between nitrous oxide quartets and doublets in high  vibrational
              levels, and develop methods for studying low  vibrational levels.  Finally, he
              will investigate the reactivity of  this state with molecular oxygen and
              nitrogen to determine whether  oxygen and nitrogen atoms are produced.***
