Abstract    :
              This award continues the development and testing of interactive multimedia
              courseware modules on social, ethical, and professional issues that arise from
              computing technology.  Multimedia `HyperCard stacks` combine video clips, sound
              bites, graphics and text.  The three modules under development focus on the
              history of computer ethics, issues of professional responsibility, and issues
              of access and equity for persons with disabilities.  The modules explore
              important concepts from the perspectives of disciplines engaged in study of
              these issues and include scenarios that add interest and reality to the
              concepts.  Glossaries, bibliographies, and related articles add to the utility
              of the modules for teaching and research purposes.   Teachers and students are
              testing the modules in classrooms and independent study settings.  This grant
              provides funds to enrich and continue to test the first module, and to develop
              and test the second and third modules.  The developers will continue to
              distribute the modules at cost to universities and scholars requesting it; to
              demonstrate them at national conferences and workshops; and to write articles
              describing the development of the modules and their contents.  The stacks will
              serve as protoypes for high quality, cost effective, state-of-the-art
              curriculum materials on computing and human values.
