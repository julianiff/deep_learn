Abstract    :
              9527664  Hughes  This project will systematically field test the technical 
              characteristics of a selected variety of wireless devices and  digital radio
              nets which can be integrated into types of  telecommunications networks,
              including the Internet, which serve  the broadest purposes of public education
              and research by linking  computers, sensing devices, control systems, servers,
              LANS and WANS  operated by individuals, classrooms, schools and colleges for 
              research, learning and teaching, connectivity, collaboration, and 
              conferencing.  In textual, sound and image modes of communications.
