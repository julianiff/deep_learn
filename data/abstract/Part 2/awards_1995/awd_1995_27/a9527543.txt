Abstract    :
              9527543  Cahay  This award supports the Third International Symposium on Quantum
              Confinement:  Physics and Applications to held as a part of the 188th Meeting
              of the Electrochemical Society  in Chicago, October 8-3, 1995.  More
              specifically, the funds help students to attend the meeting.  A conference
              mailing will announce a Graduate Student Competition for Best Student Paper
              Award.  The ten best abstracts submitted by graduate students will be awarded a
              check for $250 each to help their contributors attend the meeting. 
              Additionally, during the meeting, a $500 award will be given for the best
              student presentation independent of the first contest.  A total of three awards
              for  $500 each will be given.  The audience will be asked to rate each of the
              talks presented by graduate students.  We believe that this competition will
              increase the attendance at the meeting and will also favor a strong 
              interaction between  graduate students and the scientists attending the
              symposium.  The additional $500 is requested for preparation of awards
              certificate and announcement mailing to encourage student participation.    The
              symposium is dedicated to recent research in transport in mesoscopic structures
              (both semiconducting and superconducting).   The symposium will address all
              aspects of fabrication, characterization and modeling of  both semiconductor
              and superconductor mesoscopic structures and coupled systems.   This symposium
              is a follow-up of the Second International Symposium on Quantum Confinement
              which was organized as part of the 185th meeting of the electrochemical society
              in San Francisco (May 22-27, 1994).  ***
