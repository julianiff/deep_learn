                Abstract  ATM-9527378  Douglas N. Yarger  Iowa State University  UNIDATA: 
              UNIX-based Synoptic Laboratory at Iowa State University.    Funds shall provide
              necessary hardware to permit the Geological and  Atmospheric Sciences at the
              Iowa State University (ISU) to acquire  eight stations for a synoptic classroom
              to support undergraduate  and graduate meteorology courses.  The new equipment
              will  accommodate an increased number of students in the Atmospheric  Sciences
              and Agricultural Meteorology Programs as well as replace  obsolete equipment
              obtained in the early 1980's.
