Abstract    :
              Abstract  EEC-9527526, Colorado State University, Dr. Bryan Willson    This
              award provides funding to Colorado State University for support of a Combined
              Research-Curriculum Development Program entitled, "THE ENGINE in ENGINEering
              CRCD".  The CRCD program emphasizes the need to incorporate exciting research
              advances in important technology areas into the upper level undergraduate and
              graduate engineering curricula and stimulates faculty researchers to place
              renewed, equal value on quality education and curriculum development. This
              three year program will develop a curricular program centered at the upper
              level undergraduate and introductory graduate levels, but applicable throughout
              the undergraduate curriculum.  A series of multimedia modules will be developed
              which demonstrate how state of the art research is being used to improve the
              design, manufacture and operation of engines.  In addition, a "virtual
              hands-on" engine test cell laboratory will be developed, which will allow
              students from any U.S. university to conduct actual engine experiments on-line.
