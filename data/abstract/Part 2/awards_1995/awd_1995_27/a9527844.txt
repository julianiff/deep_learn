Abstract    :
              Behnke, Steve  U. of California, Santa Barbara   The Nelchina caribou herd in
              south-central Alaska has been a focus of conflict for over thirty years.  While
              the herd has been closely managed since the early 1970s, biologists disagree
              about the relative impacts of weather, range, wolves, bear and hunting on herd
              dynamics.  This scientific dispute is exacerbated and complicated by allocation
              conflict in respect to the subsistence preference of local peoples who rely on
              wildlife.  The research will explore how science, culture, and nature are
              co-produced in the case of the Nelchina caribou.  It examines natural resource
              management at a site where divergent interpretations and representations of
              nature and society are negotiated and resolved.  Theoretical aspects of
              cultural geography and the sociology of science are utilized.  Data in written
              and oral form that was presented to the Board of Game during deliberations on
              regulatory proposals will be gathered and analyzed.  Subsequent investigations
              will seek to understand the background of the representations.
