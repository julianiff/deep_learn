Abstract    :
              9527725  Mitchell-Olds   Hybrid vigor is central to many questions in
              agriculture and genetics.  Increased fitness of heterozygotes (the phenomenon
              of hybrid vigor or heterosis) contributes to high yield in many crop species,
              and may maintain genetic variation in wild populations.  Despite their
              importance, the factors influencing hybrid vigor and other forms of genetic
              variation are poorly understood at the genetic and molecular level.   The
              research proposed takes a reductionist genetic approach to this problem by
              studying causes of quantitative genetic variation in important physiological
              traits.  Chromosomal locations and DNA sequence variation of genes that may
              control metabolism will be examined in an effort to understand the factors
              influencing levels of genetic variation, vigor, and fitness or yield in plant
              populations.  This work may have important benefits in agriculture, forestry,
              and understanding of natural populations.
