Abstract    :
              9527024  Molnar     The key link between dynamic processes and the resulting
              large-scale kinematics of continental deformation is the constitutive law
              relating stress to strain rate.  The PI proposes to determine lateral
              variations in such constitutive relationships across deforming continental
              regions where continuous deformation approximates the kinematics of continental
              tectonics.    Calculated velocity fields will yield an internally consistent
              strain-rate field that the PI will use to determine the laterally varying,
              vertically averaged, effective viscosity of deforming continental lithosphere. 
              This study will test the validity and limitation of the thin viscous sheet as a
              model for large-scale continental dynamics.   Quantifying effective viscosity
              will reveal whether regions of low strain rate deform slowly because of high
              strength or because of low stress.  A decrease in effective viscosity with
              increasing strain-rate will allow inferences of the relative importance of
              friction on faults and ductile deformation at depth in resisting deformation. 
              In addition, the study of kinematics alone will address specific conundra of
              Asian tectonics.
