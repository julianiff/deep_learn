Abstract    :
              This research is developing formal frameworks and methodologies  for the
              verification and development of reactive systems: systems  that maintain an
              ongoing interaction with their environment. The  research concentrates on two
              tasks:  modular verification, so  that the correctness of an entire system can
              be derived from the  correctness of its smaller components, and refinement, so
              that a  high-level functional specification can be refined repeatedly,  where
              each refinement step is formally proven to be a correct  implementation of the
              former one.  The techniques are being  integrated into the STeP (Stanford
              Temporal Prover) system.  ***
