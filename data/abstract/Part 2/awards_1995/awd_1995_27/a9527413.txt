Abstract    :
              Abstract    This award is to allow participation by US researchers in a 
              workshop aimed at establishing a framework for producing a  magnetic anomaly
              map and magnetic digital data base for the  Antarctic.  The workshop will be
              held with the collaboration of  the British Antarctic Survey at Griton College,
              Cambridge (UK)  over 18-19 September 1995.  The workshop will establish: 1) the
               geologic requirements for the Antarctic map and data base; 2)  conditions of
              data contributions;  3) formats for the data base  and map; 4) where
              compilation efforts will take place; and 5)  conditions of data release.  A
              report covering these points, as  well as a strategy for implementing
              compilation efforts, will  result from this workshop.    The US, through the
              Office of Polar Programs at the National  Science Foundation, maintains a
              strong research program in  Antarctic earth sciences.  Representation in this
              meeting is in  the best interests of both the US research community and the US 
              Antarctic Program's Polar Earth Sciences Program.  Furthermore,  the Antarctic
              Treaty requires each member nation to share and  disseminate information
              resulting from Antarctic research  activities.  Participation of US researchers
              in this meeting is  important to the data dissemination goals of the Antarctic 
              Treaty.
