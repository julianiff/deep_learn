Abstract    :
              Elliot Bernstein of Colorado State University is supported by the   Experimental
              Physical Chemistry Program to study radical-closed shell   molecule reactions
              relevant to atmospheric and combustion chemistry.    Specifically, Prof.
              Bernstein will study radicals prevalent in mildly   oxidizing environments such
              as methyl, hydroxy, and nitrate radicals and   their reactions with ethylene. 
              He will generate the radical-molecule   complex initially in its ground
              electronic state, where the barrier is   high enough to inhibit reaction, then
              optically excite the complex to an   excited (barrier-less) electronic state to
              initiate reaction.  He will   employ time-resolved optical/mass spectrometric
              techniques to follow the   reaction.   Finally, ab initio calculations will be
              exploited to generate   reaction potential energy surfaces.    The implications
              of this line of research are many-fold.  These studies   will provide important
              details about reaction dynamics; the reactions to   be studied are particularly
              relevant in the areas of combustion and   atmospheric chemistry.  The cluster
              environment will yield unique details   not readily obtainable in the gas- or
              bulk-phase, and new techniques for   generating radicals in clusters will be
              explored and developed.
