Abstract    :
              9527900  Simms    Plants may respond to disease or herbivory either with
              resistance, which reduces the level of damage, or they may tolerate damage by
              reducing its effect on reproduction.  Little effort has been devoted to
              understanding how plants tolerate or compensate for damage.  Nevertheless, many
              plant ecologists have maintained that compensating for damage is an important
              mechanism by which plants respond to herbivory.  Recent studies have revealed
              genetic variation for tolerance within natural plant populations, as well as
              trade-offs associated with tolerance:  when plants do relatively well in the
              presence of damage, their siblings do relatively poorly in a damage-free
              environment.  This proposal describes two major experiments designed to explore
              mechanisms underlying this trade-off in the wild turnip mustard, Brassica rapa.
               To measure tolerance, half sibs will be exposed to carefully controlled levels
              and timing of damage produced by both insects and artificial means.  These
              manipulations will be performed in various environments to determine what
              environmental factors influence the ability of genotypes to compensate for
              damage.  Quantitative genetic analyses will be used to test two hypotheses: 
              H1:  Tolerance is more costly than resistance because costs of tolerance are
              associated with major life-history trade-offs; and H2:  The cost of tolerance
              is caused by a trade-off between ability to compensate for damage and
              competitive ability.  Results from this study will significantly improve
              understanding of how plants respond to herbivores and pathogens.  Furthermore,
              as tolerance and compensatory growth have become recognized as important
              agronomic traits, this study will provide important insights as to what
              trade-offs might be involved in breeding these traits into crop varieties.
