Abstract    :
              9527866  Ayers   Phylogenetic studies of plants of the Andean alpine tundra
              provide a unique opportunity to investigate evolutionary processes in tropical,
              high-elevation environments. Dr. Tina Ayers of Northern Arizona University is
              studying the genus Lysipomia, a medium-sized group of ca. 28 species of small
              "cushion" plants restricted to tundra-like communities in Andean South America.
              The greatest species diversity in Lysipomia is found in Ecuador and Peru on
              both sides of a major geologic break in the northern Andes known as the Piura
              Divide or the Huancabamba Depression. The apparent absence of widespread
              species and the presence of a large number of narrow ranging endemic species
              adjacent to the Depression argues for the idea that this barrier and associated
              climatic changes have played an important evolutionary role in Lysipomia
              phylogeny.   The primary focus of the study is to construct a phylogeny of the
              species of Lysipomia using information from morphology, anatomy, chromosomes,
              and DNA, and based upon herbarium material and recent field collections.
              Because morphological features may show convergence in these harsh
              environments, independent data sets generated from both chloroplast
              (restriction enzyme mapping) and nuclear (ribosomal ITS sequences) DNA will be
              emphasized. Other groups of Campanulaceae show major rearrangements in gene
              order on the chloroplast chromosome, and special efforts will be made to map
              such rearrangements, if encountered, in Lysipomia. A species-level phylogeny
              will allow tests of modes of speciation and adaptive radiation in Andean alpine
              habitats, and will help reconstruct the historical biogeography of
              high-elevation tropical communities.
