Abstract    :
              9527398  Gross    This action supports students and researchers to attend a 
              symposium on the mechanical properties of materials. The  symposium is planned
              for Anaheim, California, 4-8 February  1996.   Emphasis is on current
              understanding of high  temperature creep, fatigue and fracture, dynamic
              plasticity,  and plastic deformation of ice.  The symposium looks at the  past
              contributions of Professor Hans Weertman to these areas  of science and
              addresses future needs through approximately  60 technical papers. A
              publication of the symposium is  planned.  %%%  This  research has relevance to
              the science and  application  of structural materials under variable stress
              conditions.  ***
