Abstract    :
              EEC-9527484  Weldon    Environmental and energy considerations are slowly
              forcing the  automotive industry toward the electric car.  The University of 
              Iowa's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for  Simulation
              and Design Optimization of Mechanical System is  currently performing research
              addressing most areas of vehicle  design except for the power and drive train. 
              The University of  Texas at Austin has extensive facilities and capabilities
              for  research in electromechanical systems and proposes to collaborate  with
              the Center so that it could address total electric vehicle  design or the
              electric car.    This award provides funding to prepare and hold a planning
              meeting  at the University of Texas at Austin in the fall of 1995 to  determine
              a research agenda with industrial interest and to  determine if there is
              sufficient industrial support to warrant the  formation of an
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center  site at the University of
              Texas at Austin.    The University of Texas at Austin research site will
              address  electromechanical component, subsystems and system modeling and 
              simulation.
