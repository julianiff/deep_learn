Abstract    :
              9527953  Ling   This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will investigate a new
              view of process equipment maintenance  and reliability as part of the life
              cycle modeling of manufactured products.  The path to accomplish this is to
              move maintenance of equipment and processes from responsive corrective repairs,
              to intelligent prevention using experience and scheduled service, finally to
              the goal of a science based and sensor enhanced way of doing predictive
              maintenance.  The focus area is the electronics industry, where these
              investigators have established the contacts needed to get empirical data to
              back up their theory and methodology.   The exploratory research objectives
              are: to judiciously assemble operating and maintenance data, to identify
              promising methods for  modeling equipment degradation that use both stochastic
              and mechanistic methods, and to include degradation modeling of process
              equipment in the life cycle modeling of manufactured products.   The models,
              backed up by data, will lead to a methodology that can identify equipment
              components that are critical because either they have precursors that give long
              range predictions of their degradation or they deteriorate so quickly they need
              sensor based monitoring.  This grant will attempt to establish a science and
              engineering base for maintenance, that will lead greater availability and
              productivity, lower  costs for energy and maintenance, and improved  product
              quality and safety.  ***
