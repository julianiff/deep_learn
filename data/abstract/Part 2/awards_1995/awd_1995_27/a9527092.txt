Abstract    :
              9527092  Hochella    This grant provides $109,205 in support of the  costs of
              funding a two-year postdoctoral position  and necessary equipment to develop
              scanning  tunneling spectroscopy (STS) methods for  interrogating mineral
              surfaces exposed to O2 and  H2O under ultra-high vacuum (UHV).   This research 
              has great potential to elucidate the atomic-level  electronic structure and
              reactivity of many  minerals of relevance to low temperature  environmental
              geochemistry.  The work will be done  using an existing Scanning Tunneling
              Microscope  (STM) and will include the development of  standardized procedures
              for preparing mineral  surfaces for STS analyses, preparation of STS tips  for
              density-of-state-flattening and methods of  data collection.  ***
