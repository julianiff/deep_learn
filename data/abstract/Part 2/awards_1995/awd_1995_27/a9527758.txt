Abstract    :
              9527758  LYDEARD   Neotropical cichlids are a group of fascinating freshwater
              fishes that have long attracted the attention of professional biologists and
              hobbyists alike.  Neotropical cichlids are found from the Rio Grande in Texas
              to southern South America.  Cichlids have evolved into a variety of shapes and
              sizes that are ecoloeically similar to North America's largemouth bass,
              bluegill, and rapid water-loving, bottom-dwelling fish called darters. 
              Cichlids are unique among fish in that they build nests, care for their young,
              and defend territories.  These features have also made cichlids popular with
              aquarium hobbyists; familiar aquarium varieties include the Jack Dempsey,
              firemouth, Aztec, oscar, angelfish, and discus.  Unfortunately, despite the
              widespread appeal of Neotropical cichlids, we still know very little about the
              relationships among these species.   The primary objective of this research is
              to examine the relationships of Neotropical cichlids using DNA sequencing
              technology.  By actually sequencing portions of several genes from
              representatives of Neotropical cichlid species, we expect to construct a tree
              depicting their relationships to one another.  Understanding the relationships
              of Neotropical cichlids will enable biologists to learn how the various
              morphological varieties evolved and provide an important framework for future
              ecological and behavioral studies.  In addition, our work may provide useful
              information for improving cichlid stocks for the aquarium trade.
