              University of Michigan, Dr. Elijah Kannatey Asibu    This award provides
              funding to The University of Michigan for support of a Combined Research
              Curriculum Development Program entitled, "Flexible Power System Control." The
              CRCD program emphasizes the need to incorporate exciting research advances in
              important technology areas into the upper level undergraduate and graduate
              engineering curricula and stimulates faculty researchers to place renewed,
              equal value on quality education and curriculum development. This three year
              program under the direction of Dr. Elijah Kannatey Asibu will create two new
              courses on the subject of lasers in manufacturing that will combine the study
              of basic principles of the laser and newly developed theory in laser materials
              processing with experimental laboratory projects.  The project will provide
              advanced undergraduate and first year graduate students greater insight into
              the physical phenomena of beam material interaction.  It will also provide an
              effective forum for transfer of the new technology to industry.
