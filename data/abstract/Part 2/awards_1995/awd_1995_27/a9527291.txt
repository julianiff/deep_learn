Abstract    :
              This research program focuses on the coherent control of  molecular dynamics
              through the selective excitation of  molecular states, which can then decay
              into various pathways  with product distributions determined by the excitation 
              channel.  Control is achieved by varying the phase different  between the
              multiple photons producing the excitation.  Prior work on simple molecules will
              be continued in order to  examine the control dynamics in more detail and to
              define  the limitations of the technique.  At the same time, the  control
              scheme will be extended to other, more complicated  molecules.
