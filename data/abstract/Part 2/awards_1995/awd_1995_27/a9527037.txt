Abstract    :
              9527037  Parker    This is an award to provide renewed support for the 
              operation of the National Academy of Sciences, National  Academy of
              Engineering, National Research Council's Water  Science Technology Board.  This
              Board provides a focal point  for studies related to environmental engineering
              and  hydrology.  The Board's objective is to improve the  scientific and
              technological basis for resolving important  questions and issues relating to
              management of water  resources.  This award is jointly supported by the 
              Environmental Engineering segment of the Environmental  Systems Program in the
              Engineering Directorate and by the  Hydrologic Sciences Program in the
              Directorate for  Geosciences.    An important function of the Water Sciences
              Technology Board  is to conduct studies and to sponsor workshops and 
              conferences that can be utilized for program planning  purposes.  The Board
              also functions as an appropriate means  for coordination of research plans with
              other Federal  agencies including FEMA, USGS, EPA, DOE, and the U.S. Army 
              Corps of Engineers.***
