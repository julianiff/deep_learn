Abstract    :
              9527549  Johnson       This award suuports US participation in the Second 
              International Conference on Pelagic Biogeography to be held  near Armsterdam,
              The Netherlands, 9-15 July 1995.  This  conference grows out of the results of
              the first  International Conference on Pelagic Biogeography  successfully held
              in 1985.  The first conference sought to  define the unique problems and
              opportunities afforded by  study of pelagic organism distributions and to
              explore ways  in which Pelagic Biogeography could better incorporate  modern
              biogeopraphic concepts and advanced approaches to the  study of the maintenance
              and history of open-ocean  distribution patterns.  The second conference will
              focus on  how Pelagic Biogeography can contribute to a better  understanding of
              marine ecosystems, and will particularly  focus on its potential contribution
              to assessing and  understanding global change and marine biodiversity studies.
