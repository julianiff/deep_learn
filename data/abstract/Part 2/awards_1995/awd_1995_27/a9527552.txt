Abstract    :
              This starter grant award to the University of Colorado will support the  
              research of Professor David M. Jonas.  The theme of the research is the   use
              of multiple pulse, nonlinear spectroscopy using femtosecond lasers to   resolve
              the dynamics underneath the featureless spectra of molecules in   condensed
              phases and to prepare and study transition states for thermally   activated
              chemical reactions.  Three projects will be pursued, the first   being
              femtosecond, three-pulse experiments aimed at time-resolving motion   across
              the transition state of thermally activated chemical reactions.    The second
              is heterodyned photon echo studies of electronic dephasing and   line
              broadening.  The third is pump-probe studies of photosynthetic   energy
              transfer.  The research will advance the fundamental understanding of how
              thermally   activated reactions work, as well as the understanding of energy
              transfer   and excitonic interactions at short distances in photosynthesis
