Abstract    :
              9527968  Newton    This project will improve the pinned insect collection of the
              Field Museum of Natural History by providing 182 new cabinets and 1763 new
              drawers to house the specimens. Inferior, old storage trays will also be
              replaced with trays made of modern, archival materials. The collection will be
              moved into newly constructed space in the Field Museum, and while the move is
              going on, the Lepidoptera and other non-Coleopter specimens will be
              reorganized.  Unidentified material will be identified by curators and visiting
              scientists.  Upon completion of the project, the pinned insect collection will
              be far more accessible for use by the scientific and conservation communities.
