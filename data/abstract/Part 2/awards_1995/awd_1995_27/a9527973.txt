Abstract    :
              9527973  LAKE   By far the greatest numbers of species in the world's
              biodiversity are members of very varied groups or lineages known collectively
              as "invertebrate animals."  To date, our knowledge of the relationships among
              invertebrate phyla is based primarily on morphological features and the
              resolution of relationships on this basis still leaves much to be desired. 
              This award will provide funds for DNA sequencing efforts for 35 invertebrate
              taxa and that information will be used to address morphological,
              paleontological, developmental, and biochemical changes or events that occurred
              during the diversification of invertebrates.  Special attention will be paid to
              the origins of deuterostome and protostome animals and the origins of the
              arthropods and their hypothesized close relatives.  DNA sequences will be
              obtained for 18S rRNA for all taxa and for a nuclear elongation factor gene for
              some of the taxa critical to understanding older or deeper phylogenetic
              relationships.    This award will contribute to our currently very rudimentary
              understanding of  an important and relatively neglected aspect of biodiversity.
               Knowledge of relationships among invertebrate taxa has potential applied value
              as many invertebrate groups include species that are of economic and medical
              importance.  The phenomenon of bioprospecting has been revealing important
              natural products from invertebrates that show pharmaceutical promise from
              antibiotics to anesthetics.
