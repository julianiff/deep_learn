Abstract    :
              The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program is supporting a   research 
              effort where a hybrid electronic structure technique will be developed by  
              Prof.  E.A. Carter of UCLA that first utilizes density functional theory to  
              obtain an  accurate electron density distribution for a metal, which then is
              used   (along  with its corresponding orbital representation) to provide a set
              of   Coulomb and  exchange operators that describe the interaction of the
              infinite metal   surface  and bulk crystal with a chemisorption region
              (composed of a few metal   atoms and  an adsorbed molecule).  The chemisorption
              region is then described using   a local  multireference configuration
              interaction method in the presence of the   embedding  Coulomb and exchange
              field derived from density functional theory.  The   goal is  to develop and
              test this hybrid DFT/CI method, with the hope that it will  provide the most
              accurate means yet of studying chemisorption on metal   surfaces  from first
              principles theories.  A new theory involving a mixture of quantum chemistry and
              solid state   physics  techniques will be developed.  The theory utilizes
              quantum physics known   for its  accuracy in describing metals and quantum
              chemistry known for its   accuracy in  describing metal-molecule chemical
              bonds.  These taken together are   expected to  provide the most accurate means
              yet of modelling chemical reactions that   occur  on metal surfaces.  Many
              important industrial technologies rely on such  reactions and it is hoped that
              the new theory will help optimize such  technologies further.
