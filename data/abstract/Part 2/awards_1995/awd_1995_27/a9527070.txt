Abstract    :
              Kettler  OPP 9527070    Abstract    This award supports organic geochemical
              characterization of  Cretaceous-Paleogene sedimentary rocks that are expected
              to be  recovered during the Cape Roberts Project (CRP).  The CRP  proposes to
              core four 500 m holes from a fast ice drilling  platform in the Ross Sea in
              1995 and 1996.  The core recovered  will be described, curated, and sampled for
              scientific research.  The CRP has the potential to answer significant questions
               regarding the history of the West Antarctic rift system, the  development of
              continental ice sheets in Antarctica during the  Cretaceous and Paleogene, and
              the response of biota to climatic  deterioration and the development of
              seaways.  Organic  geochemical measurements are relevant to these issues and so
              are  included in the initial core characterization studies.  The work 
              supported here includes measurement of whole-rock carbonate  carbon, total
              carbon, total nitrogen, and total sulfur, analysis  of the elemental
              composition of kerogen in selected samples, and  gas chromatographic analysis
              of the solvent-soluble organic  matter in selected samples.  These data will be
              collected in the  Crary Science and Engineering Center (CSEC) at McMurdo
              Station  and will be reported as part of the initial core characterization 
              study of the CRP.
