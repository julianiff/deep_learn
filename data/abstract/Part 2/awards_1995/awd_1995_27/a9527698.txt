Abstract    :
              9527698  Whiting  Monitoring athe exchange of trace gases (especially greenhouse
              gases) between terrestrial systems and the atomsphere will provide a means to
              assess the effectiveness of changes in anthropogenic emissions of future
              climatic conditions.  Remote sensing technology has the potential to provide
              monitoring capabilities in estimating carbon dioxide exchange (primary 
              production) and methane emission from wetlands.  To utilize remote sensing as
              an accurate predictive tool in estimating methane emissions form a variety of
              wetland, a systematic comparison of methane emission, primary production and
              remote sensing relationship across large latitudinal will be an important step.
               This project will examine these relationship within and among three primary
              wetland systems chosen along a wide latitudinal gradient (25 N to 60 N): the
              subtropical Everglades, the expensive marshes of southwestern Louisiana, and
              the boreal peatlands of Alberta and Northwest Territories.  The project should
              produce results applicable to a broad suite of questions at regional-t-global
              scales having to do with the interaction of human activity and climate change.
