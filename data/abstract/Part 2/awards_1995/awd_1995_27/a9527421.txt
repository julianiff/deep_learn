Abstract    :
              9527421  Kieda       Showers produced by the highest energy cosmic ray 
              primaries, with energy above 10 GeV have been observed in  scintillator and
              Cerenkov arrays and the Fly's Eye.  the  former detects shower components, the
              latter their  fluorescence produced in the atmosphere.  Both techniques  have
              limited aperture not likely to be substantially  increased because of cost. 
              This grant funds a new approach  that may provide substantially larger aperture
              with  comparable resolution at significantly lower cost than is  possible with
              conventional methods.  Calculations show that  Cerenkov light emitted by the
              shower particles is intense  enough to produce detectable signals (perhaps even
              in  daylight!) in non-imaging planar detectors arrayed on the  ground.  Of the
              various candidate technologies, single-  crystal CZ-Si solar panels, will be
              the focus of the  research, those being readily available and relatively 
              inexpensive.  This novel idea will be tested with  measurements of the
              sensitivity of the solar panels  and  other possible detectors and with an
              instrumented small set  of panels at the site of the CASA/MIA/HiRes cosmic-ray 
              detector system to detect showers in coincidence with it.  ***
