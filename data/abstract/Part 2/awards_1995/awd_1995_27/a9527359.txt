Abstract    :
              With support from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Robert L.  
              Kuczkowski of The University of Michigan is continuing his research in   the
              area of fourier-transform microwave spectroscopy of weak complexes.    He will
              investigate the structure and dynamics of a) sulfur dioxide   complexes, b)
              cyclopropane complexes, c) complexes involving strong   acids, d) metal
              complexes, and e) termolecular complexes.  Calculations   using models provided
              by Stone or Muenter will be performed for   comparison purposes, which will
              yield highly accurate tilt and torsional   angles.    Results from the above
              studies will provide fundamental information on   the nature of weak binding
              forces between molecules and on intermolecular   potential functions.  Such
              results will help to test models and develop   theories which can guide
              chemists on how compounds interact, grow into   larger clusters, and arrange
              themselves in condensed phases.  This has   potential implications for a wide
              spectrum of important phenomena ranging   from biochemical applications such as
              drug design and transport of   species across membranes, to physical processes
              such as cloud formation,   acid rain phenomena and substrate-catalyst
              interactions.
