Abstract    :
              9527567   Crowe  This project is to evaluate the efficacy of the ion microprobe
              to precisely and accurately determine 18O/18O ratios in non-conducting silicate
              phases, in particular garnet.  Used primarily for heavy isotope measurement,
              ion probes have recently been used to measure light stable isotope ratios,
              although precision limits have typically been poor due to counting statistics
              and a lack of properly characterized standards to correct for solid
              solution-dependent matrix effects.  The PI's have developed a set of
              isotopically homogeneous, well characterized grossular and andradite ion probe
              standards that significantly improve both the precision and accuracy of
              results.  New, high precision ion probe data generated by the PI's demonstrate
              the potential of the technique, and funding is to continue and further this
              work.
