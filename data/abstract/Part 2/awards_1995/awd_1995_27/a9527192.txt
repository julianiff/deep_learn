Abstract    :
              9527192  Taylor  The Nanomanupulator (nM) project will investigate the most
              powerful and efficient systems, methods and algorithm for applying the
              high-performance graphics supercomputer, Pixel-Flow, to the real-time control
              of scientific instrumentation.  The nM system provides an intuitive interface
              to scanning probe microscopes (SPMs), allowing scientists from a variety if
              disciplines to examine and manipulate nanometer-scale structures.  The nM
              displays a high quality rendering of the surface being scanned as the data
              arrives in real time.  using force-feedback controls, the scientists can feel
              the surface representation to enhance understanding of surface properties and
              can modify the surface directly.  Important proof-of-concept studies have shown
              that the nM greatly increases productivity by acting as a translator between
              controlled.  This project will study issues which will made the nM a more
              powerful and accessible tool for the scientific community.
