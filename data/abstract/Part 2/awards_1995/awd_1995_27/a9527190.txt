Abstract    :
              9527190  Hollis   This research aims to improve assembly in product
              manufacturing.  Assembly is a difficult and time-consuming process to automate,
              especially when small tolerances are necessary.  This architecture for agile
              assembly is a strategic framework using agent-based robotic elements that are
              precise, modular, and extensible.  These elements form sets of leased
              self-contained software/hardware modules that can be programmed and operated
              over the Internet, and can be brought together to form miniature agile
              factories for assembly.  Such a scheme requires a combination of intelligent
              networked communication, distributed computing resources using high-performance
              processors, and distributed sensor/actuator subsystems of novel design.  Design
              and construction of a prototype miniature factory according to the principles
              of agile assembly architecture will be carried out to validate the research and
              provide a unique and powerful reconfigurable platform for assembly research and
              evaluation by industry.  Partial assembly of magnetic storage disk drives will
              serve as a testbed.     This work aims to advance knowledge in three main
              areas:  (1)  seamless wide area and local area networking of distributed agents
              emphasizing high quality of service; (2)  modular precision robotic assembly
              elements containing high-performance embedded processors; and (3) a
              comprehensive software environment for modeling, simulation, and programming of
              the miniature factories.  The results of the research could allow manufacturers
              to develop a capability for geographically distributed design and deployment of
              assembly systems while providing drastically reduced changeover times, higher
              quality, and a new level of manufacturing system portability.
