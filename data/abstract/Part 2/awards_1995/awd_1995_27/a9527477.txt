Abstract    :
              9527477  Prabhu   This research is funded as an SGER (Small Grant for
              Exploratory Research). The objective of the project is to enhance the design,
              development, and implementation of a computer-aided nonlinear discriminant for
              pattern recognition. The approach will employ techniques from algebraic
              geometry and dynamic systems. Discriminant design uses a database of feature
              vectors and partitions the feature space into disjoint regions corresponding to
              different classes of patterns. Based on the methodology,  an algorithm will be
              developed and implemented. The performance of the algorithm will be benchmarked
              through a series of tests problems in weather forecasting and production
              systems for which quick pattern recognition and control are required.   To
              rapidly recognize and act on objects, especially in situations involving
              automatic assembly and part sortation, are essential qualities for the design
              and implementation of effective automated production systems. The technique,
              apart from its nonlinear discriminant nature, is expected to yield some
              improvement in both speed and accuracy in pattern recognition in general. The
              development of fast algorithms capable of processing large amounts of data in
              very short time and with high accuracy is essential for large scale adoption of
              automatic pattern recognition techniques in a host of applications. The outcome
              of this research has the potential to advance the state-of-the-art in this
              critical field.
