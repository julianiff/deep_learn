              Jersey Institute of Technology, Dr. Anthony Johnson    This award provides
              funding to the New Jersey Institute of Technology  for support of a Combined
              Research Curriculum Development Program entitled, "Multidisciplinary Optical
              Science and Engineering CRCD Program at NJIT".  The CRCD program emphasizes the
              need to incorporate exciting research advances in important technology areas
              into the upper level undergraduate and graduate engineering curricula and
              stimulates faculty researchers to place renewed, equal value on quality
              education and curriculum development. This three year program will institute
              complementary applied optical science and engineering courses at NJIT which
              will (1) provide a unified, multidepartmental optical science/engineering
              curriculum and (2) emphasize optics courses which will provide laboratory and
              classroom training to undergraduate and graduate students in emerging areas of
              industrial and national importance.  ***
