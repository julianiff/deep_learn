Abstract    :
              In the coniferous forests of the Pacific Northwest, canopy gaps created by the
              death of large trees within mature forests are hypothesized to determine the
              species composition and future development of those forests.  In 1990, the
              investigators established experimental canopy gaps of different sizes within
              two conifer forests of different age.  The main objectives have been to
              determine the influence of the composition and abundance of vegetation and the
              availability of resources (e.g. light and moisture) prior to and immediately
              after gap formation on the pattern of development in old growth forests.  The
              investigators will continue their long-term measurements of plant diversity and
              abundance, and of light and soil moisture levels, in the experimental gaps.   
              Recent plans for management of federal lands in the Pacific Northwest emphasize
              managing young forests to encourage a greater diversity of species and
              structure that is characteristic of old-growth forests.  Allowing stands to age
              naturally may accomplish this goal, but selective tree harvest has also been
              proposed as a way to achieve structural complexity more rapidly while allowing
              some commodity extraction.  This study will aid in understanding how canopy
              gaps influence development of old-growth forests, how long it might take for
              old-growth structure to develop naturally, and whether selective harvest of
              different sizes of openings can mimic this process.  This study will also
              provide new information on the most appropriate gap size for the establishment
              and growth of different tree and understory plant species, and the effect of
              existing vegetation on tree survival and growth.
