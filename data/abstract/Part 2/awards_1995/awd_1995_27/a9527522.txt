Abstract    :
              9527522  Hunter  Most ecologists agree that populations of herbivores are
              influenced by both the availability of suitable plant food and by the actions
              of their natural enemies.  There is no consensus, however, on how the relative
              power of these two processes varies in different environments.  This project
              combines experimental approaches and field sampling to assess changes in the
              relative importance in food quality and natural enemies on populations of
              insect herbivores that feed on oak trees.  The quality of oak leaves will be
              manipulated by fertilization of trees in a plantation, and natural enemies will
              be excluded from a subset of the trees.  Sampling will determine whether insect
              populations respond more to changes in food quality than to changes in
              predation pressure.  The results from the oak plantation will be compared with
              a natural field site, the Coweeta Long-Term Ecological Research Site, where oak
              trees grow along a gradient in elevation.  The results will add to our
              understanding of the environmental conditions under which predators or food
              quality dominate populations of herbivores.  Humans are interested in managing
              populations of many kinds of herbivores.  Insect pest of fields and forests,
              and mammals such as deer and caribou, are among the herbivores that we seek to
              control because of their effects on food production and recreation.  Judicious
              management of herbivore populations requires understanding of the factors that
              influence their population ecology.  The results of this project will help
              determine the circumstances under which biological control or hunting will aid
              or hinder management goals.
