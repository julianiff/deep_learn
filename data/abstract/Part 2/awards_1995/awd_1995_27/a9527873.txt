Abstract    :
              9527873  Klinman  Partial support  is requested for the Gordon Research
              Conference on Isotopes in Biology and Chemistry to be held in Ventura,
              California, February 11-16, 1996.  This long-standing conference has
              traditionally brought together investigators from a multitude of disciplines
              (e.g., physical and organic chemistry, atmospheric chemistry, and biological
              chemistry).  As a result of its interdisciplinary nature, the Conference has
              served as a breeding ground for the generation of new concepts and
              methodologies in the biological sciences.  Examples include the remarkable
              advances in enzymes kinetics that occurred in the 1980's: the recognition of
              the possible role of nuclear tunneling in enzyme reactions; the stimulation of
              a systematic study of the role of magnetic field effects in enzymatic
              reactions; the use of heavy atom isotope effects to probe plant physiology and
              evolution; etc.  In recent years, the Conference has been moving increasingly
              into the area of biological chemistry.  This trend is reflected in the current
              program which will range from a discussion of new aspects of H-transfer
              catalysis (low barrier hydrogen bonds, tunneling, and the role  of  proton
              pools in catalysis) to the use of isotopic probes to establish and characterize
              radical species in biological processes.  A special session will be dedicated
              to a consideration of recent applications of heavy atom effects to characterize
              biological systems.  Intermixed within this program will be sessions on both
              physical chemistry and reaction mechanisms.  One particularly strong component
              of this conference is that it provides a format for the interaction of
              theoreticians with experimentalists.  %%%  Isotopes are widely used in biology
              and chemistry in order to follow processes and to understand function.  This
              conference seeks to bring together scientists who use isotopes in an
              interdisciplinary manner in order to improve information exchange and allow
              exposure to new results.  It is particularly important to the developm ent of 
              biochemical tracer methodology that biologists be exposed to chemical
              applications of isotopes.  ***
