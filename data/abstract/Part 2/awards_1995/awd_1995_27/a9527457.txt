Abstract    :
              Abstract  EEC-9527457-University of California-Davis, Dr. Michael Buonocore   
              This award provides funding to the University of California-Davis for the
              support of a Combined Research-Curriculum Development (CRCD) Program entitled,
              "Research and Educational Program in Magnetic Resonance Imaging." The CRCD
              program emphasizes the need to incorporate exciting research advances in
              important technology areas into the upper level undergraduate and graduate
              engineering curricula and stimulates faculty researchers to place renewed,
              equal value on quality education and curriculum development. The goal of this
              proposal is to develop an outstanding research and education program in
              Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) that will serve as a model program and
              resource at the national level.  This program will train engineers in the
              fundamentals and recent advances of MRI, to prepare them for careers in
              industry research and development, and to fill the growing need for engineers
              knowledgeable in MRI technology.  ***  ??
