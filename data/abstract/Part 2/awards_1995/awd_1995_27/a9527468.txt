Abstract    :
              In this project, which is supported by the Theoretical and Computational  
              chemistry program,  professor Schaefer at the University of Georgia  will
              continue his investigations of the electronic structure of atoms and  
              molecules and the reactions which they  undergo.  The research program is  
              composed of two parts.  The first is the development and testing of new  
              methods, while the second is the application of these methods to relevant   and
              interesting chemical problems.  The methods to be developed are all   aimed at
              a more accurate description of the potential energy surface(s)   which describe
              a molecule and the energy changes once  the molecule is distorted and reaction
              occurs.  Of particular focus in   this granting period will be an
              implementation of coupled cluster methods   applicable to open shell species. 
              Additionally  Schaefer will   investigate approximations to another
              electron-correlation method, namely   second-order configuration interaction. 
              During this grant period a number of chemical applications will also be  
              pursed.   A partial list of these projects includes:  a detailed examination of
              the   phenylcarbene/tropylidene potential energy surface; the equilibrium  
              geometry of the ammonia dimer; an investigation of a direct iron-iron   bond in
              the complex Fe2(CO)9.  Further investigations will also probe   whether hybrid
              density functional theory Hartree-Fock methods can resolve   the apparent
              inconsistencies between molecular mechanics and experiment   for the
              thermochemistry of C20H20.
