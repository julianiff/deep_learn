Abstract    :
              The emerging new field of groundwater ecology asserts that certain biota are
              characteristic residents of groundwater and that there are important couplings
              between groundwater and surface-water biota.  One hyopthesis is that
              groundwater flow influenced benthic algal species composition in lakes.  Here
              we propose to critically address important short-and long-term
              groundwater/biotic diversity interaction by Sparkling Lake Nevins Lake, MI and
              Williams Lake, MN.  The research will assess how nutrients delivered by
              groundwater influence the species composition benthic diatoms at discharge and
              recharge sites, how dispersal of characteristic diatoms from that discharge
              contributes to within-lake diatom diversity,, and how the long-term
              consequences of groundwater coupling can be followed in sediment cores.  The
              proposed investigations would expand and complement long-term studies at the
              three sites and surrounding regional studies.
