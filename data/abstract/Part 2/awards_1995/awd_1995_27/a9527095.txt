Abstract    :
              Dilip Kondepudi is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational
              Chemistry Program to perform experimental and theoretical   studies of auto
              catalytic and stochastic kinetics of crystallization.  He   plans to study the
              fundamental aspects of spontaneous generation,   propagation and amplification
              of chiral asymmetry.  Kondepudi has   discovered that stirred solutions of
              sodium chlorite crystallize with   nearly 100% either dextro- or levorotatory
              crystals.  His research   program has been directed at attempting to model and
              explain this   phenomenon of spontaneous generation of chiral symmetry.  He has
              shown   that the amplification arises as a non-linear process caused by
              secondary   nucleation after the breakup of a small crystallite in the stirring
                process.  He plans to extend the experiments in new directions,  
              particularly with regard to primary and secondary nucleation studies of   amino
              acids.  It is well known that for many drug compounds only one enantiomer is  
              biologically active, and in some well known cases the other enantiomer   may
              have deleterious side effects including genetic damage.    Understanding of
              physical and chemical processes that generate chiral   asymmetry may be of
              great practical value in improving methods to produce   enantiomerically pure
              compounds.
