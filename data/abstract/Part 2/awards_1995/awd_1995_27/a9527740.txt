Abstract    :
              9527740  Hughes    This award supports travel to Jordan to establish the
              feasibility of developing a collaborative program of paleoclimatic research
              using tree rings.  The objective of the resulting project would be to develop
              tree-ring records of climate over the past several centuries for this part of
              the Near East, as part of an international effort to understand interannual to
              century scale variability in climate.  The region is currently poorly
              represented in records of this kind.  Benefits derive from filling this gap in
              global coverage, enabling a more thorough description of climate variability in
              mid-latitudes and hence an improved capability to understand this aspect of
              climate variability.  This study will improve our capability to understand
              environmental variability on these time scales of key features of the regional
              environment, e.g. persistence of drought, reliability of streamflow.
