Abstract    :
              The long-term goals of this research are to reconstruct the changes in
              vegetation, lake conditions, and climate that occurred over the past 20,000
              years on islands of the eastern Caribbean.  Sediment deposited in two volcanic
              lakes on Dominca will be analyzed for physical characteristics, chemical
              contents, and biological remains. The first phase of this project will test a
              new method for detecting prehistoric hurricanes in lake sediment based on the
              large amounts of debris from vegetation that is washed into the lakes. These
              layers will be dated by lead-210 and compared with historical records of
              hurricanes in the same area.  It has been proposed that hurricane intensity and
              frequency will increase in response to climate change that warms tropical sea
              surface temperatures.  An understanding of the nature, ranges, and timing of
              past hurricanes and the responses of  the plant communities to hurricanes will
              provide a guide to responses that are possible in the future.
