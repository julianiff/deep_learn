Abstract    :
              9527929  Somerville  The objectives of this project are to gather and provide
              access  to digital strong motion recordings from recent large Japanese 
              earthquakes; to document the source, path and site parameters  required for the
              interpretation and use of the data; to compare  them with attenuation relations
              used in the United States; and  provide commentary on their relevance to ground
              motions in the  United States. The aim is to provide basic data for use by the 
              earthquake engineering research community.    In the two year period between
              January 15, 1993 and January 17,  1995, five major earthquakes occurred and
              were widely recorded in  Japan. The smallest of these earthquakes, the
              magnitude 6.9 Kobe  earthquake of January 17, 1995, was the most damaging
              because of  its occurrence in a dense urban region. The four other 
              earthquakes, with magnitudes in the range of 7.5 to 8. 1,  occurred in
              subduction zones, and were all larger than any  earthquake in the United States
              for which we have strong motion  recordings. These strong motion data are
              difficult to acquire,  and most investigators in the United States do not know
              how to  acquire them. Further, the data cannot be directly used in the 
              development of empirical ground motion models because different  magnitude
              scales are used in Japan as compared to the USA (JMA  magnitude instead of
              moment magnitude); and epicentral distance  is used in Japan instead of the
              closest distance to the fault.  These conditions result in the underutilization
              of these  potentially valuable strong motion data.    The project involves the
              following:  1. Gather digital strong motion time histories together with the 
              many categories of information that are required for the  interpretation and
              use of the time histories. These include  source parameters such as seismic
              moment, focal mechanism and  tectonic category; path parameters describing the
              closest  distance to the recording site; and available geotechnical data  from
              the recording sites.  2. Using these data, c ompare the Japanese ground motions
              with  corresponding empirical attenuation relations used in the United  States.
               3. Based on this comparison, prepare a commentary on the records  describing
              their appropriateness for particular seismic source  regions in the United
              States. The digital time histories,  parameter information, comparisons, and
              commentary will be  archived on the Internet and provided to the National
              Geophysical  Data Center in Boulder, Colorado.    The proposed work will
              implement all of the major recommendations  of the 1993 International Workshop
              on Strong Motion Data  concerning the dissemination of strong motion data from
              recent  earthquakes in Japan.  ***
