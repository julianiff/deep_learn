Abstract    :
              9527814  Kummel    This research project is an effort to understand basic
              halogen  chemistry on GaAs, and the correlations between surface  chemistry,
              structure and electronic properties.  Additionally,  the project includes an
              activity to apply the results of the  chemical passivation study to device
              fabrication with  development of a gate insulator of CaF2 or SrF2 and a halogen
               passivated, un-pinned GaAs surface.  For basic passivation  studies an atomic
              passivation layer will be formed by dosing of  F2, Cl2, Br2, I2 with a
              differentially pumped MBE source and  cycling the substrate temperature to
              remove arsenic halides or  gallium polyhalide from the surface.  Samples will
              be  characterized in an STM chamber with XPS and STM used to detect  the
              position of the Fermi level within the bandgap.  %%%  The knowledge and
              understanding gained from this research  project is expected to contribute in a
              fundamental way to  improving the performance of advanced compound
              semiconductor  materials used in computing, information processing, and 
              telecommunications by providing a fundamental understanding and  a basis for
              designing and producing improved layered structures  of materials required for
              advanced devices and circuits.  An  important feature of the program is the
              integration of research  and education through the training of students in a 
              fundamentally and technologically significant area.  ***
