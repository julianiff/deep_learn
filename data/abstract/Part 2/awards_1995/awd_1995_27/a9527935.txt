Abstract    :
              Orville/Abstract           The objectives of this research are to 1) combine all
              valid  data to compare the infrared satellite cold cloud histories, cloud- 
              to-ground lightning histories, and cell structure using the ship  radar volume
              scans during the TOGA COARE period (Dec. 1992-Mar.  1993), 2) construct
              sounding data appropriate for each case, 3)  derive the convective available
              potential energy (CAPE), seeking  differences in the environment between MCS's
              which produce  lightning from those cloud systems that do not produce
              lightning.   In addition, we will 4) determine the detection efficiency of the 
              advanced lightning direction finder (ALDF) as a function of range  and azimuth
              using waveform digitized lightning data obtained at  Kavieng, Papua New Guinea,
              and 5) determine the sensitivity of the  ALDF to intracloud lightning flashes.
