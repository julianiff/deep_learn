Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9527999    The effects of temperature, time history and material
              properties on nanoparticle (5 to 50 mn) formation will be investigated. 
              Studies of  particle size and agglomeration processes of certain metal oxides
              and metals will be investigated either in a free jet flame, furnace or laser
              ablation aerosol generators.  The influence of trace gases on primary particle
              size will be analyzed.  Measurements of coalescence rates compared to theory
              will provide the nanophase solid state diffusion coefficient.    The work has
              relevance to ultrafine particle synthesis, control of residue particles
              resulted from incinerators and of contaminants in plasma processing.  ***
