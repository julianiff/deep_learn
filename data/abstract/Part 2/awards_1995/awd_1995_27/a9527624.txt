Abstract    :
              9527624  Ebrahimi    This project addresses two emerging scientific interests: 
              the extraordinary strength of composites with interphase  spacing in the
              submicron to nanoscale range and near-net-  shape manufacturing of metal
              composites by electroforming.  The objective is to utilize electrodeposition as
              a technique  to produce ultra-fine laminated composites of copper-nickel  and
              copper-silver, and to develop a mechanistic  understanding of microstructure
              and mechanical property  relationships in these materials.  The study aims at 
              understanding the effects of fineness of microstructure  measured by laminate
              spacing OsO to grain size OdO, texture,  and interfacial structure on yielding,
              strain hardening, and  fracture behavior.  The choice of the Cu-Ni and Cu-Ag 
              systems allows investigation of the effects of lattice  mismatch and stacking
              fault energy on the interfacial  structure and mechanical properties of
              nanostructured  multilayers.  Results of extensive microstructural and 
              mechanical characterization will be analyzed and used to  develop mechanistic
              models for deformation and fracture of  ultra-fine multilayered composites. 
              %%%  This study extends understanding of deformation and fracture  mechanisms
              in ultra-fine, laminated composites.  ***
