Abstract    :
               The focus of this research will be in two areas.  First, studies on  
              nudibranchs will identify new compounds and determine the source   organisms
              for those compounds that are dietary derived.  Specific   examples of systems
              to be studied include: Bornella anguila, Phyllidia   ocellata, P. zelandica, P.
              varicosa, Siphonaria spp., Phestilla sibogae,   Adalaria proxema and Alderia
              modesta.     Second,  the role of symbionts   in the production of marine
              natural products will be examined.    Target   molecucles include: Swinholide
              A, the pyridoacridine alkaloids, the   Renieramycins, Jaspamide,
              Halichodramide, cyclic dipeptides and   diterpenes. With this renewal award,
              the Synthetic Organic Program is   supporting the research of Dr. D. John
              Faulkner of the Marine Research   Division of the University of California-San
              Diego Scripps Institute.    Dr. Faulkner will focus his work on understanding
              the impact of marine   natural products on marine biology.  The project
              involves the chemistry   and chemical ecology of marine molluscs, and the the
              role of symbionts in   the production of marine natural products.
