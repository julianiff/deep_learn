Abstract    :
              John Dahler is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational
              Chemistry Program to continue his theoretical statistical   mechanical research
              on suspensions, polymers, and chemically reactive and   non-uniform fluids. 
              Four specific areas of research are being pursued:   1) Statistical mechanical
              studies of non-uniform systems that seek to   extend a new theory of
              non-uniform but static thermodynamic field   variables to incorporate fluxes
              and rates of relaxation and reaction in   terms of well-defined correlation
              integrals of microdynamic variables; 2)   An extension of a theory of colloidal
              dispersions and applications to   studies of frequency-dependent viscoelastic
              moduli and of sedimentation   and light scattering; 3) Studies involving a
              theory of chemically   reactive fluids to examine density fluctuations caused
              by size changes of   the species involved in reactions and the effects of
              chemical reaction on   collective modes of the fluid such as those associated
              with ordinary and   fast sound; and 4) Studies of the equilibrium properties of
              ideal polymer   chains to incorporate the effects of excluded volume
              interactions.  A number of commercially important products are derived from
              colloidal   dispersions and solutions of polymers.  Dahler's research is
              focused on a   molecular level understanding of the physical properties of such
              complex   fluid systems.  A deeper understanding of these systems may lead to  
              improved materials properties and new commercial applications.
