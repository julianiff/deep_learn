Abstract    :
                Dunbar/Kyle  OPP 9527373  Zielinski  OPP 9527824    Abstract    The Antarctic
              ice sheets are ideal places to preserve a record  the volcanic ash (tephra)
              layers and chemical aerosol signatures  of volcanic eruptions.  This record,
              which is present both in  areas of bare blue ice, as well as in deep ice cores,
               consists  of a combination of local eruptions, as well as eruptions from  more
              distant volcanic sources from which glassy shards can be  chemically
              fingerprinted and related to a source volcano.  Field  work carried out during
              the 1994/1995 Antarctic field season in  the Allan Hills area of Antarctica,
              and subsequent microbeam  chemical analysis and 40Ar/39Ar dating has shown that
              tephra  layers in deep Antarctic ice preserve a coherent, systematic 
              stratigraphy, and can be successfully mapped, dated, chemically  fingerprinted
              and tied to source volcanoes.  The combination of  chemical fingerprinting of
              glass shards, and chemical analysis of  volcanic aerosols associated with ash
              layers will allow  establishment of a high-resolution chronology of local and 
              distant volcanism that can help understand patterns of  significant explosive
              volcanisms and atmospheric loading and  climactic effects associated with
              volcanic eruptions.  Correlation of individual tephra layers, or sets of
              layers, in  blue ice areas, which have been identified in many places the 
              Transantarctic Mountains, will allow the geometry of ice flow in  these areas
              to be better understood and will provide a useful  basis for interpreting ice
              core records.
