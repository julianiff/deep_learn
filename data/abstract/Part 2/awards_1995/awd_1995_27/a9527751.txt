Abstract    :
              9527751  Mortensen    This research uses techniques developed under a prior NSF 
              grant to study microplasticity near inclusions embedded in  an elastoplastic
              material subjected to a uniform far-field  stresses.  The program employs
              silver chloride (AgCl) as a  model material for the study of metals containing 
              reinforcements or inclusions larger than a micrometer in  size.  AgCl is an
              ionic solid which deforms by dislocation  slip and its similarity with a metal
              from that standpoint is  well established.  Unlike a metal, AgCl is
              transparent,  stress birefringent, and allows for the observation of 
              dislocations at low densities by ambient-temperature  decoration with metallic
              silver.  Data are quantitatively  compared with two existing models for the
              deformation  behavior of two-phase materials, the Eshelby equivalent  inclusion
              method and finite element techniques.  The  differences, if any, between the
              empirical results and the  predictions of the models help guide efforts to
              incorporate  microstructural features and dislocation mechanics into  future
              models.  %%%  This study provides experimental micromechanical data,  sampled
              within a well-established metal analog, at a  microscopic scale and within bulk
              material.  Results from  this work are relevant to a wide array of engineering 
              structural materials, including two-phase alloys and metal-  matrix composites.
