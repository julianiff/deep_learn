Abstract    :
                Anderson  OPP 9527876    Abstract  This award supports continuation of a long
              term investigation of  the continental shelf sediments that is aimed at
              examining the  configuration of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet during the last 
              glacial maximum, the events and mechanisms involved in its  retreat, and the
              timing of retreat.  The project involves: 1)  characterizing variations in the
              ice sheet grounding zone in a  latitudinal transect extending from Ross Sea to
              Bransfield Basin,  2) reconstructing conditions at the ice/bed interface prior
              to  and after ice sheet retreat, and 3) radiometrically dating ice  sheet
              retreat along this transect.  Detailed sea floor imagery  (multibeam and
              deep-tow side-scan sonar), high resolution seismic  reflection profiles, and
              sediment cores will be used to map and  characterize prior grounding zones.  Of
              particular concern are  features that  indicate the amount and organization 
              (channelization) of basal meltwater and the extent of bed  deformation that
              occurred in different ice streams.  The timing  of ice sheet retreat provides
              information about the link between  Northern and Southern hemisphere ice
              expansion, and the role of  eustasy in ice sheet decoupling.  This research
              should lead to  better predictive models to determine which ice streams are
              most  unstable and likely, therefore, to serve as Oweak linksO in the  long
              term behavior of West Antarctic Ice Sheet.
