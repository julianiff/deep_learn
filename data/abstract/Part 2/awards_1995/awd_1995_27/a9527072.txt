              College  UNIDATA:  A Migration of Meteorological Data Reception from  Satellite
              to the Internet Using UNIDATA LDM Software.    This funding shall move the
              meteorology department from a data  reception program, that relies on satellite
              transmissions, to a  program that relies upon the Internet for Meteorological
              data.  A  UNIX-based server is necessary to receive data via the Internet.  
              This machine will run the UNIDATA software that will ingest and  manage
              multiple data streams.
