Abstract    :
              9527716  MICHOD  This project studies the transition in evolution from cells to
              organisms  for the purpose of understanding the emergence of organisms as a new
              unit  of selection. The issues considered are applicable to all major 
              transitions in evolution, such as from individual genes to gene networks,  from
              gene networks to bacteria-like cells, from bacteria-like cells to  eukaryotic
              cells with organelles, from cells to multicellular organisms,  and from
              solitary organisms to societies. All transitions in the units of  selection
              share two common themes: (i) the emergence of cooperation among  the lower
              level units in the functioning of the new higher level unit, and (ii) 
              regulation of conflict among the lower level units. These issues are 
              represented in explicit genetical models of mutation and selection within  and
              between organisms for the purpose of understanding certain general,  but by no
              means universal, features of organisms: the presence of a  sequestered germ
              line, maternal control of cell fate during early  development, and the passage
              of the reproductive cycle through a single  cell state-the zygote. The research
              is applicable to the conflict among  cells that arises within organisms in the
              development of cancers.
