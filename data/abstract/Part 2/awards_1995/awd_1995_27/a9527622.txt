Abstract    :
              9527622 Wunderlin The University of South Florida herbarium is nationally and
              internationally known for its collections from Florida, North America and Latin
              America. The herbarium conserves 212,000 specimens, including 275 types. The
              facility is actively used by taxonomists and ecologists in the region to
              investigate biodiversity issues.  This award will alleviate danger to the
              collections presented by overcrowding of the specimens, and also provide more
              work space for scientists who are using the collection.  The compactor storage
              system and new cases that will be purchased from this award will allow for 15
              years of growth in the collection.
