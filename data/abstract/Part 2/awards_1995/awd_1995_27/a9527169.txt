Abstract    :
              9527169 Keyes  This project will develop public use software to implement two
              important paradigms for domain decomposition: medium-grained data decomposition
              and course-grained task decomposition.  In addition, it will enhance the theory
              of task decomposition with respect to two specific applications involving
              multiple physics, aerodynamics and physics.  It will attempt to verify  the
              theory behind the two paradigms, and the develop software which combines the
              strength of both.    Effective multi-domain parallel solutions to multi-model
              coupled field problems will have widespread usefulness, particularly in light
              of the growing emphasis on multidisciplinary analysis and optimization.  The
              current pioneers of multidisciplinary optimization are finding it necessary to
              revisit the lower levels of the constituent modeling hierarchies.  It is not
              practical to simultaneously upgrade all of the low-level models employed inside
              of optimization loops to the complex models used in the state-of -the-art of
              the individual disciplines, for reasons of complexity and severe
              ill-conditioning.  This creates an obvious niche for the deliverables of this
              proposal - highly performant solvers with built-in support for multi-model
              analysis.
