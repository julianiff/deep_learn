Abstract    :
              9527034  Bodnar  This proposed research will continue to study the distribution
              of metals in porphyry systems.  Emphasis will be placed on quantification of
              the metal contents of inclusions from different paragentic stages and different
              vertical and horizontal positions in well characterized porphyry deposits.  The
              Red Mountain, Arizona, porphyry system, which represents the transition between
              deeper classical porphyry mineralization an shallow high-sulfidation
              enargite-gold mineralization, will be studied in detail to monitor the behavior
              of metals from the deep shallow portions of one system.
