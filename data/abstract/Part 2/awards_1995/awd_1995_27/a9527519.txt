Abstract    :
              Abstract  EEC-9527519-University of Massachusetts-Amherst, Dr. John Collura,
              Principal Investigator    This award provides funding to the University of
              Massachusetts-Amherst for the support of a Combined Research-Curriculum
              Development (CRCD) Program entitled,  Research and Curriculum Development in
              Intelligent Transportation Systems.  The CRCD program emphasizes the need to
              incorporate exciting research advances in important technology areas into the
              upper level undergraduate and graduate engineering curricula and stimulates
              faculty researchers to place renewed, equal value on quality education and
              curriculum development. The primary objective of this proposal is to integrate
              past and ongoing research results in the area of Intelligent Transportation
              Systems (ITS) into upper level undergraduate and graduate level engineering
              curricula at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst.  This will better prepare
              students at the undergraduate degree level to help plan design, operate, and
              evaluate ITS systems while also teaching students at the graduate level to
              participate in system development and ITS research.
