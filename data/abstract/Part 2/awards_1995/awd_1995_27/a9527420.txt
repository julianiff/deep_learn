Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9527420  E. Dendy Sloan  Colorado School of Mines      A new
              state-of-the-art for hydrate experiments is proposed by demonstrating
              measurements of the hydrate phase structure and composition, using Raman
              spectroscopy.  The work will have two major impacts:    1. The hydrate
              structure is virtually never measured but predicted.  There are multiple 
              instances in which the incorrect hydrate structure has been predicted.  With at
              least  three common hydrate structures, the incorrect structure (and associated
              formation  conditions) is predicted more frequently than commonly realized.  We
              intend the  proposed work to demonstrate how this problem may be corrected.   
              2. The hydrate phase composition (both the guest-to-host ratio and
              guest-to-guest  composition) is also predicted rather than measured.  However,
              such  measurements are necessary to correct the existing thermodynamic model
              since  hydrate formation conditions depend not only on structure but also on
              the phase  composition.
