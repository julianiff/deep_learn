Abstract    :
              This research is investigating the inherent performance problems  associated
              with object-oriented code execution.  Traces are being  captured from a number
              of object-oriented programming environments.   A workload Characterization is
              being performed to identify the  underlying problems presented by this new
              programming model.   Architectural changes are then proposed to improve the
              execution  performance of object-oriented code.  This research is 
              investigating architectural changes to the hardware that will  improve
              performance across all programming environments.  As more  and more software is
              developed using object-oriented languages,  this research will have a direct
              impact on accelerating the  performance of future applications.    The
              educational part of this project is concerned with making  improvements in the
              Computer Engineering curriculum, student  advising tools, classroom computer
              aids, and undergraduate research  courses.
