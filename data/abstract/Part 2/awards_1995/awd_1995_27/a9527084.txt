Abstract    :
              Ming  9527084  The PIs propose an experimental investigation of the thermal
              equation of state of perovskitite, the high-pressure perovskite-bearing
              asemblage of minerals thought to dominate the petrology of the lower mantle. 
              The experiments will involve high-pressure, high-temperature determinations of
              P-V-T relations using synchrotron radiation, and the results should allow
              testing of models of distinct bulk composition for the earth's upper and lower
              mantle.
