Abstract    :
              9527060  Self  Recent work on the Columbia River flood basalts and the ongoing 
              Kilauea eruption has led to a new hypothesis for the emplacement of flood
              basalt lava flows.  Contrary to the results of previous workers, flood basalt
              lava flows could not have been turbulent.  Instead, evidence indicates that
              these flows were emplaced over a period of years as inflating pahoehoe sheet
              flows.  While the physical evidence is compelling, initial work still leaves
              many unanswered questions about the mechanics of the eruption and emplacement
              of these huge lava flows.  Review of available data and conducting some new
              field experiments with an emphasis on large sheet flows will provide insight
              into inner workings of flood basalt lava flows.  This investigation of the key
              physical processes will allow L. Keszthelyi to extend his current numerical
              modeling efforts of the CRB flows initiated under an NSF Earth Sciences
              Postdoctoral Fellowship.  Combining careful measurement of  flood basalt lava
              flows in the CRB and observation of active flows in Hawaii into numerical
              models is the only way to place quantitative constraints on the emplacement
              style and eruption duration of continental flood basalt lava flows.  This will
              lay the necessary foundation for future quantitative estimates of the
              atmospheric and climatic impact of  flood basalt eruptions.  The proposed
              research will also lead to significant advances in understanding the behavior
              of lava flows in general.
