Abstract    :
              9527244  Roesler         This project is a three-year study of what happens to 
              solar energy at the interface between the antarctic sea ice  and the
              atmosphere, specifically how the energy is  apportioned among the ocean, the
              ice, and the lowest air  layers.  It will be carried out in cooperation with
              the  Australian Antarctic Program, with field work on board the  Australian
              ship Aurora Australis.       The very high reflectivity of the seasonal
              antarctic  sea ice cover reduces the input of solar energy at the  surface, and
              the low thermal conductivity of the ice  reduces the loss of heat from the
              ocean to the atmosphere,  significantly affecting the climate of the Southern
              Ocean.  Information about how these processes work is needed in  order to
              develop appropriate and realistic sea ice models,  and to integrate these into
              general circulation and climate  change models.       Three topics will be
              investigated:  the distribution  and types of snow and ice cover and their
              reflectance in  the solar spectrum, the effect of clouds in transmitting 
              incident solar radiation, and the distribution and  absorption properties of
              organic material within the snow  and ice.       Calibrated downward and
              reflected upward irradiance  observations will be used to infer the radiation
              balance at  the surface and will be used to model the surface energy  forcing
              for the antarctic sea ice region.  The  concentration and distribution of major
              organic absorbers  will be determined from core samples within the ice, and 
              their effect on the transmittance of energy within the  visible and ultraviolet
              bands will be studied.  Algal  layers are frequently found within the antarctic
              sea ice,  and have been proposed as a likely mechanism for initiating  seasonal
              plankton blooms in the Southern Ocean.  ***
