Abstract    :
              9527387  Zeng  Coal processing waste dams are used to store coal slurry, and as 
              such have many characteristics in common with a broader class of  structures
              known as tailings dams. Tailings dams are  characterized by hydraulically
              placed fills held in place by an  embankment. Failure of tailings dams due to
              earthquakes has  occurred many times in the past, causing significant loss of 
              property and human lives as well as severe environmental  problems. Despite the
              damage caused by such failures, there has  been little research conducted to
              evaluate the stability of such  structures under earthquake loading. Coal waste
              is a fine grained  material which is sensitive to cyclic loading. High excess
              pore  pressure, and in the worst scenario liquefaction of the tailings,  can
              cause large pressure on the supporting embankment and  initiate catastrophic
              failure.    This project uses a geotechnical centrifuge modeling technique to 
              study the mechanism of failure of coal-waste tailings dams and to  generate
              physical data for the evaluation of current design  procedures.    The project
              involves:  1. Two centrifuge tests on tailings dams constructed according to 
              two different construction methods currently used in practice  2. Comparison
              between the data from centrifuge tests with the  results obtained from
              numerical simulation    The results of this study will provide engineers with
              valuable  information concerning the stability of existing tailings dams  and
              guidelines for improvement of future designs.  HD/ Data/ Files/ Awards/
