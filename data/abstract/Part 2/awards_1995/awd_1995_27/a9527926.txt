              Support for International Travel to Workshop on Loop  Parallelization    The
              International Workshop on Loop Parallelization, being held in  April 1966 in
              Wadern, Germany, has as its purpose bringing  together two research communities
              which are both working on Loop  Parallelization, but applying differing models
              and criteria.  One  of these communities has concentrated on parallelizing
              compilers  for sequential loops, pragmatically developing heuristic methods 
              that may work at high speed for a variety of loops, but are not  provably
              optimal, while the other community works on regular  array design, identifying
              optimal parallelizations for highly  regular loop nests.  The purpose of the
              Workshop is to get the  groups working together on a variety of common
              problems.  Researchers from the USA, Europe, and Japan are going to be 
              present.  This grant will guarantee a strong representation of  American
              scientists from the two relevant communities working on  this important aspect
              of parallel computation.
