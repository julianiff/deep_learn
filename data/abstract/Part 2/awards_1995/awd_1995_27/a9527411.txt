Abstract    :
              9527411  Staley    The American Academy of Microbiology will convene a 
              colloquium of leading scientists to determine how to proceed  in a timely and
              expeditious manner to address the urgent and  enormous task of understanding
              microbial diversity.  Issues  in microbial diversity that require particular
              attention are  the following.  How should microbial diversity be measured?  How
              should taxonomic studies of poorly known phyla be  encouraged?  What activities
              are most important to assess?  How can microbiologists coordinate their
              research activities  with botanists and zoologists?  What new technologies can
              be  developed to enhance our study of microbial diversity?  The  meeting will
              bring together a highly select group of  microbial biology scientists,
              including at least five  botanists and zoologists also involved in
              biodiversity.  The  inclusion of botanists and  zoologists in these discussions
               will help build necessary bridges between these two sets of  disciplines and
              microbiologists.  In addition, several  European scientists will also be
              included in the proceedings  who are participating in ongoing efforts in
              microbial  diversity funded by the International Union of Biological  Sciences
              and the European Economic Community. The objective  of the colloquium is to
              develop a white paper report with an  in-depth analyses of these important
              issues in biodiversity  studies and with recommendations for a future plan of 
              action.   The final report and recommendations of the  proceedings will be
              published and disseminated to the  microbiological community,  to industry, to
              policy makers  who have concerns about biodiversity, and to the appropriate 
              federal and international agencies.  ***
