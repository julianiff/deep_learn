Abstract    :
              Abstract  EEC-9527422    This award provides funding to Harvard University for
              support of a Combined Research-Curriculum Development Program entitled,
              "Analysis, Control and Optimization of Discrete Event Dynamic Systems." The
              CRCD program emphasizes the need to incorporate exciting research advances in
              important technology areas into the upper level undergraduate and graduate
              engineering curricula and stimulates faculty researchers to place renewed,
              equal value on quality education and curriculum development. This three year
              program, involving faculty from Harvard University, Boston University and the
              University of Massachusetts at Amherst will develop a curriculum in the
              multidisciplinary area of Discrete Event Dynamic Systems (DEDS) based on
              research accomplishments and consisting of new courses and a novel laboratory
              setting for the study of these large, complex, and expensive engineering
              systems.  ***  ??
