Abstract    :
              9527362  Hennage  Joint ACS/OSA sponsorship will provide an interdisciplinary
              forum  for the presentation and discussion of new and previously  unpublished
              results on advanced organic thin film materials with  potential applications
              for photonics.  Materials synthesis,  fabrication, and processing will be
              covered in depth and related to  chemical, physical, and optical properties. 
              Theoretical and  experimental studies regarding these properties will be
              described.   Materials exhibiting electroluminescence, second-order, third- 
              order, and photorefractive nonlinear optical properties will be  given
              particular emphasis.  Both active and passive photonic device  applications
              will be discussed with a focus on the relationship  between device performance
              and materials properties.  ***
