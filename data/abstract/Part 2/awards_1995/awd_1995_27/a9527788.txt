Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  OPP-95-27788  LARSON      This proposal is for initial support of an
              Alaska Native Science Commission (ANSC). The concept was developed following a
              series of planning meetings organized by the Alaska Federation of Natives in
              concert with the University of Alaska Anchorage and other scientific and
              indigenous groups. The mission of the ANSC is to facilitate the integration of
              indigenous knowledge into science;  influence priorities in research; mandate
              participation of Alaska Natives at all levels of science; provide mechanisms
              for the feedback of results; promote science to young people; encourage Native
              people to enter science; and to ensure that Native people share in the economic
              benefits derived from their intellectual property.
