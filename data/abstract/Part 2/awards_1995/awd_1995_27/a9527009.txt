Abstract    :
              9527009  Barton  This collaborative project (NSF and industry) will yield a
              novel comparison of igneous-related mineralization across regions of
              contrasting characteristics.  It provides an integrated approach to sorting our
              some of the major controls on igneous-related metallogenesis.  These studies
              build on earlier NSF-sponsored research by the PIs.  Industry
              funding/collaboration is in place for student and field support; NSF funds will
              be used primarily for geochemical, petrological, and geochronometric studies. 
              Comparative studies will be conducted in three regions which have contrasting
              crustal compositions, igneous and tectonic histories, and metallogenic
              characteristics.  These contrasts, when considered together, will provide tests
              of hypotheses that can not be evaluated in any local area.  Overall, the PIs
              will develop the following topics:  (1) characteristics of key districts, (2)
              magmatic compositional controls on mineralization, (3) crustal-scale controls
              on magmatism and metallogeny, and (4) secular variations reflecting
              preservation, exposure, and contrasting petrogenetic regimes.  The goal of the
              coupled geochemical and field studies is to better understand the geology,
              geochemistry, and timing of representative magmatic-hydrothermal centers.
