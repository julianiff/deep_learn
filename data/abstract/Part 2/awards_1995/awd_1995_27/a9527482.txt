Abstract    :
              9527482  Burchat       This grant funds a continuing study of charm particle 
              production by pions, in particular a determination of form-  factors in the
              semi-leptonic decay of charged D mesons,  using data produced at the Fermilab
              Tevatron accelerator.  In addition, support is provided for participation in a 
              large international collaboration to design and build the  detector (BABAR)
              that will be put into operation at the SLAC  PEP II asymmetric B factory later
              in this decade.  This  grant has been made under the Presidential Young 
              Investigator program.  ***
