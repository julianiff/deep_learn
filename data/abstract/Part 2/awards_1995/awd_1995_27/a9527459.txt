Abstract    :
              9527459  Knapp    This award will allow San Jose State University to develop a
              two course sequence in the field of Human Computer Interfaces (HCI).  These
              courses will by project-oriented and taught in a lecture/laboratory mode.  The
              projects, along with much of the course content, will by based on the research
              being performed at the San Jose State University in the HCI areas of biosignal
              input, sound localization, sonification and visualization.  The lectures will
              cover subjects from pattern recognition to non-linear filtering to graphics
              algorithms.    The laboratory projects will be developed by the course
              instructors with the close assistance of the Department of Occupational
              Therapy, and the Computer Art and Design Center (CADRE).  Project teams of
              engineering students will be augmented by "clients" from these department who
              will define the requirements for the projects and evaluate each team's progress
              toward success.    These courses will be taught at San Jose State University
              and at University of California, Santa Cruz via the new CALREN interactively
              networked teaching facility.  Once the course has been fully developed, sites
              across the Silicon Valley will be able to present these courses.
