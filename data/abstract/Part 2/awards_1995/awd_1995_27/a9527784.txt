Abstract    :
              Abstract  EEC-9527784-Texas A&M University, Dr. Sohi Rastegar    This award
              provides funding to Texas A&M University for the support of a Combined
              Research-Curriculum Development (CRCD) Program entitled, "A Multidisciplinary
              Program in Biomedical Optics." The CRCD program emphasizes the need to
              incorporate exciting research advances in important technology areas into the
              upper level undergraduate and graduate engineering curricula and stimulates
              faculty researchers to place renewed, equal value on quality education and
              curriculum development. The objective of this project is to develop, implement,
              and evaluate a unique interdisciplinary curriculum in Biomedical Optics.  The
              thrust of the new curriculum includes the development of four new senior
              undergraduate and introductory graduate courses based on research advances made
              within the Biomedical Engineering Program at Texas A&M University in
              collaboration with internal and external medical centers.  This new curriculum 
              will integrate optically based therapeutic, diagnostic, and monitoring
              principles into the bioengineering curriculum as well as provide unique courses
              which by their nature are each multidisiciplinary and cover fundamental
              principles highly relevant to other traditional engineering disciplines.  ***
