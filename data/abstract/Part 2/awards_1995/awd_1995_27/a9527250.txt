Abstract    :
              This study addresses the effects of different-sized mammalian herbivores on
              plant diversity at six different North American grassland sites.  These sites
              represent two sets of sites that differ in their inherent site productivity. 
              One hypothesis is that differences in productivity will lead to very different
              effects of herbivores on plant diversity.  At low productivity sites, most
              plant species are of sufficiently high quality to be consumed by all
              herbivores, but are defended such that larger herbivores eat inferior plants,
              while smaller herbivores feed on seeds of dominant plants.  At high
              productivity sites, competitively dominant species may be consumed only by
              larger herbivores that can accommodate their low N content.  These trade-offs
              suggest that larger herbivores will have greater effects on plant biomass at
              high productivity sites, while smaller herbivores will have greater effects on
              biomass at low productivity sites.  In addition, larger herbivores may increase
              diversity at high productivity sites and reduce it at low productivity sites,
              while smaller, more selectively  foraging herbivores may have the opposite
              effects.  The goal for this proposal is to begin monitoring for the first 3
              years of a long-term (next 10 - 20 years) program as it is likely that changes
              in plant species composition and diversity will require that long to respond
              fully to  treatments. The collaborative network of LTER and other sites
              committed to support this project should  greatly facilitate such monitoring. 
              The results should provide a general understanding of the role of  herbivores
              in controlling grassland plant diversity, and should aid efforts to restore,
              preserve, and  manage grassland ecosystems.
