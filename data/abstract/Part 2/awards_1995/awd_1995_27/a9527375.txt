Abstract    :
              9527375  Elgamal  This action concerns the analysis and interpretation of
              downhole  seismic records from the Hualien site in Taiwan.    Over the past
              four years, extensive studies of downhole array  data from recorded earthquake
              motions at Lotung, Taiwan, and at  the Wildlife Refuge site, Imperial County,
              CA, have resulted in  the identification of a great deal of
              practically-oriented site  and soil dynamic response characteristics. The
              identification of  these characteristics is entirely based on the recorded
              downhole  acceleration data. Through these studies, a system of well  developed
              and integrated techniques has evolved for conducting  state-of-the-art analyses
              of downhole array data. In this  project, these techniques are used to analyze
              the recorded  downhole Hualien seismic records.  These records are used to 
              identify the site low-amplitude shear wave velocity profile, and  shear wave
              propagation; also the soil dynamic response  properties. The primary analysis
              tools used are optimization  routines combined with site amplification codes.
              Emphasis is  placed on the definition of practical analysis methodologies, and 
              design-oriented procedures.  ***
