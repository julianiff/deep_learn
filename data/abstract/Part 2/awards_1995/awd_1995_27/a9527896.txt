Abstract    :
               This project involves a summer institute in research design in cultural
              anthropology.   Experts in research design and in the link between data and
              theory will teach a set of 12 graduate students chosen competitively from Ph.D.
              programs throughout the US during a period of 3 weeks.   Course content will
              cover a broad spectrum of issues focusing on the link between theory and the
              development of research objectives, concepts, definitions, variables, measures
              and hypotheses; the relationship between quantitative and qualitative
              approaches in the ethnographic context; systematic data collection procedures;
              probability and non-probability sampling; statistical distributions and
              elementary data analysis with an emphasis on concepts (e.g., sampling
              distribution theory); and an introduction to data structures and management in
              both a qualitative and quantitative context; and strategies of hypothesis
              testing.   This project is important because it will provide an introduction to
              research issues in scientific anthropology for graduate students who may not be
              receiving an adequate exposure to their issues in their respective departments.
               The results of the 3 year workshop should be to increase the level of
              competence among students to do significant research projects for their
              dissertation research, and to become more proficient social scientists in
              general.
