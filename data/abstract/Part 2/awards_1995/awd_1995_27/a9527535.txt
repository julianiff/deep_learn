              State University, Dr. Kenneth Reardon    This award provides funding to
              Colorado State University for support of a Combined Research Curriculum
              Development Program entitled, "Bioremediation Technology in the Engineering
              Curriculum: A Module Based Multimedia Approach."  The CRCD program emphasizes
              the need to incorporate exciting research advances in important technology
              areas into the upper level undergraduate and graduate engineering curricula and
              stimulates faculty researchers to place renewed, equal value on quality
              education and curriculum development. This three year program will integrate
              bioremediation technology concepts into undergraduate and graduate engineering
              courses via eight modules containing laboratory, video, mini lecture, and/or
              case study components.  The content of these modules will be enhanced by
              inclusion of closely related research being performed by the curriculum
              development team and by field experience provided by a panel of practicing
              bioremediation engineers.  ***
