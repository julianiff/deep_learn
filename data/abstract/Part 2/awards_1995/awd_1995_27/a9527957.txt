Abstract    :
              9527957  Crossley  Soils contain a large number of microbes, such as bacteria
              and fungi, and animals. These animals range from tiny amoebae, microscopic
              worms, small spiders and insects, to the more familiar beetles, ants,
              earthworms, and mammals. Although many of these animals can be found in
              agricultural soils, they often have been ignored. Current agricultural
              practice, which involves tilling the soil and adding chemicals, kills many. But
              agriculture is moving towards less intensive management, such as reduced
              tillage and fewer chemical applications. In sustainable or reduced input
              agriculture, soil biology assumes much greater importance. New management
              techniques need to be developed, and for these to be effective, a better basic
              understanding of soil biology is necessary. This research asks the question,
              what are the effects of plant root systems on soil biology? Also, insects
              feeding on leaves of plants are linked by root activity to the below-ground
              system. How does this linkage affect methods of management? The answer to these
              questions will help in the design of sustainable agriculture and in determining
              linkages between above-ground herbivory and the rooting zone in agroecosystems.
