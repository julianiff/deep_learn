Abstract    :
              Whillans, Wilson, Goad  OPP 9527571    Abstract  This award supports a project
              to initiate Global Positioning  System (GPS) measurements for rock motions in
              South Victoria Land  and vicinity.  The results will be used to test some of
              the  leading models for ice-sheet change and tectonism, in particular,  whether
              the continent is rebounding due to reduced ice load from  East or West
              Antarctica and whether there is tectonic motion due  to Terror Rift or uplift
              of the Transantarctic Mountains.  A  modest program to measure ice motion will
              be conducted as well.  The motive is to test models for ice flow in the Allan
              Hills  meteorite concentration region and to determine whether small  glaciers
              in the Dry Valleys are thickening or thinning.  Monuments will be set into rock
              and ice and GPS receivers used to  determine their locations.  Repeats in later
              years will determine  motion.  Field activities will involve close cooperation
              with the  USGS.
