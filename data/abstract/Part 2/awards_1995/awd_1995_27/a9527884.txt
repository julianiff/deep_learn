Abstract    :
              9527884  Wallace   The cactus family, Cactaceae, comprises some 1500 species in
              North and South America (with one introduction to West Africa) and includes
              morphologically diverse life forms ranging from columnar, tree-like to barrel
              to viny and epiphytic. In adapting to dry and often desert conditions, these
              "stem succulents" have likely in parallel converged on similar vegetative
              shapes and forms, which renders evolutionary analysis designed to distinguish
              the lineages within the family difficult and confusing. In order to obtain
              robust and independent comparative data for taxonomic and phylogenetic
              analyses, Dr. Robert Wallace of Iowa State University is studying DNA variation
              in genes of the chloroplast and nucleus, from samples of cacti from the two
              large subfamilies Opuntioideae and Cactoideae.   DNA nucleotide sequences are
              being gathered from several genes, and these will be aligned for comparison and
              assessed for mutational differences between species. Phylogenetic trees are
              then constructed based upon these measures of mutation difference. With the
              phylogenies (or taxon genealogies) as guide to lineage relationships among
              genera and species, one can study the pattern of adaptive radiation into desert
              habitats throughout the Americas, and the morphological changes that accompany
              or enable evolution into various regions and habitats. The phylogenetic
              analysis also will inform a more stable classification of cacti, and direct the
              choice of key characters for purposes of species identification.
