Abstract    :
              9527592  CLARK  Genes that influence fertilization success are likely to be
              under strong natural selection.  Despite this selection, the genes are variable
              within populations, which makes this an interesting system to study how genetic
              variation is maintained.  This project will quantify how genetic variation
              affects gamete competition in the fruitfly Drosophila.  This model organism
              allows examination of general questions that would be much harder to study in
              larger organisms.  Several aspects of gamete competition will be studied,
              including genetic variation among females in the tendency to use gametes from
              different males, and the opportunity for male by female interactions in the
              magnitude of gamete competition.  The genes that encode the male accessory
              gland proteins (Acps) have been identified as likely components of gamete
              competition.  Joint analysis of molecular sequence variation within species and
              variation in gamete competition will allow inferences of causal connections
              between Acp genes and gamete competition.  Experiments will pursue components
              of displacement from both directions:  from phenotypic variation in sperm
              displacement toward identifying the molecular basis for the difference, and
              from identifying molecular variants toward testing their effects on gamete
              competition.  Results of recent and proposed experiments raise several crucial
              theoretical questions about the maintenance of variation in genes that affect
              gamete competition.  Results from the theoretical work will suggest
              explanations for the maintenance of variation and the rapid evolution of Acp
              genes.
