              mos    SGER: content-Based Retrieval of Multimodel Medical Images    Medical
              images are at the heart of patient's diagnosis, therapy  treatment, surgical
              planning, outcome assessment, and medical  education.  They, however, impose
              the most stringent requirements  of information management in the future
              multimedia healthcare  environments.  Accordingly, this research will explore
              new  techniques of content-based retrieval of multimodal medical  images,
              including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron  emission tomography
              (PET), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS),  and magnetoencephalography
              (MEG), as well as complemented textual  reports and image annotations.  The
              term "content" is in a  general sense, including structural and functional
              contexts of  particular objects in an image, the objects themselves and their 
              three dimensional anatomical structure, and even their semantic  relationships
              across different kinds of medical images.  The  success of this exploratory
              research will provide key technical  ingredients to construct future multimedia
              healthcare information  systems and open up new vistas for digital medical
              library.
