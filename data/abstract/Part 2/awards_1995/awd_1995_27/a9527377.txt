Abstract    :
              EEC-9527377  Thompson    This award provides funds for the Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center for Nondestructive Evaluation at Iowa State
              University  to continue research in the area of nondestructive evaluation.  The
              research emphasizes advanced ultrasonic techniques, eddy current, thermal, and
              optical techniques, radiographic techniques, signal processing, pattern
              recognition, and nondestructive evaluation of composite materials.  The
              research includes development of novel techniques, computer-based modeling,
              analysis of states of stress, advanced signal processing, and investigation of
              the structure and properties of materials.
