Abstract    :
              Abstract  EEC-9527493, Oklahoma State University/Dr. David B. Pratt 
              (collaborative project with University of Oklahoma/Dr. S. Raman (EEC-9531194)  
               This award provides funding to Oklahoma State University (OSU)  for support of
              a Combined Research-Curriculum Development Program entitled, "Curriculum for
              Integrating Manufacturing Enterprise Decisions (CIMED)".  This is a joint
              collaborative project with the University of Oklahoma. Support for the
              University of Oklahoma portion of this project is provided under award
              EEC-9531194). The CRCD program emphasizes the need to incorporate exciting
              research advances in important technology areas into the upper level
              undergraduate and graduate engineering curricula and stimulates faculty
              researchers to place renewed, equal value on quality education and curriculum
              development. This three year program will develop a research/teaching
              environment to focus on integrated manufacturing and enterprise modeling. 
              Undergraduate curriculum enhancement will be based on a joint University of
              Oklahoma/Oklahoma State University project on integrated production management
              and the development of graduate courses will build upon research results of an
              enterprise modeling research effort.  OU will have lead responsibility for the
              development of the integrated undergraduate enhancements which will allow
              students to study the role of individual activities and the effect of
              individual decisions with respect to a global system's performance.  OSU will
              have lead responsibility for the graduate enhancements which will be directed
              toward contributing to the development of a unified framework for
              conceptualizing, designing, modeling, and operating advanced manufacturing
              systems.    ??
