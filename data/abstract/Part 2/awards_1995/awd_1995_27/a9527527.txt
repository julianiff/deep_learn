Abstract    :
              1                                                                               
                                                             Abstract  EEC 9527527    This
              award provides funding to the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UT) for
              support of a Combined Research Curriculum Development Program entitled,
              "Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMCs)".  The CRCD program emphasizes the need to
              incorporate exciting research advances in important technology areas into the
              upper level undergraduate and graduate engineering curricula and stimulates
              faculty researchers to place renewed, equal value on quality education and
              curriculum development. This three year program will integrate the long
              standing research advances, achieved by UT and the Oak Ridge National
              Laboratory (ORNL), on the materials science and mechanics of CMCs into
              interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate level curricula at UT.  The
              proposed program will be conducted at UT and ORNL under the supervision of Drs.
              P.K. Liaw and N. Yu, assisted by three graduate students.  In addition, a
              number of distinguished UT faculty members and renowned ORNL scientists, who
              have extensive research experience on CMCs have committed to participate in the
              proposed program.  Strong administrative commitment to the implementation of
              the proposed program has been made by UT and ORNL and state of the art
              instructional modules, such as an on line hypermedia textbook, will be
              developed for quality teaching and learning.
