Abstract    :
              This project goal is to investigate applications of stream-  based functional
              programming methodology to the  implementation of multiprocessor based 
              real-time systems,  and specifically  to  signal processing applications. The 
              work is based on the Sisal programming language. It will use  Sisal's stream
              data types, static analysis methods, and  automatic mapping  to map parallel
              computations on  processors in distributed computer systems. The Paradigm 
              compiler will be redesigned and extended to perform static  analysis and
              mapping of continuous stream processing  computations. A related objective of
              this effort is to  develop analytical methods for performance modeling of 
              stream-based computations on multiprocessor systems.  ***
