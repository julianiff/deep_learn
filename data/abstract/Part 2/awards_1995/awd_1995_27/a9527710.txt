Abstract    :
                9527710  Rypstra  This research focuses on the effect of tillage practices in
              soybean fields on the survival and coexistence of two species of wolf spider. 
              We will test the hypothesis that the coexistence of these two spider species
              differing in competitive ability, colonization ability, and longevity depends
              on the degree of fragmentation and disturbance in their habitat.  The two
              species of spider prefer patches of plant debris on the soil surface - a
              feature of soybean fields maintained under conservation tillage practices.  We
              will monitor the spiders in tilled and untilled soybean fields and manipulate
              the spatial pattern of their environment by localized tilling or addition of
              mulch.  These manipulations will enable us to understand how habitat
              destruction and fragmentation change the interaction between the two species
              and determine the situations where the interaction results in localized
              extinction.  Empirical data will be used to build a computer model to extend
              our understanding of species coexistence to longer time frames and more general
              situations.  The spider community is diverse and constitutes nearly 50% of the
              predatory fauna in soybean fields, but it is poorly understood.  Understanding
              the activities and interactions of spiders in conventional till and no-till
              soybean fields is a critical step towards understanding the effect of tillage
              practices on this important crop.
