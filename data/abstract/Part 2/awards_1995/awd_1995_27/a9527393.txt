Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   Program
              will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of   Nevada in Reno
              in the acquisition of a high performance computer   workstation cluster,
              consisting of six HP 700J and two SGI Indigo 2 XZ   workstations.  This
              equipment will enhance research in a number of areas   including the following:
               (1) Theory of dynamics and spectroscopy, (2) theory of plasma and intense  
              radiation fields, (3) chemistry of reactive intermediates, (4) theory of  
              collisional activation, and (5) many body theory of atoms and molecules.  A
              workstation network of fast, modern computer workstations is a new way   to
              satisfy the computing needs of chemistry departments.  Such a   `computer
              network` also serves as a developmental environment for new   theoretical codes
              and algorithms, provides state-of-the-art graphics and   visualization
              facilities and supports research in state-of-the-art   applications of parallel
              processing.
