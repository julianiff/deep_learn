Abstract    :
              9527808  GILLESPIE   The goal of many studies of  molecular evolution is to
              understand why there is so much variation in the genetic material, DNA, between
              species and between individuals within a species.  In one theory most of this
              variation has no functional consequences.  In the theory being studied in this
              project, most of this variation does have biological consequences.  To
              understand which theory and assumptions best describe  molecular evolution, the
              predictions of each theory will be compared with the patterns observed in
              actual DNA sequences.  This work is of potential value for  understanding
              genetic variation in such traits as disease susceptibility in human
              populations.  Is genetic variation in susceptibility due to many small
              mutations or to a few large ones?    The goal of the second part of this
              project, on quantitative genetics, is to understand the genetic basis of
              variation in measurable traits, such as size or weight, both within and between
              species.  The great conceptual problem in this work is to deal with the
              combined effects of many genes, each of small effect, on a quantitative trait. 
              In the theory to be investigated these small genes interact with one another in
              a way that adds biological relevance that was missing from previous models. 
              Once the theory is in place, it will be used to investigate several problems of
              biological interest.  This work will be important for agriculture, where
              practitioners require better theories of the genetic basis of traits, such as
              milk yield in cattle, that are of economic importance.
