                  Abstract  ATM-9527097  Richard D. Clark and Russell L. DeSouza  Millersville
              University  UNIDATA:  A Computer Equipment Request to Expand Meteorological 
              Interactive Computing Capabilities for Education and Augment  UNIDATA's
              Internet Data Distribution Center.    Funds will 1) expand the present
              meteorological interactive  computing capabilities which extensively employ
              UNIDATA-supported  software and 2)  enhance and augment the UNIDATA Internet
              Data  Distribution  (IDD) system by serving as a relay and/or archiving  sight.
               The requested workstations, and others presently on hand  from previous
              NSF/UNIDATA awards, will become part of the local  area network supported and
              maintained by the meteorology program in  two teaching labs and a research lab.
