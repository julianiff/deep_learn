Abstract    :
              The purpose of this proposal is to improve basic education  in mathematics at
              the postsecondary level.  The underlying  philosophy is that students must be
              actively involved in  meaningful, global learning grounded in real life 
              situations.    To enact this philosophy, the project will develop two,  three
              credit courses in integrated mathematics/sciences,  which will meet general
              education requirements in  mathematics for the Associate and Bachelor's
              degrees, and  serve in the preparation of teachers for grades K-12.  Content
              will be based on critical concepts drawn from  College Algebra, College
              Trigonometry and Statistics.  Cooperative and discovery learning, along with
              the uses of  interactive multimedia, will be emphasized.  Students will  form
              teams across diverse educational environments, and will  conduct long-term
              studies of critical community problems.  Faculty will serve as mentors and
              coaches.    The courses will be developed and team-taught by faculty  from all
              of the higher education institutions in the  metropolitan Jacksonville, Florida
              area, as well as two  secondary schools in the two county area. Classes will be
               conducted in electronic classrooms connected via two-way  audio and video. 
              Special emphasis will be placed on  participation of women and minorities. 
              Expected outcomes  include over 70 faculty and 1,400 students affected by the 
              project.
