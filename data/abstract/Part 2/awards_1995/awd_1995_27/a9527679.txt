Abstract    :
              Dr. William J. Evans, Department of Chemistry, University of California -  
              Irvine, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic  
              Program of the Chemistry Division for research into the chemistry of  
              organosamarium(II) and related complexes. The general objectives of the  
              project are to identify and develop new types of chemistry and chemical  
              transformations by exploring, defining, and exploiting the special   properties
              of divalent samarium. Four areas of general importance will be   investigated:
              carbon-carbon bond formation in hydrocarbon coupling   processes, the insertion
              chemistry of oxygen-containing substrates, the   chemistry of main group
              substrates containing element-element bonds, and   the synthesis and reactivity
              of isolable, alkane-soluble carbocations.  Metal compounds are used to
              facilitate many important chemical processes.   However, there is a group of
              metals, called the lanthanides, whose   chemistry is not well developed. Over
              the past few years tantalizing   hints have appeared that indicate that
              samarium, one of the lanthanide   elements, may possess heretofore unrecognized
              abilities to mediate   chemical reactions. In this project the ability of a
              series of samarium   compounds to activate hydrocarbons and to break and form
              bonds between   carbon and other elements will be assessed. This will
              contribute to the   discovery of new uses for samarium, which is an inexpensive
              metal readily   available in the United States.
