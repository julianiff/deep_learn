Abstract    :
              9527669  Frost  Little Rock Lake was the site of a whole-ecosystem acidification
              experiment between 1983 and 1990. A wide range of acid responses were
              documented by comparing the lake's treatment and reference basins. Since 1990
              when acid additions stopped, chemical and biological characteristics of the
              lake's recovery have been evaluated. Chemical features of the lake have largely
              returned to pre-acidified conditions. By spring 1995, the lake's pH was close
              to 6.1, the value prior to the manipulation. In contrast, some biological
              conditions of the lake have proven much less resilient. In particular, the
              taxonomic composition of the treatment basin's zooplankton community has
              remained substantially different from the community occurring in the reference
              basin. Even total zooplankton biomass, which remained nearly equal in the two
              basins in all but the lowest pH stage of the acidification, has fluctuated
              widely during recovery. This award will provide funds to continue monitoring
              the treatment and reference basins of Little Rock Lake. This will allow
              assessment of whether the zooplankton recovery is simply slower that the lake's
              chemistry or if the community has been driven to an alternate state which will
              persist for an extended period of time. The funds will also allow additional
              small-scale experiments to evaluate some of the mechanisms affecting
              zooplankton dynamics. Large-scale experiments such as this serve as an
              interface between applied and theoretical ecology. Continued funding of this
              project will provide important insights into the specific effects of
              acidification and into some of the fundamental processes that control ecosystem
              structure and function.
