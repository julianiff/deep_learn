Abstract    :
              Elser  9527322    How does elemental composition ("stoichiometry") of animals
              vary among species?  How might differences in body elemental composition affect
              how food webs function?  This project will test the hypothesis that differences
              among species in body stoichiometry of the nutrients nitrogen (N) and
              phosphorus (P) reflect differences among species in specific growth rate. It is
              predicted that rapidly growing organisms must have high ribosome concentrations
              in their bodies.  Ribosomes are P-rich (low N:P) cellular structures
              responsible for protein synthesis and thus growth.  Therefore, rapidly growing
              organisms are predicted to have lower N:P ratios in their bodies that slower
              growing species. We will test this hypothesis by studying elemental and
              biochemical composition and body growth rates of zooplankton species at high
              latitudes vs. mid-latitudes. Natural selection along latitudinal gradients is
              hypothesized to select for differing growth rates among similar planktonic
              species. We will study ecological and evolutionary determinants of a parameter,
              animal N:P stoichiometry, that is likely to be a key factor influencing food
              webs of lake and ocean ecosystems.
