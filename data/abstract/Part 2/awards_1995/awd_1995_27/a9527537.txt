Abstract    :
              9527537  Rappaport     This award will allow the Virginia Polytechnic Institute
              and State University and the University of Missouri-Rolla to develop and
              distribute a trilogy of electrical engineering courses at the senior/graduate
              level.  These courses include hardware and software components, combined with a
              change in teaching emphasis, and they will be offered at both universities, as
              well as at the University of Canterbury, in Christchurch, New Zealand.  This
              project includes plans for the faculty to develop teaching materials, software
              modules, educational videotapes, and to provide laboratory/hardware experiences
              for students that do not exist today.  Using an advisory panel consisting of
              academic and industry experts from the communications field, the course trilogy
              will be reviewed and perfected during this curriculum development.  Materials
              developed under this program will be made available to universities throughout
              the country, through widely available texts, software modules, experiment study
              guides, and world-wide web postings.
