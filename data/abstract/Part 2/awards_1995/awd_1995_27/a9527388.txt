Abstract    :
              Peter Galison:  Histories of Science/ Histories of Art    In November, Harvard
              and Boston Universities are holding a series of events designed to focus
              scholarly attention on the interface between histories of science and histories
              of art, and to bring public attention to the issues of culture and technology
              -- both how culture views technology and how created technologies produced
              specific cultural forms.  Under this grant, Professor Galison of Harvard and
              Professor Caroline Jones of Boston University are convening an international
              workshop on these issues.  Participants are to discuss precirculated papers on
              specific themes that cross disciplinary boundaries.  Historians of science, art
              historians, cultural historians and philosophers are participating in the
              workshop to be held November 3-5 at the two universities.      This workshop
              promises to enhance the growing intellectual exchange between historians of art
              and science, thus bridging the gap between programs in NSF and the National
              Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities.  The workshop will provide a forum
              for this emerging interdisciplinary area and promote a fertile exchange of
              ideas which may form a basis for assessing past accomplishments and an opening
              on the wealth of new questions that are appearing.
