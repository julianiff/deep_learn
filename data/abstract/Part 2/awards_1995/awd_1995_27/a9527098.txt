Abstract    :
                Abstract  ATM-9527098  Thomas L. Mote and Vernon Meentemeyer  University of
              Georgia Research Foundation, Inc.  UNIDATA:  An Equipment Request to Advance
              Education and Research in  Climatology/Meteorology at the University of
              Georgia.    Funds will purchase two X-terminals and an overhead projection 
              system for use in student weather briefings, class lectures, and  research
              presentations.  Extra disk storage is also necessary to  enable the creation of
              an archive of selected surface and upper-air  observations.  The equipment will
              be used primarily within the  Climatology Research Laboratory and will enhance
              the education of  students and provide the university with the means to access
              new  research projects and fully participate in the UNIDATA community.
