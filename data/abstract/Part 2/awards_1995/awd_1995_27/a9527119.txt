Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT      EEC-9527119  Greenberg    This award provides funding for a "TIE"
              project to pursue cooperative research in the application of acoustics  for
              characterization of gas and liquid phase inclusions in systems of interest to
              the NSF I/UCRC for Separations Using Thin Films at the University of Colorado
              (CSTF) and the Center for Process Analytical Chemistry (CPAC) at the University
              of Washington.  The proposed "TIE" project research represents the first step
              in an anticipated long-term collaboration towards the development of a new
              generation of smart sensors.  The specific research objectives involve the
              adaptation of acoustic time-domain  reflectometry to the study of changes in
              the pore structure which occur during membrane compaction and changes in bubble
              size and position which occur in process streams.  An improved fundamental
              understanding of these phenomena is essential for successful development of
              membrane-based chemical sensors.  The proposed research builds upon existing
              strengths in acoustics and membranes at CSTF and expertise in chemistry and
              chemical processing at CPAC, and makes effective use of costly resources by
              designing and fabricating sophisticated acoustic instrumentation that can be
              applied to both membrane compaction and bubble dynamics.  In addition, the
              creation of a formal "TIE" between the relatively young CSTF and
              well-established and highly successful CPAC will enable CSTF to obtain valuable
              information from CPAC about long-term sponsor development and facilitation of
              technology transfer with industry sponsors.
