Abstract    :
              9527834  KOHN   The use of a novel molecular approach will provide detailed
              information on the self-incompatibility (S) locus, which controls the rejection
              of self pollen and acceptance of cross pollen in members of the tomato family
              (Solanaceae). This genetic locus controls a cellular system of self-recognition
              and rejection that is only partially understood at present.  DNA sequence
              information at this locus has so far been limited to rather few, highly
              divergent, alleles from widely separated species. The S-locus has been little
              studied at the population level because current technology for determining the
              genotype of individual plants requires the use of cumbersome crossing methods.
              Our molecular approach decreases the time needed to sample S-allele diversity
              within and between populations and provides detailed molecular information from
              closely related alleles for studying the relationship between DNA sequence
              change and rejection specificity.    Information on allele number will be used
              to relate species ecological characteristics to effective population size, a
              quantity of concern to conservation biologists. Genealogical structure of
              S-alleles will be used to measure the frequency of historical bottlenecks and
              test the frequency of one possible mechanism for species formation. Test
              crosses among plants carrying S-alleles with very similar molecular sequences
              will help resolve the relationship between sequence variation and the ability
              to recognize self from non-self pollen. Understanding how sequences control
              rejection specificity will provide information useful in plant breeding where
              self-incompatibility limits the breeder's ability to create homozygous inbred
              lines.
