Abstract    :
              Dr. David M. Stanbury, Department of Chemistry, Auburn University, is  
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of   the 
              Chemistry Division for research into main-group electron-transfer   reactions.
              The kinetics and mechanisms of selected chemical reactions   will be probed in
              a series of redox reactions of simple main-group   molecules in aqueous
              solution.  these reactions will be designed so that   the rate limiting step is
              outer sphere electron-transfer. The systems   include halogen, oxyhalide,
              nitric oxide, and ozone oxidation-reduction,   and have been selected to
              contribute broadly to the understanding of the   electron-transfer process. As
              several of these reactions appear to   violate the prediction that there is a
              simple correlation between the   reaction rates and the energy required to
              distort the molecules to a   compromise geometry between the oxidized and
              reduced structures, Marcus   Theory will be tested.  Electron-transfer is one
              of the most basic reactions and is of importance   in many areas of chemistry.
              This investigation will center on systems   that are involved in chemical
              processes occurring in the environment and   in biological systems. The details
              of how electrons are transferred to or   from a molecule will be  determined.
              This is of significance because   several of these systems do not appear to
              follow predicted behavior or   are ones that are unstudied. In order to
              understand the role of these   compounds in the environment or biological
              systems, their fundamental   behavior must be understood.
