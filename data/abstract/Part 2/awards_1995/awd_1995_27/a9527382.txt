Abstract    :
              9527382  DeMaster    The  mechanisms and rates of sediment mixing by the 
              feeding  and movements of animals,termed  bioturbation, may  profoundly
              influence chemical recycling,  microstratigraphy,  and  faunalcommunity 
              structure at the deep-sea floor.  Recent  studies  of ingestion  by 
              bottom-dwelling fauna  suggest they consume newly sedimented, highly organic 
              particles.  If such selective  feeding is     widespread,  biogeochemical
              models, based on single bioturbation tracers,  would provide unreliable
              predictions  about bioturbation,  microbial  metabolism,  sediment  diagenesis,
               and strata  formation.  This  study  will  test  three  alternative, 
              mechanistic  hypotheses  by: assaying ratiotracer  activities  in
              deposit-feeder  guts and on sediment  particles of various  sizes.
              Specifically, tracer-dependent  mixing may result from  (1)  sizedependent
              ingestion of Th-  234-rich particles by deposit  feeders, (2)  selective 
              ingestion of young, food-rich particles by deposit feeders,  independent  of 
              size, or (3)  passive  cascade  and/or  active  sequestering  of  newly 
              deposited  particles  in  animal burrows.      ***
