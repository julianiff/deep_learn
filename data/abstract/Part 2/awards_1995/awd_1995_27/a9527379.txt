              Institute  UNIDATA:  Equipment for UNIDATA Network Integration, Archive 
              Access, and Forecasting Instruction.    Funds will support Unidata software and
              data utilization for the  Desert Research Institute's Atmospheric Science
              Center, the Western  Regional Climate Center, and the Atmospheric Sciences
              teaching  program.  The new equipment will improve data networking 
              reliability, establish both an automated short term archive  operation, and
              provide new forecasting laboratory workstation  facilities for students and
              scientists working at the Institute and  the collocated National Weather
              Service Office.
