Abstract    :
              9527593  Ranker   The herbarium of the University of Colorado holds the largest
              and most taxonomically divers collection of Colorado plants in the world and
              has one of the most significant collections of plants from the Rocky Mountains.
              The gymnosperm portion of the collection comprises approximately 1700 specimens
              and is particularly noteworthy for its important collections of the genus Pinus
              from Mexico and the United States southwest. This award will be used to
              purchase 15 steel herbarium cases to house the collection (previously stored in
              substandard cases) and provide for increased accessibility to and modest growth
              of the collection.
