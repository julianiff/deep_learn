Abstract    :
              This research will employ cross-site and within-site comparisons using three
              LTER sites  to extend and enrich our knowledge of biodiversity and its dynamics
              at these sites and establish a  baseline for understanding the long-term
              dynamics of a critical and sensitive component of these  ecosystems.  To answer
              this question they will document how species and communities of ground-dwelling
              ants respond to local and regional gradients in vegetation and land-use between
              the Central Plains site (Colorado shortgrass steppe), the Sevilleta site
              (transitional between grassland and Chihuahuan  Desert), and the Jornada site
              (Chihuahuan Desert).  The work focuses on ground-dwelling ants because  they
              are easily sampled and observed, are abundant and diverse, are characterized by
              strong behavioral  and competitive interactions, are sensitive to both
              small-scale and large-scale environmental  variations, and may play a major
              role in the movement of materials in arid and semiarid ecosystems.  The sites
              represent a gradient in temperature, precipitation, vegetation, and
              biogeography.  Within  each site, ant  communities and functional roles will be
              compared in grass-dominated and shrub-  dominated vegetation and in locations
              differing in grazing intensity.  Observations at nest sites of  foraging
              individuals and of removal of seeds and mealworms from food stations will be
              used to document  how the relative magnitude of material flow generated by ants
              of different functional groups differs  among habitats within a site and how
              these differences are affected by factors operating at the  regional scale.
