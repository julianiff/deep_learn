                                                             Abstract  EEC 9527345 University
              of Missouri Rolla, Dr. Scott Sudhoff    This award provides funding to the
              University of Missouri Rolla for support of a Combined Research Curriculum
              Development Program entitled, "Flexible Power System Control".  The CRCD
              program emphasizes the need to incorporate exciting research advances in
              important technology areas into the upper level undergraduate and graduate
              engineering curricula and stimulates faculty researchers to place renewed,
              equal value on quality education and curriculum development. This three year
              program under the direction of a multi institutional team of researchers from
              the University of Missouri Rolla, University of Arkansas, and Kansas State
              University will design two new courses to provide students with a firm grasp of
              the fundamentals in distribution and transmission systems and to introduce the
              students to advanced topics in the control aspects of these systems.  Novel
              features of this program include multi institutional cooperation, student
              consulting teams, virtual classrooms and interactive computer exercises and
              design.  The faculty involved in this CRCD program will cultivate and
              disseminate the expertise of the researchers to enhance each school's power
              engineering program.  In addition, this project will lay the groundwork for
              schools to enhance the educational experience of their students by relying not
              only on the experience of on site faculty, but also on the experience of
              researchers at other institutions.                                          v
