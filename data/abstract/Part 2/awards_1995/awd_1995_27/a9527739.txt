Abstract    :
              9527739  STEPHENSON       Fertilization in plants is the culmination of a series
              of interactions between the pollen grain and the female part of a flower (the
              pistil). Each flowering plant in the world today is here because the pollen of
              each of its paternal ancesters succeeded in fertilizing an egg that produced a
              seed. An understanding of pollen tube growth and the interactions of growing
              pollen tubes with the pistil are fundamental to the plant sciences, just as the
              ability to manipulate the growth of pollen has profound implications for the
              applied plant science and biotechnology. One of the most interesting and
              potentially useful pollen-pistil interactions is self-incompatibility (SI). SI
              is a genetic system that allows a plant to recognize and reject self pollen
              while permitting the growth of cross pollen. This mechanism allows plants to
              avoid the deleterious effects of inbreeding. Recently, we have found that the
              flowers of Campanula plants are self-incompatible when they first open but, as
              the flowers become older, they permit growth and fertilization by self pollen. 
               The research funded in this award will identify the genetic causes of this
              breakdown in SI over time; it will examine the molecular basis for the
              breakdown in SI; it will determine how the breakdown in SI leads to different
              levels of inbreeding under different environmental circumstances; and it will
              use DNA sequence information to begin to look at the evolution of SI.  Results
              will allow tests of competing hypotheses in three active and highly debated
              areas of basic plant biology: the population biology of pollen performance, the
              evolution and maintenance of mixed mating systems (partial selfing), and the
              evolution of SI.  Findings should assist in the development of cost-saving and
              time-saving methodology for the production of inbred lines needed by commercial
              plant breeding programs.
