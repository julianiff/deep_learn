Abstract    :
              9527621  Herr       During a rapid-response cruise in October 1993 the principal
               investigators conducted preliminary magnetic, gravity, and rock  sampling of
              the newly erupted flow and adjacent regions on the  Juan de Fuca ridge.  A
              continuation of the time-series  investigation of the new lava flow is proposed
              with 12 ALVIN  dives in 1994 and six dives in 1995.  This project would:  (1) 
              repeat the 1993 survey lines over the new flow, (2) remeasure the  fluid vents
              to establish a cooling rate, (3) conduct a complete  magnetic and gravity
              survey of the lava flow and dike area, (4)  place bottom magnetometers on the
              newly erupted flow area to  determine the cooling/alteration rates, and (5)
              conduct  laboratory experiments on the returned rock samples.  ***
