              This award supports a collaborative research program to obtain  the first
              age-calibrated stress-field history within the West  Antarctic rift system of
              Antarctica.  The opportunity to acquire  the stress data is provided by the
              international drilling program  planned at Cape Roberts, which is located along
              the margin  between the uplifted Transantarctic Mountains and the rifted  crust
              of the Victoria Land basin.  Information on the paleostress  history of the
              Mesozoic and Cenozoic rift-basin fill will be  obtained from the core and
              downhole logging of natural fractures  and faults.  To establish the
              contemporary stress state, the  cores will be examined for coring-induced
              stress fractures and  the borehole will be examined via downhole televiewer and
               dipmeter for any wellbore breakouts and fractures reactivated by  the
              contemporary stress field.  The stress data will be analyzed  to address
              questions relevant to the paleo- and neotectonic  evolution of the Antarctic
              plate.  The results will contribute to  the resolution of outstanding questions
              such as the cause of the  anomalous aseismicity of the continent, the geometry
              of stresses  along the lithospheric boundary between the Transantarctic 
              Mountains and the West Antarctic rift system, and the evolution  of the
              Antarctic intraplate stress field and its relation to  rifting episodes
              associated with Gondwanaland breakup.  Contemporary stress data obtained from
              this program will be added  to the global stress data base, and will help to
              fill the current  void in the global stress coverage marked by the Antarctic
              plate.
