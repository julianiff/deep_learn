Abstract    :
              This research is on algorithmic approaches to VLSI, and four problems are being 
              investigated.  These are:  1. Literal minimization in logic synthesis using an 
              approach based on term intersection graphs.  2. Gate level placement problems 
              using minimum floating Steiner trees.  3. Budget assignment in timing driven 
              placement in which a novel optimization tool is being explored.  4. Clock tree 
              design using a gated design which minimizes activity, hence power consumption. 
               A coherent design system, incorporating above stages, is being developed.
