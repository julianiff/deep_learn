Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at Syracuse University acquire a
              modern single crystal X-ray  diffraction system. This equipment will enhance
              research in a number of areas including the  following: (1)metal oxide clusters
              and solid, (2) boron hydride clusters, (3) metal-thiolate  chemistry, (4)
              alkaline,alkaline-earth and lanthanide chemistry, and (5) the development of 
              technetium and rhenium radiopharmaceuticals.       The X-ray diffractometer is
              used to make accurate and precise measurements of the full three  dimensional
              structure of a molecule. The information obtained gives the precise values of
              all the  bond distances and bond angles of a given molecule and it gives
              accurate information about the  spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to
              the neighboping molecules.
