Abstract    :
                  9527315  Polvani     This project represents an ongoing collaboration
              between Drs. Lorenzo Polvani of Columbia University (under this award) and Dr.
              Alan Plumb of MIT (ATM-9528471) concerning the dynamics of nonlinear
              atmospheric waves and vortices, with particular emphasis on applications to the
              stratosphere.  In this work, a number of tools have been employed.  Initially,
              the techniques of contour dynamics was used to study, at very high resolution,
              the characteristics of Rossby wave breaking under a variety of circumstances. 
              The principal investigators then used a global, pseudospectral, shallow water
              model to look at the two-dimensional dynamics of nonlinear waves in the
              presence of nonconservative processes as well as a "contour advection"
              technique (a Lagrangian, high resolution, contour-following approach to depict
              transport in known flows.  To extend these results, the PIs will examine the
              three-dimensional aspects of the interaction between Rossby waves and the
              stratospheric polar vortex using a multi-layer, pseudospectral, primitive
              equation model.  They also will investigate various aspects of the tropospheric
              circulation related to Rossby wave dynamics - including atmospheric blocking
              and interactions between the Hadley circulation and midlatitude planetary
              waves.    ***
