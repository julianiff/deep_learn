Abstract    :
              In population biology the estimation of parameters such as  effective population
              size and migration rate is crucial.  The rapid increase in the collection of
              population samples  of genetic data allows investigation of patterns and rates 
              of migration among geographically subdivided populations  with much greater
              power.  Present estimation methods either  assume knowledge of the exact
              genealogical tree of ancestry  of the sampled genes or neglect all the
              information about  this tree.  Taking the uncertainty in the estimate of the 
              genealogy into account is the major challenge for a proper  statistical
              analysis of these data.  The proposed research  will use maximum likelihood to
              infer these rates and  patterns, using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to
              sum  over all possible genealogies when computing the likelihood.  Methods will
              be extended to multiple populations:  (1) for a  number of different models of
              population structure, and (2)  for different kinds of data, such as molecular
              sequences.  Computer programs for estimating patterns of migration will  be
              developed and produced.  They will be of interest in  ecology, conservation
              biology, and anthropology.
