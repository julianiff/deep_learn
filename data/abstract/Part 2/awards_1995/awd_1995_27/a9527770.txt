Abstract    :
                This project involves the dissertation research of a cultural anthropologist
              from the University of Kentucky.  The research problem is to understand how
              devotion to the cult of the Virgin Mary in Ireland is mediated by the gender of
              the individual, how these beliefs and practices affect the individual's health
              behavior, and how devotion and the religious beliefs affect opinions about
              Ireland's relations with the larger social and political environment,
              specifically the European Community.  The methods used in this exploratory
              project include participant observation in a representative urban location,
              intensive interviews of healing narratives and ritual processes, several formal
              surveys of selected religious congregation members, and analysis of archival
              material on the religious organizations, ceremonies, and social activities. 
              This project is important because it will provide information on how religious
              beliefs and activities impact on normally secular beliefs and practices, in
              this case about health and international politics.  While the connections
              between these social variables are normally not in the public eye, the behavior
              of people in the world -- e.g., in the former Yugoslavia-- shows that the local
              group identities often rise to be of paramount importance.  Case studies such
              as this will provide information to build a general social theory relating
              religion, gender, health and political behavior.
