              Abstract  ATM-9527637  Yerg, Marty  NOAA-National Weather Service  Title: US/PRC
              Bilateral Meeting    This award provides partial support (with NOAA) for a
              meeting of  the U.S.-PRC Joint Working Group on Cooperation in the Field of 
              Atmospheric Science and Technology, held in Washington, October 24-  November
              5, 1994.  NOAA and NSF have been involved in the official  U.S. bilateral
              agreement with the People's Republic of China for  about fifteen years.  It has
              resulted in many accomplishments in  the areas of tropical and monsoon
              meteorology, mesoscale  meteorology, and climate studies.    The meeting is one
              in a series, held every two years, where the  U.S. and the PRC meet to discuss
              science accomplished and future  plans for the next two years of joint
              research.  The meeting is of  direct benefit to NSF (ATM) in planning its
              science agenda in  regard to joint work with U.S. PIs and the PRC.
