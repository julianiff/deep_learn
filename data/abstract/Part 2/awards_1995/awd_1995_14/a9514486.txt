Abstract    :
              This award supports Professor Erik Antonsson of California Institute of
              Technology, Assistant Professor Kevin Otto of MIT and two graduate students of
              Professor Antonsson's to collaborate in fundamental research in manufacturing
              engineering with Professors Hans-Juergen Zimmerman and Hans-Juergen Sebastian
              of the Department of Operations Research of the Rheinisch-Westfaelische
              Technische Hochschule Aachen (RWTH-Aachen.)  Both groups are utilizing the new
              mathematics of `fuzzy sets` to represent intrinsically imprecise information
              and to formalize trade-offs between conflicting goals.  The US participants
              will benefit from joining their expertise in applying fuzzy set theory in
              Engineering Design research with the German experience in representing and
              manipulating imprecision in Configuration Design.  After exploring the
              commonalities in their approaches, they expect to integrate them and apply the
              combined approach to a realistic industrial problem to test the robustness of
              the technique.  The use of fuzzy set theory instead of utility theory is a
              promising new approach to dealing with decision-making under uncertainty.  A
              unified formal method for configuration and engineering design could be applied
              to virtually all engineering design problems, and ought to reduce engineering
              design time and increase design quality, particularly in the design of large,
              complex systems.  Increasing concurrency (the overlap of work normally done
              sequentially) in engineering design has the potential to significantly decrease
              the time required to create a successful design.
