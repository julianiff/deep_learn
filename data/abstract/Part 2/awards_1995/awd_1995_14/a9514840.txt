Abstract    :
                This award supports a planning visit by the Directors of the Institute for
              Environmental Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, Professor Irving M.
              Shapiro and Professor Robert Giegengack, to the University of Cape Town, South
              Africa.  The purpose of the visit is to discuss the establishment of a Center
              for Environmental Studies at the university, which would collaborate with other
              universities and environmental research organizations in South Africa.  The
              proposed center would focus on the identification and resolution of
              environmental problems that affect the social and material development of
              Africa.  By linking students, faculty, research scientists, and communities in
              common studies, the center will promote multidisciplinary analysis of
              environmental problems and the dissemination of knowledge throughout the
              country.  It is hoped that the center will develop an Africa-centered and
              world-recognized capacity for postgraduate studies of the environment that will
              stimulate a `call to action` for effective resource management in pursuit of
              sustainable development.
