Abstract    :
              This award supports Professor Koblar Jackson and Adjunct Professor Mark Pederson
              of Central Michigan University (CMU), together with a US graduate student and a
              US postdoctoral fellow, to collaborate in materials research with Professor
              Thomas Frauenheim and others of the Institute of Physics of the Technical
              University of Chemnitz, Germany.  They share an interest in the application of
              advanced simulation methods to study the properties of materials, but they have
              expertise in complementary approaches that differ in speed and accuracy.  The
              US participants have expertise in the more accurate first-principles
              density-functional technique while their German partner is more experienced
              with the faster density-functional-based tight-binding approach.  They propose
              to apply both methods in three specific projects: (1) a study of passivation of
              surfaces during chemical vapor deposition, (2) measuring the relative
              stabilities of defects in crystal lattices and (3) examining the issues related
              to the stability and reactivity of silicon clusters.  Pursuing these
              applications will require them to develop new methods for predicting infrared
              and Raman intensities and a new method for calculating surface properties
              within a first-principles approach.  Results of this research will be of
              significant interest to the surface science community and those studying
              silicon-based materials.
