Abstract    :
              9514034  Mullet     The goals of this work are:     1) To delineate the specific
              cis-elements that mediate jasmonate-induced transcription of VspB, a 50 bp DNA
              domain that activates reporter gene transcription in response to jasmonic acid
              in soy beans.    2) To identify and clone genes that encode trans-factors that
              interact with the jasmonate response cis-elements.    3) To complete
              characterization of two jasmonate insensitive mutants of Arabidopsis thanlania
              and clone the genes identified by these mutants.  %%%  Jasmonates regulate the
              expression of numerous genes involved in plant responses to wounding, pathogens
              and pests as well as during specific stages of development. Jasmonic acid is
              derived from linolenic acid by a biosynthetic pathway and the results from this
              work will help to elucidate the biochemical pathways that mediate jasmonic acid
              modulation of plant genes.  ***
