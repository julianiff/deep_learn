Abstract    :
              This award supports Professor Ahmed Shabana and a graduate  student of the
              University of Illinois at Chicago to  collaborate in engineering research with
              Dr. Richard  Schwertassek and others of the Institute of Robotics and  System
              Dynamics of the German Aerospace Research  Establishment (DLR.)  This German
              organization is widely  recognized as one of the premier aerospace research 
              institutions in Europe if not the world, and the  participating institute is
              very highly regarded for its  state-of-the-art research.  The US and German
              partners in  this project are interested in computational aspects of the 
              mechanics, mechatronics and control of constrained  deformable bodies such as
              large scale structures intended  for orbit around the earth.  The goal of their
              research is  to develop more efficient and robust methods for the dynamic 
              analysis and control of large scale flexible systems.  More  specifically, they
              plan to develop new computer and  numerical algorithms for the efficient
              solution of  constrained deformable body dynamic equations, by taking  into
              account the effects of mechatronics and control  parameters.  They intend to
              evaluate the effects of  different linearization schemes on control system 
              performance and develop guidelines which can be applied to  identify the most
              useful dynamics and control methodology  for a particular application.  This
              collaboration benefits  from the complementary expertise of the US group in 
              computational mechanics and the German group in the  experimental control and
              mechatronics of flexible systems.
