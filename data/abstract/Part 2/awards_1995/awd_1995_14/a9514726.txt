Abstract    :
              This project in theoretical gravitational physics is  concerned with a broad
              range of research in gravitational  physics, including quantum gravity, quantum
              field theory in  curved spacetime, classical general relativity, and some 
              astrophysically oriented research.  The mathematical  properties of the
              Wheeler-DeWitt equation on superspace will  be investigated, particularly with
              regard to the existence  of an initial value formulation and to the study of
              the  asymptotic behavior of solutions in the limit as the spatial  geometry is
              scaled to "zero size".  Issues in quantum field  theory in curved spacetime
              such as the validity of the  "averaged null energy condition" and the
              "chronology  protection conjecture" will be analyzed.  Numerous topics in 
              classical gravitation will be investigated, including the  issue of how the
              entropy of a non-stationary black hole  should be defined in a general theory
              of gravity, and the  conditions under which a "second law" will hold.    The
              main goals of this research are to obtain a deeper  understanding of
              mathematical and physical issues in general  relativity, and to make progress
              towards formulating a  quantum theory of gravitation.
