Abstract    :
              This project involves the research of a cultural anthropologist from the
              University of California-Los Angeles.  The project is to maintain and develop a
              data-base of demographic information about a small group of foragers known as
              the Hadza, in Tanzania.  The PI and other collaborators have conducted research
              among this group for the past 10 years.  The questions to be asked concern the
              nature of the local women's reproductive histories to test hypotheses relating
              men's reputations and their wife's fertility, the relation of a woman's size
              and reproductive history, and the nature of the desired offspring set size and
              gender composition.    In addition a  linguist will study the Hadza language
              with the goal of recording its distinctive features, analyzing its relations
              with other regional languages (none have been recognized so far), and recording
              indigenous folk-lore.  This research is important because the group to be
              studied represents one of the few and fast vanishing hunter-gatherer societies
              still existing in the world.  The data on the reproductive behavior and
              language of these people represent a valuable data-base to be used for
              comparative studies of human language, reproduction and family planning.
