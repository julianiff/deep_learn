Abstract    :
              9514389  Begenisich    Most, if not all, physiological processes require the 
              movements of ions across the membrane of the cells.  The  pathways for these
              ion movements are channels, or pores,  formed by proteins imbedded in the
              membrane.  Some of these  proteins pores are specialized to allow potassium
              ions to  pass through the membrane very selectively.  Potassium ion  flow has
              many critical physiological roles for the normal  functioning of the nervous
              system, as well as the generation  and modulation of rhythmic electrical
              activity in the heart  and other organs. With such diverse and important roles
              it  is not surprising that these proteins are the targets of  many biological
              and pharmacological agents.  Although the  structure of some potassium channels
              is now understood, the  specific biophysical  mechanisms by which the channels 
              achieve their very high degree of ion selectivity and the  details of how ions
              pass through the channels remains  largely unknown.  This project employs
              molecular cloning  techniques to express potassium channels in oocytes, where 
              the currents through the channels are detected with modern 
              electrophysiological techniques.       The basic research funded by this award
              enhances the  understanding of fundamental, molecular  properties of ion 
              permeation through the use of cloned potassium channel  proteins.
