Abstract    :
                   The visual cortex of the brain is a major site of activity involved in
              visual perception.  This large network of interacting nerve cells, or neurons,
              analyzes the activity of neural information coming from the eyes, and generates
              activity patterns itself.  The precise mechanisms of how this analysis is
              achieved have not yet been fully detailed at the level of neurons and
              connections between neurons.  There are a variety of categories of interacting
              nerve cell classes, based on their morphology, connections,
              electrophysiological characteristics, and areas of the visual field to which
              they respond.  This project uses electrophysiological, anatomical and
              computational tools to see how function and structure are correlated in this
              complex structure.  Recent results from several laboratories have revealed a
              pattern of synchronization in a subset of cortical neurons, showing oscillatory
              electrophysiological activity at frequencies in the range of 30-60 Hz.  This
              project is designed to reveal some of the cellular mechanisms which may
              underlie how these synchronized oscillations depend on the configuration of
              visual stimuli, and which may play a role in sensory processing.     Results
              from this work will be important in testing a currently controversial issue of
              visual processing, and will be important beyond visual physiology, to help
              understand cortical and complex brain organization in general, and to
              understand mechanisms of perception of the external environment.
