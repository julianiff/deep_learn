Abstract    :
                ***  9514787  Meeks      The long-term goal of this program is to identify,
              characterize and manipulate genes involved in cellular differentiation in the
              cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. strain ATCC 29133, a strain that can differentiate
              motile hormogonial filaments, akinetes (spores) and heterocysts, which are the
              sites of N2 fixation. Nostoc 29133 is also a facultative heterotroph that can
              establish a symbiotic association, via hormogonia, with the bryophyte
              Anthoceros punctatus. Anthoceros produces extracellular metabolites that
              sequentially stimulate hormogonia and heterocyst differentiation of Nostoc spp.
              to 10-fold or higher levels than those seen in its absence. The physiological
              and molecular genetic techniques developed in the prior grant and the
              transposon mutants currently in hand form the methodological and biological
              foundation of this proposal. Specific objectives are proposed in the following
              two areas. I . Heterocyst maturation is dependent on a signal cascade
              regulatory system. Analysis of Nostoc 29133: :Tn5-1063 strain UCD 311
              (Fox~Sym+) with an insertion devR, encoding a receiver-domain-only response
              regulator protein. Biochemical and genetic assays to identify potential
              phosphodonors and phosphoreceivers of DevR. This project will identify members
              of a two component regulatory system involved in heterocyst development. 2.
              Hormogonia differentiation is a consequence of differential gene expression.
              Establishment and analysis of a hormogonia-specific subtractive cDNA library;
              generation by transposition of mutants of Nostoc 29133 altered in hormogonia
              formation; genetic characterization of such mutants and of cosmic clones from
              cDNA analysis. This project is the initial effort in understanding how cells
              divide uncoupled from DNA replication and biomass increase to form hormogonia
              and then return to the vegetative growth state in completing a cellular life
              cycle.  ***
