Abstract    :
              9614256  Otto    Accumulating evidence suggest that the parahippocampal 
              cortical region plays an important role in memory processes,  the precise
              contribution of the parahippocampal cortical  region to normal memory, and the
              way in which damage to this  area impairs memory, is poorly understood.  The
              proposed  studies entail a systematic investigation of the role of the 
              parahippocampal cortical region in memory processes.    An initial series of
              studies involve the development of an  associative memory task that based on
              neuroanatomical  considerations, will actively engage and critically depend  on
              neural circuitry within the parahippocampal cortical  region.  The remaining
              studies entail an  electrophysiological examination of the response properties 
              of individual neurons within the parahippocampal cortical  region during
              learning of this task.  It is expected that  these cells will change their
              response patterns during  learning such that they will become more responsive
              to  stimuli used during training, reflecting a learning-induced  "plasticity"
              of responsiveness.  These data will provide  valuable insight into the ways in
              which the parahippocampal  cortical region participates in memory processes in
              general.
