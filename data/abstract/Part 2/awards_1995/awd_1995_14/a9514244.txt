Abstract    :
                    9514244  Barker      This award supports the participation of ten American
              researchers  at a workshop on Large Molecule Energy Transfer to be held at 
              McLaren Vale, South Australia, July 7 through 12, 1996.  The  American
              organizer is Prof. John Barker from the Department of  Atmospheric, Oceanic and
              Space Sciences at The University of  Michigan.  The Australian organizer is
              Prof. Keith King of the  Department of Chemical Engineering of the University
              of Adelaide.    The workshop will focus on collisional energy transfer
              involving  highly vibrationally excited molecules.  The objectives of the 
              workshop are: 1) to acquaint energy transfer researchers with the  current
              state of theoretical and experimental knowledge in  dealing with large and
              small molecular systems; 2) to identify  experiments and theoretical
              developments which will have the  greatest impact on advancing knowledge about
              large molecular  vibrational energy transfer; and 3) to foster further 
              collaboration and communication between U.S. and Australian  scientists in this
              area of research which should be of mutual  benefit to investigators in both
              countries.  The Australian  support for the workshop is provided by the
              Australian Department  of Industry, Science and Tourism (DIST).  The existence
              of a  final report, to be made available at World-Wide Web sites in  both the
              United States and Australia, will be announced through  the "Molecular Dynamics
              Newsletter", distributed internationally,  and in "Chemistry in Australia",
              which is distributed in  Australia.
