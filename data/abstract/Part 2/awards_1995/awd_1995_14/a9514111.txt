Abstract    :
                   The goal of this research is to enhance our understanding of the conditions
              under which  women have children at an early age, the  conditions under which
              women delay having children,  and conditions that may enhance or inhibit a
              woman's ability to access opportunities for   education and employment. Data
              will be gathered from an American Indian  population and will  provide
              important additions to existing knowledge  about human behavior and
              reproduction.        There are three specific research  objectives: 1) to
              identify the social, economic, and  health factors that  facilitate
              reproduction for the study population; 2) to construct a data set of  women's
              life histories and develop a model of the relationship  between the timing of 
              reproduction, the availability of education and  employment opportunities, and
              the availability of  physiological, social,  and economic resources necessary
              for successful childrearing; and 3) test   hypotheses about the timing of
              reproduction over a woman's life course.  This research explores  an option for
              reproduction among poor women which coordinates limited but early reproduction 
              supported by family networks and later acquisition of education and employment
              opportunities.
