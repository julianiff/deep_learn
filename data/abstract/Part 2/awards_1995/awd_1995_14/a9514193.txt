Abstract    :
              9514193  Kieda       This grant supports cosmic-ray research by a faculty 
              member and a graduate student.  They use a newly developed  technique that
              makes use of two imaging air-Cerenkov  detectors recently put into operation in
              coincidence with  the existing CASA and MIA air-shower detector arrays at 
              Dugway, Utah.  They study the elemental composition of  cosmic-rays at energies
              in the range.  The data are  necessary to distinguish among models for
              accelerating  mechanisms.  ***
