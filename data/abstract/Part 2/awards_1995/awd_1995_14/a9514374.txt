Abstract    :
              Nunez  9514374      The brain and its cells are unique in their ability to
              change in  response to their internal surroundings and the animal's 
              experiences.  This ability to adapt can be demonstrated at the  molecular,
              cellular and behavioral levels.  One of the most plastic  cells in the brain
              are not even nerve cells, but are peripherally  derived mast cells.  The mast
              cells and glial elements provide an  enriched environment in which the nerve
              cells function.  However,  much is unknown about the mast cells in brain
              especially their  function and anatomy.  Dr. Nunez is assessing the ability of 
              daylength, a strong environmental cue, to alter the anatomy of  brain mast
              cells and their central nervous system location.  These  investigations lay the
              foundation for studies on the influence of  mast cells on adaptive behaviors
              and other neurochemical changes.   These investigations will provide
              significant basic information  about the interplay between the environment and
              brain function.   This information will then be used to further understand the
              how  environmental factors increase or decrease species survivability in  the
              wild or captivity.
