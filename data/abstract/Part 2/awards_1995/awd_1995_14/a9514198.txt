Abstract    :

              This research represents a continuation of research in nonlinear  econometric
              methods.  The research has applications in other  disciplines than economics,
              such as biological sciences.  It will  develop better approximations to
              underlying data.  The P.I. will  continue to work on methodologies that
              sequentially improve the  approximations as information becomes available and
              permit  reliable inference at each intermediate stage of model evolution.  
              Application fields within economics include money,  macroeconomics, and
              finance.
