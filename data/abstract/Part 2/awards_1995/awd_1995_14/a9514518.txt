Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support Dr. Fred Wendorf will conduct
              archaeological excavations in the Nabta Playa region which is located in
              southwestern Egypt. Previous work has indicated the presence of prehistoric
              cattle pastoralists in the area from about 9,000 to 5,300 years ago. (After
              that time rainfall decreased and the area was abandoned.) Visible remains in
              the playa include several megalithic alignments, stone `calendar circles`, two
              small stone tumuli covering burials of cattle and 34 largaer tumuli clustered
              into three groups. Based on these preliminary information, Nabta appears to
              have served as a regional ceremonial center and more recent counterparts are
              known from the southern Sahara margin. While these latter are much younger they
              often cover burial chambers for leaders. Dr. Wendorf will partially excavate
              one of the Nabta mounds to determine what it contains, to collect datable
              organic materials and to determine how the structure was built  If skeletal
              materials are recovered these data will provide the basis to design  a larger
              longer term research project.  Archaeologists wish to understand how complex
              societies arise and are maintained. Although a great deal is known about the
              Pharonic period of Egyptian civilization, its antecedents are very poorly
              understood. Preliminary Nabta research suggests that stratified social
              organization may date to at least 6,000 years ago in a pastoralist context. Dr.
              Wendorf's work may shed light on the starting point of the developmental
              process.
