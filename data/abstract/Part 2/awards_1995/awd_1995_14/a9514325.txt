Abstract    :
                This project funds the dissertatin research of a student from the University
              of Connecticut.  The project tests the hypothesis that, irrespective of race,
              ethnicity, age, or social class, women who participate in Connecticut
              state-sponsored fostering programs create an identity of `mother` to the
              children in their care. This entails incorporating foster children into their
              family based on affective bonds, rather than biology or law.  The student will
              select a sample of 120 individuals (60 couples) for extensive ethnographic
              interviews on their experiences as foster parents.  Based on this knowledge the
              student will construct and adminster cultural tests of meaning to a total of
              360 women in the 3 primary ethnic groups in the region (Euro-American,
              African-American, and West Indian), subdivided into novice and experienced
              foster parents and private or state-sponsored programs.  By examining if, how,
              and why, in the face of child welfare policies premised on legal or biological
              definitions of `family,` women create and maintain a sense of themselves as
              `mothers` rather than `foster mothers` and `children` rather than `foster
              children,` the project will clarify the circumstances that lead to foster
              parent disillusionment, fatigue and, finally, drop-out.  The knowledge created
              by  project will contribute to the formation of more effective child welfare
              policy and practice.
