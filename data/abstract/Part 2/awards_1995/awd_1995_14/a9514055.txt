Abstract    :
                                        Abstract    Zuk  9514055    This project will examine
              the ways in which the sexes differ  in both behavior and physiology,
              concentrating on the role  of variation among females in determining the out
              come of  sexual selection, and a definition of male  quality  that  can be used
              to assess condition or vigor under a wide range  of circumstances.  By
              examining female behavior and  morphology, and by using indices of
              immunocompetence to  analyze male quality, the research will extend knowledge
              of  universal, a measure of condition or quality which reflects  immune system
              competence is clearly linked to an  individual s fitness.  Using captive red
              jungle fowl, the  work builds on previous studies showing that females prefer 
              to mate with males with large, colorful combs, and that  infection of males
              with an intestinal parasite hampers the  development of the same characters
              used by females in  choosing mates.  In addition, highly ornamented
              individuals,  have fewer circulating lymphocytes, suggesting that such  males
              pay a price in terms of reduced immune competence by  appearance, and immune
              response, and will integrate basic  and applied research in behavior and
              immunology.  The  outcome will be a better understanding of how behavior, 
              including aggressive behavior and stressful experiences, is  reflected in
              immune system parameters that are relevant to  the health of all animals.
