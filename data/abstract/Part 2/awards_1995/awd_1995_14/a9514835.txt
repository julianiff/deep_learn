Abstract    :
              Zoeller  9514835    The ability of organisms to respond to cold environments and
              to  nurse their young, in spite of the seemingly disparate nature of  these
              stimuli, actually depends on the activation of  the same 
              neurochemical-containing cells in the brain.  The chemical produced  by these
              brain cells is a small peptide called  thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH),
              which controls metabolism by  regulating the secretion of thyroid hormones. 
              Dr. Zoeller is  assessing the ability of these stimuli to modify the production
              of  TRH in the brain.  Additionally, while TRH is involved in the  response to
              these stimuli, it appears that distinct subpopulations  of cells, all producing
              TRH, are responsible for each response.   Using molecular tools, identification
              of these subpopulations is  being explored.  The mechanisms involved in
              organismal responses to  the environment and the energy demands place upon
              them, is critical  to the survival of all species of animals, as is the ability
              to  care for their young.   A greater understanding of brain mechanisms  in
              these areas will foster our ability to facilitate species  survival in
              captivity and in the wild.
