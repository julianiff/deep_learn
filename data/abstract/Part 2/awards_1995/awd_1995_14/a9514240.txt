Abstract    :
              This is a group proposal for continued support of research  in general
              relativity and especially its interface with  quantum physics.  The program has
              several goals which will  be pursued by the PIs in various collaborations. 
              First,  they hope to determine conclusively if quantum general  relativity can
              exist as a mathematically consistent theory  non-perturbatively.  Second, they
              wish to introduce a number  of new approximation methods to:  i)  gain physical
              insights  into the nature of quantum geometry that is to replace the  continuum
              and explore the effects that this replacement  would have on quantum field
              theory;  ii)  study the coupling  of matter fields to gravity;  iii) 
              investigate whether the  requirements that the theory has a good ultra-violet 
              behavior and a good semi-classical limit have unanticipated  consequences; and,
              iv)  explore certain aspects of the  relation between string theory and quantum
              gravity.    This program will explore the most important open problems  in
              theoretical physics, and is likely to produce important  insights and progress.
