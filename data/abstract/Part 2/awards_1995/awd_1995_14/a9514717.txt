Abstract    :
              Hugo A. Hopenhayn  University of Rochester  SBR-9514717    This research will
              examine several aspects of unemployment  insurance that have implications for
              the design of social  insurance in many other countries.  The P.I. will
              undertake joint  research with Dr. Antonio Cabrales of Spain and Dr. Juan Pablo
               Nicolini of Argentina to understand the international dimension  of his
              research project.  The first aspect investigated will be  the adverse impact of
              unemployment insurance on the reemployment  of workers.  Unemployment insurance
              can induce workers to reduce  their search intensity or to decline some job
              offers.  The  research will attempt to determine the optimal design of 
              unemployment insurance to provide insurance yet still provide  suitable
              incentives for reemployment.  The second aspect will be  the ability to learn
              about different workers abilities over their  work history.  Unemployment
              insurance will transfer income from  high to low ability workers over time. 
              This will have an impact  on the optimal design of unemployment insurance.  The
              final  aspect of the research will look at the job creation and job 
              destruction process to learn if this too should affect the  optimal design of
              unemployment insurance, and if so, in what way.
