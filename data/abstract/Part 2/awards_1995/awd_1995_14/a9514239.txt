Abstract    :
                      Abstract  9514239  Klessig        Salicylic acid (SA) has been found to
              play an important role in the activation of defense responses against microbial
              attack in plants.  This laboratory has identified a SA binding protein, which
              is a catalase, and its activity is blocked by SA.  The hypothesis to be tested
              is that increased levels of H2O2 and other reactive oxygen species induce plant
              resistance (PR) genes (PR .  In this proposal experiments will be done to study
              the role of catalase and ascorbate peroxidase (another H202 degrading enzyme)
              inhibition by SA, as well as he induction of PR gene resistant genes.  The time
              course of the levels of SA, H2O2 and PR mRNA will be determined at the sites of
              infection.   Plants made transgenic by the introduction of the nahG gene, which
              codes for the enzyme that breaks down salicylic acid will be examined and
              compared in a number of way to the wild type plants.   Transgenic plants with
              suppressed levels of catalase or ascorbate peroxidase, made by introducing
              antisense to these enzymes will also be examined.  These experiments will
              provide information on how salicyclic acids acts in the plant defense response.
