Abstract    :
              9514238  Vaccarino  The early embryonic stages of brain development in mammmals
              are regulated by the influence of growth factors which stimulate neuroblasts,
              the source of nerve cells, to proliferate in a coordinated manner.  While the
              presence of this control is well established, the mode of action of these
              growth factors is not well undertood.  The objective of this proposal is to
              explore the distribution of the molecular receptors for these growth factors on
              neuroblasts.  Experimental administration of specific growth factors by
              microinjection will be used to examine effects on the proliferation and  death
              of neuroblasts.  Parallel studies will be performed on neuroblasts maintained
              in cell culture.  The results of these experiments will enhance our
              understanding of how the cerebral cortex develops.
