Abstract    :
              Macdermott  9514720  The functional contacts between nerve cells are called
              synapses, and the development of   the nervous system involves elaboration and
              specialization of those synaptic inputs.  A   fundamental aspect of development
              of the mammalian spinal cord is the representation of   sensory input.  While
              the sensory nerves have grown into the spinal cord by birth and   already are
              synapsing with some of their target neurons, the quality of these sensory  
              signals is immature.  For example, the response to stimuli may be prolonged in
              time, and   the area of the body, called the "receptive field", from which a
              central neuron receives   input may be considerably broader than in the adult
              animal.  This project uses   pharmacology and physiology to study the role of a
              particular molecule, the NMDA-  receptor that acts at the synapse to bind the
              NMDA transmitter molecule.  This   component of the nerve cell surface is
              proposed to have two different tasks during early   postnatal development of
              the spinal cord.  One is the processing of sensory pain signals in   the spinal
              cord, and the other is the active fine tuning of synaptic connections between  
              neurons involved in sensory transmission.Results from this work will not only
              help understand the maturation of sensory pain perception, but will have a
              broader impact on neurophysiology and developmental biology.  The results will
              clarify the role of an important receptor molecule in   development, and will
              help understand the developmental mechanisms by which sensory   stimuli are
              represented in the central nervous system.
