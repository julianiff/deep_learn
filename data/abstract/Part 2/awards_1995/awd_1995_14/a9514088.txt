Abstract    :
                                        Abstract    Adkins-Regan  9514088    The goal of the
              proposed research is to analyze  developmental processes leading to adult mate
              choice and  mate preferences, especially preferences that are sexually 
              dimorphic (different in males and females).  The project  will focus on a
              particularly robust and widespread aspect of  mate choice, preference for
              opposite-sex partners (sexual  partner preference), and a species well-suited
              to the goal,  the zebra finches treated with estrogen during the first two 
              weeks posthatch and housed in an all-female zebra finches  treated with
              estrogen during the first two weeks posthatch  and housed in an all-female
              environment from 40 days  (independence from the parents)to 100 days (young
              adulthood)  then prefer to pair with other females.  In order to address 
              important questions raised by this discovery, a series of  experiments will be
              conducted in which annals are exposed to  different hormonal or social
              environment manipulations  during development and then tested for sexual
              partner  preference--organizational effects of hormones produce early  in
              development, and sexual imprinting--and will elucidate  the manner in which
              hormonal and experiential influences  interact during development.  This work
              will advance our  understanding of mate choice and of reproductive behavior 
              development.
