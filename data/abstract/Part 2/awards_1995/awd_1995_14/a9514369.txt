Abstract    :
              9514369     Luine      Communication between cells in the brain requires the
              secretion of  a chemical from one cell which then acts on another cell, that is
               frequently adjacent to it.  One of the chemical messenger molecules  of the
              brain is serotonin.  If enough cells in the brain release  the same
              neurotransmitter in the same area at the same time, the  behavior of the
              organism may be changed.  Dr. Luine is involved in  elucidating whether
              serotonin or another chemical mediator,  gamma-aminobutyric acid, is
              responsible for mediating  hormone-dependent behavioral changes.  The change in
               gamma-aminobutyric acid levels after hormonal treatment or under  natural
              conditions are being assessed, as are modifications in  gamma-aminobutyric acid
              receptors, and the enzymes responsible for  producing this chemical in the
              brain.  Investigating the physical  connections between serotonin- and
              gamma-aminobutyric  acid-containing neurons is underway.  These studies will
              allow Dr.  Luine to establish the complex interplay between brain messenger 
              molecules required to formulate a behavioral response.  Moreover,  these
              investigations will provide a useful model for understanding  how serotonin and
              gamma-aminobutyric acid  interact throughout the  brain.  All vertebrate
              species sleep, eat, and behave and these  results will be pertenient to the
              generation of behaviors in  animals in their natural habitats.
