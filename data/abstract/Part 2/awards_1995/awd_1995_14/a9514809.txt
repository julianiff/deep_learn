Abstract    :
              9514809  Sobel    The studies described in the proposal are linked by the idea
              that  intelligently designed institutions may perform well even if  individual
              participants are boundedly rational, and that a  measure of an institution's
              success is how well it performs when  agents make mistakes.  The proposal
              contains several related  projects.  One project studies auction mechanisms to
              extend the  ideas, introduced by others, that these markets do not rely on 
              optimizing behavior to operate efficiently.  The goal is to prove  that prices
              converge to the competitive price when participants  are budget constrained but
              unsophisticated, and to identify a  class of internally consistent, adaptive
              behaviors that generate  efficient outcomes in complicated auction
              environments.  Another  project analyzes a mechanism design problem with
              two-dimensional  output in order to determine how the ability to observe one 
              component influences the product of the second.  Two studies  focus on the
              relationship between poorly informed agents and  experts.  One model describes
              the function of a market in which  agents must select an expert, either from
              information supplied  through advertisements or word of mouth.  The other
              investigates  when a boundedly rational agent should delegate decision making 
              authority to an expert.  For the most part, the techniques are  standard tools
              from game theory and the theory of mechanism  design; in particular, incomplete
              information will be the primary  reason that agents cannot make perfect
              decisions.
