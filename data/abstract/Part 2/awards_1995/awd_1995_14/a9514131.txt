Abstract    :
              9514131  Carlson       The Particles and Nuclei International Conference  (PANIC
              96) will be held in Williamsburg, VA, 22-28 May 1996  and will be co-hosted by
              the Continuous Electron Beam  Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) and the College of
              William and  Mary.  This is a major conference and will be the fourteenth  in a
              series begun a CERN in 1962.  Its purpose is to bring  together researchers in
              particle and nuclear physics to  discuss recent advances and foster
              cross-fertilization of  both fields.  The average attendance at recent
              conferences  in this series has been about 700 persons.  We are  requesting
              funds to defray expenses, particularly expenses  relating to support for
              unfunded or underfunded active  researchers whose participation we would value.
