Abstract    :
              Moore  9514769    There are marked anatomical differences in the central nervous
               systems of males and females.  It appears that the gonadal hormone 
              environment may play a substantial and integral role in the  development of
              these differences.  However, a component of  structural differences also
              appears dependent on external stimuli  received during development of the
              central nervous system.  Dr.  Moore is investigating the interrelationship of
              factors involved in  developing differences in the central nervous system.  The
              studies  involve manipulation of the gonadal hormone mixture and the 
              environmental experiences young animals encounter.  The influence  of these
              changes on anatomical characteristics of the nervous  system are probed using
              sophisticated neuroanatomical techniques.   These investigations will provide
              significant information about the  factors important for the development of the
              nervous system.   Additionally, information about the role of external
              environmental  factors on the nervous system will also be defined.  This 
              information is crucial to understanding the ability of species to  survive in
              the wild and reproduce successfully, and ultimately  thrive in their natural
              habitats.
