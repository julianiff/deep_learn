Abstract    :
              Current trends in linguistics differ from each other in several  ways;
              nonetheless, many of the differences have polarized around  two persuasions
              known as the formalist approach and the  functionalist approach. The two
              directions are assumed by most to  be mutually exclusive and in competition. As
              a result,  practitioners of each approach have been working in relative 
              isolation from those of the opposite trend, with instances of 
              cross-fertilization or even attempts at clarifying the critical  issues few and
              far between.    Divisiveness within a field of inquiry is counterproductive; if
               the rift is underlain by differences whose nature has not been  fully
              enunciated and examined, it is doubly so. The proposed  conference on
              functionalism and formalism in linguistics directly  addresses this aspect of
              the current state of the field by  adopting two central goals. One is to lay
              out a small set of  basic parameters in terms of which the basic assumptions of
              each  approach can be explicated and contrasted. The clarification of  the
              similarities and differences between the two approaches  provides the grounds
              for addressing our second objective: to  assess the extent to which the two
              approaches are compatible and  to explore ways in which insights of one
              approach may benefit the  other. Given that the formalism-functionalism
              dichotomy is a  meaningful one in other areas of humanities and social sciences
               as well, the results of the conference may contribute to the  rapprochement of
              the two directions both inside and outside  linguistics.
