Abstract    :
                This project consists of a scholar's award for methodological training to a
              cultural anthropologist at the University of California-Santa Barbara.  The
              funds will support the training in geographic information systems of a
              specialist in several research areas: the human and environmental consequences
              of he globalization of the shrimp mariculture industry in Central America,
              population tourism, environment and development in the Western Caribbean, and
              agricultural development, migrant health and environmental justice in central
              California.  The purpose of the training is to advance the investigator's
              research skills in applying spatial analysis with demographic, socioeconomic
              and environmental data.  This project will enhance the expertise of an academic
              scholar in global environmental change research with policy relevant knowledge,
              and contribute to graduate and undergraduate methodological training in these
              areas.
