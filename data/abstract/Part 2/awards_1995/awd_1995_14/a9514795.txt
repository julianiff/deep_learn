Abstract    :
                   This research program emphasizes two different aspects  of precision
              measurements.  In the first the approach of  atom interferometry will be used
              to determine atomic and  molecular properties such as polarizabilities and to
              study  fundamental quantum phenomena such as Aharonov-Casher and  Berry's
              phases. Simultaneously, the potential use of atom  interferometry in inertial
              sensing will be explored, where  there exists the possibility, because of its
              enhanced  sensitivity, that it could replace the laser gyroscope.  In  the
              second a new approach to ultra-precision mass  measurements will be further
              developed. This technique will  exploit the simultaneous determination of the
              cyclotron  frequency of two ions in a trap in order to remove errors in  the
              mass measurements associated with magnetic field  determinations.  Results of
              the research in both areas have  implications beyond the narrow area of AMO
              physics.  Extremely precise polarizability measurements for cesium  will check
              atomic structure calculations required for  analyzing measurements of parity
              violation in the atom;  extremely precise measurements of the mass difference 
              between 3H and 3He could help place bounds on the mass of  the neutrino.
