Abstract    :
              9514305   Boyd      There is strong evidence for sexual differences in the
              central nervous system, and in the physiology and behavior of most vertebrates.
               The steroid hormones derived from the gonads of males and females are
              necessary for the generation and maintenance of these differences.  However,
              they are not solely responsible for these differences and other chemical
              mediators in the brain, notably neuropeptides, subserve critical functions in
              the manifestation of the anatomical differences.  Therefore, a central issue is
              the definition of the interrelationship between steroid hormones and
              neuropeptides in the brain.  The present experiments address this issue and
              focus on the posterior pituitary neuropeptide system, which has been implicated
              in fluid balance, lactation, learning and memory, reproductive behaviors, and
              parental behaviors.  Dr. Boyd will determine whether a direct neurochemical
              link is possible between the steroid hormones and neuropeptide system
              containing arginine vasotocin and how the steroids modulate the ability of
              identified neurons to produce vasotocin.  She will also establish the
              connections of these neuropeptide-containing neurons in the brain.   These
              results are crucial to understanding the basic mechanisms underlying chemical
              messenger interactions in the brain.  Furthermore, they will generate important
              information about the origin of sex differences in neuroanatomical structures
              and provide a basis for gender differences in behavior, prevalent in most
              species.
