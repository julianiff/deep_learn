Abstract    :
                This workshop, organized by Dr. James Momoh,  Professor of Electrical
              Engineering at Howard University, in cooperation with Dr. D. M. Kroko,
              President and Director-General of Energie Electrique de la Cote d'Ivoire, the
              national utility company, will  be held in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, in July 1996. 
              Researchers from Anglophone and Francophone Africa, (Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon,
              Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Senegal, Zambia, and South Africa), and across the US,
              working on electric power distribution, will identify technology issues and
              economical/technical benefits of effective distribution technology.  Little
              research has been done in Africa on distribution systems, whereas, in the US,
              research in these areas is becoming a priority.  This workshop will give the
              African participants first hand information on available tools and technology
              for efficient power system distribution.  It will help African engineers to
              solve the perennial distribution system problems in their countries; the
              resulting increase in reliability would bring  economic benefits.   The
              interchange will help US researchers and engineers understand the needs of the
              African countries and the methodologies they are using to solve the power
              system problems.  Previous workshops on related topics have stimulated a
              significant volume of follow-on collaborative activities among the US and
              African participants.
