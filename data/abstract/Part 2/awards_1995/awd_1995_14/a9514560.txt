Abstract    :
              IBN:  95154560  PI:  Margiotta    Nerve cells, or neurons, communicate with each
              other primarily at functional contacts called chemical synapses.  Each synapse
              is highly specialized for the release of neurotransmitter molecules from the
              presynaptic cell terminal, and for molecular reception of the particular
              neurotransmitter molecules by the membrane on the postsynaptic cell.  The
              receptor structures are made of membrane proteins, and these receptors often
              are clustered right near the sites of presynaptic release.  It remains unknown
              how those receptor molecules become clustered in the postsynaptic membranes. 
              This project utilizes molecular and biochemical approaches to isolate and
              identify the genetic sequences, expression, and functional role of a
              potentially important protein that is associated with clustering of receptors
              for a common neurotransmitter, acetylcholine.    Results will be important for
              neuroscience in general because synapses are crucial for neuronal signaling. 
              Identification of the molecules important for receptor clustering will be
              central to achieving a better understanding of how synapses form and how they
              function.
