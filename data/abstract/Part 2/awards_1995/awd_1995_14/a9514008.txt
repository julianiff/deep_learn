Abstract    :
              9514008  MAY   Fungi are one of the most diverse groups of organisms on earth
              yet little is known about the processes that generate and maintain this
              diversity.  Moreover, the genetic diversity of fungi allows them to evolve new
              pathogenic types quickly in response to advances in crop breeding and medical
              practices.  In this project, the reproductive biology of Coprinus cinereus is
              studied to determine the evolutionary forces acting on one important gene,
              which controls mating compatibility.  Unlike animals with just two compatible
              types, C. cinereus has many and any two types are compatible.  The diversity of
              mating-type genes along with their extreme levels of DNA sequence variation
              make them an excellent system for understanding the evolutionary forces acting
              on protein-coding genes.  The observed patterns of sequence diversity will be
              compared with those predicted by theoretical models.  The results will shed
              light on the maintenance of genetic diversity in many important highly variable
              genes such as mating compatibility genes in plants and histocompatibility genes
              in animals.
