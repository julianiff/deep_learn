Abstract    :
              9514544  Woollacott    In everyday living, infants and children are continually 
              confronted with  potential threats to balance. We need a better understanding 
              of the  conditions that make balance difficult, how children respond  when
              balanced  is threatened, and how those responses change as children  grow and
              gain  experience. By artificially creating a threat to balance, we  can observe
               these different balance recovery patterns and understand the  conditions 
              associated with balance control.  A second question is how  balance recovery 
              strategies change during early childhood and at what stage  children benefit 
              from practicing balance skills.    To answer these two questions we will create
              a disturbance  of balance by  unexpectedly moving the surface on which a child
              stands.  We  will record the  movement patterns used to recover balance and
              measure the  muscle responses  that underlie the recovery movements.    The
              results of the proposed research will contribute to our  understanding of 
              normal motor development, and will be particularly useful in  clinical 
              settings where the evaluation of  balance function of  children with motor 
              disabilities such as cerebral palsy is required. These data  will serve as a 
              basis for determining the time frame of the emergence of  normal balance 
              control and the ability to adapt balance adjustments to  changing conditions, 
              so that the performance of children with delays and  abnormalities in 
              development can be compared to this norm.
