Abstract    :
              Murphey  9514701     Nerve cells, or neurons, communicate with each other at
              specialized junctions   called synapses.  At chemical synapses, an active
              neuron releases a particular   chemical neurotransmitter compound from the
              presynaptic side of the terminal to   cross the tiny synaptic gap and bind to
              receptor molecules on the postsynaptic   cell.  Binding of the neurotransmitter
              leads to an electrophysiological change   called the postsynaptic potential.
              Two sensitive indicators of transmitter release   that can be measured by
              electrophysiological recordings are facilitation, which is   an increased
              postsynaptic response, and depression, which is a decreased   postsynaptic
              response.  Some identified single cells in insects can make two   different
              kinds of synapse on postsynaptic cells, facilitating at one cell and  
              depressing at the other.  The emergence of facilitation at a synapse has been  
              found to be regulated by the postsynaptic cell, so the target cell has an
              effect on   the input it receives.  This work will use electrophysiology and
              pharmacology to   examine this retrograde regulation of transmitter release,
              using the advantages   of invertebrate nervous systems in having particular
              identifiable synapses.  It   may be that a continuous release of a
              co-transmitter differentially adjusts the   properties of the presynaptic
              terminal, or instead that the postsynaptic neurons   release a substance that
              regulates the function of the presynaptic terminal.     Results from this work
              will be important to understanding the important issue of   how synaptic
              activity is regulated, and these results are likely to have a broad   impact in
              both neurophysiology and developmental neuroscience.
