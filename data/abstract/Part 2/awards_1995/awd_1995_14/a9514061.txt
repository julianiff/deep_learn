Abstract    :
                As a result of human activities including fossil fuel combination and forest
              burning, the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) is currently
              higher than in recorded history and it is rising at an unprecedented rate. CO2
              is one of the several `greenhouse gases` and the rapid increase in its
              concentration may lead to global climatic warming.  Vegetation plays a large
              role in the global CO2 cycle-it removes CO2 from the atmosphere in the process
              of photosynthesis and releases CO2 to the atmosphere in the process of
              respiration.  Any changes in global photosynthesis or respiration will affect
              the rate of change of atmospheric CO2 concentration.  Recent studies indicate
              that plant respiration may be inhibited in the short-term by increased CO2
              concentration, yet virtually nothing is known of the underlying physiological
              mechanism(s), the duration of the response, or how widespread this phenomenon
              is in nature. The proposed research initiates an examination of the biochemical
              and physiological basis of the direct effect of CO2 on respiration using a
              combination of novel experimental approaches in both laboratory and natural
              settings.  The research should significantly advance knowledge of the
              regulation of plant respiration by CO2.  In turn, this will improve our
              understanding of the role of vegetation in regulating atmospheric CO2
              concentration and, thus, the potential for global climate change.
