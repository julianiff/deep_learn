Abstract    :
              9514889  Mulloney    The exploration of the neuronal bases for animal movements
              is one of the most challenging tasks that faces the neuroscientist.  This task
              is made feasible through the study of simpler model systems, which are found
              among invertebrate animals. Dr. Mulloney has shown through his previous NSF
              support that in the crayfish small neural circuits in each body segment
              genepate the basic rhythmic movements, and that a separate neuronal
              coordinating system organizes the local movements into a coordinated pattern. 
              With this additional funding, he will explore in more detail the specific means
              by which the reciprocally inhibitory interactions among identified neurons
              generate the basic oscillatory patterns of the local circuits.  Mathematical
              simulation of the physiologically defined interactions by Dr. Mulloney will
              test the progress of the neurophysiological description and guide the conduct
              of further experimentation.  The results from these studies will enhance our
              understanding of the neuronal bases for movements in all animals and have broad
              applications in the design of robotic locomotion systems.
