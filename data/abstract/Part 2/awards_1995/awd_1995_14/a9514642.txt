Abstract    :
              Lufkin  9514642     The part of the mammalian central nervous system called the
              brainstem is formed   embryologically from two regions called the mesencephalon
              and the rhombencephalon.    The rhombencephalon, or hindbrain, is the brainstem
              region through which motor and   sensory information for the facial region is
              conveyed.  Brain development is directed in   part by an important group of
              genes called homeobox, or Hox, genes.  Nothing is known   about the molecular
              mechanisms which regulate the neurogenic Hoxa-1 and Hoxa-2   genes, which show
              highly dynamic spatio-temporal patterns of expression during   development. 
              This project uses biochemical approaches with transgenic mice to locate   and
              characterize the DNA regulatory elements (promoters and enhancers) that direct 
               Hoxa-1 and Hoxa-2 gene expression.     This work provides important
              information that will further our basic understanding of   how Hox genes
              control the complex pattern of neural development, and the results will   have
              an impact beyond neuroscience to genetics and developmental biology in general.
