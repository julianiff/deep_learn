Abstract    :
              Wouter den Haan  University of California, San Diego  SBR-9514813    The
              research will attempt to refine and formulate estimators and  descriptive
              statistics useful in macroeconomic research.  Part of  the research will
              emphasize empirical research, other parts will  emphasize econometric
              methodology.  The specific areas to be  investigated, which are highly
              technical, include business  cycles, long variation in macroeconomic variables
              and forecast  errors.  Research of this type will produce econometric tools 
              which will allow macroeconomists to more accurately analyze the  economy.
