Abstract    :
              9514767  Pevsner       In this proposal Professors Pevsner and Chien request 
              support for participation of their group at Johns Hopkins  University in
              experiments at the L3 detector at the LEP  collider at CERN, in addition to
              work leading to  participation in the CMS detector at Atlas and the AMS space 
              shuttle experiment.  ***
