Abstract    :
              9514105  Harlow    Disuse atrophy of skeletal muscle is a problem faced by
              inactive animals whether it be hospital patients, astronauts in a space vehicle
              or constrained animals during winter dormancy.  Muscle disuse atrophy results
              from a decrease in muscle mass due to a reduction in the number of fibers, a
              decrease in the size of the cells or a combination of the two.  Since the
              hibernating black bears show little protein loss during winter inactivity and
              are thus an excellent model for investigating how some animals avoid muscle
              disuse atrophy, the PI plans to study the mechanism involved in the
              intracellular and extracellular protein changes.  The PI will also determine if
              lactation laces a greater demand on muscle protein degradation.  These studies
              will also determine how much fat (for energy) and protein (for water) are
              required by overwintering bears and what the lactation demands are on fat and
              muscle tissues in order to properly evaluate the bear as a muscle conserver
              during periods of inactivity.
