Abstract    :
              This is a program to study atomic noise sources in simple  radiating systems. 
              Such noise is the limiting factor in the  accuracy with which the most advanced
              high-precision optical  measurements can be made and plays a significant role
              in the  experimental limitations imposed on efforts such as the  production of
              squeezed states and the study of ultra-cold  atoms in traps.  Using atomic-beam
              techniques, the research  concentrates on three areas:  isolating and
              separately  identifying different sources of noise; development of  "internal
              atomic beam splitters" for measurements of atomic  correlation functions; and
              exploration of direction noise of  continuous spatial photon echoes.  In
              addition to having  immediate application in other areas of atomic and optical 
              physics, this work also probes the fundamental quantum  mechanical definition
              of measurement.
