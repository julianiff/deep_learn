Abstract    :
              9514891  Vary    This Americas Program award will leverage support from other 
              sources for a joint planning workshop, on photovoltaic power  generation,
              organized by Dr. James Vary, Iowa State  University (ISU) and Dr. Ethelvina
              Escobar, University of El  Salvador.  The objective of the workshop is to
              initiate a  long-term cooperative project in science education and  research in
              alternative power sources between the two  universities.  The proposed project
              will team photovoltaics  (PV's) specialists from ISU Microelectronics Research
              Center  with Dr. Escobar's group in El Salvador.   ISU has a group  of
              scientists working both on the research and pilot  production of photovoltaic
              devices.  Dr. Escobar has already  established an active program in the
              development of  alternative energy sources for community development in El 
              Salvador.  Photovoltaics researchers from Mexico and Costa  Rica will also
              participate in this workshop.    The extension of research and technology in
              terrestrial PV's  to third world countries is important if the technology is 
              to make it into the market place, since emerging countries  are likely to be
              its earliest users.  This planning workshop  will serve to bring together
              experts from the region to  promote collaboration on photovoltaic devices,
              which may  lead to the development of more efficient alternative energy 
              sources.    ***
