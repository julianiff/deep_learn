Abstract    :
              This grant provides support to the Organizers of the 30th International
              Symposium on Archaeometry to facilitate the participation of non U.S.
              scientists in the meeting. The Symposium will take place from May 20-24 on the
              campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  Held at different
              locations every two years this Symposium is central to archaeometric science
              and it provides a venue for scientists from many parts of the world to present
              the results of their research and to assess developments in the field. Because
              archaeometric research is conducted in an international context and the
              archaeological materials which are the objects of study also come from many
              places it is crucial to have broad and strong international representation.
              However financial constraints for non-U.S. scientists are often prohibitive and
              this grant will permit 10 such individuals to participate in the meetings.
