Abstract    :
                   Stochastic phenomena, the dynamical effects of thermal and  molecular
              fluctuations, are of continuing interest in physics and  biology. Our approach
              involves theory, numerical simulations and  contact with experiments.  In one
              part of the research, quantum  mechanical consequences of chaotic dynamics in
              classical systems  will be studied.  Classical measures of fluctuation
              amplification  by chaos, such as Lyapunov exponents, can be related to the 
              growth rate of quantum variances in systems that can be described  both
              classically and quantally.  This connection will be explored  in the context of
              magneto-optically trapped cesium atom  experiments.  This work leads to a
              reevaluation of fundamental  classical concepts such as point and trajectory
              that turn out to  be unstable characteristics of chaotic systems.  In another
              part  of the research, stochastic properties of the propagation of  action
              potentials along neurons is explored.  These studies  provide a first
              principles account of ion channel fluctuations  and their affects on action
              potential propagation, timing, and  interspike statistics, each of which has
              been recently  highlighted as of importance for the information coding problem 
              in neuronal signals.  The fluctuations cause spontaneous firing  patterns that
              have been measured and which will be compared with  numerical simulations of a
              stochastic theory.
