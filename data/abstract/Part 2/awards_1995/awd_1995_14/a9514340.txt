Abstract    :
              This is a program of aggressive study of optical pumping  mechanisms and
              development of optical pumping techniques  with particular attention toward
              coupling the results of  this work to noble-gas-enhanced MRI.  It will be
              carried out  in close collaboration with MRI team from the university.  The
              initial focus will be on enhancing the MRI signal  through increasing the
              number of polarized rare gas atoms.  The ultimate goal will be to explore
              time-dependent  functional imaging as well as the possibility of imaging in 
              tissues through absorption of the rare gases in the blood  stream, which will
              then deposit them in the areas of  interest.
