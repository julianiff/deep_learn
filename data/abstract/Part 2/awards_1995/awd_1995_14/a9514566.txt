Abstract    :
              9514566  Dytman  Studies of near-threshold pion production in nucleon-nucleon 
              collisions will be carried out at the IUCF cooler ring.  These  experiments
              concentrate on measurements of analyzing powers  utilizing a polarized proton
              beam.  The data will quantify the s-  wave strength in the production process,
              thereby permitting  theorists to test their models of heavy meson exchange
              and/or off-  energy-shell effects in nucleon-nucleon interactions - a topic of 
              significant current interest.  The group will also continue to  play a leading
              role in the construction of the CEBAF Large  Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS)
              detecter, with the construction of  the Region I drift chambers.  They are also
              leaders in defining  the physics of the nucleon resonance program at CLAS. 
              Upon  completion of the CLAS detector in 1997, the Pittsburgh group  will be
              major contributors to the production and analysis phase,  both as spokesman and
              as collaborators.  They are scheduled to  run for 168 days of production.  ***
