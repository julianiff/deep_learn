Abstract    :
              9514180  Abolins       This grant supports a program of research in elementary- 
              particle physics with an international collaboration that  studies properties
              of proton-antiproton interactions at 2  GeV produced in the Fermilab Tevatron
              colliding-beams  acceleratop complex.  Topics of interest include production 
              and decay of top quarks, precision measurement of parameters  important for
              detailed investigation of the validity of the  "standard model" theoretical
              framework.  Included is support  for instrumentation development to improve the
              capability of  DO and future detection apparatus.  ***
