Abstract    :
              9514421  Thompson    Understanding the functioning of messenger molecules inside
               cells is critical for a complete explanation of how nerve  cells communicate. 
              Activation of molecular receptors on the  surface of nerve cells by
              neurotransmitter molecules  unleashes a cascade of events, which is
              orchestrated by the  intracellular messengers.  The key messenger is the 
              concentration of calcium ions, which controls the production  of the gaseous
              neurotransmitter, nitric oxide (NO).  Nitric  oxide, in turn, stimulates the
              production of the cyclic  nucleotide messenger, cGMP.  Calcium ions, NO, and
              cGMP  together regulate numerous physiological events, including  synaptic
              transmission and the opening of membrane ion  channels.   The focus of this
              research project is on the  dynamics of calcium ion concentrations, which are
              affected  by calcium release from intracellular storage compartments  and by
              calcium ion inflow through the cell membrane. More  specifically, the
              experiments are concerned with the  internal signaling pathway that is
              activated by muscarinic  cholinergic receptors in cultured cells.  Techniques 
              employed include the voltage clamp and calcium imaging;  these are combined
              with modern molecular techniques to  examine in detail rate-limiting steps in
              the activation of  calcium release, for calcium influx, and in the production 
              of cGMP.    It is expected that these experiments will greatly advance  our
              understanding of fundamental cellular mechanisms that  regulate signaling
              within nerve cells.
