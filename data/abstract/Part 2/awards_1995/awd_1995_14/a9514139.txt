Abstract    :
              ***  9514139  Fuller                                                            
                   This is a planning visit proposal submitted by Dr. Michael  Fuller, the
              University of California at Santa Barbara.  He  plans to visit his counterparts
              in Kalimantan, Indonesia  for site evaluation for a paleomagnetic study and for
              field  logistics.  Large scale platewide rotations have been noted  by
              paleomagnetic studies using the results collected from  the Philippine Sea
              Plate in the East to Myanmar (Burma) in  the West.  Additional paleomagnetic
              data from Kalimantan,  Indonesia are needed to ascertain whether such
              geological  signals are present in the area.  Dr. Fuller will use this 
              planning visit to assess the accessibility to research sites  and field
              logistics.  ***
