Abstract    :
              Adams  9514678    Insect growth and development is associated with repeated
              shedding  of the old exoskeleton or cuticle in a process called ecdysis.  The 
              successful performance of this complex behavior is crucial to the  survival of
              developing insects.  It appears that a newly described  novel endocrine system
              regulates ecdysis in moths and may be  important to this develomental process
              in all insects.  This novel  endocrine system appears to produce multiple
              hormones.  The  identification of these hormones is paramount to Dr. Adams' 
              research endeavor.  Once these factors have been chemical  identified, reagents
              will be prepared that allow the localization  and quantification of the
              hormones in the insect during  development.  Finally, the site and mechanism of
              ecdysis-triggering  hormone action will be elucidated.  This unique endocrine
              system  provides opportunities to study the hormonal regulation of  development
              and behavior from the molecular to the organismal level  including information
              regarding the regulation of hormone sythesis,  release and physiological
              action.  Furthermore, premature  administration of ecdysis-triggering hormone
              to early stages of  larvae and pupae is lethal, these hormones may prove to be
              of great  commercial significance in the biological control of insect pests.
