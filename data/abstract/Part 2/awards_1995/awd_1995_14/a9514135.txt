Abstract    :
              9514135  Westfall    Sea anemones are marine invertebrates that belong to the 
              most primitive group of animals with a nervous system.  Studies of these
              animals reveal nerve-cell function at its  most elemental.   Research on the
              relatively simple nervous  systems of these animals can reveal the nature of 
              neurotransmitter and neurohormone prototypes early on the  evolutionary scale. 
              Earlier studies by Dr. Westfall, and  supported by the NSF, suggest that even
              these primitive  nervous systems include both excitatory and inhibitory 
              interconnections.  Research under this award includes  ultrastructural studies
              to describe in detail the synaptic  contacts between sensory cells, ganglion
              cells, and the  harpoon-like stinging capsules (nematocysts).   These 
              anatomical studies with the electron microscope are  complemented by additional
              studies that employ  immunohistochemistry to identify and localize
              neurohormones  in the sea anemones.    These studies provide a unique look at
              the first-evolved  nervous systems, which will help inform all of biology about
               the evolution of higher animals.
