Abstract    :
              Dermatoglyphic traits develop during the second trimester in utero, and are
              excellent markers  for second trimester antenatal environmental events.  Recent
              research has demonstrated that a  monozygotic twin model employing
              dermatoglyphics may be used to determine whether  antenatal environmental
              conditions influence the etiology of complex bio-behavioral traits  during the
              second trimester.  This model has been successfully applied in a study of 
              schizophrenia.  Identical twins discordant for schizophrenia (ie., one twin had
              the disease while  the other did not) were also discordant for total finger
              ridge count. As monzygotic twins are  usually concordant for this
              dermatoglyphic trait, an environmental event is implicated.  This   event would
              have to occur during the second trimester and may play a role in the etiology
              of  schizophrenia, as well as in the development of dermatoglyphic traits.   
              The present study will use this monozygotic twin-dermatoglyphic model to
              determine whether  there is evidence of a second trimester antenatal
              environmental component in the etiology of  other complex behaviors in males. 
              This study will also collect data on other characteristics  associated with
              antenatal development, such as handedness and birth-weight.
