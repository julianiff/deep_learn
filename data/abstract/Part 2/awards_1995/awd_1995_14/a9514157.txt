Abstract    :
              9514157  Balamuth  A study of the structure of nuclei with unusual neutron to
              proton  ratios, "halo" nuclei, will be undertaken,  Some of these nuclei  are
              thought to be important in stellar evolution but can be  produced in high
              energy heavy ion collisions at the Michigan  State University National
              Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory.  Some neutron-rich light nuclei are
              produced at sufficient  excitation that they decay by particle emission.  Their
              structure  and lifetime for dissociation can be inferred by using charged 
              particle, neutron, and gamma ray detectors to measure the break-  up fragments.
               Another category of nucleus of interest includes  those nuclei with N=Z. 
              Charged-particle, neutron and gamma ray  detectors at Gammasphere (LBL) will be
              used to provide structure  and lifetime information about these proton-rich
              nuclei.  ***
