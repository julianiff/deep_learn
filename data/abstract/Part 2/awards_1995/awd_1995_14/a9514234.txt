Abstract    :
              9514234  Stomp  This award provides support for purchase of equipment required
              for the establishment in the U.S. of a collection of diverse isolates of Lemna,
              also known as duckweed.  Lemna is a monocotyledon that grows as a free-floating
              plant in slow moving lakes and stream and is of considerable potential for
              basic studies in the biology of plants and for more applied uses as a source of
              animal feed and specialty chemicals.    The collection consists of about 1000
              strains collected by Dr. Elias Landolt of the University of Zurich over the
              course of his scientific career; these isolates represent all 32 known species
              of Lemna and most of the geographic range of the organism.  The collection is
              being moved to the U.S. where it will be made available to other researchers by
              the awardee.  ***
