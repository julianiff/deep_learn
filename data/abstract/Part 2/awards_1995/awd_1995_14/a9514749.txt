Abstract    :
              Audrey Light  Ohio State University  SBR-9514749    The research will analyze
              the effect of schooling on job  turnover.  There is little consensus in the
              economics profession  about whether job turnover is higher or lower among more
              highly  educated young individuals.  One of the questions to be  investigated
              is whether whatever compels a young person to stay  in school also compels him
              to stay with his employer.  An  alternative question to be investigated is
              whether young people  go to school instead of looking for the "right" job.  If
              this is  true, job turnover may increase later.  The answer to these and  other
              related education/job turnover research questions could  affect future
              education policies.  The research will use 1979-94  data on young people,
              covering both males and females, whites,  blacks and Hispanics.  It will employ
              sophisticated econometric  techniques to separate individual effects from
              education effects.
