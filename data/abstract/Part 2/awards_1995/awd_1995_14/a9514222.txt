Abstract    :
              9514222  Smith       This proposal requests  three years of support for a  group
              of researchers to participate in experiments at three  laboratories: 
              Brookhaven, Fermilab and DESY.  The  experiments will search for rare composite
              hadronic objects,  measure the properties of charmonium, and probe for quark 
              substructure.  The techniques include heavy ions, cooled  antiproton beams and
              electron-positron collisions in a large  collider collaboration known as ZEUS.
