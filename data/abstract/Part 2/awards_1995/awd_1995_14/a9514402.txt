Abstract    :
              9514402  Weiss    A U.S.-Latin American workshop will be given May 25-27, 1996 
              at the Universidade Federal de Rural, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil  on problems in
              the area of time-resolved experiments in  photochemistry, photophysics, and
              photobiology.  Invited  participants include scientists from 9 U.S. states,
              Puerto  Rico, and 3 South American countries.  The workshop will be 
              coordinated by Richard Weiss from Georgetown University, and  Frank Quina of
              the University of Sao Paulo, with the  cooperation of the Inter-American
              Photochemical Society  advisory board and president. Moreover, 2 additional
              U.S.  participants will be selected competitively from junior  faculty and
              post-doc applicants.    The organization of the workshop, including the
              selection of  participants, promises a healthy interaction and the  potential
              for establishing new long-term collaborations  between U.S. and South American
              scientists. Because of  recent equipment acquisitions in several South American
               photochemical research laboratories, this is an especially  appropriate time
              for establishing a baseline for where the  field is and where it is going.  As
              much of the workshop  focus will be on methodology, this also provides a forum
              for  interchange of experimental methods necessary for the proper  use of the
              sophisticated equipment.  ***
