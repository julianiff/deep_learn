Abstract    :
              9514844  Larson-Prior    The cerebellar cortex is an area of the brain known to 
              receive  multi-modal sensory information which it uses to organize  appropriate
              motor  outputs. Incoming sensory information is processed, in part,  by 
              neurotransmitters whose actions can be modulated by  serotonin.  At this time, 
              the cellular mechanisms by which the cerebellar cortical  circuit organizes and
               integrates incoming sensory data to produce appropriate  motor commands are
              not  well understood.  In some systems, modulation of  neurotransmission is
              known to  produce a reorganization of the underlying circuitry which  results
              in the  generation of different neural responses.  The ability of  serotonin to
              effect  such changes in the cerebellar cortical circuit will be  examined in
              these  studies.  It is hypothesized that serotonin provides a  global
              modulatory signal  that is independent of the type of sensory data being 
              processed.  Thus, serotonergic input may signal changes in a global  manner
              that is of  equal relevance to all activated sensory systems.  Under  these
              circumstances,  cells which project information to the cerebellum utilizing 
              serotonin as a  transmitter could regulate the level of motor response  evoked
              by any given  sensory signal dependent upon the state of the organism.  By 
              providing  information on the manner in which serotonin modulates  cerebellar
              processing,  these studies will add significant new information  concerning the
              mechanisms  by which the brain coordinates and controls movement.
