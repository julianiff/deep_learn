Abstract    :
              This award supports Professors Gary Hachtel and Fabio Somenzi, and  a graduate
              student, all from the University of Colorado, to  collaborate in computer
              science research with Professor Christoph  Meinel and others of the Department
              of Computer Science and  Complexity Theory and VLSI-Design of the University of
              Trier,  Germany.  They are working in the area of computer-aided circuit 
              design, focusing on the synthesis and verification of digital  systems using
              `binary decision diagram` data structures.  Together  they will explore new
              classes of these efficient data structures  and their behaviors in specific
              applications.  Previous work by the  group at Trier on Ordered Binary Decision
              Diagrams (OBDDs) has  focused primarily on the theoretical foundations and the
              connection  with complexity theory.  The US group has been motivated by real 
              problems of electrical engineering such as sequential circuit  verification,
              optimization and testing.  The plan for collaboration  will transfer and
              combine the complementary knowledge and  experience of the two groups.  The
              resulting synergism should  result in contributions to both theoretical and
              practical aspects  of circuit design.
