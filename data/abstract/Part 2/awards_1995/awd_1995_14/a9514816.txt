Abstract    :
              9514816     Dohanich    The neural basis for the development of learning and
              memory is  currently unclear. However, studies have implicated the cholinergic 
              nerve network in the brain as being an integral chemical component  of the
              process of learning and memory.  Recent investigations noted  that gonadal
              hormones, particularly estrogen, may participate in  these complex behaviors,
              especially during advancing age. The  investigations of Dr. Dohanich will
              establish the linkage between  these chemical messenger molecules in learning
              and memory across  the ages.  As part of these investigations, the experiments
              will  characterize the hormonal conditions that affect performance in  tasks of
              learning and memory, particularly following the compromise  of the cholinergic
              system.  Further innovative investigations will  elucidate the
              interrelationship of the environment, either simple  or complex, with the
              hormonal milieu in the development of learning  and memory.  Unfortunately,
              ample basic information regarding the  complex interactions of the brain
              chemical messenger molecules and  the environment has precluded a clear
              understanding of the  development of learning and memory behaviors.  The
              present  investigations will foster greater understanding of these critical 
              behaviors. Moreover, the role of the environment in learning has  been proposed
              but critical investigations have not been undertaken.   These studies will be
              among the first to generate quantifiable data  on the role of the environment
              in information processing in  biological systems.
