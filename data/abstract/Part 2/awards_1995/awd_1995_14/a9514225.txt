Abstract    :
              9514225  Jorns  The area of flavins and flavoproteins is a broad, but clearly
              and simply defined one.  It covers all aspects of work pertaining to the
              chemistry  and biology of compounds based on the isoalloxazine nucleus and on 
              very closely related structures.  Because of the extraordinary versatility  of
              flavin as a prosthetic group and its  involvement in a variety of important 
              biological oxidation  and reduction processes, this area continues to expand
              rapidly.  Interest in flavins ranges from theoretical chemistry to medical
              aspects.  The 12th International Symposium on flavins and Flavoproteins is to
              be held at the University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada, June 30-July 6,
              1996, as one of a series which has been organized at 3-year intervals since
              1965,  The last symposium was held  in Nagoya, Japan in 1993.  Because of the
              continued and increasing pace of research in this area, it is important that
              regularly scheduled meetings be held.  Review lectures will cover the entire
              field and the meeting should bring together scientists from all over the world
              from a wide variety of disciplines, and promote valuable discussion and
              exchange of information.  In addition, it should serve the purposes of keeping
              existing workers fully up to date with all aspects of the subject and of
              initiating young investigators into this important area of research.
