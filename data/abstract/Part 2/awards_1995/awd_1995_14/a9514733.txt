Abstract    :
              Anthropologists have long been interested in the relationship between biology
              and culture.  The  Hindu caste system, which established preferred mating
              practices among the populations of  India, is a good example of the impact of
              social processes on human biology.  Numerous  investigators have studied the
              effect of the caste system on genetic variation.  Yet the  generalizations from
              this body of work remain unconvincing for several reasons.  First, many of  the
              polymorphisms assayed are indirect measurements of DNA variation, are sampled
              from  only a few loci, and are not selectively neutral.  Second, many studies
              do not estimate  significance levels or confidence intervals, leaving the
              findings suspect.  Finally, no systematic  comparisons have been made with
              continental populations (i.e., Africans, Asians, and  Europeans) using a large,
              uniform set of DNA polymorphisms.  To date, no one has taken  advantage of the
              recent advances in molecular biology to address unresolved questions of 
              long-standing importance to human evolution in India.  The proposed research
              will critically  investigate the genetic evolution of South Indian caste
              populations by (1) formulating and testing  hypotheses of the effect of caste
              subdivision on genetic variation; (2) using a variety of  mitochondrial and
              nuclear DNA polymorphisms;  and (3) making direct comparisons to  continental
              populations.  The study will analyze mitochondrial DNA, Y-chromosomal DNA, and
              autosomal DNA  polymorphisms with differing rates of mutation from a sample
              representing individuals in 4  castes spanning the caste hierarchy and 2 tribal
              populations.  Comparisons will be made to our  existing data from caste and
              continental populations.
