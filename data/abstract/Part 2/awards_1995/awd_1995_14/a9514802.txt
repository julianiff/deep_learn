Abstract    :
              Albers  9514802      Odors are one of the most common forms of social
              communication  among individuals of many species.  These odors are effective 
              mechanisms to communicate information regarding dominance status  and mate
              choice.  Recent studies have revealed that the peptide  neurotransmitter,
              vasopressin, in the medial preoptic-anterior  hypothalamic region of the brain
              is involved in odor-induced  communication.  Dr. Albers research is
              characterizing the brain  circuitry involved in gonadal hormone-dependent
              odorant  communication and is elucidating the role of glutamate as an 
              additional neurochemical substrate underlying this behavior.  These 
              investigations are providing new information about the basic  principles
              regulating neural and hormonal interactions to govern  complex mammalian
              behaviors.  In addition, information regarding  the mechanisms of mate choice
              and reproductive success in the  laboratory or the wild will be gained from
              these studies.
