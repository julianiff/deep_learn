Abstract    :
              The Effect of Expecting to Evaluate and of Forming Performance Expectations on
              the Evaluation Process and Outcome  People are increasingly asked to evaluate
              their experiences õ their satisfaction with the quality of products they
              purchase, services rendered to them, and so forth.  However, there is little
              research examining how these evaluations are formed and what factors influence
              their content.  For example, does it make a difference if evaluations are
              elicited from individuals spontaneously (the individual asked for the
              evaluation does not anticipate being asked) versus deliberately (from
              individuals informed  that an evaluation will be requested after the good or
              service is provided)?  The proposed research will examine differences between
              spontaneous and deliberate evaluations resulting from a variety of factors
              including recall, primacy effect, the effect of a `peak event`,  the
              correlation between judgment and recall,  susceptibility to context effects,
              susceptibility to order effects and the influence of irrelevant reasons.
