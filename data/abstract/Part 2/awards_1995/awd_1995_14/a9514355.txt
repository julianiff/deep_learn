Abstract    :
                This project has three goals:         (1) To create an electronic lexical
              database of Standard  Istanbul Turkish, called Turkish Electronic Living
              Lexicon  (TELL). TELL will be unique among existing corpora in reflecting  the
              actual knowledge and pronunciations of native speakers. It  will be of value
              for a variety of research purposes, including  phonological, morphological, and
              lexicostatistical research.         (2) Using TELL, to pursue specific
              phonological questions  about Turkish during the course of the project, which
              will (a)  help to ensure that the database contains data representative of 
              relevant phonological phenomena in Turkish and (b) result in  journal articles.
                      (3) Using TELL, to produce a book, The Lexical Phonology of  Spoken
              Turkish, which will be a comprehensive survey of the  phonology of Turkish
              words. The book will provide a complete  description and theoretical analysis
              of Turkish lexical  (word-internal) phonology which, by being based on new data
              from  TELL, will be able to go far beyond past work.
