Abstract    :
              Experimental data on the spectra of the excited states of  the heavier rare
              gases and of the hydrogen halides will be  collected, interpreted and compared
              with existing  theoretical models.  The results will provide new insights  into
              the multichannel coupling which exists in the excited  states of these
              molecules and provide data needed for a  number of applications.
