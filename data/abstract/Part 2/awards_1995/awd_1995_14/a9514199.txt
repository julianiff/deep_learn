Abstract    :
              9514199  Fracalossi    This U.S.-Brazil planning grant will support a trip by 
              Debora Fracalossi of the National Zoo and Smithsonian  Institution to Manaus,
              Brazil to establish a  collaboration with Vera M. Fonseca de Almeida e Val of 
              the National Institute of Amazonian Research (INPA). The  eventual objective
              will be to perform a comparative study  of the L-gulonolactone oxidase activity
              in Amazonian  fish. This is to be accompanied by correlation between  such
              activity and diet, including studies of the vitamin  C levels in fruits and
              seeds consumed by fish. The  broader objective is a deeper understanding of the
               biosynthesis of vitamin C in vertebrates    The establishment of cooperation
              between the National Zoo  and INPA is very promising, with benefits to both
              sides.  The research is of intrinsic interest, extending our  knowledge of
              physiological processes, and of potential  application to nutrition.  ***
