               9514096 Celenza  The primary way in which plants increase the size of their
              root system is by lateral, or secondary, root formation. This developmental
              process involves the coordination of both differentiation and cell division.
              Exogenous application of the plant growth hormone indole-3 acetic acid (IAA)
              induces cell division in the cells that give rise to lateral roots and
              therefore increases the number of lateral roots. The long term goal of this
              work is to define the developmental pathway or lateral root formation and
              understand how IAA regulates that pathway. Previously, three Arabiodopsis
              mutations were discovered that cause aberrant lateral root formation (alf).
              Briefly, the alf1-1 mutation causes a hyperproliferation of lateral roots
              presumably due to excess IAA, the alf4-1 mutation fails to make lateral roots
              and is insensitive to IAA, and the alf3-1 mutant initiates lateral roots but
              the lateral roots fail to mature and die. Surprisingly, IAA rescues the alf3-1
              mutant. The first objective of this proposal is directed at cloning and
              characterizing the ALF4 gene product. The  ALF4 gene will  be cloned using a
              map based approach as well as a transposon tagging scheme. The gene has been
              mapped in relation to the Arabidopsis physical map and flanking markers have
              been identified. in addition, DS elements capable of excision and reinsertion
              have been mapped to locations near the genes. Once the gene is cloned, its
              predicted protein sequence will be compared to sequence databases. From this
              information experiments will be designed to determine the biochemical function
              of the gene product. These experiment will include analysis of the temporal and
              spatial expression patterns of the gene, determination of the intracellular
              location of the protein, and expression in heterologous systems directed at
              assaying biochemical function. New mutants defective in lateral root formation
              will also be isolated as well as the identification of new mutant alleles of
              ALF3 and ALF4. Mutants will be screened for in populations mutagenized with
              different mutagens and derived from different ecotypes. ***
