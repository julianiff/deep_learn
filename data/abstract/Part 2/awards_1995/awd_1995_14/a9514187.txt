Abstract    :
              9514187  Riddiford      Ecdysteroids cause insect molting and metamorphosis, and
              juvenile hormone is present during larval life to allow growth and molting and
              to prevent metamorphosis. Interference with the action of these hormones is one
              way to control insect pests. Dr. Riddiford has found that there is a dynamic
              and complex pattern of changing ecdysteroid receptor isoforms and its partner
              USP during a molt and at metamorphosis in the epidermis of the tobacco
              hornworm, Manduca sexta.  She now plans to study both the hormonal and the
              spatiotemporal regulation of these receptors and the initial transcription
              factors that they induce at the cellular level using primarily
              immunocytochemical and in situ hybridization analysis of tissue exposed to
              these hormones both in vivo and in vitro. These studies will provide deeper
              insight into how the ecdysteroids initiate and coordinate the cellular
              responses that lead to the formation of a new cuticle during a molt and during
              the switch in cell fate that is essential for metamorphosis. By studying the
              influence of juvenile hormone on these cellular dynamics, she will shed new
              light on its mode of action in the prevention of the switch of cell fates.
