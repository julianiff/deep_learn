Abstract    :
              9514150  Ganezer       In this RUI proposal Professor Ganezer requests support 
              for the study of solar neutrinos at an experiment known as  Super-Kamiokande. 
              This project will provide a unique  opportunity for an ethnically diverse group
              of students to  participate in a state-of-the-art experiment that is of  major
              interest in Physics and Astronomy.  ***
