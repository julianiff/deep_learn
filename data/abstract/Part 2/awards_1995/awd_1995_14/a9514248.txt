Abstract    :
              9514248  Zot    The Zot laboratory has discovered the first non-actin protein
              that binds a nonfilamentous myosin.  This protein, Acan125, from Acanthamoeba,
              binds to myosin-I through a src homology domain, SH3.  Another protein, Acan47,
              copurifies with Acan125 and may also be a myosin-binding protein.  The goals of
              this project are to determine the functions of Acan125 and Acan47 in order to
              determine cellular roles for myosin-I.  The specific aims are to: 1, determine
              the structure of Acan125 and its SH3 binding site by cloning and sequencing the
              cDNA; 2, determine the structure and myosin-I binding characteristics of
              Acan47; and 3, establish a role for Acan125 in Acanthamoeba using monospecific
              high-titer antibodies to localize Acan125 by immunofluorescence and to inhibit
              its function in living cells by microinjection.  Antibody-injected cells will
              be monitored for myosin-associated functions such as shape changes and cell
              motility, intracellular vesicular transport, and vacuolar contraction.  In
              addition, Acan125 and myosin-I will be localized simultaneously by double-label
              immunofluorescence, including isoform-specific antibodies to myosin-I to detect
              changes in patterns of associations between specific isoforms of myosin-I and
              Acan125.        This project will explore not only issues of myosin-I function,
              but also the broader issue of SH3 function.  SH3-mediated associations form
              transiently between proteins of diverse functions on the surfaces of cellular
              membranes.  Cellular movement requires the coordination of membrane and
              cytoskeletal systems.  As a result of its lipid binding properties, the
              actin-based motor protein myosin-I has been implicated in many
              membrane-mediated motile processes.  The characterization of SH3 binding
              partners will likely reveal novel roles for myosin-I and the microfilament
              system.  the overall goal is to understand the processes involved in
              actin-based cell motility that are common among all cells.  ***
