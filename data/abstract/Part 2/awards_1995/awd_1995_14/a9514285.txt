Abstract    :
              9514285  Murray         In vitro methods will be used to study gap junctions 
              and gene regulation following treatment of cells with  compounds known to
              influence junction expression and to  promote adrenal steroidogenesis. 
              Specially, the effect of  adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), and DbcAMP treatment and
              cAMP-  dependent protein kinase (pKA) activity on gap junction  expression will
              be studied.  Bovine and human adrenal  cortical cell lines and primary rat
              cultures of adult rat  adrenal cortical cells will be used.  Vectors containing
               cDNA antisense directed against gap junction gene products  (Connexin 43,
              Cx43) will be introduced into cells to  determine the effect of gap junction
              expression inhibition.  Adrenal gland development in transgenic mice containing
              a  Cx43 knockout will be studied.  The effect of over  expression and
              inhibition of gap junctions on adrenal cell  function, will be studied.  Gap
              junction expression will be  characterized and localized with
              immunohistochemistry,  western blot and northern blot analysis.  Evidence of
              cell  communication will be obtained with Lucifer yellow dye  transfer
              experiments.  Studies on the role of pKA and gap  junction expression will
              increase the knowledge of how gap  junctions function in endocrine cell
              response.  ***
