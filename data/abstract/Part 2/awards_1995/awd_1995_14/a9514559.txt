Abstract    :
              9514559  Thompson    Insects exemplify the diversity of animal behavior in the 
              world  around us.  Some insects are large enough that we can  discover how  the
              individual cells in their nervous systems act to  orchestrate  their behavior. 
              In this project, the central nervous  systems of  large male and female
              grasshoppers will be compared to  understqand  how females but not males manage
              to produce a female-only  sexual  behavior, oviposition.  Preliminary work has
              shown that  males have  most of the same nerve cells that the female uses in
              her  oviposition  behavior.  However, for one class of cells the male has many 
              fewer.  In this study the structure and function of the "oviposition-  like" 
              cells of the male will be investigated, and the cells for  which the  male is
              deficient will also be compasred.  The significance  of this  work lies in its
              contribution to the development of a model  system  where we can investigate
              adaptations of the nervous sustem  that  support specialization of behavior.
