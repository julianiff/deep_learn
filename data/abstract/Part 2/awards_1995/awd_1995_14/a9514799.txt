Abstract    :
              9514799  Mickley    Infants and, to a lesser extent, fetuses are now widley
              recognized as having a diverse behavioral repertoire and intellectual abilities
              to perceive and interact with their environment.  The proposed studies are
              aimed at determining how the fetal/neonatal brain develops appropriate
              interconnections and how memories and motor behaviors are formed during the
              perinatal period.  Futher, these experiments will also reveal how changes in
              brain neurochemistry modulate fetal and neonatal capacitites to learn and
              remember.
