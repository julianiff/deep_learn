Abstract    :
              The first aim of this conference is to appraise and to suggest  improvements in
              existing international and inter-area comparisons  of income, output, and
              prices.  The second is to present and  discuss new measures for China and the
              countries of the former  Soviet Union that are now being added to the ongoing
              comparison  and new inter-area measurements for the United States and other 
              countries.  The third purpose is to present a variety of  applications of the
              data to economic issues beyond the  measurements themselves.  Papers will be
              presented from producers  of the international and inter-area comparisons, from
              users of  the data, and from those interested in the theoretical  foundations
              of the measurement methods.  The papers will be  presented at a meeting of the
              Conference on Research in Income  and Wealth of the National Bureau of Economic
              Research.  The  meeting will be held March 15-19, 1996 in Washington, DC. and
              the  conference papers will be published as part of the series,  Studies in
              Income and Wealth.
