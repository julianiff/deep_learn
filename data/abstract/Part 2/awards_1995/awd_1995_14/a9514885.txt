Abstract    :
              9514885  Tabakin       The new continuous electron beam facility (CEBAF) 
              generates an electron beam that is not only energetic (4  GeV), but provides a
              large, steady current.  With that beam,  plus state-of-the art detectors,
              experimentalists will  perform precision, innovative experiments to determine
              what  happens when high-energy electromagnetic radiation (provided  by the
              electrons) strikes a proton.  Protons and electrons,  which are prime building
              blocks of matter, have spin.  At  CEBAF, it will be possible to orient and
              measure their  spins.  Our goal will be to predict, using quark-models of  the
              proton structure, the angular distribution of the mesons  that are produced in
              such experiments.  Mesons are the  particles that generate the strong
              interactions that  provide the nuclear or strong force, also called hadron 
              dynamics.  Some mesons are spinless, some have a spin of  one, in some cases
              spin 2.  We will predict, not only the  likelihood of the production at various
              angels (their cross-  sections), but also how their production is influenced by
               the initial electron and proton spin orientations and what  final proton and
              meson spin orientations are predicted by  the best available electromagnetic
              and strong interaction  theories.  Thus, we will be testing the validity of
              present  formulations of hadron dynamics.  ***
