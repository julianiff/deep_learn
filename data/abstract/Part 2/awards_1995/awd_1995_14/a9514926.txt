Abstract    :
              9514926  Wilson  This grant provides renewed funding for three years for the
              travel expenses of participants in the annual Summer Workshops on Economic
              Theory conducted by the Stanford Institute of Theoretical Economics (SITE). 
              Each summer, these six-week workshops bring prominent researchers and younger
              scholars together for a series of seminar presentations and sustained
              collaborative research.  Now in its 26th year, this series of workshops is the
              principal forum worldwide for innovative studies of important topics on the
              forefront of economic analysis.      The topics selected for each workshop
              depend on the current research areas and the anticipated availability of
              outstanding researchers with important papers to present.  Each autumn, the
              SITE faculty convene in open meetings to develop possible topics.  The Director
              oversees preparation of surveys of the possibilities, followed by a meeting of
              the SITE Executive Committee to make selections.  The topics selected for the
              1996 Summer Workshop are:   (1) Effects of heterogeneity on aggregate economic
              fluctuations; (2)  Reconsideration of the Foundations of Uncertainty in
              Economic Equilibrium; (3) Economics of Transition to Market Economies; (4)
              Financial Contracting and Corporate Control; (5) Endogenous Credit
              Restrictions; (6) Market Design; (7) Decision Theory for Non-Cooperative Games;
              and  (8) Empirical Estimation and Testing of Theoretical Models.
