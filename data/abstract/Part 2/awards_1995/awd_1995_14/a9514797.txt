Abstract    :
              9514797  Hall       This proposal deals with a wide range of problems in high 
              energy theoretical physics, but there are several themes.       One avenue is
              to explore new formulations of the basic tools  of quantum field theory with
              which one describes the interactions  of elementary particles.  Possible
              generalizations are proposed  and some new facets of string theory are
              considered as well.  String theory is an attempt to arrive at a unified
              description of  all interactions including gravity.  There are formidable 
              mathematical obstacles in obtaining such a formulation:  some of  these are
              addressed in the proposal.       A second avenue is to attempt a more
              phenomenological  description of the interactions of elementary particles, in 
              particular incorporating supersymmetry, the proposed but as of  yet unobserved
              symmetry between bosons and fermions.  Several  models are discussed and their
              predictions for high energy  experiments are detailed.       The links between
              phenomenological models and underlying  string theories are another subject of
              this proposal as are the  predictions of models for phenomena in the early
              universe and for  cosmology.  ***
