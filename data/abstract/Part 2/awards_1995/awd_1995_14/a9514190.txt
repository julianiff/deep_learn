Abstract    :
                9514190  Kisslinger    We propose to initiate new collaborations between
              nuclear  theorists at several Chinese institutions and those at  Carnegie
              Mellon University.  These new projects in medium  energy nuclear/particle
              physics are based in part on  fruitful collaborations during the past decade. 
              One of the  main efforts is the study of the quark structure of hadrons  and
              nuclei, which will give important insight into the  nature of Quantum
              Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of strong  interactions.  This research will
              also include research on  nucleon-nucleon and nucleon-hyperon interactions
              based on  quark/gluon interactions.  The methods of QCD sum rules will  be used
              to help develop models consistent with QCD theory.  Another effort will be the
              study of the modifications of  hadronic properties and interactions in nuclear
              matter. This  research will include studies of nucleon nucleon scattering  in
              heavy ion collisions as well as the modification of  hadronic masses ans
              coupling constants.  The method of QCD  sum rules will also be used here when
              applicable.    This collaboration is supported under the U.S.-China 
              Cooperative Research Program.
