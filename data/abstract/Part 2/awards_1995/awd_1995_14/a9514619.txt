Abstract    :
              9514619  Clark    Learning and synaptic plasticity -- the modification of 
              communication between nerve cells -- play a central role in  a wide variety of
              cognitive and neuronal processes.  Because  a single neuron can make synaptic
              contacts with thousands of  other neurons, a fundamental question is whether
              increases  in synaptic strength are necessarily expressed cell-wide at  all
              connections of a given neuron, or can instead be synapse-  specific and so
              occur at only selected connections of the  cell.  To investigate
              synapse-specific facilitation, this  research program utilizes a favorable
              simple model system,  and focuses on cells known to exhibit learning-related 
              increases in synaptic strength.  Studies will first  determine whether
              long-term (> 24 hr) as well-as short-term  increases in synaptic strength can
              be synapse-specific.  This is a critical issue, given that long-term
              facilitation  appears to depend on changes in gene expression.  The 
              neurotransmitter serotonin will be applied selectively onto  particular
              synapses in order to induce facilitation, and  intracellular
              electrophysiological recordings will be used  to test whether synaptic
              facilitation is greater at treated  synapses compared with other synapses of
              the same cell.  Second, studies will investigate underlying cellular 
              mechanisms.    These studies will provide new insights into the conceptual  and
              mechanistic relationships between short-term and long-  term memory, and
              illuminate key cellular and molecular steps  underlying learning-related
              neuronal change.
