Abstract    :
              9514531  Chiba    Finding the molecules that mediate cell-to-cell recognition
              among the brain cells (neurons) is a major challenge in developmental
              neurobiology.  Direct experimentation on these important molecules is possible
              in a powerful model animal, Drosophila (fruit fly).  This research will take a
              full advantage of the relative simplicity of the Drosophila brain, as well as
              the latest genetic and cell biological manipulation technologies available in
              the system.  The goal of the research is to examine the basic molecular
              mechanisms of specific cell-to-cell recognition events that precedes formation
              of a synapse, a neuronal connection site.  One model "synaptic recognition
              molecule", Toll, will be used to assess how this and other similar molecules
              may regulate synapse formation and its specificity.  The results are hoped to
              provide insights to how relatively simple molecular mechanisms may underscore
              construction of complex neuronal networks in the brain.
