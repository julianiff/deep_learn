Abstract    :
              Peter Schmidt  Michigan State University  SBR-9514750    The proposed research
              will cover three topics in econometric  theory.  The first part will deal with
              instances in which the  effects of economic shocks die off completely, but very
              slowly.   Research will be undertaken to determine which shocks are best 
              characterized by this phenomena and how to estimate variables  related to these
              shocks.  The second part will develop estimation  methods for panel data. 
              Panel data involve repeated observations  over time at the individual or firm
              level; they allow statistical  control for certain types of unobservables and
              the identification  of dynamic relationships.  The third part will continue
              work on  the estimation of production frontiers and the efficiency of  economic
              units.  The research will develop measures of the  statistical precision of
              efficiency estimates and will extend  knowledge of complications arising in
              efficiency measurement,   The research undertaken will be useful to other
              economists who  use econometric models in their research.
