Abstract    :
              9514950  Reucroft       This grant provides support for research in elementary 
              particle physics by 5 Northeastern University faculty, 3  postdoctoral
              associates and 4 graduate students.  They  engage in 3 activities: 1) study of
              collisions of  antiprotons with protons at 2 TeV in the Tevatron collider  at
              Fermilab, with the DO collaboration, and participation in  the current DO
              detector upgrade; 2) study of electron-  positron collisions at the LEP
              collider at CERN in Geneva,  Switzerland, with the L3 collaboration, and 3) 
              instrumentation R&D directed toward design of the CMS  detector to be operated
              in the next decade at the LHC  collider at CERN.  ***
