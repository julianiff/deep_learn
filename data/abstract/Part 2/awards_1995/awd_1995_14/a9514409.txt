Abstract    :
                   Electroreception is a special sensory ability of some animals to detect
              extremely small electrical fields in the natural environment.  It was
              discovered in aquatic vertebrates less than 40 years ago, and this special
              sense has since been discovered in mammals.  However, it has never been found
              in any invertebrate.  This project uses physiological and behavioral techniques
              to design tests for the presence of electrosensory capabilities in crustaceans.
               The SGER is an appropriate mechanism for this unique opportunity because the
              experiments are brief and straightforward, and while the risk is conceptual
              that the PI's might not find electroreception, the potential impact of the
              discovery is very high.   Such a discovery would have immediate importance not
              only in opening an entirely new field for sensory science, but also in offering
              new concepts and approaches for neuroscience in general, for evolutionary
              biology and potentially for bioengineering.
