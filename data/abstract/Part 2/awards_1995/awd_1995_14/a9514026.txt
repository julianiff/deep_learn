Abstract    :
              Abstract  9514026  Cohen      The single-cell sporangiophore of the lower fungus
              Phycomyces blakesleeanus is very sensitive to blue light, by bending toward the
              light and growing with exposure to light, and showing a negative growth
              response to a decrease in light. Phycomyces has great potential for comparing
              signal processing in lower organisms to those in higher organisms.  This
              investigator has found evidence for the presence of G proteins in the
              sporangiophore, and G proteins are essential for phototransduction and many
              types of signal transduction in higher organisms.  In this proposal the
              investigator will  seek to establish the role of G proteins in blue light
              transduction in Phycomyces.  Immunoblotting with antibodies to G( subunits and
              covalent FAD (which is involved in the photoreceptor system of this fungus),
              will be used in a number of behavioral mutant strains.  A cDNA library will be
              used for cloning of G( subunits and these will be compared to these proteins in
              other systems, and mRNAs from the mutants will be examined by Northern
              blotting.  These studies will provide important information on how the blue
              light detection system works at the molecular level and will indicate common
              elements that exists between signal transduction systems of the lower
              eukaryotic organisms and vertebrates.        ***
