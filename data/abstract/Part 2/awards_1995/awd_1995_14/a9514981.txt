Abstract    :
              9514981  Jones    This grant renews support for the Northwestern Summer Workshop
               Series.  It supports conferences at Northwestern University  during the
              summers of 1996, 1997, and 1998.  Each consists of two  week-long workshops,
              one concentrating on theoretical issues in  macroeconomics and the other on
              microeconomics.  The topics for  the three years will vary.  Areas that look
              promising for the  1996 macroeconomics workshop include: fertility and
              population  growth, institutions for dealing with income and employment risk, 
              and theoretical and computational methods for studying models  with
              heterogeneous agents.  Areas that look promising for the  1996 microeconomics
              workshop are: interactive learning in  economics and game theory, rational
              learning in repeated and  recurring environments, evolutionary learning by
              boundedly  rational agents, and the applications of learning models to 
              industries, auctions, etc.  The topics for the second and third  years of the
              macroeconomics workshop and the second year of the  microeconomics workshop
              will be decided at a later date.  On the  macro side, areas likely to be
              included are: acquired comparative  advantage and the dynamics of international
              trade, the long-run  distribution of income and wealth, technological change
              and  diffusion, monetary and fiscal policy in growing economies, human  capital
              accumulation and labor market dynamics, and the  computation of equilibria for
              dynamic models.  On the micro side,  areas that look promising are: the role of
              information in  auctions and asset pricing, contracts and the internal 
              organization of firms, and the empirical implications of  industrial
              organization models.  The political economy workshop  is planned for 1998. 
              Topics include formal political theory and  the formation of political
              institutions.
