Abstract    :
              Ball  9514525    Numerous animals integrate various cues from the environment to
               predict the arrival of improving conditions associated with spring.   Arguably
              the most critical cue is changing daylength, which is  responsible for
              enhancing numerous behaviors including  communicative behaviors.  Increasing
              daylength also fosters marked  chemical changes in the brain associated with
              the behavioral  changes. In these receptive animals, secondary features may 
              potentiate the positive aspects of increasing daylength.  However,  increasing
              daylength after a period of time precipitates the  development of
              refractoriness which terminates behavioral  enhancement and brain neurochemical
              changes. Dr. Gregory Ball is  assessing the interplay between daylength and
              secondary  characteristics in fostering seasonal behavioral changes.  The 
              studies include an identification of the neuronal circuitry  responsible for
              mediation of the behavioral changes in the animals,  as well as a demonstration
              of the specific secondary cues to which  the animals respond.  Studies to this
              point have not identified  specific features of the environment other than
              daylength as  enhancors of behavioral activity.  These studies will be useful
              to  understanding the survival of species in their nature habitats and  the
              environmental cues to which they are most responsive.
