Abstract    :
              9514202  Wolf    This U.S.-Argentina collaborative research project will 
              continue the development of a framework for the formal  specification and
              analysis of the behavioral properties of  software architectures. Together with
              Daniel Yankelevich of  the Universidad de Buenos Aires in Argentina, the PI at
              the  University of Colorado Boulder will extend his work on a  formal
              specification method based on the Chemical Abstract  Machine (CHAM) model. 
              CHAM provides operational semantics  which may be more easily understood by a
              wide audience than  competing mathematical formalisms.    The collaboration
              established in this project connects the  PI with an existing effort between
              Argentina and Italy on  specification and verification of concurrent systems. 
              It  also combines the systems orientation of the U.S. group with  the
              theoretical orientation of the Argentines to understand  the potential of the
              CHAM model for software architecture.  ***
