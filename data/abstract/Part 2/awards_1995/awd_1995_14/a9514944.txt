Abstract    :
              A program of laboratory experiments in gravitation is to be  continued and
              expanded.  Emphasis will be on instrumentation  for tests of Einstein's weak
              equivalence principle (EP), and  a high accuracy measurement of the
              gravitational constant G.    The instrument best suited for this research is
              the classic  torsion balance.  In modern form this instrument is  remarkable in
              its capability to measure slowly varying  extremely small forces, but it is now
              approaching the limits  of its abilities when operated at room temperature.  An
               important thrust of this research program will be the  development and
              application of a new generation of torsion  balance instruments which operate
              at cryogenic temperatures  with greatly increased sensitivity due to lower
              thermal  noise and greater mechanical stability.
