Abstract    :
                   In human vision, it is not clear how the visual system maintains the sense
              of   relative brightness under widely varying conditions of lighting.  This
              work   exploits an approach using "induction", where a neighboring field
              affects the   perceptual quality of a target field; for example, a gray area
              next to a dark   background looks bright, while the same gray area against a
              light background   looks dark.  This illusion works whether the overall
              illumination is at high or low   levels.  A novel technique based on this
              property is used here, where the target   is a band and on each side of the
              band there are both dark and light bars   forming a grating, which induce an
              illusory grating of varying brightness to   appear within the band itself,
              which really has a single constant brightness.    Standard matching techniques
              are used to measure how of dependent the   effects are on mechanisms for
              contrast, and on global (wide-field) vs. local   (narrow field) spatial
              brightness mechanisms.     Results from this work will help unravel a
              fundamental problem in vision, and   will have an impact beyond visual
              neuroscience to perceptual physiology in   general, and could be important in
              the design of visual displays for many   applications.
