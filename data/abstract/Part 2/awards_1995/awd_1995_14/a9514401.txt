Abstract    :
              9514401                           FRAJZYNGIER                                   
              The aim of the project is to complete reference grammars of  several
              undescribed Chadic languages spoken in the Extreme North  province of Cameroon
              and in Chad, some of which are endangered  with extinction. The specific goals
              of the project are: (1) A  grammar and dictionary of Mina; (2) A grammar and
              dictionary of  Gidar; (3) A syntax of Lele; and (4) A syntax of East Dangla.
              The  study is also theoretical in that it will address the  interrelationships
              between word order, coding on the verb, object  incorporation, and coding
              through adpositions, all of which are  deployed by languages under study.  A
              native speaker of East  Dangla, a person with some linguistic training, will be
              brought  from Chad to participate in the project.      The Chadic branch is the
              largest family within the Afroasiatic  phylum, which includes such well studied
              languages as Egyptian  and Semitic. Chadic languages are spoken in Nigeria,
              Northern  Cameroon, Chad, and Niger. Many of these languages are also 
              endangered. They are spoken by a small number of people in a  region undergoing
              rapid urbanization with Hausa, Arabic, and Fula  as vehicular languages of the
              area. The languages chosen for  description belong to Central and Eastern
              branches of Chadic.  They differ in very important respects in their syntax, 
              morphology, and phonology. The proposed descriptions will fill  important gaps
              in our knowledge of the Chadic language family.
