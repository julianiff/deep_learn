Abstract    :
              John F. Geweke  University of Minnesota - Twin Cities  SBR-9514865    This
              research will be in the area of Bayesian econometrics, which  uses priors to
              improve model results.  The research has three  parts.   The first part will
              attempt to make Bayesian methods  computationally less difficult.  The second
              part will investigate  the possibility that Bayesian results can be made
              publically  available and reused by other researchers through reweighting.  
              The third part will explore ways of relaxing distributional  assumptions. 
              Bayesian estimation is sufficiently difficult such  that most economists
              currently do not use it.  The main thrust of  this research is to overcome the
              problems so that more economists  use Bayesian results and methods.
