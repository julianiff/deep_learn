Abstract    :
              9514846  Lin    International corporation is proposed on a research project 
              aimed at developing a novel ceramic membrane reactor for  efficient conversion
              of methane to ethylene.  The membrane  reactor uses a proton-conducting ceramic
              membrane with a  surface which is catalytically active for methane coupling. 
              The research project consists of membrane synthesis by  various methods,
              membrane characterization, and hydrogen  permeation/methane conversion reaction
              on the membrane  reactor.  The project is of multi-disciplinary nature, 
              involving solid state ionics, chemical vapor deposition,  catalysis and
              reaction engineering.  Collaborative research  is proposed with a Chinese
              laboratory which has demonstrated  a long term research experience in solid
              state ionics and  chemical vapor deposition.  Collaborative research 
              activities include (1) Metal-organic chemical vapor  deposition synthesis and
              electrochemical characterization of  the ceramic membranes at the Chinese
              laboratory and (2)  Electrical conductivity measurements of thin ceramic 
              membranes and hydrogen permeation/methane conversion  reaction on membrane
              reactors in the PI's laboratory.  The  collaboration will result in fast
              development of the novel  ceramic membrane reactor for effective conversion of
              methane  in an environmentally benign manner.  Experience gained  through the
              collaboration will help establish facilities for  electrochemical
              characterization of high temperature  ceramics and metal-organic chemical vapor
              deposition of thin  ceramic films in the PI's laboratory.
