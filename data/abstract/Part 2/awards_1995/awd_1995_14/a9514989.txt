Abstract    :
              Gilbert Metcalf  National Bureau of Economic Research  SBR-9514989    This
              research will investigate the returns to households of  making energy
              conservation investments.  It will use a large data  set on residential energy
              consumption, which includes information  on income and family characteristics
              as well as detailed  characteristics of the home.  The research will consider
              the  impact of the rebound effect, where consumers may increase their  use of
              energy when energy conservation reduce the costs of  overall energy use.  The
              effect of weather conditions on energy  consumption will be taken into account.
               The analysis produced by  this research will be useful to other researchers
              and policy-  makers as well.
