Abstract    :
              9514258  Coon  The area of biological oxidations, which is of major  importance
              to modern biochemistry, molecular biology, and  biophysics, continues to be one
              of vigorous investigation.  This special symposium is being held in honor of
              Dr.Vincent  Massey, a leader in the field of biological oxidations, on  his
              70th birthday.  The symposium will focus on enzyme-  catalyzed oxidations and
              flavins and flavoproteins.  The  speakers will include 10 from the United
              States and 6 from  foreign countries.  All have made significant research 
              contributions in the field of biological oxidation's and  many are Dr. Maser's
              former students and collaborators.  Topics that will be discussed include: 
              oxygenases,  hydroxylases, oxidases, and dehydrogenases in addition to  broader
              topics such as protein flexibility and biological  development of the oxidative
              proteins.  %%%  Biological oxidation includes virtually all of the  biochemical
              processes by which energy is derived from foods.  A large range of enzymes
              accomplish the various reactions  that are involved.  This meeting will bring
              together  investigators who are working on the broad range of enzymes  and
              related topics that are linked by a common theme, i.e.,  biological oxidation. 
              It is expected that information  exchange among these investigators will lead
              to new insight  into this field.  ***
