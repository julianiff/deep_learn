Abstract    :
              The project is the editing and publication of a dictionary of the  ritual
              languages of the Iban of Borneo. The dictionary will contain  approximately
              20,000 entries. No dictionary for any of the ritual  languages of Borneo
              currently exists.     The Iban are the politically dominant and most numerous
              indigenous  society on Borneo, the third largest island in the world. Iban are 
              found in all parts of the island, and in many other countries in  Southeast
              Asia. Iban speakers number approximately 1,100,000, and  Iban is the second
              language to another 500,000 people.    The dictionary will provide a permanent
              record of the survivals,  archaisms, and other esoteric terms that receive
              little attention  in most dictionaries. The dictionary will make available to 
              linguists, anthropologists, and other social scientists the  extensive lexicons
              and imagery of Iban bards and shaman, as well  as the oral traditions of the
              Iban. The lexicon of ritual terms  will be valuable to historical linguists for
              the study of  relationships between vernacular and ritual languages of 
              Austronesian-speaking communities. It will provide data essential  to the
              analysis of the evolution of such specialized  vocabularies. In light of rapid
              social and cultural changes, it  seems likely that unless the dictionary is
              produced before the  end of this decade, its production will be impossible.
