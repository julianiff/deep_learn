Abstract    :
              9514517  Burnside      The 6th International Symposium on Avian Endocrinology
              will be held at the Chateau Lake Louise in the heart of the Canadian Rocky
              Mountains from March 31 until April 5, 1996. The meeting will bring together
              scientists with expertise in various aspects of avian endocrinology ranging
              from molecular biology to field ecology. The meeting will include sessions
              devoted to osmoregulation, reproduction, neuroendocrinology, growth, embryonic
              development, calcium metabolism, behavior, regulation of cellular function,
              sexual differentiation, intermediary metabolism, circadian rhythms and
              conservation. The meeting will attract approximately 400 scientists from more
              than 20 countries in the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia.
              Attendance by students from developing countries will be sponsored to
              facilitate development of communication between established laboratories and
              newly formed research groups. The proceedings of the meeting will be published
              by the Journal of Endocrinology and will serve as the most recent comprehensive
              account of advances in avian endocrinology. The meeting will provide a unique
              opportunity for scientists whose work involves birds to exchange ideas and
              develop the international network of specialists in the field.   ***
