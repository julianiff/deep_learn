Abstract    :
                 This project is for Collaborative Research at Undergraduate Institutions,
              involving zoology, microbiology, physics, and chemistry.  There are strains of
              bacteria found in wild birds that produce an enzyme called keratinase, which
              degrades feathers.  This project investigates the microbial ecology of the
              bacteria, including the interactions with other microbes that occur on the
              feathers, determines quantitative rates of feather degradation, and compares
              the molecular structures and specificity of keratinases from different
              bacterial strains.  The project also explores potential agricultural,
              environmental, and industrial applications for the enzyme.  Keratin is a tough
              structural protein found in feathers and hair.  A keratin-digesting enzyme
              could be used not only to help dispose of the feather waste from the poultry
              industry, but could be used to increase production of commercial animal food
              from feather meal.  The keratinase from bird bacteria selectively degrades
              feathers, but leaves hair and wool intact, making it an attractive model for an
              enzymatic cleaner that could clean but not damage woolen products.  This work
              has a potential impact on a range of fields including ecology, microbiology,
              zoology, and chemistry, and promises a novel cross-disciplinary experience
              involving undergraduates in interesting research with both basic and applied
              aspects.
