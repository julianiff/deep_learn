Abstract    :
              9510306  Kojima  Experiments  are  proposed  to  explore  the  properties  of 
              the  magnetic  superfluid  A-1  phase of  liquid  He-3  at  ultra  low 
              temperatures  and in high magnetic fields. The temperature  width  of   the 
              A-1  phase will be measured by developing  an  acoustic  thermometer.  The 
              superfluid fraction  will  be  measured  using  spin/entropy  wave  propagation
              techniques. The  spin  relaxation  will  be  measured by a novel mechanical
              device  to  detect  spin  density.  All of these measurements are proposed to 
              be  extended  from our previous maximum field of 5 tesla up to 15 tesla.  %%% 
              Liquid  Helium-3 will be subjected to temperatures down to  0.001  degrees 
              Kelvin and to magnetic fields as high as 150,000  gauss.  Under  these
              conditions, liquid Helium-3 transforms into a unique  magnetic  superfluid 
              state. The focus of  research  will  be  to  measure  the  effects  of  the 
              magnetic  polarization   on   the  superfluid   state  at  ultra  low 
              temperatures.  Thermodynamic,  hydrodynamic  and magnetic properties will be
              investigated  using  acoustic  and  mechanical  devices in the  proposed 
              experiments.  Better understanding of the superfluid state might be applied  to
               studies of more familiar superconducting states of metals.  ***
