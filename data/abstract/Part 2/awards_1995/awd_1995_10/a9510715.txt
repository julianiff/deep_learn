Abstract    :
              This project will attempt to develop more advanced designs for artifical neural
              networks which can learn from experience how to predict of filter  streams of
              inputs over time.  The work will build upon novel designs developed under a
              previous NSF grant, which are being tested in applications such as blind
              deconvolution and interference cancelling in nonstationary  communication
              channels (e.g., making cellular phones work better),  identification and
              control of nonlinear plants, prediction of financial time-series and
              classification of time varying patterns such as speech recognition and
              transient signal processing (radar, sonar, biological).  The basic approach
              will be to deepen the theoretical understanding of the limitations of the
              existing designs in these applications, and to develop new general-purpose
              designs--rooted in an exploration of basic theory--to overcome these
              limitations.  Among the theoretical issues given priority are the problem of
              mixing discrete and continuous variables in the context, the problem of 
              time-warping  (e.g. different speakers speaking at different  speeds), and the
              problems of robustness over time.
