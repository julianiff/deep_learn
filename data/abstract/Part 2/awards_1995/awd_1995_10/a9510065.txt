Abstract    :
              9510065  Fredlund  This research will provide a baseline technique to test the
              hypothesis that the Great Plains grassland is currently, and has been
              throughout most of the Holocene, in dynamic equilibrium with long-term climate
              fluctuations on the regional scale. Under this hypothesis, the dominant grasses
              of the region should have been able to rapidly adjust to climatic change during
              the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. This project will begin to test that
              hypothesis through the analysis of the late Pleistocene and early Holocene
              fossil record from the region. The first stage of this process is to calibrate
              and validate the tools that will be used to measure grassland response in the
              fossil record: phytolith and stable carbon isotope analysis. Current
              interpretations of these methods are based on theoretically sound but imperfect
              relationships with grass taxonomy and community composition. This study will
              analyze soil samples from an array of over 50 modern prairie sites from across
              the region. Grass phytolith assemblages, (13C of soil organic matter, and (13C
              or organic carbon occluded within opal phytoliths will be analyzed for each
              sample. If the technique can be calibrated in this fashion, a direct
              relationship can be determined between (13C in fossil phytoliths and the
              general C3/C4 ratio of community composition. This, in turn, can be related
              directly to climate.   This project will provide an important assessment of the
              ability of (13C analysis of phytoliths to address vegetation-climate
              relationships over the Holocene in grasslands. Although much is known about
              forest dynamics during the Pleistocene and Holocene, there is very little
              detailed information on the regional dynamics of the Great Plains in response
              to climate change.
