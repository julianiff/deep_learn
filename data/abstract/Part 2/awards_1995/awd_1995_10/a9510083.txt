Abstract    :
              9510083  Roberts    The middle Pliocene to early Pleistocene was a period of
              major global climate change.  Few long and continuous of records of non-marine
              climate changes have been reported from this period in the continental United
              States, and those that exist are from the far west of the Great Basin where
              marine climate processes would be expected to significantly affect the records.
               New data have been obtained by the Principal Investigators from two recently
              drilled lacustrine sediment cores in the eastern Great Basin.  Preliminary data
              suggest that these cores represent important geological records of paleoclimate
              (from 0.75 Ma to about 3.1 Ma) which will provide much-needed data to determine
              the relationship, and degree of coupling, between marine and continental
              climate processes.  The goals of this study are to acquire environmental
              magnetic, lithostratigraphic, and sedimentologic data from these two cores in
              order to decipher the history of paleoclimate variations in this part of the
              Great Basin.  Detailed documentation of the timing, temporal variation, and
              magnitude of Pliocene and Pleistocene climatic events will provide
              fundamentally important data concerning continental climate change.  It is
              proposed to compare the data with other, less detailed, records from the Great
              Basin as well as marine paleoclimate records.  This will help to constrain
              models of land-ocean interaction and models of global environmental change. 
              The project is multidisciplinary and multi-institutional and will be carried
              out in close collaboration with colleagues from the U.S. Geological Survey and
              the University of Utah.
