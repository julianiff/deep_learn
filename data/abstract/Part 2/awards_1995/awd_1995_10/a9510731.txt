Abstract    :
              9510731  Thompson  This  project  will  investigate the  effect  of 
              fission-induced  columnar  defects  on  vortex pinning in  a  variety  of 
              high-Tc  materials,  such as practical Pb-doped Bi-2223/Ag composite  wire  or 
              tapes,  Hg-based cuprate epitaxial films and bulk  materials,  and  Bi-2212 
              single crystals. The goal is to  develop  practical  ways  to  enhance  the 
              critical current density,  Jc,  in  these  materials  via deliberate
              introduction of extended  defects  with  GeV range light particle irradiation,
              with potential for scale-up  to  large  prefabricated structures. The project 
              incorporates  a  focused  joint  effort of groups at the University of 
              Tennessee,  Knoxville,  and  at  IBM  T.  J.  Watson  Research  Center,  with 
              demonstrated  expertise  in  studies of  superconductors  and  in  various
              magnetic and transport methods. The project also draws on  the  expertise and
              irradiation facilities at Los Alamos  National  Laboratory and on fabrication
              of wires and tapes at the  American  Superconductor Corporation.  %%% 
              Large-scale applications of high temperature superconductors  are  not  yet 
              possible due to difficulties in manufacturing wires  or  tapes  capable of
              carrying large currents, that is, having  large  critical  current  densities,
              Jc, sustainable  in  high  magnetic  fields.  The  problems  are  related  to 
              dissipative  motion  of  current  "vortices" which are intrinsic to the high-Tc
               materials  in   the  presence  of  magnetic  fields.  This  project  employs 
              radiation induced damage centers, or columnar defects, which  act  to  "pin" 
              the  vortices so they are unable to move,  and,  as  a  result,  greatly
              enhance the current carrying properties  of  the  materials.  The  project
              incorporates a focused joint  effort  of  groups  at the University of
              Tennessee, Knoxville, and at IBM  T.  J. Watson Research Center, with
              demonstrated expertise in studies  of superconductors and in various magnetic
              and transport methods.  The   project   also  draws  on  t he  expertise  and 
              irradiation  facilities  at Los Alamos National Laboratory and on  fabrication 
              of wires and tapes at the American Superconductor Corporation.  ***
