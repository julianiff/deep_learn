Abstract    :
               This proposal for a Research Planning Grant is intended to carry out research
              on how time is defined and used.  Results will be used to plan a follow-up
              study about perceptions of fairness in work allocations and how these may
              affect life course transitions.  It adds to theories about family stability and
              to generalizations about the demography of the life course by its focus on the
              importance of the time it takes to fulfill work and family obligations. 
              Existing data sources at both the national and state level are analyzed to
              expand definitions of time use and the scope of how time use may affect
              important life course events.  Focus group interviews with both men and women
              will be conducted to explore the meanings that subjects attribute to how they
              use time, particularly with respect to fairness in the allocation of household
              responsibilities by gender.  The results of the quantitative analysis and the
              focus group interviews will form the basis for the design of a new study,
              directly concerned with how beliefs about gender roles are associated with
              conflict between household partners and how beliefs affect transitions to
              marriage, cohabitation, or divorce.     The prevalence of households where two
              adults work outside the home, along with the customary demands in running a
              household, are important for the formation of the family's social capital. 
              Although the division of labor within the household begins with tasks, this
              research promises new insights into how the family functions by focusing on how
              much time those tasks take.  With time the critical variable, the investigator
              will be able to move to a consideration of beliefs about fairness in the
              allocation of tasks, and their relation to interfamilial conflict and familial
              stability.
