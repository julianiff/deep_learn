Abstract    :
              This project, supported under the Optical Science and Engineering  initiative in
              the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,  involves the continued
              development and application of time resolved  photocalorimetric and Raman
              spectroscopic methods for the  characterization of the kinetics, energetics,
              and molecular  structure of short-lived photochemical species within microscale
               domains. A variety of novel methods will be pursued which will  detect very
              fast reactions occurring within micron to nanometer  dimensions, such as may be
              evident in monolayer, thin film, and  colloidal systems. Pulsed-laser Raman
              spectroscopy will be used to  probe free-radical chain initiation reactions;
              optically launched  surface acoustic waves (SAW) will allow the detection of 
              polymerization reaction kinetics within the monolayer region of  thin films; a
              new `photon burst` spectroscopic method which  involves the laser excitation of
              fluorescent-labeled particles and  the laser-induced rupture of analyte
              encapsulated liposomes will  allow the determination of particle size
              distribution and reaction  chemistry within colloidal media. These techniques
              are `cutting-  edge` and will offer technology not currently available for
              probing  these environments.  Next generation advances in the information,
              manufacturing, and  medical technologies will require the ability to engineer
              and/or  probe microscopic areas at nanosecond timescales. Professor Harris  and
              his students at the University of Utah will pursue several  cutting-edge laser
              spectroscopic techniques that will allow the  characterization of processes
              occurring within single cells, at  `stress-fracture` interfaces in materials
              and/or inside other  miniaturized structures.
