Abstract    :
              9510390  Williams    The  13th  International Conference on Defects in
              Insulating  Materials  will  be  held July 15-16, 1996  at  Wake  Forest 
              University.  The Conference will focus on wide-gap materials  and  their 
              defects in bulk and interface regions.   A  wide  range  of  scientific  and 
              technological  topics  will   be  covered.   The scientific sessions will
              feature  theoretical  (computational)  methods  and  experimental  techniques 
              for  understanding   defect   physics.    Ferroelectric    memory  materials,
              gate insulators, blue diode laser materials,  and  fiber  optics are some of
              the technological problems  to  be  discussed.    %%%    The  13th
