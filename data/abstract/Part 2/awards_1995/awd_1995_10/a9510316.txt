Abstract    :
              9510316  Fano       The spatia character of the wavefunctions of simple three- 
              body systems such as He and H2 are studied using the R-matrix,  hyperspherical
              expansion technique.  This enables a systematic  study of how these systems
              evolve from small to large hyperadii  and the mechanism responsible for
              ionization and dissociation of  the molecular complex.  ***
