Abstract    :
              9510272  Brown    The primary goals of this project are to establish the 
              generic principles which allow organic-inorganic composites  having controlled
              microstructures to be designed and to  establish mechanistic paths governing
              self-assembly of  composites formed by reaction in aqueous solutions.  Three 
              technical objectives will be pursued:  (1) to concentrate  on establishing the
              relationships between the chemistry of  the inorganic matrix phase, the
              kinetics of its formation,  and the attendant microstructural development; (2)
              to  explore the use of polymers having specific polymer  conformations and
              functional groups and thereby to  investigate the interaction between these
              polymers and the  matrix phases; and (3) establish effects of the polymeric 
              structures and the hydrolysis of the matrix phase  precursors on the formation
              of polymer crosslinks.  The  investigation of adsorption phenomenon and
              interaction with  surfaces having spatially and compositional controlled 
              functional groups will also be explored.  %%%  This research project is
              important to the design and  development of chemical routes to form composites.
               It  emulates the attributes of biological composite materials  associated with
              their formation at net shape, low  temperature and pressure.  ***
