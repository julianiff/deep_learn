Abstract    :
              9510263  Asmerom  This project will enable Asmerom to test the concept  that
              isotopes in the Thorium-Uranium series, if they can be measured accurately in
              young volcanic rocks, will add a new dimension to our understanding of the
              relationship between the mantle and the continental crust, the origin of alkali
              and tholiitic basalts, depth of melting, and the time frame in which various
              things happen.  This award will provide for the PI and a graduate student to
              collect a few representative samples from three suitable volcanic fields, and
              then carry out the appropriate analyses at the University of Minnesota.
