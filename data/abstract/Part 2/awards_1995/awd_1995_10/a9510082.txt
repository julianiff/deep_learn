Abstract    :
              9510082 Roberts  This work is supported by a Research Planning  Grant for Women 
              Scientists and Engineers Award. Appropriate  Volterra equation  formulations
              for a variety of new problems  will be examined with  tools from applied,
              functional and  asymptotic analysis. This research  seeks, for example, 
              sufficient conditions for the onset of the  phenomena, lower and  upper limits
              for the critical time, the behavior  of the solution  in the key limit and the
              nature of the blow-up  (quenching,  absorption) set.   The National Science
              Foundations mandate to  ensure the vitality of  the Nations scientific
              enterprise  includes concern for the quality,  composition, distribution and 
              effectiveness of the human resource  base in science and  engineering.  Within
              this context, the Foundation  is committed  to enhancing the current rate of
              participation of women  in  science and engineering careers, in general, and as
              active   participants in all of its programs.  Research Planning Grant  awards 
              are made: (1) to help increase the number of new women   investigators
              participating in NSFs research programs; and, (2)  to  facilitate preliminary
              studies and other activities related  to the  development of competitive
              research projects and  proposals by  women who have not previously had
              independent  Federal research  funding.  Research Planning Grants are one-time 
              awards that may be  used for preliminary work to determine the  feasibility of
              a proposed  line of inquiry, and/or for other  activities that will facilitate
              proposal  development.
