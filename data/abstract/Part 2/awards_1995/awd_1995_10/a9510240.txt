Abstract    :
              9510240  Whiting    This grant provides partial support for the acquisition 
              gamma  detector for use in research to trace fine sediment moving  through
              watersheds. How fine sediment moves from the landscape to  the channel and to
              downstream points is both a fundamental  scientific question whose answer is
              necessary for modeling  landscape evolution and a practical question whose
              answer is  critical in land management decision-making.  The PI's  will  employ
              the detector to measure fallout radionuclides including,  7Be, l37Cs and 2l0Pb
              in order to follow fine sediment as it moves  through watersheds.  These
              radionuclides are washed from the  atmosphere by precipitation and quickly
              adsorbed onto sediment,  which permits their use as tracers of sediment.  The
              relative  activities of these radionuclides with different half-lives  should
              allow the distinction between "new" sediment washed off  the landscape during
              storm events and "old" sediment which has  been stored in the stream bed and
              bank and has been resuspended  by the increased flow associated with storm
              runoff.  The activity  of radionuclides in sediment relative to these two
              end-member  components can be used to establish the relative delivery of 
              landscape sediment to downstream points in the drainage network,  to estimate
              mean travel distances and transit rates of fine  sediment, and identify sources
              of sediment in the watershed.  This innovative research has great potential to
              improve our  understanding of fine sediment and pollutant transport in 
              watersheds and thus is directly applicable to a variety of  environmental
              problems.        ***
