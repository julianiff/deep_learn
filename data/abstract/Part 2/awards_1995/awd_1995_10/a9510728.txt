Abstract    :
              9510728  Cole       This award will provide requests infrastructure support  for
              an interdisciplinary team working on a broad array of  theoretical and applied
              problems in nonlinear optics. The  group consists of applied mathematicians,
              physicists, and  industrial scientists, and the problems being researched are 
              closely connected with applications such as laser  technology, fiber-optics
              communications, all-optical data  transmission systems, and composite nonlinear
              optical  materials. The infrastructure support  will provide for an  intensive
              series of seminars, mini courses, and workshops on  nonlinear optics, for
              graduate research assistants,  postdoctoral fellows, and long-term visitors.   
                  The proposed projects cover a wide range of problems,  such as dynamics and
              operation of gas lasers and fiber  lasers, nonlinear optics of pulses in
              standard and  erbium-doped fibers, dynamics of light in second-harmonia 
              generating media, optical properties of composite materials,  and light
              propagation in periodic media The tools to be used  in the formulation and
              analysis of these problems include  asymptotic expansions and perturbation
              theory, accurate  numerical computations, soliton and inverse-scattering 
              techniques, nonlinear analytical estimates, and dynamical  systems methods. The
              diverse expertise of its members will  enable the group to successfully
              complete the investigations  of the proposed projects, and shed light on
              nonlinear  optical problems from new angles that could only come from  such
              unique interdisciplinary connections.
