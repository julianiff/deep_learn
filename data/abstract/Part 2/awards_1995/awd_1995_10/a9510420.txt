Abstract    :
              9510420  Lenhoff  This proposal is on research to continue to develop a 
              quantitative thermodynamic basis for the analysis and design of  protein
              separations, comparable to that which is routinely  applied to conventional
              separations in the chemical process  industries.  This will involve research
              on: (1) molecular  theories to predict key thermodynamic properties of proteins
              in  solution, based on protein structure, when it is known, and on  key
              experimental biophysical characteristics, when the structure  is not known, and
              (2) use of the descriptions of phase behavior  and physical properties to
              develop rational, thermodynamically-  based approaches to predict separation
              performance for important  processes, including precipitation and two-phase
              aqueous  extraction.  ***
