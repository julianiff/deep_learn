Abstract    :
              SBR-9510318  Melissa Savage, Principal Investigator (PI)  University of
              California Los Angeles       Disturbance and Diversity in Complex Ecological
              Systems    The problem of diversity in ecological systems has been the subject
              of intense interest during the last 20 years, but a complete theoretical
              explanation still exists.  A number of hypotheses have successfully explained
              aspects of the origin and maintenance of biodiversity including, the niche
              diversification, compensatory mortality, equal chance, and intermediate
              disturbance hypotheses.  This Career Advancement Award research project
              explores the role of disturbance, in particular, intermediate levels of
              biodiversity, in maintaining diversity in dynamic landscapes within the context
              of work being done at the Santa Fe Institute.   Research at this Institute
              seeks a common theoretical framework for complex adaptive systems and aims to
              find shared features of such systems that explain their origin and functioning
              in a variety of fields, from cell biology and evolution to economics and
              language.  The objective of this study is to explore several similarities
              between properties found in these systems and those found in complex disturbed
              ecosystems.  The work involves a broad review of the literature and
              formalization of  several aspects of disturbed forest communities in order to
              test hypotheses about the role of disturbance in generating and maintaining
              diversity.  There are unresolved theoretical questions about the assemblage of
              species, as well as, the rules that govern diversity in natural communities. 
              General rules and insights that emerge from this study of complex systems may
              offer a fresh theoretical approach to the study of ecological diversity.
