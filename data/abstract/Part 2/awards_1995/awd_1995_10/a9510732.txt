Abstract    :
              9510732  Gilbert  The objective of this research is to obtain evidence for G4
              tetraplex DNA in vivo; more specifically, on meiotically paired chromosomes. 
              Biochemical and genetic evidence suggests that this novel form of DNA exists in
              vivo as a structural intermediate for several cellular processes including
              meiosis, telomere functioning, and G-rich sequence mediated recombination.  The
              yeast gene KEMI encodes a G4-DNA dependent nuclease.  A homozygous deletion of
              this gene blocks yeast cells at meiosis I, where homologous chromosomes are
              paired but fail to resolve, supporting the hypothesis that G4-DNA is involved
              in meiotic chromosome pairing.  Naked chromosomes will be isolated from
              meiotically blocked (kem1() yeast cells and their DNA will be visualized and
              examined by a light microscopy, and by CHEF gel electrophoresis and Southern
              blotting in comparison with chromosomes from wild type cells.  Chromosomes from
              keml( mutant cells blocked in meiosis I should exhibit higher-order structural
              changes including retarded mobility in CHEF gels, and tetrameric (4N) complexes
              of DNA from homologous chromosomes joined at multiple points.  This research
              will shed new light on meiotic chromosome pairing by demonstrating DNA-DNA
              interaction consistent with G4-DNA pairing in vivo,  and will establish the
              foundation to investigate other cellular processes in which this tetraplex DNA
              might be involved, such as telomere functioning and recombination.  %%%  The
