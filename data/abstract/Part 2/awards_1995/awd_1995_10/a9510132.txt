Abstract    :
                    9510132  Plummer    This research program is aimed at an investigation of
              the physical and  chemical properties of surfaces, interfaces, and thin films
              of  simple  metals,  with the objective of using these model systems to 
              elucidate  fundamental  concepts.   A wealth of fascinating   physical 
              phenomena  awaits  investigation, such as  pinned charge  density  waves  at 
              the  surface  of potassium, pre-martensitic surface transitions on lithium, 
              surface  reconstructions such as the missing row reconstruction  on  a 
              beryllium  surface,  oscillatory structural  transformations  in  thin  films, 
              and  collective  excitations in "designed"  multilayers.   The  impact  of
              these studies will be the development of new concepts  that  govern the
              behavior of a surface and an interface.  %%%  The  physical  and  chemical
              properties of materials  are  varied  and  extremely  complex,  governed by the
              details of  the  interactions  of  billions  and  billions of electrons with
              billions of  ions.   On  the  other  hand,  it  is  this complexity that leads
              to  applicability  of  materials in our daily lives, such as integrated
              circuits (computers),  magnetic  recording, catalytic activity, and light
              weight  but  strong  materials,  so  that  new  material, with quite  different
               or  better  physical  or  chemical  properties can be prepared.     This 
              research  program  uses the simple metals (e.g., lithium, sodium, beryllium) 
              as  the vehicle for developing a fundamental understanding of the physical  and
               chemical  properties  of surfaces  and  interfaces.   It  is  the 
              characteristics of the surface or interface that dictates the behavior  in most
              of the applications above.  ***
