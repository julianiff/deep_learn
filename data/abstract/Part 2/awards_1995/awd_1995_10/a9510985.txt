Abstract    :
              Formulating effective social policy requires careful analysis of  the
              intertemporal decisions that individuals make.  For example,  responding to
              social problems like drug use, criminal activity,  teenage pregnancy, and
              high-school failure, requires  understanding of the intertemporal decisions
              that contribute to  these outcomes.  Enhancing the understanding of
              intertemporal  choices is the focus of this study.  It will emphasize 
              interdisciplinary research projects motivated by behavioral  anomalies in
              intertemporal decision-making.  Each project  analyzes a new model of
              intertemporal choice suggested by  evidence and experiments in the psychology
              literature.  These  psychological models will be evaluated using standard
              economic  analysis.    This study involves three different research projects. 
              The first  project analyzes the behavior of decision-makers with hyperbolic 
              discount functions.  Hyperbolic discount functions suggest a  multiple-self
              interpretation of intertemporal decision-making,  generating an interesting
              framework for understanding phenomena  like self-control.  The second proposes
              a physiological  microfoundation for environmentally dependent motivational
              states  or drives.  This project uses physiological theories of  homeostasis
              and Pavlovian conditioning to build a theory of  endogenous motivational
              states.  For example, the model proposed  here explains how environmental cues
              elicit drives for  instantaneous gratification.  Finally, the third project
              builds  on the psychology literature about over optimism.  This project 
              examines the behavior of decision makers with over optimistic  priors and
              considers the consequences for consumption behavior.
