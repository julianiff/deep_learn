Abstract    :
              ***  9510437  Tosunoglu    Description:  This project is to support US
              participation in an international meeting "The Conference on Recent Advances in
              Mechatronics" planned to be held August 14-16, 1995 in Istanbul, Turkey.  The
              meeting is scheduled to bring Turkish, US, Japanese, and European scientists
              and engineers to share research results and identify areas for future research,
              and for joint work in the area of mechatronics.   Topics to be covered will
              include: development of mechatronic machines; production automation;
              intelligent manufacturing systems, robotics and motion control, and education
              and training in mechatronics.  The plans call for special sessions and
              tutorials to be led by Japanese experts.  The Turkish organizer is Dr.Okyay
              Kaynak, UNESCO Chair on echatronics at Bogazici University in Istanbul.  It is
              expected that a proceedings of the plenary lectures and presented papers will
              be published and made available before the meeting.    Scope:  This meeting is
              the first in its type, and is sponsored by, among others, the American Society
              of Mechanical Engineers, the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society, the IEEE
              Robotics & Automation Society, The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan,
              the Japanese Society of Mechanical Engineers, the Robotics Society of Japan,
              and the Society of Instrument and Control Engineers of Japan.   The
              participation of US scientists is important to the success of this meeting.  It
              is expected that they will benefit from the interaction with the strong
              Japanese delegation as well as the European participation.  The Turkish
              organizer hopes to have this meeting held bi-annually, rotating the host
              country between Europe, the USA, and Japan.  The increasing emphasis in Turkey
              on this scientific topic, as evidenced by the establishment of the UNESCO chair
              at Bogacici University, will benefit from having the meeting held at that
              university.  ***
