Abstract    :
              This study will combine existing multi-channel seismic, Seabeam and  SeaMarc
              data to produce a three dimensional image of fault  structure along the East
              Pacific Rise.  The study will test  hypotheses of how abyssal hills are formed
              and how subsurface  processes affect the surface morphology.
