Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF/Sloan Fondation Postdoctoral  Research Fellowship in
              Molecular Evolution for 1995 for two  years.  The training and research plan
              will be conducted at  the University of Oregol under the sponsorship of Dr. 
              Charles B. Kimmel of the Institute of Neuroscience.  The reseach will focus on
              the origin and evolution of a  critical shared-derived feature of the
              vertebrate body plan,  the neural crest.  Genetic investigations of vertebrate 
              embryogenesis have identified the snail and goosecoid genes  as molecular
              markers for the initial specification of neural  crest, as well as its most
              important derivatives in the  craniofacial region, the pharyngeal arches.  The
              primary  objective of this research will be to clone the homologs of  these
              genes from a nonvertebrate chordate (Amphioxus,  subphylum Cephalochordata), as
              well as a primitive  vertebrate (the lamprey, superclass Agnatha), and to
              compare  their embryonic expression patterns with a model vertebrate  system,
              the zebrafish.
