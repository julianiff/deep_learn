Abstract    :
              9510259  Daw    This work investigates the fine structure of dislocations in 
              the FeAl and NiAl pseudobinary systems.  Specifically, it  studies the details
              of dislocations and dislocation  reactions in these compounds, using both
              atomistic (embedded-  atom and tight-binding/density-matrix methods) and 
              anisotropic continuum calculations.  The investigator will  explore four key
              features: (1) the core structure and  mobility of a<111> dislocations; (2) the
              source of the yield  strength anomaly; (3) the mechanism of the slip
              transition;  and (4) deformation mechanisms above the slip transition.  He is
              closely coordinating this theoretical work with the  experimental efforts of
              Prof. Mike Mills of The Ohio State  University.  Such work will help to
              determine strategies for  obtaining improved low-temperature ductility and
              high-  temperature strength in these compounds.  %%%  This project
              theoretically investigates the properties of a  class of intermetallic
              compounds, namely, iron-aluminum and  nickel-aluminum.  These materials are of
              considerable  technological interest due to their attractive high-  temperature
              properties and excellent oxidation and corrosion  resistance (that is, they
              keep from rusting or breaking  down).  Applications include aerospace turbines,
               semiconductor coatings, and automotive components.  In  particular, the
              investigator will look at linear defects in  these materials called
              dislocations that are responsible for  many of the properties of interest. 
              Once scientists better  understand the dislocations, then they can develop
              better  strategies in obtaining improved properties.  The  investigator is
              closely coordinating this theoretical work  with the experimental efforts of
              Prof. Mike Mills of The  Ohio State University.  ***
