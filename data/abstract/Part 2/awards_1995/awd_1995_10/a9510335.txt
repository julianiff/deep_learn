Abstract    :
              9510335  Litvin    This project, part of the Research in Undergraduate 
              Institutions program, contributes to the area of two  dimensional
              crystallography and its applications.  The  investigator will identify and
              determine the symmetry of  domain twins and walls, for both ferroelastic and
              magnetic  materials. He will make use of Volume E of the International  Tables
              of Crystallography, of which he was a recent co  author.  These boundaries have
              an important influence on the  physical properties of multi-domain ferroelastic
              and  magnetic materials.  %%%  This theoretical research, under the Research in
               Undergraduate Institutions program, takes place at the Burks  Campus of
              Pennsylvania State University.  It falls in the  area of crystallography, which
              involves the study of  symmetries in solids.  In particular, this project deals
               with those regions inside ferroelastic and magnetic  materials where two
              individual perfect crystalline domains  meet.  These boundaries have an
              important influence on the  physical properties in multi-domain materials.  ***
