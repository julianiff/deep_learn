Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    9510301  Hryciw    This research project will produce the design and
              prototype  development of a Subsurface Vision Probe (SVP) for in situ 
              characterization applicable for geotechnical and geo-  environmental site
              investigations.  The research will be  conducted as a collaboration between the
              University of  Michigan and Hogentogler & Co., Inc. of Columbia, MD.  The 
              ultimate objective is to incorporate the SVP into equipment  used for cone
              penetrometer testing.  A standard cone will be  modified by combining a
              high-resolution CCD video camera,  lens, lighting, and mirror system with
              synthetic sapphire  viewing window into the penetrometer housing.  The video 
              images captured will allow the soil to be classified using  image processing
              techniques.  Ultimately, soil grain size  distribution using visualization
              techniques could be  determined in situ on a continuous and real-time basis.
