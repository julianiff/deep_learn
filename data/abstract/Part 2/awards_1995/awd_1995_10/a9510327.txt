Abstract    :
              Presidential advisers play a central role in controlling the flow of information
              to the chief executive, defining problems, and persuading the president to
              embark on specific courses of action.  Few studies, however, have examined
              systematically the patterns of communication between a president and his
              advisers, and fewer still have explored how these patterns change over time. 
              This research uses archival data, in particular the president's daily diary
              schedules, to examine the communication patterns between the president and
              other executive branch officials in the Nixon and Carter administrations.  The
              research considers how institutional, interpersonal, and environmental factors
              contribute to the initial development and subsequent evolution of these
              patterns.  In doing so, the project employs social network concepts and
              techniques.  Ultimately, the research will clarify and test some of the
              fundamental behavioral and institutional assumptions that underlie current
              theories of communication within advisory networks.
