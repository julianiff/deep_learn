Abstract    :
              9510188  Williams  This SGER award will support research on the recent eruptive
              activities of Rabaul Caldera of Papua New Guinea.  The goals are to collect
              real-time data on SO2 emissions and obtain samples of the eruptive products for
              studies of volatiles contained in the magma body.    The need to understand
              large-scale 9510188caldera forming eruptions and, specifically, the premonitory
              activity is very fundamental.  The gases are not preserved as a rock record
              and, therefore, one must make the analysis in real-time.  Volcanic gas flux is
              very important in understanding the causes of global change, and there are
              major uncertainties about the flux of different gases released by
              caldera-forming eruptions.
