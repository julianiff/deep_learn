Abstract    :
              9500716  Coburn       Coburn will continue studies of heat flow estimates and
              Berezin-Toeplitz algebras in several directions. Efforts will be continued to
              develop "backward heat estimates", obtained for the usual heat equation in
              earlier work with C. A. Berger, to more general parabolic equations. Another
              focus will be to follow-up recent work with J. Xia on "Toeplitz algebras and
              Rieffel deformations" to check whether Toeplitz algebras on bounded domains are
              generally "strict deformation quantizations" of the corresponding algebras of
              continuous functions. Coburn and Berger will also follow-up Coburn's work on
              "Deformation estimates for the Berezin-Toeplitz quantization" to obtain
              isomorphism invariants for the algebras of (boson) canonical commutation
              relations. These invariants arise from an appropriate extension of the index
              theorem to pseudo-differential operators with "eventually slowly varying"
              symbols.  ***
