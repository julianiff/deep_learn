Abstract    :
              9510091  Rumble   This award supports research to develop an ultra-violet laser
              microprobe system for in situ analysis of oxygen isotopes in minerals. The
              system to be developed will be capable of sampling nanomole quantities of
              oxygen (to obtain isotopic ratios 18O/16O and 17O/16O) from the surface of
              oxide and silicate mineral samples with a spatial resolution on the order of
              ten micrometers. Oxygen is the most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and
              its isotopes are useful as tracers of mass transfer within the crust, as
              sensitive recorders of water-rock chemical interactions, and as recorders of
              temperature of rock-water equilibration.   ***
