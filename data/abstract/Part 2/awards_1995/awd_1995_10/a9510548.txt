Abstract    :
              Technology is a key input to development, and to sustain it, a sound science
              base is required.  Therefore, a large number of international agencies give
              science and technology (S&T) aid and assistance to lesser developed nations. 
              They provide this assistance in both narrow focused as well as broad based
              program activities.  Examples of such program types include health,
              agriculture, infrastructure, economic development, education, and the
              environment.  The primary objective of this project is to assess the available
              literature to determine the extent of beneficial impacts of this S&T aid
              assistance on the society and economy of the recipients.  Project reports
              available from the major international donor agencies, electronic data bases,
              and traditional print sources, representing all of the major world regions
              (Asia, Africa, Central/South American), and focusing on the program types
              listed above, will be reviewed and analyzed.  the literature reviews, as well
              as the summary assessment will be structured to include geographic data,
              planning, objectives, procedure, problems encountered, and evaluation of impact
              of the project (s) under review.  The primary purpose of the research is to
              identify areas of successful socioeconomic impact from S&T aid assistance
              programs, areas in which the results have not been as successful, and attempt
              to identify commonalty among the projects found in the two areas.
