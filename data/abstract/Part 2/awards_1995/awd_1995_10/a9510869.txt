               Texas Historical Commission    Holocene Paleoclimatic History of the Rainfall
              Gradient in the Southern Great Plains    The Great Plains represent the
              climatic transition between moist eastern and semiarid western North America. 
              This project investigates the climate history of this rainfall gradient in the
              southern Great Plains over the course of the Holocene (the period following the
              end of the last ice age or the last 10,000 years).  The paleoclimate
              reconstruction is based on the stable isotope composition of the carbonate
              fraction of shells of the land snail, Rabdotus, which is abundant in the late
              Quaternary record of the region.  Samples from four Texas sites spanning the
              modern rainfall gradient in the region are analyzed for stable carbon and
              oxygen isotope ratios.  These ratios serve as proxies for determining  plant
              types and  seasonal variations in temperature.  Documenting the recent history
              (last 10,000 years) of this rainfall gradient is of critical importance in
              evaluating paleoclimatic models of the Holocene and understanding how the
              gradient could change in the future in response to human-induced modifications.
               The data also provides a basis for reinterpreting and refining current
              understanding of the patterns of cultural adaptation in the region.
