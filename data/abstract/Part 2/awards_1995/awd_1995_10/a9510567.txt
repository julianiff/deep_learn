Abstract    :
              Dr. John Arnold, Chemistry Department, University of California -   Berkeley, is
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic   Chemistry
              Program of the Chemistry Division to study the interactions of   the heavier
              group 12 elements with metals. This largely synthetic   chemistry project
              targets the design of chalcogenate ligands that will   stabilize specific
              metal-chalcogen interactions and the use of these   ligands to prepare a range
              of chalcogenate compounds. Analogs of metal   alkoxides and thiols will be
              prepared with chalcogenolate moieties, -Se-R   and -Te-R, whose `R` groups are
              designed to yield molecular species with   stable metal-selenium or -tellurium
              bonds. The reactions and mechanisms   of these compounds will be systematized. 
               There are a number of advanced electronic materials which are based on  
              metal-selenium and -tellurium systems. Selenium and tellurium chemistry,  
              however, is not yet well understood. This project aims at the preparation   of
              new types on metal compounds that contain stable metal-selenium and  
              -tellurium bonds and at systematizing the chemical behavior of these  
              linkages. By knowing the typical reactions of M-Se and M-Te bonds, new   routes
              to electronic materials may be designed.
