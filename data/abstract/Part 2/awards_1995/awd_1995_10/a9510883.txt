Abstract    :
              This project supports a workshop of an interdisciplinary  group of scholars now
              studying organizational processes in  high-hazard productions systems and a
              collaborating group of  industry experts.  The workshop is structured to help 
              participants identify significant research questions,  fertilize nascent
              research directions, catalyze cross-  disciplinary and academic-industry
              collaborations, and  contribute to a supportive infrastructure for this
              potential  community of scholars and practitioners.  Participants will  write
              positions papers in preparation for the workshop and  prepare reaction papers
              critically examining analyses of  incidents during the workshop.  The
              organizers will prepare  a workshop summary that highlights suggestions for
              high-  hazard organizations and organization theory, and the nature  of
              communication among academics and industry participants.
