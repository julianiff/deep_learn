Abstract    :
              This award supports the research of Professor Helene Barcelo in the field of
              algebraic combinatorics. The algebraic shifting method introduced by Kalai in
              1984 has proven to be an extremely successful tool for characterizing the
              f-vectors of a wide range of classes of simplicial complexes. The goal of this
              research is to investigate possible generalizations of this method to algebraic
              structures other than simplicial complexes. The algebraic structures to be
              studied share the common property that they have a class of combinatorial
              objects associated with them.     This research is in the general area of
              Combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how
              discrete collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete
              systems is extremely important to modern communications. For example, the
              design of lapge networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the
              design of algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of objects,
              and this makes use of combinatorial research.
