Abstract    :
              This project is a collaborative study between David Fritts at the  University of
              Colorado and Chiao-Yao She at Colorado State  University.  The PIs will use the
              sodium lidar at Fort Collins and  the Rayleigh lidar in place, as well as a
              resonance lidar to be  developed at ALOMAR.  The Fort Collins sodium lidar
              system  currently has wind and temperature measurement capabilities with 
              vertical and off-vertical viewing options.  Since Fort Collins  provides
              correlative data for middle atmosphere studies, efforts  there will focus on
              dynamics studies using new and existing wind  and temperature data.    ALOMAR
              (the Arctic Lidar Observatory for Middle Atmosphere  Research), a major optical
              and radar observatory in Norway, will  provide comprehensive and nearly
              continuous measurements of  atmospheric dynamics, structure and composition. 
              Development of a  resonance lidar capability at ALOMAR will extend continuous 
              measurements (in altitude) of atmospheric temperature,  constituents, winds and
              heat and momentum fluxes, permitting  quantitative and correlative studies of
              mesospheric and lower  thermospheric structure, dynamics, and variability not
              possible at  any other site.***
