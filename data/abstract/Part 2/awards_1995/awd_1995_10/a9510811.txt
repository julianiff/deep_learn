Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF/Sloan Foundation Postdoctoral  Research Fellowship in
              Molecular Evolution for 1995 for two  years.  The training and research plan
              will be conducted at  Yale University under the sponsorship of Dr. Leo W. Buss
              of  the Department of Biology.  The research will focus on the expression of
              genes in a non  segmented, radially symmetric organism.  The spatial and 
              temporal expression patterns of these genes in the life  cycle of a marine
              Cnidarian are expected to suggest their  primitive functions and provide the
              foundation for  subsequent comparative study of the emergence of  morphological
              novelty.
