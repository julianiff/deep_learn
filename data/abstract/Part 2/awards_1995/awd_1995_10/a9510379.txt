Abstract    :
              9510379  Eldering  This is an award to support preliminary research on the
              factors  that influence the nature of aerosol particulates in air that 
              negatively affect its quality.  The proposal leading to this  award was
              submitted in response to NSF 93-130, Research Planning  Grants and Career
              Advancement Awards for Women Scientists and  Engineers.  The investigator has
              selected the region surrounding  Pocatello, Idaho as the site for this planning
              study.  Its  objective is to utilize results of an air quality sampling 
              program as a step toward determining the feasibility of  formulating
              mathematical models that can be used in the  engineering design of pollution
              abatement and mitigation  measures.  The intensive sampling program will be
              conducted in  cooperation with the Southeastern Idaho Air Pollution Control 
              Office.    An understanding of the sources of air pollutants and conditions 
              that affect their movement is necessary in the formulation of  mathematical
              models that can be used in the engineering design of  abatement procedures. 
              This project is expected to assist in  determination of the need for and
              feasibility of a long-term  sampling program that would reveal annual
              variations in sources,  chemical composition and size distribution of aerosol 
              particulates in regions with significant particulate air quality  problems.
