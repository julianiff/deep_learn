Abstract    :
              Abstract for Minority postdoctoral fellowships      This action funds an NSF
              Minority Postdoctoral Research  Fellowship for 1995.  This program of
              fellowships is a joint  activity of the Directorate for Biological Sciences and
              the  Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences of  the National
              Science Fundation. Two-year fellowships are  offered each year in a effort to
              increase the number of  research scientists from underrepresented minority
              groups,  i.e., Native Americans (including American Indians and  Alaskan
              Natives), Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Pacific  Islanders, thereby
              contributing to the future vitality of  the Nation's research enterprise.  The
              goal of the program  is to prepare minority scientists for positions of 
              scientific leadership in academia and industry.  The  fellowships are designed
              to permit Fellows to choose the  research and training environment most
              beneficial to their  scientific development.    The research and training plan
              supported by this fellowship  is entitled: Cell Cycle Dependent Expression of
              the  Catalytic Submit (M2) of Ribonucleotide Reductase.
