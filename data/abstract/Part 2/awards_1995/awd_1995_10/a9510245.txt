Abstract    :
              In this project funded by the Advanced Materials Chemistry Program in the  
              Special Projects Office of the Chemistry Division, Gordon will conduct  
              fundamental research on a low-temperature chemical vapor deposition (CVD)  
              process for early transition metals such as titanium, zirconium, or   hafnium. 
              The approach will be to synthesize novel precursor compounds   containing
              hydrogenated aromatic ligands which should decompose cleanly   into metal
              hydride films and very stable aromatic byproduct vapors.  The   metal hydride
              films would then be dissociated into the metal and hydrogen   by heating to
              higher temperatures.  The deposited metals will be fully   characterized for
              composition and structure as well as for thickness,   electrical resistance,
              surface morphology, and step coverage using   various spectroscopic and
              microscopic tools.   Since no low-temperature CVD processes are currently known
              for any of the   early transition metals, successful discovery and development
              of a   low-temperature CVD process for deposition of these metals should have
              an   important impact on CVD of semiconductors and non-metals.  Various  
              electronic and optical applications, such as solar cells, smart windows,  
              flat-panel displays, corrosion-resistant coatings, and other thin-film  
              applications will be affected.
