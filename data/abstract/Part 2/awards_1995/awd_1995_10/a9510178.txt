Abstract    :
              9510178  Duffy    In this Research Planning Grant the investigator will explore
              the  role that patriotism plays in political discourse among  contemporary
              Native Americans.  This is part of a multi-phased   research design to explore
              political dynamics of nations within a  nation, thereby gaining insight on such
              troubling regions as  Bosnia and Rwanda, or wherever political entities within
              a state  divide themselves along national or ethnic lines.    The investigator
              will link Q-methodology with a survey  instrument.  The objective of the
              planning grant is to develop a  research proposal which gives insights on: 
              culturally-specific  ways of thinking about politics and political
              participation;  cognitive mechanisms members of subcultures use to adapt to two
               value systems; and, sources of differences in political  participation among
              and between tribes.  Exploring these issues  will contribute to theories about
              political attitude formation  and change, political behavior, and linkage
              between attitudes and  political participation.  ***
