Abstract    :
              THIS AWARD SUPPORTS PRELIMINARY RESEARCH AIMED AT A DESCRIPTION OF CYCLIC
              HOMOLOGY OF ALGEBRAIC VARIETIES USING TECHNIQUES IN DIFFERENTIAL ALGEBRA.  IN
              EARLIER WORK THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR HAS SHOWN THAT CYCLIC HOMOLOGY CAN BE
              USED TO RECOVER A CLASSICAL INVARIANT, THE MILNOR OR TJURINA NUMBER, OF PLANE
              CURVES WITH ISOLATED SINGULARITIES.  SHE WILL NOW  WORK ON OBTAINING AN
              EXPLICIT COMPUTATION  OF HOCHSCHILD HOMOLOGY AND CYCLIC HOMOLOGY FOR GENERAL
              ALGEBRAIC CURVES.  THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR WILL ALSO WORK ON THE MODULE OF
              DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS ON CURVES WITH ISOLATED SINGULARITIES.    THIS RESEARCH
              IS CONCERNED WITH ALGEBRAIC K-THEORY.  IN A BROAD SENSE, ALGEBRAIC K-THEORY
              CONCERNS THE EVOLUTION OF CONCEPTS FROM LINEAR ALGEBRA SUCH AS BASIS AND VECTOR
              SPACE.  THIS WORK HAS SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR NUMBER THEORY AND ALGEBRAIC
              GEOMETRY, AND PROMISES TO MAKE EXCITING CONNECTIONS BETWEEN A NUMBER OF
              DIFFERENT AREAS OF MATHEMATICS.
