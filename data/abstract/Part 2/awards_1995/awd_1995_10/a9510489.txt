Abstract    :
              9510489  Peterson    This dissertation research investigation addresses the role
               played by institutional arrangements, political behavior, and  environmental
              constraints in explaining the diffusion and outputs  of school reform efforts
              across 63 American cities.   The key  question of the research is:  what
              conditions made school reform  more likely during 1992-1995?  The dependent
              variable is the  incidence and out put of reform, as measured in scaled
              responses  produced by interviewing seven knowledgeable sources in each  sample
              city.    This investigation is the first attempt to examine the fate of a 
              number of reform policies across a large sample of cities.  By  creating an
              original data set measuring the appearance of five  educational reforms across
              the U.S., the rate at which they were  debated and implemented, the role of key
              hypothetical actors, and  board behaviors, this study will be able to offer
              unprecedented  insights into the determinants of school reform.  Meshing this 
              data with existent demographic, fiscal, and institutional data,  as well as the
              results from two questionnaires, proved effective  in the pilot study in Baton
              Rouge, Louisiana.  ***
