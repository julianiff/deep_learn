Abstract    :
                     ABSTRACT  CTS-9510563  Richard N. Smith    This is a GOALI proposal for a
              three-month industrial internship for the summer of 1995 to study  fundamental
              problems in the investment casting process in cooperation with the General
              Electric R&D Center, and to initiate a collaborative research effort with GE. 
              Particular emphasis will be on studies of investment casting of superalloys,
              including the development of modeling tools.
