Abstract    :
              9510062  Cole       This project will examine stable isotopes in corals 
              collected off Venezuela to look for evidence of changes in ocean  circulation
              and temperature which may correlate with rainfall  patterns in Brazil and
              sub-Saharan Africa.  If so, the coral  record can be used to extend rainfall
              records to prehistoric  times, in order to discern cyclic or long-term changes.
               The  project also implicitly tests assumptions about the role of cross- 
              equatorial heat transport in controlling tropical Atlantic  climate.  ***
