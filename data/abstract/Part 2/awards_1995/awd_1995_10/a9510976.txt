Abstract    :
              9510976    Kritzer  Contingent legal fees are a central feature of the American
              civil justice system.  The persistent controversy surrounding them pits those
              concerned about access to justice, especially for the disadvantaged, the poor,
              or deprived, against those concerned about excessive litigiousness and its
              effects on economic costs and productivity.  Existing research has focused on
              the contingent fee at a case level and has focused on the potential conflict of
              interest that arises between lawyer and client as well as the lawyer's
              incentives in individual cases.  This project will seek to enhance our
              understanding of the consequences of contingent fees by shifting the focus from
              the individual case to the contingent fee practice.  The empirical research to
              be conducted, cast in a portfolio theory perspective, will help determine
              whether conclusions about contingency fees and their consequences should be
              revised when placed into the actual contexts of contingency fee practices.  The
              research will be based on a survey of, at work observation of, and
              semi-structured interviews with contingent fee lawyers.  This multi-method
              approach will provide breadth and depth to our understanding of contingent fee
              practice.  %%%%  Contingent legal fees are a central feature of the American
