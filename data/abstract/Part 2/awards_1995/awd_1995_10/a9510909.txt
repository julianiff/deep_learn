Abstract    :
              SRS 9510909  Vonortas  The project will develop a database of the research joint
               ventures (RJVs) registered with the U. S. Department of  Justice under the
              National  Cooperative Research Act (NCRA)  of 1984.  The NCRA-RJV database
              permits both time series and  cross sectional statistical analysis and will
              provide data  to do empirical analysis to determine the characteristics of 
              these research joint ventures and their business  participants.  The data base
              will be linked to other  Commercially available databases such as Compustat and
               CorpTech and will be updated for the next three years until  1998.  The
              database will also be available to other  researchers.  The project will
              provide data on the  characteristics of such partnerships and will contribute
              to  the discussions concerning the importance of interfim  cooperation to
              industrial competitiveness.
