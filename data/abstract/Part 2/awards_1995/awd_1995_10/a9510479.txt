Abstract    :
              9510479  Penzien  This is an international  travel award to enable the 
              Principal Investigator to  visit the Korea Advanced  Institute of Science and 
              Engineering (KAIST) and Korea  Science and Engineering  Foundation (KOSEF) to
              develop  the final plan for the  International Symposium on  Civil
              Infrastructure Systems.  The venue of this symposium  will be in Seoul, Korea
              and  the host will be KOSEF.  This  international symposium, the  first major
              meeting of this  kind, was approved by the  last joint staff meeting  between
              INT/NSF and KOSEF.    The international cooperative  activity undertaken under
              this  project will enhance NSF's  Civil Infrastructure Systems  Research by
              developing  specific cooperative research  activities and joint funding  and
              mechanisms with potential  international partners in  Asia.  ***
