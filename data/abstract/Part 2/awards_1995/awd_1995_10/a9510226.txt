Abstract    :
                  This project is for Collaborative Research at Undergraduate Institutions,
              involving biology, chemistry and physical optics.  When the nervous system
              grows during development, one of the key events is the extension of long
              processes called neurites from individual nerve cell bodies; these neurites
              connect cells to their targets (other nerve cells, muscles, or glands) that may
              be long distances away in the adult.  There are various barriers between
              tissues in the body, and one of these is called extracellular matrix, or ECM,
              which is largely made of proteils.  It is believed that the growing tip of
              neurites secrete an enzyme that is a proteinase, to locally break down the ECM
              and allow the neurites to penetrate it.  This project utilizes novel
              fluorescent dyes and time-lapse microscopic imaging techniques to examine the
              localization of a particular metallo-proteinase, degradation of the matrix, and
              intracellular traffic carrying the proteins.  The project is designed to reveal
              for the first time the dynamics of molecules believed to be integral to
              mechanisms for neurite elongation.  Results will have an impact on
              developmental biology, cell biology and imaging technology, and the project
              provides a novel multidisciplinary experience involving undergraduates in
              exciting research over an unusual range of techniques from biochemistry to
              optics.
