Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  K. Y. Simon Ng    This is a postdoctoral industrial fellowship awarded
              under the GOALI program.  It is to support Dr. Haryani Permana  to work in the
              General Motors North American Research and Development Center with Dr. David
              Belton.  The goal of the effort is to fill a gap in the fundamental
              understanding of palladium-rhodium interactions in automotive emission  control
              catalysts.  The activity of a planar model catalyst is compared with the
              high-surface-area supported palladium-rhodium catalyst to established the
              relevance of the model system.  The model catalyst is studied using
              ultrahigh-vacuum surface analysis, in-situ infrared spectroscopy, and scanning
              probe microscopy to gain insight on the interactions of palladium and rhodium
              under various conditions.     This research is relevant to the design of more
              effective and longer lived catalytic converters for control of nitrogen oxides
              and hydrocarbons in automotive emissions.  ***
