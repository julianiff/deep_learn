Abstract    :
              This is a collaborative proposal with Dr. James Davis of the University of
              Illinois (SBR    95107955).  The PIs propose to test a new model (the social
              judgment scheme model) of    group decision making.  This model pertains to
              decisions concerning continuous    variables such as money or other quantities.
               In the experiments to be performed by the    PIs, the issues to be decided
              will include decisions about public hazards that inspire the    feeling of
              dread.  The PIs will manipulate a number of procedural aspects of mock panels  
               or committees in order to ascertain the influence of these factors.  Such
              factors will    include the group decision rule (e.g., unanimity or majority),
              group size, accountability of    the group to other constituencies, and
              framing.
