Abstract    :
              9510066  Okos  This  project  is on research to establish and verify  a  general
               multiphase-multispecies   transport   theory   for    hydrophilic  shrinking
              systems by combining various independent theories  that  exist   in   the 
              literature.   A  new  thermomechanical   theory  potentially applicable to most
              hydrophilic shrinking systems such  as  foods, contact lenses, drug delivery
              polymers, and clays will  lead  to  novel  forms of Darcy's and Fick's laws 
              applicable  to  saturated   shrinking   systems  and  to  novel  
              non-equilibrium  definitions  of  swelling pressure and capillary pressure.  
              This  research proposes to extend the new thermomechanical theory  into  an  
              experimentally  verifiable  form,  to  develop   fundamental  property models,
              and to verify the theory with experiments.  ***
