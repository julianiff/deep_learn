Abstract    :
              In countries of Central and Eastern Europe, privatization of  state owned
              enterprises is the central element of transition to a  market economy.  The
              objective of this research is to investigate  the relationship between speed of
              privatization and changes in  output, with particular emphasis on the role of
              unemployment and  fiscal policy.  The issue can be stated as: how should
              government  choose the downsizing of the state sector and the path of  taxation
              to achieve a desirable resource allocation in the  transition economy.    The
              theoretical part of the research consists of developing a  consistent
              macroeconomic framework for a transition economy with  a job matching process
              in order to analyze the effects and  welfare implications of alternative
              privatization and taxation  schemes.  The model is a general equilibrium model,
              i.e. it  captures the interaction of all variables in the model.  By 
              incorporating the job matching process, the model takes into  account the
              regional and skill mismatch between unemployed  workers and available vacancies
              that currently exists across  countries of Eastern Europe and, thus, provides a
              suitable  framework for studying the optimal speed of privatization.  The 
              empirical part involves  collecting data on output, employment,  unemployment,
              fiscal expenditures, and taxes for each country and  then estimating the
              general equilibrium model.  ***
