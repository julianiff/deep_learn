              Abstract  ATM-9510183  Houghton, David D.  University of Wisconsin  Title:
              Extratropical Climate Variability in the Coupled Ocean-  Atmosphere System   
              This research is focused on understanding and isolating key  physical
              mechanisms related to: 1) the effects of tropical-  extratropical interactions
              on interannual variability in the  extratropical North Pacific region, 2)
              decadal climate variability  in the North Pacific, and 3) abrupt shifts in the
              extratropical  atmospheric flow in the transition seasons.  Simulations from a 
              hierarchy of numerical models with validation from observations  provide the
              basic data for analysis.  Careful diagnostics will  enable isolation of
              specific processes.  Such isolation is critical  for developing theory and for
              understanding results from fully  coupled models.  Observations from global
              data sets will be used  not only for model parameter specification and
              validation, but also  for diagnostic analyses parallel to those that are found
              useful in  the model studies.    A strong point for this research project is
              the close collaboration  of scientists representing both the oceanographic and
              atmospheric  science communities.  This will enable them to adequately 
              incorporate the key mechanisms of the ocean-atmospheric system  important to
              the various time scales of variability.
