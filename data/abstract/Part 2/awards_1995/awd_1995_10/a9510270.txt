Abstract    :
              9510270  Clark  The proposed research is in the Undergraduate Design Projects 
              Program category, and requests support for undergraduate and  graduate student
              engineers to provide prototype "custom designed"  devices and software to aid
              persons with disabilities.  The  primary goal of this thrust is to provide
              meaningful design  experience for the engineering student that will directly
              aid a  specific disabled individual. A formal program is in place at the 
              University of Massachusetts-Lowell which will ensure satisfactory  progress is
              attained on these projects.  A group of students and  the investigators on the
              grant will work with a number of  collaborating agencies and individuals on
              these projects.  Fifty  projects are planned during the five year duration of
              this award,  and a written report on the completed projects will be submitted 
              for an annual publication.    Once completed, each project will be given to the
              person for whom  it is designed.  The hope is that this "real world" experience
               will give engineering students a sense of purpose and pride, help  engineering
              schools serve the community, attract new students  into engineering, and raise
              student interest in graduate  education.    This type of undertaking is
              important since it provides a  meaningful experience for engineering students
              as part of their  undergraduate design requirements, and will also benefit a 
              population where customization is often needed for rehabilitation  devices.
