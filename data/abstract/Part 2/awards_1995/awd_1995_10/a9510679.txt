Abstract    :
              Dr. LeRoy Peterson, Jr., Department of Chemistry and Physics, Francis   Marion
              University, is supported under a Research Planning Grant for   Minority
              Scientists and Engineers by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and   Organometallic
              Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division for the study   of zinc and cadmium
              complexes which model the action of these metals in   biological systems. To
              this end a series of zinc and cadmium compounds   utilizing
              poly(pyrazolyl)borate, nucleic acid, and carboxylate ligands   will be prepared
              and characterized. The structures and properties of   these complexes will be
              used to understand the interactions of the metals   with complex biological
              molecules.   Zinc plays important roles in a diverse series of enzymes and is
              involved   in many biochemical processes including DNA replication,
              recognition,   rewinding, and degradation. Chemically cadmium is closely
              related to   zinc, but, in contrast to zinc, is quite toxic. The major goal of
              the   research is to establish the important aspects of the chemistry of zinc  
              and cadmium that govern their behavior in biological systems. A   significant
              portion of this planning grant will involve the establishment   of
              collaborative arrangements with nearby laboratories, which will allow   Dr.
              Peterson and his students access to instrumentation not available at   Francis
              Marion University.
