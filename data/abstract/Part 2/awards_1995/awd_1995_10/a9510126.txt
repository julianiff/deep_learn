Abstract    :
                9510126  Queller   Drs. Queller and Strassmann will work on several species of
              Polistes paper wasps, each chosen for characteristics that make it particularly
              suitable for studying one kind of conflict. .  They have developed DNA
              microsatellite loci that will provide an unusually clear picture of the genetic
              structure of colonies.  This research should reveal much about the expression
              and resolution of genetic conflicts of interest.  It will test elements of kin
              selection theory that are relevant to a wide range of species.  It may provide
              general insights into the evolution of other kinds of cooperative entities,
              from the eukaryotic cell to multicellular organisms.   On the practical side,
              the research will utilize and contribute to the new technology surrounding
              microsatellite genes, a particular method of genetic fingerprinting important
              in many areas, including evolutionary studies, conservation genetics,
              forensics, and gene-mapping studies for agricultural and medical needs.  It
              will also provide test data sets for new methods of estimating relatedness
              being developed in the same laboratory.   Besides contributing to the training
              of postdoctoral and graduate students, Queller and Strassmann encourage
              participation of undergraduates, high school students, and teachers who take
              the knowledge they gain back to the classroom.
