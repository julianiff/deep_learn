Abstract    :
              9510075  Keigwin       Water masses of North Atlantic are known to have varied 
              on glacial/interglacial and millennial time scales.  Deep  northern water was
              suppressed during severe climates,  intermediate water flow was enhanced and
              Gulf Stream  temperature and salinity varies.  Long and large diameter  cores
              are now available from Blake and Bahama outer ridges  and the Carolina slope. 
              Using geochemical proxies the  principal investigator will recreate deep and
              intermediate  hydrographic conditions for the last glacial maximum,  deglacial
              low salinity event and the deglacial cooling  event.  ***
