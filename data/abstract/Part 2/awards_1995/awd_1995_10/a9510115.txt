Abstract    :
              9510115  Lipo       A frequent requirement in motor drive applications such as 
              spindle drives, steel plants, and paper making machinery is to  operate at
              constant poser over a wide speed range.  Constant  power operation is
              particularly important in the field of  electric traction which covers a wide
              range of applications  ranging from locomotives to electric vehicles.  At
              present, field  weakening techniques are used to widen the speed range of ac 
              machines of conventional design, but as the desired speed range  for constant
              power operation increases beyond twice the normal  (or "rated") speed, the
              motor size and weight increases  dramatically for both induction and permanent
              magnet type  machines.  In the proposed project, a comprehensive analytical, 
              simulation, design and experimental program is set forth to  develop ac
              induction and synchronous machines which possess the  capability of an extended
              "constant power" field weakening range  without need for an oversized machine. 
              Pole changing of the  stator winding of both types of machines is accomplished
              by  proper control of the currents fed to the phases of a specially  designed
              stator winding using only conventional pulse width  modulated inverters. 
              Hence, the stator pole changing mechanism  does not necessarily introduce any
              additional switches,  contractors or solid state (or passive) components to
              achieve its  task.  The goal of achieving extended field weakening range will 
              be accomplished by means of innovative concepts of stator and  rotor design
              which will enable these new machines to be roughly  30 to 50% the size and
              weight of conventional ac machines  presently used for this same purpose.  ***
