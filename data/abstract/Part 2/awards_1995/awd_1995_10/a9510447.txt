Abstract    :
              9510447  Pastor  Grizzly Bear Digging in Subalpine Meadows: Influences on Plant
              Distributions and Nitrogen Availability  Grizzly bears are omnivores who often
              feed intensively on bulbs of plants such as glacier lilies. Foraging by bears
              can overturn large tracts of subalpine meadows. Preliminary observations
              suggest that this activity may increase nitrogen availability, seed production,
              bulb nitrogen, and bulb carbohydrate content. As such, these large animals may
              play major roles in the structure and function of subalpine plant communities.
              This project will rigorously test this hypothesis in areas inside and adjacent
              to Rocky Mountain National Park in Montana. This research will consider the
              role of a large omnivorous animal on the ecosystems in which they reside.
