Abstract    :
              9510182  Page  Theoretical research will be conducted on the nonlinear  dynamics
              of solids and molecules.  Three projects will be  undertaken: (1) a new class
              of localized vibrational  excitations which occur in nonlinear periodic
              lattices,  Ointrinsic localized modes,O will be studied.  These modes  are
              generated by optical pumping in the infrared.  The  properties of these new
              modes and their occurrence in real  three-dimensional crystals will be studied.
               Multistable  vibrational energy transmission across interfaces between 
              optically pumped organic crystals having a resonant  anharmonic interlayer
              coupling will also be studied. (2) a  related study of the anomalous infrared
              properties of the  defect system potassium iodide with singly charged silver 
              will be done. (3)  finally, infrared and Raman spectroscopy  of large amplitude
              anharmonic dynamics in biomolecules and  fullerenes will be studied using
              first-principles quantum  molecular dynamics.  %%%  This theoretical research
              program investigates the nonlinear  properties of solids and molecules.  These
              nonlinear  vibrations are often optically active and hence the research  will
              reveal new insights into the optical properties of  molecules and solids.  ***
