Abstract    :
              9510185  Belitz  The objective of this project is to enhance the current 
              understanding of condensed matter systems that are subject  to quenched
              disorder.  Specific systems to be studied  include quantum ferromagnets,
              magnets in random fields,  disordered superconductors, and doped
              semiconductors, as  well as other systems that undergo a metal-insulator 
              transition.  The methods that he uses include the  construction of effective
              field theories, renormalization  group techniques, and many-body perturbation
              theory.  A  successful completion of the project will contribute to the 
              understanding of an important area of condensed matter  physics and will train
              technical personnel with expertise in  this field.  %%%  The project deals with
              a variety of materials, such as those  with a transition between metallic and
              insulating phase.  Such materials have frozen into them defects of some type 
              that will make the material insulating if their presence is  sufficiently
              strong.  Examples include magnets,  superconductors, semiconductors, and
              metals, each with one  or more special type of defects.  Often, defects are 
              intentionally introduced into materials to give them desired  properties.  The
              PI will use state-of-the-art theoretical  methods to study such phenomena.  The
              PI carries on a  fruitful collaboration with T. R. Kirkpatrick from the 
              University of Maryland.  ***
