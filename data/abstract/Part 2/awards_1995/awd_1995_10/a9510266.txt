Abstract    :
              9510266    Gordon       The PI is organizing a Gordon Research Conference on
              Atmospheric Chemistry in  Newport, RI on June 18-23, 1995. This Gordon Research
              Conference is one of the major  meetings in this field. This year, the
              conference theme will be  Aerosols  - an extremely  timely topic of intense
              interest in both tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry. Aerosols  have also
              been identified as being the key uncertainty with respect to anthropogenic 
              influences on climate. The meeting will be attended by both established
              researchers and  young scientists, among them the participants of the preceding
              ACCESS meeting.  ***
