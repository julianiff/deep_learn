Abstract    :
              9510092  Congleton     This award provides funding for the establishment of an 
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center in Ergonomics at  Texas A&M
              University.    The research activities of the Center will contribute to the 
              technology and information base necessary to evaluate and  redesign existing
              workplace environments and work methods and to  provide the leadership for the
              effective design of future work  systems.  The Center will provide an
              opportunity for industry to  coordinate and direct research objectives in
              response to safety,  health, and ergonomic guidelines and standards that are
              being  adopted.  A focused research program will span interdisciplinary  fields
              aimed at reducing injury/illness rates; reducing  cumulative trauma disorders;
              reducing costs; increasing  productivity; and developing responses and research
              for increased  regulatory activity.  These technical programs are well
              developed  and aimed at solving key problems of both academic and practical 
              importance that will enhance and extend the reputation of the  Center and
              encourage growth in membership.    The Principal Investigators are competent
              researchers, actively  engaged in research within the area of interest to the
              Center and  it is their reputations that have resulted in the commitment of  10
              companies to support the new Center.  Their proven leadership  skills should
              help ensure the success of the Center.     The Program Manager recommends that
              Texas A&M University be  awarded $50,000 for the first year of a five-year
              continuing  award.    Near the end of each 12-month period the Program Manager
              and/or  the Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers  Division
              will review the progress of the Center on a number of  renewal criteria,
              including the following:  1) the extent to  which the university/industry
              interaction is developing; 2) the  extent to which the support base is
              developing; and 3) the extent  to which a robust research is developing.  If
              the review is  satisfactory, the Program M anager will recommend support for
              the  next period of this continuing award.
