Abstract    :
              9510391  Kirwan  This  project  is on research to improve fermentation  yield 
              and  reliability  by  developing better methods  to  account  for  the 
              influence  of  raw  material  variation  on  performance.   Media  ingredients 
               are   typically  of  natural  origin   and   poorly  characterized making it
              difficult to establish and quantify their  influence  on  the  fermentation
              process.   Near  Infrared  (NIR)  spectrophotometry  will be examined as a
              means to  quantitatively  characterize  media ingredients for correlation  to 
              fermentation  performance.   A  graduate student is to  spend  a  semester  and
               summer  working at the Merck & Co. facility in Elkton,  Virginia,  as  part of
              a cooperative research program with the University of  Virginia.  ***
