Abstract    :
              This research concerns a fundamental problem of machine learning,  which  is 
              how  to learn when the originally given representation  space  is  of low
              quality.  Most machine learning methods  search  for desirable knowledge in the
              same representation space in which  training examples are presented (that is,
              use the same attributes  or  terms  as  those  employed in the  training 
              data).   If  the  original  representation space is inadequate, that is, the 
              given  attributes  or descriptive terms are insufficiently  relevant  to  the
              present learning task, such methods do not perform well. This  project
              investigates several novel ideas and methods for learning  in  such 
              situations.   In  particular, we  are  investigating  a  constructive 
              induction  approach to  the  problem,  in  which  a  learning system performs a
              double intertwined search - one for an  improved  knowledge  representation 
              and   one  for  the   "best"  hypothesis  in  that  space.  In the
              multistrategy   constructive  induction  methodology, a combination of
              strategies  is  employed  for  transforming the initial representation space
              into  the  new  task-oriented  space.   the  space transformation  operators 
              are  divided  into  "constructors" that expand the space by  inventing  new 
              attributes  and  "destructors"  that  reduce  the  space  by  removing  or
              abstracting the current attributes, guided by  "meta  rules" that are initially
              provided, but incrementally improved by  a secondary learning process.
