Abstract    :
              Water, sound and electromagnetic waves are examples of wave  phenomena that
              occur in most physical systems.  General  relativity, Einstein's reformulation
              of Newton's  gravitational theory, predicts that accelerated masses  produce
              gravitational waves analogous to the way charges  produce electromagnetic
              waves.  Effects of gravitational  waves on the orbits of binary pulsars have
              already been  detected and observatories sensitive enough to observe the  waves
              from distant galaxies are now under construction.  The  goal of this project is
              to develop methods for relating the  properties of these waves to their sources
              so that the  details of the emission process, such as a black hole  collision,
              can be inferred.  It utilizes a new and powerful  computational approach to
              general relativity based upon the  light rays along which the waves travel.
