Abstract    :
              9510512  Friis  This project is a Research Planning Grant made to help  increase
              the number of new women investigators participating  in National Science
              Foundation (NSF) research programs, and  to facilitate preliminary studies and
              other activities  related to the development of competitive NSF research 
              proposals.    The aims of the research planning project are to: 1)  establish a
              firm working relationship with a manufacturing  company that produces metal
              tantalum foams, 2) work with  that company to develop a technique of forming
              metallic  reentrant structures directly in manufacturing, and 3) do 
              preliminary elastic property and fatigue toughness  characterization of the
              metallic reentrant structure as a  function of transmission compression ratio. 
              Characterization of the reentrant structure as a function of  compression ratio
              will facilitate design of devices that  incorporate this structural material. 
              The preliminary data  and proof of testing techniques will serve as a solid 
              foundation for a subsequent research proposal for full  characterization of the
              tantalum reentrant structure.  ***
