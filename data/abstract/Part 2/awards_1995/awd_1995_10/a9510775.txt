Abstract    :
                    Abstract for Molecular Evolution postdoctoral fellowships      This action
              funds a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1995.  This
              program of fellowships is a joint activity of the Directorate for Biological
              Sciences of NSF and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation of New York City.  The
              five-year program is in its second year.  Eighteen two-year fellowships are
              offered each year for research and training  in theoretical, comparative,
              computational, and /or experimental analyses of biological patterns and
              processes at the molecular level, within the framework of evolutionary change
              and adaptation of organisms, or in the use of molecular data to address broad
              evolutionary questions.  Fellows are encouraged to broaden their scientific
              experience and perspective in molecular evolution by selecting a host
              laboratory where new conceptual approaches and experimental techniques can be
              learned.      The research and training plan supported by this fellowship is
              entitled:  The Molecular Basis of Morphological Evolution in Maize and
              Teosinte.
