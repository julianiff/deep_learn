Abstract    :
              9510044  Paul  Ecosystem Response to Catastrophic Defoliation of Poplars 
              Defoliation of hardwood forests by Gypsy moth caterpillars in the eastern US
              has caused great concern. Defoliation kills some trees and the leafless trees
              are unsightly, as well as having the potential to cause environmental pollution
              because of the frass produced.  Poor success of past attempts to stop
              defoliation, the patchiness of Gypsy moth attacks, and the various rates of
              recovery of different forests show there are numerous ecosystem responses and
              controls which are little known.  Better knowledge of ecosystem response and
              recovery could greatly aid in coping with or overcoming catastrophic
              defoliation.  This project will study a well characterized research plot where
              some trees will be defoliated and others protected using an organic
              insecticide.  Effects on nitrogen cycling, water uptake, and root mycorrhizae
              will be measured.  This project will provide the fundamental information which
              will help better manage forests affected by this serious pest.
