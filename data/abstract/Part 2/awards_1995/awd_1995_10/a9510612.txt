Abstract    :
              9510612  Reinholtz   This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry
              award will support a graduate student and a fraction of a faculty member's time
              to work on a collaborative project between Virginia Tech and B&W Nuclear
              Technologies.  The project will use different modes of motion control for
              hand-to-eye coordination of an industrial robot. Vision will be the major form
              of feedback for this control problem. This is an attractive approach for B&W 's
              application.  Robots service steam generators where space and access are
              limited, but the applications call for motion on the order of +/-0.5 mm with a
              payload of 65 kg.  B&W will provide in-kind support by committing the
              equipment, technical support and software for the research.   The results from
              this collaboration will allow better maneuverability and safety in monitoring
              major components of power generating plants.  The technology is also applicable
              where remote operation in confined spaces and hazardous areas is needed.  ***
