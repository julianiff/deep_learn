Abstract    :
              9510008  Chang     The development and evolution of cyclones and anticyclones
              control, to a large extent, the weather in the mid-latitudes.  These weather
              systems occur in preferred regions termed the storm tracks.  It is important to
              understand the processes that can lead to the formation of these systems and
              their evolution.       Recent observational and modelling studies have revealed
              that cyclones and anticyclones occur predominantly within localized wave
              packets.  Preliminary studies suggest that the structure, evolution, and
              development of these systems within localized wave packets can be quite
              different from those suggested by traditional theories of baroclinic
              instability.  Dr. Chang intends to explore in depth the evolution of these
              systems within the localized wave packets by diagnosing observational analyses
              from the European Centre for Medium Range Prediction and the National Center
              for Environmental Prediction and by conducting numerical experiments with a
              primitive equation model with simplified model physics.     The results of this
              research will have important implications for medium range weather prediction
              (on the order of one to two weeks).   ***  ??
