Abstract    :
                   This project is for Collaborative Research at Undergraduate Institutions,
              involving biochemistry, molecular genetics and computational biology.   A viral
              microorganism that infects bacteria is the bacteriophage known as T4.  Because
              it has a relatively tiny genetic content, T4 has been a model genetic system
              revealing many important principles of molecular biology over the years.  The
              entire gene sequence of T4 is now known, and more than 100 probable genes
              remain uncharacterized.  This project uses computer programs to analyze and
              select genes of interest, molecular biology to clone and characterize the
              functions of their purified products, and biophysics and biochemistry to study
              the phage proteins and the host bacterial proteins with which they interact. 
              Particular attention is given to the potential role of these proteins in the
              context of microbial ecology, under different environmental conditions in the
              natural habitat of the host.  This work has a potentially major impact on
              understanding mechanisms by which viruses act on hosts, will lead to new tools
              for analyzing enzyme action, and promises an integrated cross-disciplinary
              experience involving undergraduates in research at the forefront of current
              techniques.
