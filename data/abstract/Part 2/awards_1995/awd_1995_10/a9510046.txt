Abstract    :
              9510046  Van Stryland  The PI proposes to apply the knowledge he has gained in 
              understanding the nonlinear response of inorganic materials (both 
              semiconductors and dielectrics) to organic materials.  In  particular he will
              concentrate on specific classes of organic  materials such as macrocyclic dyes
              that have been shown to exhibit  strong nonlinearities.  He will also
              investigate resonant  nonlinearities in these materials.  For example, 
              metallophthalocyanines and metallo-naphthalocyanines exhibit  increasing
              absorption from excited state absorption (reverse  saturable absorbers).  Such
              nonlinearities are proving useful for  optical limiting.  In addition, he will
              further develop a numerical  modeling for determining the propagation of light
              through thick  nonlinear media.  This modeling allows optimized use of
              nonlinear  absorption and nonlinear refraction for applications such as 
              optical limiting.  His past research investigated two-photon  absorption (2PA),
              bound electronic nonlinear refraction  characterized by n2, and free-carrier
              effects in semiconductors and  dielectrics.  He has recently extended these
              measurements to  molecular species and observed analogous nonlinearities.  ***
