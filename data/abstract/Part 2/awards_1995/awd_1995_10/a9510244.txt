Abstract    :
              9510244  Bach  The goal of this project is to study the computational complexity
               of number-theoretic problems.  Algorithms for solving these  problems are
              useful in the design of systems for random number  generation, cryptography,
              and computer algebra.  In addition,  many of the classic questions in
              complexity theory (such as  whether randomization helps in efficient
              computation) are  motivated by computational number theory.  Our proposed 
              investigations fall into three categories:    a) Computations and explicit
              bounds in analytic number theory.    b) The design and analysis of
              number-theoretic algorithms.    c) Constructive techniques in algebraic
              geometry and commutative  algebra.
