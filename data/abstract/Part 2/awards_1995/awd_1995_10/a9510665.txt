Abstract    :
              9510665   Thiemens     The atmospheric carbon monoxide budget is poorly
              characterized at present. In particular, it appears that there are sources
              which are either underestimated or unrecognized.  Carbon monoxide is a central
              species related to the oxidizing capacity of the lower atmosphere. New
              techniques for resolving the sources and transformation mechanisms of
              atmospheric carbon monoxide are needed. Recent measurements of the abundances
              of the stable isotopes 17O and 18O indicate anomalies in the isotopic
              composition of atmospheric carbon monoxide, which likely indicates a signature
              of atmospheric processes which alter the isotopic composition. Previous work on
              ozone, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide revealed the nature of the atmospheric
              processes causing such isotopic anomalies in these molecules.   In this
              project, a collection apparatus will be constructed to measure the isotopic
              composition of carbon and oxygen in atmospheric carbon monoxide, with the goal
              of obtaining new information on its global atmospheric budget. Routine
              measurements will be initiated in conjunction with the ongoing isotopic
              analysis programs for carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and ozone, including
              measurements of the concentrations of all species. Future activities will
              include the analysis of samples taken by balloon and rocket instruments.
