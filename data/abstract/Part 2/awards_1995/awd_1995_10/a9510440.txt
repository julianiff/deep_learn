Abstract    :
              9510440  Ravelo       This project will test the hypothesis that there are 
              nonlinear linkages between tropical solar insolation and high-  latitude
              glaciation resulting in climate variations on the 10,000-  year time scale. 
              Two time periods will be examined with the same  solar forcing, but different
              levels of glaciation, in order to  compare effects of these two boundary
              conditions.  The study may  provide a crucial insight into the controls on
              global climate  change.  ***
