Abstract    :
              9510680  Phillips    This theoretical research is co-funded by the Chemistry 
              Division and the Division of Materials Research.  The focus  is on electron
              transport in organic metals.  In particular,  the following systems will be
              studied:  the magnetic and  transport properties of organic porphyrin
              conductors; the  temperature dependence of the conductivity in potassium- 
              containing electrides; and, the construction of a room-  temperature single
              electron transistor using carbon-sixty.  %%%  This interdisciplinary
              theoretical research project is  funded by the Chemistry and Materials Research
              Divisions.  The focus is on electron transport in organic metals.  The 
              properties of these materials requires an interdisciplinary  approach for which
              the prinicipal investigator is uniquely  qualified.  Successful completion of
              this research will  contribute to the design of new classes of materials for 
              electroactive applications.  ***
