Abstract    :
              9510738  Coakley    Abstract    This award provides funds for a workshop to
              address the scientific potential of a nuclear  submarine as a geophysical
              research platform in the Arctic Ocean.  Use of a US Navy  nuclear submarine for
              civilian (unclassified) scientific research in the Arctic Ocean has  been made
              possible through a Memorandum of Understanding between the US Navy,  the Office
              of Naval Research, the National Science Foundation, the US Geological  Survey,
              and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.  The general 
              concept of using a submarine platform for marine geophysical work is intriguing
              and  there is clearly enough potential to warrant serious consideration.  The
              first step in  consideration of a possible cruise dedicated to geophysics is to
              determine the sort of  geophysical work that is achievable from a submarine and
              if the specific scientific  problems that might be addressed are important
              enough to encourage the research  community to submit proposals for
              consideration by the Foundation.  Essentially, the  potential role of a nuclear
              submarine in Arctic Ocean geophysical investigations must be  determined.  This
              workshop will address this issue and provide their recommendations to  the
              Foundation.
