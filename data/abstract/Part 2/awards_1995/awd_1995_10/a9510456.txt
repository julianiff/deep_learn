Abstract    :
              9510456  Zhang   This research aims to prove the concept of rapid development of
              manufacturing  planning software by building a prototype infrastructure for
              modular computer-aided process planning  (CAPP) systems.  Data will be
              collected from industry through the collaboration of NIST and industry  during
              an internship at NIST.  Two modules of the CAPP system, process
              selection/sequencing and  intermediate machining tolerance allocation, will be
              developed and integrated with the infrastructure  of rapid development of
              manufacturing planning software proposed by NIST researchers.  The NIST 
              contribution will be to build an open software object library, functional and
              data requirement  specification mechanisms, a knowledge-based mapping
              mechanism, an automated object composition  mechanism, and automated software
              validation procedures.   Software systems play a key role in the implementation
              of an agile manufacturing concept.  However, it is difficult to modify existing
              manufacturing application software systems to suit a user's dynamic needs, so
              currently available software systems are not useful for agile manufacturing. 
              This research should result in a general framework as well as specific methods
              that the manufacturing application software industry can use in developing the
              next generation of manufacturing planning software for agile manufacturing.
