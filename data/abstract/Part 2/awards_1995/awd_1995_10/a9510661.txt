Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program is a new grant to Professor Harry
              Dorn of  Virginia Polytechnic Institute. The objectives are to prepare and
              characterize large fullerenes and  metallofullerenes. Through the use of
              various magnetically active nuclei and the technique of  Dynamic Nuclear
              Polarization, the principle investigator will characterize a novel group of
              large  fullerenes with endohedral and exohedral metals. These unique
              hydrocarbon systems are reported  to have relevance in applications such as
              nonlinear optics and high temperature  superconductivity.  Studies such as
              those funded in this grant will enhance the understanding of  nuclear-electron
              interactions in these interesting molecules which is germane to both of the
              above  mentioned scientific areas.      The investigation of novel materials
              which have reported properties of value to optical and  magnetic systems will
              serve the public sector very well. This proposal is such an investigation. 
              These types of complexes are reported to have promise in the areas of nonlinear
              optics and high  temperature superconductivity. A detailed plan to prepare and
              characterize these unique  complexes is well thought out and described by the
              principal investigator.
