Abstract    :
              Studies of state environmental policy, with few exceptions, have concentrated on
              state implementation of federal mandates and have ignored state environmental
              policy innovations.  This research seeks to explain variations in state
              environmental policy innovation.     State policy innovations from 1980 to 1993
              in four environmental policy areas will be examined:  hazardous waste,
              groundwater protection, air pollution, and solid waste recycling.  Critical
              theoretical propositions derived from the literature on policy innovation and
              diffusion will be systematically tested.   Data drawn from a fifty state survey
              of state administrative officials as well as from interviews with federal EPA
              officers will be used to test the importance of policy networks and
              entrepreneurs, regional determinants, and federal involvement.  A content
              analysis of congressional hearings on existing federal environmental laws will
              also inform the analysis.
