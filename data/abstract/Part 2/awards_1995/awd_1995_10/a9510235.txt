Abstract    :
              9510235  Raufaste  This  award provides continuing support for the U.S.\Japan 
              Panel  on  Wind  and Seismic Effects which was established  in  1968  to 
              further  collaborative efforts between the  two  countries.   The  panel  
              develops   knowledge   and  technologies   that   advance  engineering  design 
              and construction practices.   The  panel  is  comprised  of  18 Federal
              agencies who participate  in  ten  task  committees.   The  task  committees
              focus  on  specific  national  issues,  e.g.,  passive and active control 
              systems;  repair  and  retrofit  of structures; and wind and earthquake
              engineering  for  offshore structures.  Annual meetings alternate between Japan
              and  the U.S.  ***
