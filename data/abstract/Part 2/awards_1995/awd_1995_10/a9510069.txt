Abstract    :
              This project involves the dissertation research of a student of demographic
              anthropology from Johns Hopkins University.  The project studies the
              connections between gender, and reproduction by comparing the experiences of
              recent Mexican immigrant women in Atlanta, GA and a similar group of women
              living still in their town of origin in Mexico.  Differences in patterns of
              contraceptive use and sexually transmitted disease (STD) prevention will be
              studied in relation to the broad differences in social and cultural context. 
              Using ethnographic techniques of in-depth interviews and participant
              observation the student will examine the reproductive and disease histories of
              a small sample of women in Atlanta for six months, then repeat the study in the
              village in Mexico for another six months.  Then a survey will be designed to be
              administered to a larger population in both sites, to test hypotheses about
              causes of variations in contraceptive use and STD prevention.  This study will
              advance discussions about the nature of transitional communities, and the
              social construction of gender.  The knowledge to be gained will be very
              important to planners concerned with population growth and with STD prevention,
              as the combination of in-depth ethnography and extensive surveys will produce
              an understanding of patterns of variation in fertility and disease that will be
              valid and representative for this population.
