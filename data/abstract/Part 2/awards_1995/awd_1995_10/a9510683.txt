Abstract    :
                    9510683  Peterson  This GOALI (Graduate Student Industrial Fellowship)
              award is made  to evaluate a new technique for obtaining the velocity of an 
              ultrasonic wave in concrete.  Due to the low signal to noise ratio  in oncrete,
              the conventional ultrasonic analysis methods are  frequently inadequate.  The
              use of wavelet decomposition of the  ultrasonic signal may provide more details
              on the dispersion  characteristics and thereby improved time of flight data.
