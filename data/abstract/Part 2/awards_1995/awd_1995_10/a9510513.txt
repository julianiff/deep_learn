Abstract    :
              9510513 Olson  This work is supported by a Research Planning  Grant for Women 
              Scientists and Engineers Award. The purpose of  the proposed  research is to
              shed light on the behavior of  mixtures of materials,  particularly in cases
              where anisotropy or  nonlinear behavior plays  an important role. Effective
              medium  theories and the self-consistent  approximations have been 
              successfully used to pridict behavior of  mixtures in linear and  isotropic
              situations. New approximations are  proposed which  circumvent some of the
              drawbacks of the effective  medium  theories. An average energy approach rather
              than an  average  stress approach will be used.   The National Science
              Foundations  mandate to ensure the vitality of  the Nations scientific 
              enterprise includes concern for the quality,  composition,  distribution and
              effectiveness of the human resource  base in  science and engineering.  Within
              this context, the Foundation  is  committed to enhancing the current rate of
              participation of women   in science and engineering careers, in general, and as
              active   participants in all of its programs.  Research Planning Grant  awards 
              are made: (1) to help increase the number of new women   investigators
              participating in NSFs research programs; and, (2)  to  facilitate preliminary
              studies and other activities related  to the  development of competitive
              research projeats and  proposals by  women who have not previously had
              independent  Federal research  funding.  Research Planning Grants are one-time 
              awards that may be  used for preliminary work to determine the  feasibility of
              a proposed  line of inquiry, and/or for other  activities that will facilitate
              proposal  development.
