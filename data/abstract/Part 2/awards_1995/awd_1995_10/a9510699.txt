Abstract    :
              DMR-9510699  Heiman    Strongly correlated two dimensional electron states based
              on gallium arsenide are  investigated in high magnetic fields using steady
              state and time-resolved optical  techniques and low temperatures. 
              Investigations of interest include study of the  incompressible quantum liquid
              without perturbation by  valence band holes, study of  the electron solid as
              well as composite fermions, and the study of quasi-three  dimensional electron
              systems with wide parabolic quantum wells.  %%%  Electron states confined to
              the interfaces of semiconductors exhibit unusual properties  when investigated
              under conditions of very low cryogenic temperatures and ultra high  magnetic
              fields.  These systems have revealed new and completely unexpected behavior and
               continued studies are likely to yield further insights into the properties of
              highly  correlated electron systems.  Measurement of such properties is of
              intrinsic scientific  interest but also holds the promise for discovery of
              novel technological applications.  The current investigations coordinate the
              strengths of powerful optical characterization  techniques at ultra low
              temperatures with state-of-the-art semiconductor materials  preparation.
