Abstract    :
                   This project is for Collaborative Research at Undergraduate Institutions,
              involving evolutionary and developmental biology, mathematics and computer
              sciences.  One of the fundamental questions in biology is how variation in form
              arises from a general pattern common to a group of closely related species. 
              Although a lot of descriptive detail is available about changes in shape and
              size of an animal during embryonic development, we lack precise and
              quantitative descriptions for irregular biological forms.  This
              multidisciplinary approach will use new imaging technology ald recent advances
              in geometrical theory to establish some novel mathematical equations to
              characterize how the shape of a complex structure develops and evolves.  The
              quantification of sizes and shapes of musculoskeletal structures in amphibians
              will be used to compare features at different times during development, and to
              compare features in evolutionarily related groups.  The project brings together
              faculty and students from biology and computer science.  Results will be
              important in interpreting how variation in timing of developmental events can
              be a mechanism for evolutionary change.  This work has a potentially major
              impact on developmental and evolutionary biology, and promises a novel
              cross-disciplinary experience involving undergraduates in exciting research.
