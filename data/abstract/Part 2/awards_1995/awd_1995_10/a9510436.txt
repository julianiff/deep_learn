Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT    By interagency agreement the U.S. Navy/NOAA Joint Ice Center will
              provide the management structure and coordination necessary to establish and
              maintain a network of drifting meteorological buoys in the Arctic.  The buoys
              will be emplaced at a sufficient spatial resolution and longevity to define
              surface synoptic scale atmospheric pressure, air temperature, and sea ice
              fields.  The data will be made available in real time for operational weather
              forecasting and will be used by researchers for studying global change in the
              climatically-sensitive Arctic.  ??
