Abstract    :
              9510916  Jones    The emergence of the R&D-based endogenous growth literature
              has led to an overlap between the macro growth literature and a micro
              literature on the economics of research and development.  Papers in each of
              these literature's have documented a number of distortions in the allocation of
              resources to R&D that may arise, often focusing on one or two of these
              distortions for illustrative purposes.  The contribution of this CAREER project
              is to incorporate several of these distortions into a single general
              equilibrium model and to analyze their effects empirically.  The project
              provides a coherent framework for thinking about these distortions and
              estimating their net impact on R&D.  It will focus on four key distortions in
              the allocation of resources to R&D: a monopoly markup effect, a knowledge
              spillover effort ("standing on shoulders"), a creative destruction effect, and
              a patent race effect ("stepping on toes").      The Education Plan consists of
              the development of an undergraduate research seminar for exploring the broad
              implications of the R&D-based growth model.  The seminar will be used to
              provide qualitative evidence to complement the formal statistical analysis in
              the Research Plan.  The initial part of the research seminar will highlight the
              lessons of old and new growth theory.  After discussing the subtleties
              associated with testing the R&D based models, the investigator will explore the
              historical analysis of technology and growth and the qualitative literature on
              population and economic growth.
