Abstract    :
              9510189  Storm            This award from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program   provides funds to enable attendance of the 1995 Gordon   Conference
              on Analytical Chemistry by assistant professors at   the beginning of their
              careers and by a special group of   graduate students who have won
              highly-competitive one-year   fellowships for their research in analytical
              chemistry.  The   conference theme, analytical chemistry in small domains, is 
              an extremely important one from both academic and practical  points of view. 
              For example, obtaining data concerning the   chemical composition of the
              boundary layer between two parts of   an electronic microcircuit is a
              formidable research challenge,   but is of utmost importance in understanding
              the action of the   circuit and improving its performance.
