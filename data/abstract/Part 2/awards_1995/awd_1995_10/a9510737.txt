Abstract    :
              9510737  Wilson    Abstract    This award is for an international Travel Grant
              to allow  participation by US researchers in the 7th International  Symposium
              on Antarctic Earth Sciences.  The Symposium will  be held in Siena, Italy, in
              September 1995.  It is convened  under the auspices of the Scientific Committee
              on Antarctic  Research and will be hosted by the University of Siena.  The  US,
              through the Office of Polar Programs at the National  Science Foundation,
              maintains a strong research program in  Antarctic earth sciences. 
              Representation in this meeting is  in the best interests of both the US
              research community and  the US Antarctic Program's Polar Earth Sciences
              Program.  This meeting is one of the few opportunities for the  international
              earth sciences research community to focus on  research problems in Antarctic
              earth sciences and to share  information about recent progress in Antarctic
              earth  sciences.  This meeting has historically been an excellent  venue for
              exchange of scientific information and it has led  to new lines of research and
              new collaborations.  Furthermore, the Antarctic Treaty requires each member 
              nation to share and disseminate information resulting from  Antarctic research
              activities.  Participation of US  researchers in this meeting is a meaningful
              way to meet this  requirement of the Antarctic Treaty.
