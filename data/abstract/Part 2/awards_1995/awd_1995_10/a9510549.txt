                 "1995 Gordon Research Conference on High Temperature Corrosion, July 16-21,
              New London, NH"    The Conference will be held on July 16-21, 1995 at Colby
              Sawyer College in New London, New Hampshire.   This conference is focused on
              recent advances in understanding the fundamentals of oxidation/corrosion of
              oxidation-resistant alloys and ceramics, with emphasis on their role in
              high-temperature applications.  Individual sessions are:  corrosion aspects of
              solid oxide fuel cells;  catastrophic corrosion at intermediate temperatures; 
              stress effects in oxidation;  integrity of the scale/metal interface;  thermal
              barrier coatings:  applications and degradation resistance;  oxidation of
              multiphase alloys;  design of laboratory experiments for industrial
              applications;  and contrasting aspects of silica-forming materials.  NSF
              support is directed toward young scientists and students.  %%%  This conference
              has values to the application of materials used at high temperatures such as
              gas turbines and reactors.  Discussions on protection of corrosion with
              carbon-containing gasses, sulphur- and chlorine- containing gases at
              intermediate temperatures, and  the ceramic coating that is influenced by high
              temperature will be very useful in the industry.  The fundamental principle of
              growth and relief of stress on scale, scale-metal interface, oxidation of
              multiphase alloys, and protection of silicon and silicon carbide ceramics will
              be very important in understanding the phenomena of the developing technology
              in corrosion protection.  ***
