Abstract    :
              9510553  Williams    This doctoral dissertation research project investigates
              the  causes and implications of the distribution of land use "bads"  through
              zoning in cities.  "Bads" are defined as land uses that  produce negative
              spillovers to surrounding property.  Using data  from cincinnati, Columbus,
              Indianapolis, and Milwaukee, the  project investigates the effects of electoral
              institutions on the  distribution of land use bads and the politics of 
              bureaucratic/legislative relations between the planning  department and city
              council in distributing these policy outputs.   The research also explores the
              efficiency implications of the  distribution of land use bads.  Efficiency of
              bad siting patterns  is measured in two ways--the effect of bad siting patterns
              on  property values, and the effect of bad siting patterns on the  supply of
              public goods.    This study is innovative and contributes to a larger theory of
               public policy distribution in two respects.  First, it examines  the
              distribution of bads instead of the more often-studied goods.   Second, by
              studying distribution in cities, it is possible to  take advantage of
              institutional variation that does not exist in  the study of distribution in
              the United States Congress, where  institutional structures are fixed.  ***
