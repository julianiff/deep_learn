Abstract    :
              Karen Lewis  University of Pennsylvania  SBR-9510879     This proposal will
              explore an important puzzle in international finance, namely why domestic
              residents do not diversify sufficiently into foreign assets to optimally
              risk-share. The proposal consists of three projects. The first project examines
              consumption comovements and will test for whether they can be accounted for by
              non-separabilities in the utility function.  The second project will test
              whether there are market restrictions on international risk-sharing by
              re-examining the consumption comovements allowing for market restrictions
              (e.g., foreign exchange restrictions, defaults or interest arrears on
              international loans).  The third project will attempt to measure the welfare
              loss from incomplete international risk-sharing using data on consumption,
              equity returns, and capital market restrictions.  The project will result in
              two new data sets: panel data on consumption disaggregated by
              durable/non-durable and tradable/non-tradable and panel data on various
              measures of capital market restrictions.
