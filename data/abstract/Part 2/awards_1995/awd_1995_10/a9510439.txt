Abstract    :
              9510439  Plano       This is a proposal from two members of the faculty in  the
              physics department at Rutgers to continue their research  in the analysis of
              polarized Z decays using the SLD detector  and the linear electron collider at
              SLAC.  The accelerator  has achieved a 80% polarization of the electron beam
              and the  stated plan is to collect 500,000 Z decays over the next  several
              years.  This will allow the SLD group to make what  is expected to be the
              world's most accurate measurement of  the Weinberg Angle by a technique which
              is different from  that at LEP.  The difference between the measurements at the
               two accelerators will be an important measure of the  radiative corrections in
              the standard model.  The  polarization of the Z will also allow them to make 
              significant measurements of Bs mixing.  The group has joined  the BABAR
              collaboration to study CP violation at SLAC  following at SLAC following the
              conclusion of the SLD  program.  ***
