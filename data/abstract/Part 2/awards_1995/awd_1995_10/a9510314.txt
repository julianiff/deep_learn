Abstract    :
              9510314  Grady    Peptide hormones bind to their receptors on the cell surface,
              and  induce diverse activities including secretion, muscle contraction,  and
              growth.  Cells rapidly alter their ability to respond to a  given peptide. 
              This study examines processes that alter the  ability of a cell to respond to
              one peptide hormone, gastrin  releasing peptide.  This peptide is interesting
              since tumor cells  secrete this hormone, and grow in response to it.  Thus, 
              information gained my help develop new cancer therapies.  The  principal
              investigator has shown that binding of gastrin releasing  peptide to its
              receptor causes both the hormone and its receptor to  move into the cell, or
              internalize.  The receptor gradually returns  to the cell surface, a process
              called recycling.  Now, the  principal investigator is studying these processes
              in cells that  grow in response to gastrin releasing peptide.  The
              intracellular  location of the receptor is being determined by microscopy,
              using  fluorescent peptides and antibodies.  How internalization and  recycling
              occur is being studied using drugs that block cellular  processes, such as
              protein synthesis.  The role of internalization  in changing the ability of a
              cell to respond to gastrin releasing  peptide is being studied by using (1)
              agents that block this  process, and (2) cells that have mutant receptors that
              cannot  internalize, and testing the ability to bind and signal with  gastrin
              releasing peptide.  Finally, the ability of drugs that  block these processes
              to alter the growth response to gastrin  releasing peptide is being determined.
