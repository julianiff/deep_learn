Abstract    :
              DMS-9510608  PI: Salamanca Riba    Salamanca Riba will investigate the relation
              between certain irreducible unitary Harish-Chandra modules for a group and
              Zuckerman functor modules derived from a one dimensional unitary representation
              of a subgroup.  She will also consider the problem of classifying all genuine
              unitary representations of the metaplectic group.  In particular, she will
              consider the Adams-Barbasch correspondence between these representations and a
              set of unitary representations of certain inner forms of the metaplectic group
              and determine if the representations go to Zuckerman functor modules under this
              map.      The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian
              mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in twentieth century
              mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the symmetries
              inherent in a system, the representation theory of Lie groups has had a
              profound impact upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number
              theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and
              elementary particle physics.
