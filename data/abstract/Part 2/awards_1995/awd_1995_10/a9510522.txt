Abstract    :
              History offers two contrasting lessons on the linkage between democratic
              continuity and the advocacy of racist ideology.  First, the general defense of
              democracy requires that democratic governments embrace strong,  effective,
              legal means to confine the contagion of racism.  Second, the surest means for
              the survival of democracy is through the vigorous defense of the principle of
              free expression.     Which of these lessons is the truest account of the
              resiliency of democracy to racist ideologies?  To date there has been no
              scientific analysis of the comparative effectiveness of different legal
              standards in terms of their ability to diminish discriminatory behavior and to
              secure an appropriate range of democratic rights for individuals and groups. 
              This research compares the responses of French and United States citizens to
              hateful speech, and to the legal conditions that would permit or prohibit such
              expression.  Survey based experiments as well as focus groups will be conducted
              in these two countries.
