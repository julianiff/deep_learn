Abstract    :
              9510042  Johnson         The large lakes of the East African Rift Valley are
              among the  oldest on Earth, and are vital resources for the indigenous people 
              populating their basins.  They are unique among the large lakes of  the world
              in terms of their sensitivity to climatic change, their  rich and diverse
              populations of endemic species, their circulation  dynamics and water-column
              chemistry, and their long, continuous,  high-resolution records of past
              climatic change in the tropics.         A comprehensive study of the large
              African lakes is long  overdue.  Societal need for the sustainable utilization
              of these  important natural resources offers a compelling reason for 
              examination of biological food webs, water quality and past climate 
              variability in East Africa.  These scientific and societal issues  have
              stimulated the initiation of the International Decade for the  East African
              Lakes (IDEAL).  The scientific issues to be addressed  by IDEAL were conceived
              and discussed at the IDEAL Symposium on the  Limnology, Climatology and
              Paleoclimatology of the East African  Lakes, held in Jinja, Uganda, February
              18-22, 1993.   Recommendations from this meeting resulted in the publication of
               the IDEAL Science and Implementation Plan.         This award provides funds
              for further planning, logistical  management and workshops for the paleoclimate
              initiative within  IDEAL.  Funds will be used for meetings of the American
              Steering  Committee of IDEAL, coordination between the paleoclimate community 
              and the other scientific and training initiatives within IDEAL, and 
              coordination with European and African components of IDEAL.  ***
