Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  U of Cal San Diego  Joe D. Godard  CTS-9510122      The proposal is to
              partially support an intensive two-day workshop on Material Instabilities in
              the Fall of 1995. The workshop will bring together established experts to
              discuss basic ideas and summarize recent theoretical and experimental advances
              in the field.  The workshop will cover solid metals and polymers, granular
              media and particulate suspensions, and viscoelastic polymer solutions and
              melts.  The meeting will be just prior to the Society of Rheology Conference to
              assure wide interest and increase attendance by interested researchers.
