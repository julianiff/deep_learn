Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9510575    This joint effort between the University of California
              at Berkeley, Exxon Corporation and the Metropolitan Autonomous University at
              Iztapalapa, Mexico, involves the synthesis and characterization of solid
              "superacids" based on tungsten oxide dispersed as isolated species, clusters,
              or films on the surface of zirconia or titania.  Previous work has shown that
              tungsten oxide on zirconia has catalytic activity for isomerization of higher
              alkanes without the cracking caused by other "superacids".  In order to improve
              the catalytic activity, higher surface areas are desirable.  This work includes
              detailed study of the solid-state processes involved in the precipitation of
              high-surface-area zirconium and titanium oxides and in the dispersion of
              tungstate groups on their surfaces.  Structural studies are performed using
              X-ray diffraction and absorption techniques, electron microscopy, and infrared
              and Raman spectroscopies;  acid-site densities and chemistry are probed using
              site titrations and catalytic reactions of propylene and dimethylcyclohexane. 
              These studies are complemented with mechanistic studies using in-situ  infrared
              spectroscopy and isotope jump techniques.    Branched alkanes have great value
              as octane enhancers in gasoline, lubricant components, and chemical feedstocks.
               Traditionally, these have been made using one of  several processes employing
              liquid acids, but it is generally accepted that these processes will soon be
              replaced by new processes using solid acids.  Among the advantages sought in
              this move are easier containment, less corrosiveness, environmental benignity,
              and improved selectivity.    This effort is supported jointly by the Chemical
              Reaction Processes Program (CTS), the Solid State Chemistry and Polymers
              Program (DMR), and the Americans Program (INT).    ***
