Abstract    :
              9510422  Peluso  This research examines the local consequences of extralocal
              resource management agendas and the historical roots of conflict between local
              user groups in Danau Sentarum, West Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo.  The Danau
              Sentarum area is, under Indonesian law, a wildlife reserve that officially
              contains no legal human settlement.  In fact, however, best estimates number
              the permanent residents of the region at 3,000-4,000, and this number is
              growing.  These residents depend upon fish, forest products, and game, the very
              resources the internationally-funded wildlife reserve project is intended to
              protect.  In addition, the area is important nationally for timber and fish
              production and for maintaining hydrologic processes, especially the buffering
              of downstream flooding.  Thus the region is at the intersection of the
              interests of numerous local, regional, national, and international groups.  In
              this setting, the research will focus on (1) how rules for allocation and
              management of fish resources have been developed, (2) why villages with similar
              cultural traditions and in similar ecological contexts differ in the resource
              management rules they develop, (3) how the increased pressure on the resources
              has affected the dynamics of the region's social networks, (4) what new
              resources management practices have emerged under conditions of increased
              resource scarcity and incongruent rule systems, and (5) what effect have these
              new practices had.  %%%%  This research examines the local consequences of
