Abstract    :
              ***  Trower  9510000         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              project will optimize the scintillation characteristics of cerium-doped yttrium
              aluminum perovskite (YAP) by perfecting the firm's horizontal crystallization
              technology with which it is produced.  This optimization will continue
              phenomenological efforts to model the scintillation processes in rare
              earth-doped complex single crystal oxide scintillators.  Concurrently,
              prototype YAP detectors systems will be developed for two nuclear applications
              -- soft gamma-ray/x-ray spectroscopy with emphasis on Mossbauer measurements
              and for alpha-particle spectroscopy.       High quality YAP scintillators could
              be used in about 10% of sodium iodide applications.  Grain-based alpha-particle
              detectors have potential in high resolution alpha-particle spectroscopy.  Soft
              gamma-ray/x-ray detector systems have several spectroscopic applications
              particularly high-rate Mossbauer measurements.  ***
