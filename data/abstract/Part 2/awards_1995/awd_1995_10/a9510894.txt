Abstract    :
                The study of  the role of fathers in the evolution of the primate family has
              been severely  hampered by our ignorance of true paternity-offspring
              relationships.  Crucial assumptions about male reproductive strategies could
              not be tested.  Using modern molecular techniques, this project will establish
              paternities in an already intensively studied wild population of primates that
              inhabits natural forest in Sri Lanka.  The paternity data, combined with
              knowledge of matrilineal kinships, will provide pedigrees for about a half of
              the population of 30 social groups (more than 1,000 individuals).     Earlier
              research on primates point to a variety of traits (morphological and
              behavioral) to influence male lifetime reproductive success.  These include:
              social dominance rank, age, development and growth, group residency, maternal
              attributes, paternal care behavior, male transfer coalitions, and environment. 
              The interrelationships among these factors, and their influence on male
              lifetime reproductive success, will be examined by a series of related working
              hypotheses.    The research results will have broad relevance to current
              theories of primate social evolution, including  male as well as female
              life-histories, parental care and sex allocation.
