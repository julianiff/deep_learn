Abstract    :
              9510704  McMahon  The proposed research is in the Undergraduate Design Projects 
              Program category, and requests support for undergraduate and  graduate student
              engineers to provide prototype "custom designed"  devices and software to aid
              persons with disabilities.  The  primary goal of this thrust is to provide
              meaningful design  experience for the engineering student that will directly
              aid a  specific disabled individual. A formal program is in place at the 
              University of  Tennessee-Chattanooga which will ensure  satisfactory progress
              is attained on these projects.  A group of  students and the investigators on
              the grant will work with a  number of collaborating agencies and individuals on
              these  projects.  Fifty projects are planned during the five year  duration of
              this award, and a written report on the completed  projects will be submitted
              for an annual publication.    Once completed, each project will be given to the
              person for whom  it is designed.  The hope is that this "real world" experience
               will give engineering students a sense of purpose and pride, help  engineering
              schools serve the community, attract new students  into engineering, and raise
              student interest in graduate  education.    This type of undertaking is
              important since it provides a  meaningful experience for engineering students
              as part of their  undergraduate design requirements, and will also benefit a 
              population where customization is often needed for rehabilitation  devices.
