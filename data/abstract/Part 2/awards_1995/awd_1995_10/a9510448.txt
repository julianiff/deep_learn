Abstract    :
              9509595  Kitchell  Collaborative: Alternate States and Eaosystem Metabolism in
              Lakes: Interactions of Nutrients and DOC  Some lakes are blue, but most are
              green or brown.  We have learned a great deal about eutrophication, the process
              that turns lakes green and leads to nuisance blooms of algae.  Dystrophy, the
              process that turns lakes brown, is less understood but has important
              interactions with fisheries, gas flow to and from lakes, and cycling of metals
              such as mercury.  This project will study the interactions of biogeochemical
              inputs and food web structure that control dystrophy and eutrophy in lakes.  We
              will quantify conditions that lead to change in lake ecosystem state, and
              assess responses of ecosystem production, respiration, gas exchange, and energy
              sources for fish production.  This research is a collaborative study by
              limnologists, microbial ecologists, biogeochemists and fish ecologists.  We
              will conduct a three-year program of whole-lake experiments and modeling
              studies to find the mechanisms, response rates, and constraints associated
              shifts from eutrophy to dystrophy and vice-versa.    ??
