Abstract    :
                Austin-Smith   SBR 9510877      Despite extensive research devoted to the
              study of collective decision making, relatively little is known about the
              decision making under conditions of uncertainty.  In a world in which decision
              makers have the same fundamental preferences but operate in a situation where
              information is scarce and unequally shared, group members may disagree with
              respect to the available alternatives as a result of informational asymetries. 
              Under such conditions, the Condorcet Jury Theorem concludes:  majorities are
              more likely to select the "correct" alternative than any single individual when
              there is uncertainty about which alternative is in fact the best.    This
              proposal seeks funding to investigate the properties of the Condorcet Jury
              Theorem.  It will develop a theory of collective decision making under a
              judgment-based model of democracy.  Game theoretic analyses will help inform
              the strategic considerations under which the impact of the jury theorem can be
              assessed.  The crucial role played by information aggregation in conditions of
              uncertainty will be highlighted.
