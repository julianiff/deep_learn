Abstract    :
              9510113  Solow  This proposed effort will conduct a 4-week summer school
              workshop, the fourth in a series devoted to comparisons of marine, terrestrial
              and freshwater ecosystems, to focus on food web structure and dynamics. Food
              webs represent the feeding relationships between various types of organisms and
              are part of the core subject matter in ecology. Food web theory and data are
              crucial to dealing with many environmental issues of social importance; water
              quality, marine and freshwater fisheries, species conservation, global climate
              change, agroecosystems, and the movement of toxic materials. Three basic
              features of food webs are there structures, their dynamics, and their
              relationships to the physical and chemical environment. Although these features
              are still far from being understood, empirical and theoretical ecologists are
              rapidly building up a body of descriptive data and testable theory. The
              proposed course will include a series of lectures focused on the fundamental
              theory in each of these areas. This will provide a basis for more specialized
              lectures. These lectures will address other key issues, including indirect
              effects in food webs, differences between food webs in different types of
              environments, and the application of food web theory to a number of
              environmental problems in terrestrial, marine and freshwater ecosystems.
