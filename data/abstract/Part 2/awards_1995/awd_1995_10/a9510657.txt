Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division,
              Professor  Mark A. Johnson of Yale University will continue and extend his
              research in the  development of a general spectroscopy for anion-molecule
              complexes. Weakly bound  excited states of ion-molecule complexes of the type
              (X-).CH3Y  will be investigated by  high resolution spectroscopy to obtain
              structures of nucleophilic substitution reaction  intermediates.  For this
              purpose a pulsed field detachment method is to be developed  as  a general
              spectroscopic tool.  The goals of this research are the determination of the 
              equilibrium geometries of the complexes, to achieve selective excitation of the
              complexes  near the transition states for Walden inversion, to determine
              detailed reaction rates for  laser-triggered reactions and the measurement of
              product recoil kinetic energy distributions,  and to extend these methods to
              solvated reaction intermediates.  Molecular level reaction  theory is at the
              forefront of contemporary research in physical chemistry.  Reactions involve 
              excited electronic states of single molecules, ions, as well as of molecular
              and ion-molecule  complexes.  The transition state that lies between the
              reactants and the products is of prime  concern and this research is concerned
              with developing suitable methods for its  investigation.  The overall aim of
              this investigation is to obtain a better understanding of  reaction dynamics.
