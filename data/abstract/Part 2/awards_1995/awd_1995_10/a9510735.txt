Abstract    :
              9510735   Didier   The purpose od this research is to determine phylogenetic
              relationships among fossil and living chimaeroid fishes.   This research
              focuses on musculoskeletal features of the jaws, skull, gill arches, and
              dentition. The analysis will examine 29 living taxa, plus a presently unknown
              number of unidentified species, and 9 fossil taxa of chimaeroids in addition to
              two outgroup tax, one shark and one skate. Data is obtained using a variety of
              morphological preparations including dissection, skeletal preparation, cleaning
              and staining, and histology. Morphological characters are analyzed and scored
              in living and fossil taxa, and phylogenies generated and analyzed using the
              computer algorithm PAUP (Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony).  %%%   The
              synthesis of morphological and paleontological information is the first species
              level phylogenetic analysis of this lineage. The description of at least 10 new
              species and a long overdue taxonomic revision of chimaeroid fishes are two
              important results of this work. Within this phylogenetic context, the discovery
              of new suites of characters related to jaw, skull and gill arch morphology will
              contribute important baseline anatomical information towards understanding the
              evolution and radiation of jaw suspensory mechanisms among early vertebrates.
