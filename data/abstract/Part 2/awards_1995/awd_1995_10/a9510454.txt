Abstract    :
                      9510454  Uemura    Muon  spin relaxation (muSR) measurements are
              proposed to study ground  state  properties  and  spin fluctuations in
              geometrically  frustrated  spin  systems,  such  as  the Kagome lattice  and 
              triangular  lattice  antiferromagnets strontium chromium (x) gallium (12-x)
              oxygen (19) and  lithium nickel oxygen (2), as well as in low-dimensional spin
              systems,  including  the doped Haldane spin chain system (yttrium, calcium) 
              (2)  barium  nickel  oxygen  (5), the spin-Peierls  system  (copper,  zinc) 
              germanium  oxygen (3), the one-dimensional organic conductor  aluminum  carbon 
              (60),  and  the spin-ladder cuprates, strontium  (n-1)  copper  (n+1)  oxygen
              (2n).  This proposal aims to reveal details of suggested  spin-liquid  ground 
              states as well as to  elucidate  the  process  of  destruction  of  the 
              many-body  singlet  ground  state  due  to   the  introduction  of 
              imperfections or doped charge  carriers.   The  muSR  experiments  will  be
              performed at the TRIUMF facility  in  Vancouver,  Canada.  %%%  Certain
              configurations of atomic arrangements in solids, such  as  the  triangular  or 
              Kagome lattice, tend to prevent the alignment  of  the  magnetic  moments  of 
              the  atoms  placed  on  it,  promoting  dynamic  fluctuations of the moments
              (spins).  Similarly, magnetic ordering  is  suppressed in low-dimensional
              arrangements of spins, such as  a  chain  of  magnetic  moments.  In these
              systems, novel magnetic  behavior  is  expected  at  low  temperatures,
              including  the  possibility  for  the  occurrence  of a "quantum spin liquid",
              which is a disordered  liquid-  like  dynamic state of the moments due to
              quantum-mechanical  effects.  This  proposal  aims  to  reveal the nature of 
              such  exotic  magnetic  behavior  by  utilizing a novel technique called muon
              spin  relaxation  (muSR),  which  probes  the magnetism within solids  with 
              radioactive  elementary  particles,  muons, produced  at  a  high-intensity 
              proton  accelerator (the TRIUMF facility in Vancouver , Canada).
