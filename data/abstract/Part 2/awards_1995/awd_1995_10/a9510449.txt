Abstract    :
              9510449  Looze    This proposal is in response to the Grant Opportunities for 
              Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) program.  The goal of the  proposed
              project is to provide the opportunity for the Principal  Investigator and a
              graduate student to closely work with Adaptive  Optics Associates (including
              on-site interaction and laboratory  work with technical staff members) to
              develop, test and implement  control algorithms for an adaptive optics system
              for astronomy.   This will be the first operational adaptive optics system
              outside  the U.S. Air Force.  The development of control algorithms for  the
              adaptive optics system will require applying modern  multivariable control
              techniques to a large dimensional (97  inputs, 240 outputs, and as many as 300
              plant states), practical  problem which exhibits significant uncertainties and 
              nonlinearities.  In addition, implementation issues such as the  computational
              time for the control algorithm and continued  operation when measurements are
              degraded or missing must be  considered.  Thus, this is an opportunity to test
              multivariable  control system identification, analysis and design techniques on
               a large, real problem.  In accordance with the guidelines of this  program,
              Adaptive Optics Associates  has made a commitment of  $10,000 (non-federal
              funds) to support this effort.  ***
