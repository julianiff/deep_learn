Abstract    :
              Corbett  9510278    Synthetic explorations will be pursued for novel materials 
              among the metal-rich halides and chalcogenides of the early  transition metals
              and the physical characterization of these  materials. The studies will feature
              the unique group of  highly reduced compounds in which metal cluster and 
              condensed cluster phases are stabilized by strongly bound,  interstitial
              elements. The cluster hosts will include  scandium, yttrium and the
              lanthanides, the halides will be  chlorine, bromine and iodine, the
              chalcogenides sulfur,  selenium and tellurium. The interstitials in halides
              will  feature the transition metals. Further characterization of  the
              apparently metallic lanthanides-based compounds and of  the nature of their
              electronic and magnetic transitions will  be emphasized together with searches
              for other phases  showing unusual properties and new structures and bonding. 
              Physical properties of interesting phases will be defined by  crystal
              structure, conductivity, magnetic susceptibility,  and photoelectron
              spectroscopic measurements and augmented  by extended-Huckel (band)
              calculations. Particular emphasis  will be given to the nature of the bonding
              and the physical  properties and to new horizons in solid state chemistry.  %%%
               The need for new materials is well recognized. The long  range objectives of
              the present program are to expand the  boundaries of what is possible in the
              solid state, to  understand and conceptualize the results as to stability, 
              structure, bonding and properties and, ultimately, to  provide sufficient
              information and experience to allow some  systemization and reasonable
              predictions. Several new and  exciting directions are proposed. The new
              emphases include  binary, ternary and quaternary (interstitial) compounds of 
              lanthanum, an element that has been investigated very little  but which appears
              to exhibit some distinctive and remarkable  compounds  ***
