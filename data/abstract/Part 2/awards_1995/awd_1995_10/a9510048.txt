Abstract    :
              9510048  Langdon       Past CO2 level have often been estimated from 13-C levels
              of  marine organisms.  But these values are also affected by species  growth,
              and pH and temperature of the ocean water.  The  investigators will test the
              importance of CO2 availability, pH,  growth rate and temperature on C-isotopic
              fractionation by  individual cultures of marine algae, representing major 
              phytoplankton groups in today's oceans.  ***
