Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the  NMR spectroscopic
              studies of Professor Pochapsky at  Brandeis University. The studies focus on
              the characterization  of closed-shell ion pairs and ionic aggregates. The
              research on  chiral and achiral ammonium cations with borohydride and  chloride
              anions concentrates on the structures of ion-pairs, the  effect of ion pairing
              on chemical reactivity, and dynamic  self-assembling systems. The design of
              improved  stereo-selectivity in phase-transfer catalysis is targeted. A  broad
              spectrum of advanced NMR techniques will be used in  conjunction with molecular
              modeling techniques and  vibrational spectroscopy to illucidate the structural
              and  dynamic properties of ion-pairs.    In this spectroscopic project Dr.
              Pochapsky uses nuclear  magnetic resonance techniques for the characterization
              of the  structures, reactivities, and dynamic behavior of ion-pairs and  ionic
              aggregates. These studies use chiral ammonium cations  and are valuable for the
              design of improved chiral recognition  in the important area of phase transfer
              catalysis. The combined  use of advanced spectroscopic techniques and molecular
               modeling is of further interest to the chemical community.
