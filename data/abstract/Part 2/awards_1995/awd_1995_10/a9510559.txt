Abstract    :
              Abstract  Nomura  CTS-9510559    The PI proposes to use this research planning
              grant to enhance her knowledge and experience in the area of Large Eddy
              Simulation (LES) and subgrid-scale modeling in order to better formulate an
              effective program aimed at the application of LES to the study of turbulent
              combustion.  Specific objectives include: (1) determination of the current
              state of development of LES for reactive flows, (2) initiation of a development
              effort in subgrid modeling, and (3) the preliminary assessment of the use of
              LES to combustion applications.  A major effort will be expended toward the
              development of effective subgrid-scale models describing scalar mixing and
              reaction.  To this end Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) will be used in the
              model development by providing a database with which to compare and verify the
              subgrid models.  DNS capabilities will be extended to include nonequilibrium
              chemistry and will be carried out with and without chemical energy release
              taking place.  Where possible LES will be applied to large scale "practical"
              problems and comparisons will be made with existing experimental data.
