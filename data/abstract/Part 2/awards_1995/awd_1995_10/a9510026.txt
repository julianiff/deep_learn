Abstract    :
              9510026  Rice      The Department of Geological Sciences at the University of
              Oregon  will upgrade their present Cameca SX-50 electron probe  microanalyzer
              (EPMA). This instrument forms the core of their  analytical facilities and is
              crucial for research currently being  conducted by nearly half of their
              department.  The upgrade will  include the purchase of a SUN SPARCstation 5 as
              part as part of a  "SXPACK" upgrade offered though Cameca, image processing
              software  and two x-ray diffracting pseudocrystals used for the precise 
              analysis of light elements.  The SUN computer will replace a DEC  PDP-11
              minicomputer that is at the end of its useful life, and  more importantly is no
              longer supported in terms of software  development.  Without this upgrade, the
              PI's scientific  creativity and productivity would be severely limited by an 
              antiquated computer system.  Additionallly, the SUN-based  computer system will
              provide a modern computing platform that is  fully compatible with existing
              machines on their network and will  enable access to recently developed
              software packages designed to  fully utilize the capabilities of the SX-50. 
              Recent advances in  pseudocrystal technology and analytical techniques have
              resulted  in the capability of analyzing elements in the range from boron  to
              oxygen with precision and accuracy approaching that commonly  associated with
              heavier elements. Ongoing and planned research  projects require relatively
              precise analyses of oxygen and boron  in a variety of bulk compositions.    ***
