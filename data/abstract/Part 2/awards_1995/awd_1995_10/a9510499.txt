Abstract    :
              Chris Jacobsen  ECS-9510499    The capabilities and applications of x-ray
              focusing will be developed through development of high resolution diffractive
              x-ray optics.  This work will be undertaken in an academic-industrial
              collaboration with Don Tennant of ATT Bell Laboratories (Holmdel).  ATT is now
              installing a JEOL JBX-6000FS electron beam lithography system with a field
              emission gun which is just the second of its kind to be delivered to the United
              States.  This system will be used to fabricate 20-30 nanometer resolution soft
              x-ray zone plates for microscopy, and diffractive optics for tests of extreme
              ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems for integrated circuit printing.  It will
              also be used to fabricate zone plates which will be used by Dr. Wen-Bing Yun of
              Argonne National Laboratory as x-ray lithography masks for the generation of
              thick zone plates for hard x-ray applications, such as fluorescence  microprobe
              studies.  The x-ray experiments will be  carried out using high brightness
              undulators at Brookhaven National Laboratory and at Argonne National
              Laboratory.
