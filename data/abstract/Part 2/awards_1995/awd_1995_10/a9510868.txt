Abstract    :
              The central analytic-theoretical task of the project is to  integrate the
              constraint-based core-periphery model of the  phonological lexicon into
              Optimality Theory (OT). Optimality  Theory deals with the interaction of
              phonological constraints  with each other and is built on the idea that
              constraints are  ranked and violable. Exploratory work on Japanese indicates
              that  developing the core-periphery model of the lexicon within OT not  only
              leads to a much improved understanding of lexical  organization and of the
              principles that give rise to it, but in  turn also makes a contribution to
              Optimality Theory itself, and  leads to many new empirical and theoretical
              issues.       These issues will be investigated through detailed empirical 
              analyses of the phonological lexica of particular languages (in  order to
              sharpen and test the details of the theory) and through  cross-language surveys
              (in order to secure the topological  validity of the predictions). The results
              of the project will be  reported in research articles and conference papers as
              they  become available; and the main empirical findings and theoretical 
              conclusions will be consolidated and summarized In a monograph at  the end of
              the project.
