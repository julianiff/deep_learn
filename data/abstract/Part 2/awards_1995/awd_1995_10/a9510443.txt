Abstract    :
              John Baldeschweiler is supported by a Small Grant for Exploratory   Research
              from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program and the   MPS Office
              of Multidisciplinary Activities to develop chemically   derivatized Scanning
              Tunneling Microscopy (STM) and Atomic Force   Microscopy (AFM) probe tips.  The
              goals of this research are to: 1) to   attach high-aspect adducts to the tip;
              and 2) to attach specific chemical   moieties.  At the present time users who
              want near-atomic resolution   depend essentially on luck to produce good tips. 
              The ability to attach   high-aspect adducts will make it possible to obtain
              near-atomic   resolution reliably and reproducibly.  The ability to attach
              specific   chemical moieties would lead to a mechanism for chemical contrast.  
               Preliminary calculations indicate that an AFM has sufficient sensitivity   to
              detect an interaction weaker than a single hydrogen bond.  The development of
              nanotechnology requires the ability to create and   analyze structures with
              atomic precision.  However, in order for   nanotechnology to become a reality,
              the ability to image and analyze   materials on the atomic scale is essential.
              STM and AFM have already   generated striking results in material science,
              chemistry and biology.    The ability to image the effects of nanomanipulation
              reliably will depend   on the development of reproducibly high-aspect tips, and
              the development   of chemical contrast mechanisms.
