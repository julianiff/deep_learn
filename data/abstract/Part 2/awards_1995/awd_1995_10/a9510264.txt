Abstract    :
              The proposed project focuses on the detection of lightning flashes  above
              mesoscale convective systems routinely observed during the  summer in the high
              plains of the Midwest.  The investigation  entails the use of radio wave
              diagnostics to examine the production  of ionization patches (if any) in the
              stratosphere and mesosphere.   A three-week campaign is proposed for summer
              1995; the  experimentation period will be timed to take advantage of ground- 
              based optical diagnostics that will be in place for the detection  of sprites
              and blue jets.  If the proposed observing strategy is  effective, more complex
              diagnostic systems can be implemented to  precisely define the atmospheric
              physics involved in the optical  sightings.
