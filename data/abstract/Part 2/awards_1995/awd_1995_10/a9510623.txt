Abstract    :
              9510623  Roelofs    The Principal Investigator will apply powerful, recently 
              developed, atomistic methods to problems in growth and  diffusion on surfaces
              of tungsten and molybdenum.  This work  will provide a theoretical basis for a
              better understanding  of the reduction of the work function in these materials.
               The project includes the investigation of self diffusion via  both direct and
              concerted modes using extended embedded atom  potentials.  Using molecular
              dynamics the investigator will  simulate the fabrication method used to produce
              dense arrays  of sharp field emitter tips.  Such calculations will provide  an
              important basis for applications to the development of  active illumination
              flat panel displays.  %%%  The Principal Investigator will apply powerful,

              continues the excellent  training that the investigator has provided
              previously.  An  active collaborative arrangement with Sandia National 
              Laboratory in Livermore, CA will continue.  ***
