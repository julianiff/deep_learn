Abstract    :
              9510040  Elmore   This award provides partial funding for the operation and
              maintenance of the Purdue Rare Isotope Measurement Laboratory, a multi-user
              national facility supported by NSF to provide accelerator-based mass
              spectrometry (AMS) capabilities in measuring the cosmogenic radionuclides 10Be,
              14C, 26Al, 36Cl, and 129I. The scientific goals of the facility are to develop
              and calibrate methods for applying the analysis of very low concentrations of
              cosmogenic radionuclides, a unique capability of the AMS method, to the study
              of the geologic history of rocks, soils, and ground water, and extraterrestrial
              materials.   ***
