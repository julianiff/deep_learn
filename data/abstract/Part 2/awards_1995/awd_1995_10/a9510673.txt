Abstract    :
              The  research  involves empirical  and theoretical  inquiry  into  techniques 
              for combining simple oscillators to produce  new  and  more   complex  robot 
              behaviors  from  existing  simpler   ones.  Previously  funded  work  in  the 
              PI's  laboratory  has  already  demonstrated that simple oscillators can be
              used to confer upon a  robot  superlative  but narrow dynamical dexterity.  The
               present  study  attempts to demonstrate that effective coupling techniques 
              for such existing behavioral mechanisms can confer a much broader  range  of 
              behavior. The  empirical project addresses a   robotic  manipulation scenario
              termed ``Sensor Driven Dynamical  Pick  and  Place.''  In  this  scenario, the
              robot uses  a  flat  paddle  to  acquire  balls thrown into the workspace;
              balance or bat them  as  required  through  a  clutter;  loft them  into  an 
              out-of-reach  destination  receptacle;  and  resistunanticipated  perturbations
               along  the  way. The recourse to oscillators reflects  an  almost  exclusive
              theoretical focus on event driven manipulation.    Such  a   commitment  to 
              feedback  control  addresses  the  fact  that  failures  in   machine
              reliability frequently  occur  because  of  events  which   are  not 
              intrinsically unrecoverable  but  which  violate  our  models dramatically and
              cannot be anticipated.  The  focus  on  error  detection and recovery in a 
              dynamical  setting  brings  into correspondence the concerns of the decade  old
               (and  still vigorously developing) fine motion planning literature  and 
              certain concepts and analytical tools from  the century old  (and  still 
              vigorously developing) dynamical systems  literature  that  have proven useful
              in the PI's previously funded work.
