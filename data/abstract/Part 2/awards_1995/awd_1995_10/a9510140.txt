Abstract    :
              The award is to support a doctoral dissertation research project that will
              examine the patterns of community diversity in the Hood River ecosystem in the
              Northwest Territories of Canada.  The Hood River is a pristine river without
              anthropological influences to disturb the ecosystem.  This environment will
              offer a unique opportunity to establish a link between natural heterogeneity in
              biodiversity and environmental factors such as temperature differences within
              the landscape.  The community analysis will be compared to satellite remote
              sensing data so that the role of diversity of plant communities, may be
              examined as a function of spectral reflectance.  This baseline study will
              provide data needed to test hypotheses regarding species responses to possible
              warming trends in the Arctic predicted from modelling studies.
