Abstract    :
              CTS-9510190  Pethica  Columbia Univ.      The potential of using cyclic lactams
              for separation of organics from aqueous solutions will be investigated. 
              Preliminary data indicate that cyclic lactams from micelles, exhibit a lower
              consulate temperature (LCT) with water, and have substantial capacity to
              solubilize aromatics such as pyrene.  The phase diagrams of
              alkyl-N-pyrrolidinone/water and partition coefficients will be measured for
              selected solutes.  Similar studies will also focus on a liquid alkene-grafted
              polyvinyl pyrrolidinone that is water-insoluble and has low interfacial
              tension.  Extraction of the solutes will be performed by changing temperature
              or by using mechanical dispersion of the liquid polymers followed by
              centrifugation.  The research may lead to the development of low-toxicity,
              biodegradable and non-volatile solvents for the recovery of biochemical from
              fermentation broths and the removal of environmentally undesirable chemicals
              from aqueous solutions.
