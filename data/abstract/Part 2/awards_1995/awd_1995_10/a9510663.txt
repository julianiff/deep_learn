Abstract    :
              9510663  Sieradzki    This research examines issues related to the role of
              defect  interactions in determining thin metal film growth modes.  The
              objective is to learn how to manipulate growth  parameters such that
              layer-by-layer growth  becomes the  kinetically preferred growth mode.  Growth
              mode mechanisms  are examined using combined experimental, simulation, and 
              theoretical approaches.  Electrodeposition experiments are  performed using in
              situ scanning tunneling microscopy in  order to observe the details of the
              growth mode transition  at the atomic level.  Metal-on-metal heteroepitaxial
              systems  studied include silver/gold, copper/gold, and silver/copper.  These
              systems permit a determination of the role of misfit  in the growth mode
              transition.  The layer-by-layer growth  mode is extended into the multilayer
              regime by employing  modifications of the electrodeposition system.  Monte
              Carlo  simulations using Embedded Atom Method potentials are  performed to
              determine the effects of defect interactions on  adatom cluster diffusivities. 
              %%%  This research has important materials implications since the 
              layer-by-layer  growth mode is desired  for  many  important  engineering
              applications.  ***
