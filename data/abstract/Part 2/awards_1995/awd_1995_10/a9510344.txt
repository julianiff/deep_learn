Abstract    :
              This Research Planning Grant project is in the broad area of  materials
              chemistry and has significant implications for  biotechnology.  During the
              tenure of this eighteen-month standard  grant, Professor Tam-Chang and her
              students at the University of  Nevada, Reno will carry out preliminary
              experiments necessary to  implement a major research program in biosensor
              technology based on  molecular recognition by self-assembled monolayer-resident
               receptors and complementary luminescence detection.   Alkanethiolate-tethered
              ruthenium and osmium complexes will be  prepared and incorporated into
              self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of  alkanethiols on gold surfaces, and their
              chemiluminescence and  electrochemiluminescence properties characterized. 
              Mixed SAMs in  which tethered methylphosphonate oligonucleotide analogs of DNA 
              sequences of interest are also incorporated will be prepared and  the extent to
              which double-stranded DNA interacts with the tethered  analog and alters the
              luminescence from the ruthenium and osmium  complexes will be determined.  The
              objective of this Research Planning Grant project is to explore  the
              luminescence properties of SAMs containing ruthenium and osmium  complexes, and
              to utilize that experimental platform as the basis  for new sequence-specific
              DNA sensors.  This interdisciplinary  project could give rise to sensor
              technology with important  biotechnological, environmental, and clinical
              applications.
