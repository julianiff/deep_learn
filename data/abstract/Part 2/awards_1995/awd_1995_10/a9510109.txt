Abstract    :
              9510109  Willis    Dr. Willis wants to compare the structure and activities of
              nematode lin-14 with that of the insect juvenile hormone at the molecular
              level.  If there are similarities, then she will be able to focus on whether
              such a gene as lin-14 might act directly on insect cuticular protein genes. 
              This research will shed light on the regulatory effect of juvenile hormone on
              insect metamorphosis.  ***
