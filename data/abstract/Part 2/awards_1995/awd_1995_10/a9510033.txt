Abstract    :
              9510033  Dettman  The Asian Monsoon is one of the largest and most important
              weather systems on Earth.  The development of a strong monsoon climate has been
              identified as a possible cause of the expansion of C4   grasslands and an
              oxygen isotope shift in soil carbonates in Pakistan and Nepal.  This study will
              examine the development of the modern monsoon, one dominated by the high
              Tibetan Plateau which today virtually precludes any dry-season precipitation. 
              The isotopic composition of aragonitic molluscs will be used to reconstruct the
              seasonal isotopic variation of rivers in the foothills of the Himalayas between
              12 and 1 Ma (million years before present). By combining the  18O of
              micro-sampled weekly or monthly shell growth increments with temperature
              estimates based on fossil floral  assemblages, the seasonal change  in the  18O
              of river water can be calculated.  The goal of these measurements is to examine
              the isotopic composition of river waters on a seasonal basis in order to
              estimate the aridity of the dry season and the seasonal variability of
              rainfall.  Strong seasonal aridity is indicated by positive  18O values of
              surface water in the dry season.  The seasonal amount of precipitation can be
              roughly estimated because the isotopic composition of rainfall is a function of
              the amount of rainfall at low latitudes.  Shell carbonates 13C of carbon in the
              rivers.  This allows changes in the 18O record to be directly related to
              changes in the plant biomass of the region (C3 versus C4).  Nepal will be the
              primary focus of this study because of the useful stratigraphic distribution of
              well preserved molluscs, but some shell beds in Pakistan will also be studied
              to allow comparison of different regions under the influence of the Asian
              Monsoon.
