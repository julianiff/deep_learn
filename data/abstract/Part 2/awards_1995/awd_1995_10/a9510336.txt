Abstract    :
              DMS-9510336  Steinbart    Steinbart will investigate the solutions to
              differential equations in the complex plane having entire functions as
              coefficients.  In particular, she will study the growth properties of such
              solutions in the case when one of the coefficients is transcendental.    This
              award is a planning grant that will allow the PI to further develop her
              independent research program and to develop a competitive NSF grant proposal. 
              It will provide funds to support her participation in the XVI Rolf Nevalinna
              Colloquium, an international conference specializing in complex analysis and
              related topics.
