Abstract    :
              9510333  Daniels  This  program  is  directed toward measurement of  electronic 
              excited  state  energies  and  conduction band gaps in compressed  cryocrystals
               such  as  solid  argon  and  solid hydrogen  using  nonlinear  optical 
              spectroscopy.  These  measurements  are  relevant  to  deep  planetary 
              atmospheres  problems and to ongoing questions related to  a  possible 
              insulator-metal   transition  in  highly  compressed   hydrogen.   The 
              nonlinear  optics  methods  used  are  required  to  excite  the  deep 
              ultraviolet   states  involved,  while  probing  with  optical   beams 
              transmittable by pressure cell windows.  %%%  Properties  of  crystals such as
              solid hydrogen and  solid  argon  are  crucial  to  understanding of phenomena
              in systems as diverse  as  the  deep  atmosphere of the planet Jupiter or the
              change of materials from  electrically  insulating  to conducting when
              compressed  to  extremely  high  pressures. Fundamental to this understanding
              is a  knowledge  of  how  electrons  behave  at very pressures. This  program 
              is  applying  innovative  methods using high-powered laser light pulses  to 
              measure  electron  energies  in  compressed  simple  systems  including   solid
               hydrogen and argon.  ***
