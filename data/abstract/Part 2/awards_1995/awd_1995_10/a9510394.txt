Abstract    :
              9510394  Carlson    This research addresses complex systems far from 
              equilibrium.  New theoretical techniques are developed and  exploited to study
              projects that have an array of  applications, including fracture, earthquakes,
              friction,  granular flow, and biological systems.  The first topic  focuses on
              transport properties of both models and real  systems that the PI and others
              have studied in the context  of self-organized criticality.  The second topic
              involves  continuing work in the area of modeling earthquake dynamics,  as well
              as the development of new microscopic models for  friction and granular flow. 
              The third topic addresses the  development and testing of prediction algorithms
              for  spatially extended systems.  %%%  Many systems that we seek to understand
              in the world around  us are far from equilibrium.  Examples include fracture 
              (breaking of materials), earthquakes, friction, granular  flow, and biological
              systems.  This project will continue  the work of the Principal Investigator in
              addressing such  phenomena theoretically.  One topic involves studying a 
              particular approach called self-organized criticality that  applies to motion
              in many of these situations, at least some  of the time.  A second topic
              continues work in the area of  earthquake dynamics as well as developing new
              models for  friction and granular flow.  The results of the study will  be
              directly compared with recent experimental data.  The  third major topic
              involves developing and testing new  algorithms that predict the future based
              on past for such  systems.  ***
