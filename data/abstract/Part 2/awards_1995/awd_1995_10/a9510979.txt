Abstract    :
                   This project is for Collaborative Research at Undergraduate Institutions,
              involving molecular biology, physiology and ecology to understand how
              reproduction is affected by environmental stresses.  It is well known from
              ecological and evolutionary research that organisms have considerable
              flexibility in how they respond to variable and unpredictable environments, and
              physiological and cellular mechanisms such as endocrine function have been well
              studied.  However, the means by which the environmental stimuli mediate their
              effects through physiological and molecular mechanisms are not well understood.
               This project uses laboratory and field experiments on a large insect as a
              model system to determine how variations in temperature and food availability
              affect the cellular, molecular and physiological events that accompany egg
              production, egg laying, and the development and survival of offspring. 
              Manipulations of these variables will indicate whether this reproductive
              plasticity represents an adaptive response or an environmental constraint. 
              Results will have an impact on developmental biology, ecology, evolutionary
              biology, insect biology and pest control, and promises a novel integrative
              experience involving undergraduates in exciting research over an unusual range
              of levels of biological organization.
