Abstract    :
              9510475  Greene  This  project has as its goal the preparation and 
              characterization  of high  quality  neodymium-cerium- copper-  oxygen (NCCO)
              single  crystals and  thin  films  and  lanthanum-strontium-copper-oxygen 
              (LSCO)  thin films.  Comprehensive physical property measurements will  be 
              carried out with the aim of providing reliable experimental  constraints on the
              theories  for high temperature  superconductivity and anomalous  normal state 
              properties  of  copper  oxides. A detailed  comparison  of  the electron- 
              doped NCCO system and the hole-doped LSCO system will be  made in  order  to 
              better  understand the transition  between  insulating, metallic  and 
              superconducting phases  as  the  cerium,  strontium,  or oxygen composition is 
              changed.  %%%  Many  copper oxide materials are superconductors at 
              temperatures above the  boiling  point  of liquid nitrogen  (77K) and have 
              potential  for applications.  However, an  understanding of why  these 
              materials  are superconductors  at such high temperatures is lacking at 
              present.  The goal  of  this  project is to prepare and characterize  some 
              selected copper oxide superconductors by improved methods.  This is expected 
              to lead  to  a  better  understanding of  how these  materials  work,  and
              hopefully,  to insights on  how to prepare materials which  are  better for 
              technological applications.  ***
