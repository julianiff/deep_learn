Abstract    :
                  Metherate  9510904    The brain seems to process information in special ways
              during times of behavioral arousal.  One aspect of this arousal is secretion of
              the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) within the cerebral cortex.  It has
              not yet been determined exactly how ACh modifies cortical function.  With this
              award, Dr. Metherate will determine how ACh secretion activates the cortex, and
              in particular how it modifies information processing within cellular circuits
              within the cortex.  The auditory cortex will be used as a model system for
              these studies.  This work will uncover important cellular mechanisms of
              plasticity that are likely to be involved in shifts of attention, learning and
              memory.  ***
