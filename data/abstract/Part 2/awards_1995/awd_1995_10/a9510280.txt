Abstract    :
              Conflict in groups and organizations are becoming more  pervasive due to the
              increasing complexity and  interdependence of organizational life.  Conflict
              can be  difficult in any work group, but it can be particularly  difficult when
              two cultures are involved.  Effective  intercultural interaction is crucial to
              the success of US-  Foreign joint ventures.  This Research Planning Grant  lays
               the foundation for a research program that investigates the  dimensions of
              conflict in bicultural top management teams.  Planned research includes
              interviews of managers in joint  ventures in the US, the PRC, and Russia. 
              Multiple methods,  such as multidimentional scaling and text analysis, will be 
              used to analyze different types of conflict situations  identified by the
              managers.  The research will eventually  lead to an increased understanding of
              the types of problems  that affect firm survival in an international business 
              community.
