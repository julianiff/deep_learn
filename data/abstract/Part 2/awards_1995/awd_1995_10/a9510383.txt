Abstract    :
              9510383  Baragiola      This  project is a university-industry investigation of
              the  evolution  of electronic excitations in insulators. The excitations are
              formed in  single  events  by energetic UV photons and electrons,  and  in 
              dense  cascades  induced by keV and MeV ions. The goal is to  understand  the 
              dynamics  of  energy  transport in the form  of  holes,  excitons  and  excited
              electrons in the femtosecond to nanosecond time scale, and  to  understand  the
               mechanisms for converting the  electronic  energy  in  atomic motion
              (molecular dissociation, formation of new molecules, the  ejection of particles
              from the surface, and creation of stable defects  and  phonons).   The 
              strategy is to study condensed  gases  as  model  systems,  for which basic
              cross sections are well known. The  research  involves a collaboration with
              scientists from Bell Labs and the  Univ.  of  Uppsala.  It  combines
              experiments that detect the ejected  atoms,  molecules, electrons, ions, and
              photons, and changes in the  bombarded  solids, together with molecular
              dynamics simulations.  %%%  This  project is a university-industry
              investigation of the  processes  of  energy  dissipation  in solids which are 
              bombarded  by  energetic  particles  or ultraviolet light. The goal is to
              understand how  energy  flows  into different channels, like emission of  light
              or  damage  of  the material, that will allow to find ways to modify the
              behavior. The  research  has  applications in many areas, like radiation 
              effects  in  biological   tissue,  lithography  for  manufacturing 
              microelectronic  circuits,  radiation detectors and future generations  of 
              flat  panel  displays  and  lasers in the far ultraviolet. The studies 
              incorporate  laboratory work and computer simulations.  ***
