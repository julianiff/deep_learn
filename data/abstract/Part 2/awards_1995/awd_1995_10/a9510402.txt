Abstract    :
              This Research Planning Grant project is in the broad area of  materials
              chemistry and in the subfield of nanostructures.  During  the tenure of this
              eighteen-month standard grant, Professor Liu and  her students at Wayne State
              University will conduct preliminary  experiments designed to establish the
              feasibility of a research  program in the fabrication and characterization of
              nanoscale  materials.  Their strategic approach involves the preparation of a 
              variety of nanoparticle structures and patterns including dots,  line, and
              two-dimensional islands with various shapes, followed by  the characterization
              of these structures using force microscopy,  particularly scanning tunneling
              microscopy (STM) and atomic force  microscopy (AFM).  Nanostructure synthesis
              will be based on both  traditional self-assembly and Langmuir-Blodgett
              techniques to  prepare templates as well as the direct electrosynthesis of 
              nanostructures using the probe tips of the force microscopes.   The ability to
              prepare nanometer-sized materials and to control the  size and structures of
              these particles is of immense fundamental  and technological importance.  This
              Research Planning Grant project  will lead to a research program in the
              fabrication and  characterization of nanoscale materials with `size tunable` 
              properties of importance to quantum physics and chemistry, new sub-  micron
              electronic devices, and novel optoelectronic materials.
