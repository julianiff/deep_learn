Abstract    :
                 9510299 Guo  This research project will explore the synthesis and processing
              of selected solid solution compositions in the ferroelectric tungsten bronze
              materials family that contain morphotropic phase boundary regions.  Single
              crystals in fiber form of small dimensions (< mm in diameter) will be grown
              using the laser heated pedestal growth technique.  Material characterizations
              will be carried out that include measurements of structural, chemical, thermal,
              ferroelectric (dielectric and pyroelectric), and electrooptic properties. The
              primary goal is to assess the characteristics of such phase boundaries and to
              gain fundamental understanding of property-structure-composition relations.
              Various morphotropic phase boundary systems are potentially available in this
              materials family, and provide possibilities for new materials with enhanced and
              switchable properties. The project expects to provide guidelines for the
              selection, synthesis, and modification of the morphotropic phase boundaries of
              ferroelectric tungsten bronze materials with desired and controllable
              properties for ferroelectric and electrooptic device applications. %%% 
              Systematic studies will be conducted to obtain an overall grasp of the
              characteristics of morphotropic phase boundary systems in oxide ferroelectric
              tungsten bronzes, and a fundamental understanding of the interrelation among
              physical and chemical properties, the macro- and micro-structure, and the
              chemical composition.  An important feature of the program is the training of
              graduate and undergraduate students in a fundamentally and technologically
              significant area of materials and processing research, and to improve diversity
              in science through the support of women.  This research will contribute to
              improving the general performance of advanced optical devices used in
              information storage and processing.  ***
