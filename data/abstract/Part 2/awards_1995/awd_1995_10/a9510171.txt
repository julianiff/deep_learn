Abstract    :
              CTS-9510171  Donald Kirwan  University of Virginia    ABSTRACT     The aim of
              the proposed research is to achieve a fundamental understanding of rapid
              precipitation of pharmaceutical compounds and proteins.  Potential applications
              are in the production of pure, very fine crystalline pharmaceutical products
              and the recovery of biologically active proteins.  The research will focus on
              measurements of nucleation and crystal growth kinetics, as well as impurity
              rejection characteristics under high supersaturation conditions.  The influence
              of micromixing on such processes will be investigated along with an evaluation
              of protein stability during rapid precipitation.  The results are expected to
              have an impact on the development of efficient separation techniques for the
              pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.
