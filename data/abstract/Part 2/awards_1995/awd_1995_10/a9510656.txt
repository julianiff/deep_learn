Abstract    :
              9510656  Jonckheere         Traditional robustness issues in uncertain feedback
              systems  analysis and design can be approached by considering the space of 
              uncertain parameters cut into two pieces by the crossover  hypersurface
              separating that part of the uncertainty where  specifications are met from that
              part where specifications are  not met.  A crucial observation is that this
              separating  hypersurface can get very complicated and complexity bounds on  its
              homology can be found.  In addition to the possibility of  computing the u
              function from this geometric situation,  structural instability of the
              hypersurface has indeed appeared to  be the only way to explain the
              embarrassing problem of lack of  continuity of the real  u-function relative
              the "certain"  parameters.  A prototype code for simplicial algorithm 
              construction and display of the hypersurface - using the emerging 
              computational geometry technology - is already on the verge of  becoming
              operational.       The first objective of this proposal is to further develop 
              this code into a more powerful, user-friendly one using state-of-  the-art
              computational geometry, anisotropic gridding, etc.       The second objective
              of this proposal is to develop  algebraic code (Grobner basis) for singularity
              of the Nyguist map  that could reveal the potential for structural instability
              of the  hypersurface or lack of continuity of performance relative to  rounding
              errors.  Special attention will be devoted to  singularity over a stratified
              uncertainty space.  ***
