Abstract    :
              This project spans the fields of political science, media studies, and economics
              in order to investigate the political implications of patterns of TV coverage
              of the US economy.  The analysis will be in two related parts, the first
              attempting to account for the content of economic news by reference to
              objective economic conditions, and the second attempting to account for public
              perceptions of the economy by reference to objective economic conditions and
              the contents of economic news.  The first part of the analysis will establish
              the conventions of newsworthiness that govern the production of economic news. 
              The second part will establish the extent to which these patterns of media
              coverage influence public perceptions of the economy , while avoiding the
              common error of confounding the distinctive effects of media coverage with the
              mediated or unmediated effects of real economic conditions.    Each part of the
              analysis will take the form of a statistical analysis of time series data
              encompassing the period from 1970 to 1995.  Existing data on actual economic
              conditions (from the CITIBASE data base) and on public perceptions and
              expectations about personal finances and business conditions (from the Michigan
              Survey of Consumers) will be merged with new data from a detailed content
              analysis of network television coverage of the economy, including monthly
              readings of the quality and tone of coverage of the economy as a whole as well
              as of the recurring issues of inflation, unemployment, GNP growth, wages,
              interest rates, foreign trade, and government debt.
