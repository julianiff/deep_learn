Abstract    :
              9510377  Holland       Holland's research is in model theory, a branch of 
              mathematical logic.  In recent years, many new structures of  interest to model
              theorists have been constructed as  homogeneous-universal models for classes of
              finite models with a  notion of dimension.  Among these new structures are the
              new  strongly minimal structures built from existing ones by the method  of
              fusion introduced by Hrushovski.  Holland has begun a general,  systematic
              study of arbitrary fusions from a geometric point of  view.  The new
              perspective gained therefrom enabled Holland to  produce a simple, more
              transparent construction than that of  Hrushovski in a particular case.  She
              intends fully to generalize  the simplification and to continue the systematic
              study of fusions  both from a geometric point of view, to see what new
              information  the provide on the classification of geometries that arise from 
              strongly minimal structures, and from a model theoretic point of  view, to see
              whether variations on the strongly minimal  construction might provide further
              examples of model theoretic  interest.  In parallel, Holland intends to work
              toward a unified  framework in which to view all of the new work on 
              homogeneous-universal models.        Holland intends to use the planning period
              to refine her  research project, formulating the specific, plausible
              conjectures  that should constitute a credible NSF proposal.     ***
