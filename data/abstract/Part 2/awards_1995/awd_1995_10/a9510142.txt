Abstract    :
              abstract- McCracken    This applicant will investigate mechanisms involved in
              signalling between organelles, specifically the ER-nuclear signal tdrasduction
              pathway.  This is a novel intercellular pathway that joins two topologically
              distince intracellular organelles.  The Em1p receptor in the membrane of the ER
              functions as a senor of conditions in the ER and transduces this information to
              the nucleus to activate a specific subset of genes.  This proposal will test
              the hypothesis that the ER-nuclear pathway serves to regulate ER-associated
              protein degeradation.  This will be analyzed by studying mutants defective in
              this pathway and by analyzing the interaction of the ligand with the Emp1
              receptor/kinase.  %%%  This project will investigate the mechansims of
              signalling between parts of the cell, specifically the endoplasmic reticulum
              and the nucleus.  Results from this work will explain how a local signalling
              event alters the types of genes expressed.  ***
