Abstract    :
              A state of flux exists when organizations can be characterized by frequent
              changing of roles and titles, high rates of personnel turnover, task force
              organizing based on critical expertise, and a lack of bureaucratic hiearachy. 
              Under these conditions, ad hoc organizations may form in response to rapidly
              changing situations.      This award supports a Research Planning Grant to
              formalize a set of research questions and conduct a preliminary study into the
              processes underlying the establishment of ad hoc organizations within
              governments.   This RPG will assess the feasibility of collecting information
              on the fit between the operation of governmental organizations and the
              organizational theory of ad hoc groups.  If appropriate, a detailied research
              plan will follow. The specific focus of the planning grant is on the operations
              of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and their responses to
              unanticipated events such as the Los Angeles/Northridge earthquake of November
              8, 1993.
