Abstract    :
                9510416  Webb    Low temperature transport and magnetic susceptibility 
              measurements will be carried out  on a variety of mesoscopic structures.  The
              experiments will  likely elucidate the nature of  the persistent current in
              isolated rings and arrays of rings  and the role of phase coherent  electrons
              in screening a single magnetic impurity.  These  measurements will require 
              fabrication of the highest resolution magnetic detectors  currently available. 
              Other  investigations of magnetic properties include non-periodic  fluctuation
              effects,  study of  the Kondo Effect in mesoscopic dots, and an investigation
              of  the dynamic properties of  mesoscopic systems using dc squids in nuclear
              magnetic and  electron spin resonance  experiments.  %%%  The physics of small
              structures provides the foundation upon  which future electronic  technologies
              will be based.  It is consequently extremely  important that all of the 
              potentially relevant physical properties of these systems  are identified and
              understood.  The current research carries out such systematic  investigation of
              the low temperature  magnetic properties of ultrasmall devices.  During the 
              course of these investigations some  of the most sensitive detectors available
              anywhere, which  can discern very small spatial  dimensions, will be built and
              tested.  ***
