Abstract    :
              Abstract  CTS-9510121    Fluid-particle mixture and granular flow instabilities
              will be investigated.  The dilatational and shearing instabilites of spatially
              homogeneous processes in slow sharing movement of  granular media and
              suspensions will be studied using a computer simulation technique.  The results
              will be tested in an experiment using the index of refraction matched,
              photochromatic tracer particle method.  The stability of granular flow,
              including clustering, in the Bagnold grain-inertia regime will analyzed by
              using both kinetics theory and continuum mechanics.    Understanding
              instabilities in suspension and granular flows is a critical aspects of the
              multiphase flow theory.  It has important applications in the design of
              industrial equipment handling solids and in the analysis of geotechnical
              phenomena.   ***
