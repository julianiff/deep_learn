Abstract    :
              9510373  Buss       This grant will enable the acquisition of computer equipment
              and  enhancement of infrastructure for mathematics research by a group of 
              researchers and students at the University of California, San Diego to  support
              research and research-related instructiolal activities. The  multidisciplinary
              projects include research in combinatorics and  combinatorical algebra,
              computer algebra, parallel algorithms in  computer algebra, harmonic analysis
              and graph theory, control theory,  automated theorem proving, and other areas
              of mathematics.       The grant will fund computer laboratory and computer
              equipment for  general use by faculty. students and visiting researchers at the
               mathematics department at the University of California. San Diego. The 
              primary purposes of the laboratory will be for research and for  graduate
              student training.       The grant will contain funds for the acquisition and
              installation  of computer equipment. It contains no salary funding for
              investigators  or staff. It includes directly matching funds of $50,000 from
              the  University of California, San Diego and additional substantial support 
              from UCSD in the form of networking and cabling. In addition, the  University
              of California, San Diego has just committed an additional  $31,000 per year in
              permanent funds to the mathematics department  budget to be used for hiring
              computer support personnel (this is  contingent on the details of the
              forthcoming California state budget).    ~ f
