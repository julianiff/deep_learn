Abstract    :
              Faruk Gul and Ennio Stacchetti  Northwestern University  SBR-9510942     The
              proposal concerns markets with indivisible goods and consists of two projects.
              The first project concerns the existence and efficiency of Walrasian
              equilibrium in an economy with complete information.  The P.I. shows that two
              properties of preferences, which they call substitutability and monotonicity
              are sufficient to ensure the existence o a Walrasian equilibrium.  The propose
              to find additional properties of the these equilibria. The second project
              concerns the characterization of the interim efficient, incentive-compatible
              Bayesian mechanisms for the private-values incomplete information economy with
              the same set of preferences.  The P.I. shows that the efficient mechanisms are
              essentially Vickery-Groves-Clarke (2nd price) auction mechanisms. The proposal
              is to extend the results to the case of private preferences with common
              values..
