Abstract    :
               This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
              the University of Pittsburgh.  The research investigates how members of poor,
              urban households in Brazil produce child health through the differential
              allocation of food, water, and health care to children.  The project will
              examine how variations in care, especially by gender, can be explained as
              responses to larger socio-economic constraints.  The student will study a
              community in a newly settled area of Amazonian Brazil where rapid urbanization
              has created a class of persons with little access to important resources.  The
              hypothesis to be tested is that differential valuation of male and female
              children skews the flow of resources with results apparent in child health. 
              Using ethnographic techniques of intensive interviews and
              participant-observation as well as surveys of households and specific measures
              of nursing, 24-hour activity recalls and income questionnaires, the student
              will attempt to examine the workings of the `black box` that is intra-household
              resource allocation.   This research is important because it expands our store
              of expertise about this critically important region of the world as well as
              provides information about a basic process affecting child health: the dynamics
              of resource flows within households.  Advances in our knowledge of the specific
              causes of child health that will result from this case study will be valuable
              to planners and decision makers concerned about children's general health
              status.
