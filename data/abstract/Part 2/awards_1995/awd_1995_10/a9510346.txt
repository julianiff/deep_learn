Abstract    :
              This Career Advancement Award project is in the area of surface  chemistry and
              in the subfield of interfacial vibrational  spectroscopy.  During the tenure of
              this twelve-month standard  grant, Professor Guest and her students at the
              University of  Cincinnati will construct a photoelastic modulator-based 
              ellipsometer suitable for fast, in situ monitoring of the air-water  interface.
               This apparatus will be used to demonstrate  ellipsometric detection of
              adsorbed gases at the air-aqueous  interface which represents an advance in the
              application of  ellipsometry.  This method has potential for development into
              an  non-invasive, time-resolved monitor of gas coverage, depletion, and 
              chemical reaction on liquid surfaces.  In combination with other  interfacially
              sensitive probes, this technique is expected to offer  unambiguous new insights
              into the kinetics, dynamics, and  spectroscopy of gaseous adsorbates at the
              air-aqueous interface.  This Career Advancement Award project reflects
              Professor Guest's  overall effort to revector her research direction toward the
              area  of gas-liquid interfacial phenomena.  A particular focus of this  present
              work is the development of an ellipsometric approach to the  study of
              heterogeneous atmospheric chemistry.
