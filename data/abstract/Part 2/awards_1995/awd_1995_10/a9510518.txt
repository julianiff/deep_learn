Abstract    :
              9510518  von Molnar  This   interdisciplinary,  two-campus  project  employs  
              cutting-edge  techniques  from  the fields of optical science and  condensed 
              matter  physics.  An ultra-high-vacuum scanning tunneling microscope  will  be 
              used  to  synthesize both individual and arrays of magnetic structures 
              directly  on III-V semiconductor substrates and devices. The intrinsic 
              magnetic behavior of the structures will be examined using microscopic  Hall
              bar magnetometers, Aharonov-Bohm rings, ballistic transport,  and 
              high-sensitivity  mechanical  torque measurements.  The  influence  of  magnet 
               particles   on   the  spin-dependent  electronic   state   in  semiconductors 
              will  be  investigated  through  femto-second-resolved  Faraday  and 
              luminescence spectroscopes. In  particular,  the  latter  studies include
              spatially-resolved optical microscopy.  %%%  This   experimental  and 
              theoretical  project  employs   atomic-scale  lithography,  low-dimensional 
              electronic  transpopt,  and  ultra-fast  magnetooptical  spectroscopies  at 
              low  temperature  to   investigate  quantum  magnetic structures. A unique
              aspect of the work  is  the  in  situ  fabrication of "nanomagnets" only a few
              dozen atoms in diameter,  whose  optical and magnetic properties will be
              investigated. The  work  encompasses semiconductor physics, optics, and
              magnetism. The training  gained  by  students in the areas of optical science 
              and  engineering  will  prepare  them  for a wide spectrum of career
              opportunities.  The  nanosize   magnetic   semiconductors  exhibit   novel  
              magnetooptical  phenomena  that are currently incompletely understood, but 
              which  are  felt to have great potential as possible device structures.  ***
