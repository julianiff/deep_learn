Abstract    :
              Vernon Smith, Elizabeth Hoffman, and Kevin McCabe  University of Arizona 
              SBR-9510919    This proposal is to continue current experimental work designed
              to discover what factors lead subjects to play more cooperatively and to punish
              more aggressively than game theory and economic theory predict.  The
              experiments the P.I.s propose to conduct will test a conjecture from
              evolutionary psychology that humans have evolved a predisposition to learn and
              use reciprocity in order to help foster cooperation.  In certain situations,
              people behave according to learned rules of thumb that are not necessarily
              payoff-maximizing.  The goal of these experiments is to find the environmental
              factors that trigger this behavior.
