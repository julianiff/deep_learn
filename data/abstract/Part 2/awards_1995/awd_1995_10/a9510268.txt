Abstract    :
              This Research Planning Grant project is in the broad area of  materials
              chemistry and in the subfields of electrochemistry and  heterogeneous
              catalysis.  During the tenure of this eighteen-month  standard grant, Professor
              Collinson and her students at Kansas  State University will undertake a
              fundamental investigation of  intrazeolite electron transfer.  Special emphasis
              will be placed on  electroactive molecules permanently trapped within the
              zeolite  framework resulting from `ship-in-a-bottle` syntheses.  A  systematic
              investigation of variables which influence intrazeolite  electron transfer will
              be pursued, particularly the concentration,  distribution, and electron
              exchange rate of the encapsulated redox  centers.  Using a suite of
              electrochemical and spectroscopic probes  in combination with synthetic
              strategies, the electroactive surface  concentration and thermodynamic redox
              properties of encapsulated  bipyridine complexes of divalent cobalt and
              ruthenium will be  investigated as functions of site density, electron exchange
              rate,  and zeolite microenvironment.  The objective of this Research Planning
              Grant project is the  characterization of intrazeolite electron transfer and an
               exploration of the practical applications of these unique organized  molecular
              assemblies.  This research is important to uncovering  applications of these
              materials in areas such as electroanalysis,  electrocatalysis, electronic
              materials, and optical displays.
