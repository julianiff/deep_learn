Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  JAY FRANKEL  UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE, AT KNOXVILLE  CTS - 9510441     
              This proposal is to fund innovative exploratory research on inverse analysis of
              materials in which freezing or melting are occurring during heat transfer. 
              Potential application is to metal casting, where control of the freezing rate
              can help control crystal size during the freezing process. Inverse problems are
              typically ill-posed in the mathematical sense, and solution for the boundary
              conditions that will provide a given freezing rate are often unstable and
              sensitive to initial conditions or input data.    The PI seeks a SGER to
              explore mathematical techniques that have shown initial success in providing
              stable solutions to this type of problem.  If successful, he will then apply
              for further support.
