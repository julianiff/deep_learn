Abstract    :
              This research project, at an undergraduate institution, addresses  the
              photoisomerization of trans-stilbene adsorbed on single crystal  alumina
              surfaces.  Support from the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry Program will
              enable the characterization of adsorbed  molecules using temperature programmed
              desorption and polarized UV-  VIS spectroscopy.  The effects of inert Xenon
              spacer layers on the  arc lamp induced photoisomerization will be examined, as
              will  variables such as adsorbate coverage, excitation wavelength, and  surface
              temperature.  The detailed mechanism of the surface  mediated
              photoisomerization will be explored.    Photoinduced chemistry on surfaces is
              an expanding area of research  due to interest in photocatalysis and the use of
              light for  electronic materials processing.  The work supported here addresses 
              basic aspects of this general area, by considering the simple model  system of
              light induced isomerization.  By examining a system which  has been well
              studied in the gas phase and in solution, an  understanding of the surface
              mediated process should emerge.
