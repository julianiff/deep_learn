Abstract    :
              The frontier of sensitivity in high-resolution NMR of  liquids has advanced
              greatly during the past 35  years. But there are still many important problems
              which  cannot be solved by NMR because of sample  concentrations falling below
              practical detection limits. One  as yet unexploited technique for increasing 
              sensitivity is that of electron - nuclear cross polarization  in which the
              simultaneous saturation of an electron  resonance enhances a nuclear resonance
              (in this case, a  proton or carbon resonance). Such an experiment (essentially 
              a simultaneous electron spin resonance and a nuclear  magnetic resonance
              experiment) requires instrumental  modifications not usually encountered in NMR
              (or in EPR)  experiments and careful and precise manipulation of  experimental
              conditions. Because of these extreme  requirements the feasibility of such an
              approach must be  demonstrated. Dr. Bachovchin will carry out such experiments 
              to determine the possibility of success .
