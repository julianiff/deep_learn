Abstract    :
              9510164  Johann  Well-founded orderings are ubiquitous in automated deduction, 
              being fundamental to the development of termination proofs for  computations in
              rewrite-based deduction systems, as well as of  deduction strategies aiming to
              restrict search spaces in  saturation processes.  The determination of
              well-founded  orderings suitable for a particular purpose, however, typically 
              requires a good deal of technical expertise, and because  termination of
              rewriting is undecidable in general the best that  can be hoped for is to have
              a sufficient understanding of a  sufficient variety of orderings to be able to
              cope with the many  kinds of termination and efficiency problems which occur in
               practice.  This research planning grant undertakes to develop a  comprehensive
              theory of well-founded orderings based on their  logical and numerical
              invariants.  Two specific directions for  further research are extending known
              results to larger classes of  terms, and obtaining similar results for more
              general well-  founded orderings, such as exponential orderings. As a further, 
              related line of inquiry, a theory of nontotal well-founded  orderings will be
              explored.  Since the notion of order type makes  no sense for nontotal
              orderings, appropriate logical invariants  will need to be determined.  ***
