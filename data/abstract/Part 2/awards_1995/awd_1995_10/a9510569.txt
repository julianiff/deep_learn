Abstract    :
              9510569  Wooley       The University of Michigan has for some time had a 
              program of 3-year appointments for new doctorates designed  to enhance their
              professional development as mathematicians  and educators. It's research
              programs are conducted by a  collabopative effort involving senior faculty, new
               doctorates, graduate students and undergraduates. The Number  Theory Group at
              Michigan is a very strong group of  researchers with quite diverse interests,
              and with a long  tradition of working with young faculty and students. The 
              current program has a heavy teaching component, and to  achieve a greater
              balance between teaching and research  this award will enable them to reduce
              the teaching  obligations of two young Number Theorists.
