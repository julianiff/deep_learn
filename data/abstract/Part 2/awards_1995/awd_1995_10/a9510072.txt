Abstract    :
              This project continues and expands the research in the  design, development, and
              implementation of techniques for  enhancing the power and performance of
              equational systems.  The three key areas for this research effort are rewrite 
              operations, equational programming, and equational  deduction, though the
              results will likely also be applicable  to other areas such as (constraint)
              logic programming.  Research on rewrite operations will focus on variants of 
              pattern matching algorithms that are specifically tailored  to lazy evaluation
              strategies for functional programming and  to build the semantics of certain
              functions into the  matching algorithms for equational deduction.  The 
              investigations in equational deduction will center on the  PI's recently
              proposed basic completion method, in which no  inferences are applied at those
              subexpressions in formulas  that are built up  from substitutions generated in
              previous  inference steps.  The equational programming component of  the
              proposal will focus on the further development of Equals  --- a fast parallel
              implementation of a lazy language and  the Integral system which uses symbolic
              constraint solving  techniques to glue together program analyses across 
              different paradigms.  ***
