Abstract    :
              9510401  Setton  This project is a Research Planning Grant made to help 
              increase the number of new women investigators participating  in National
              Science Foundation (NSF) research programs, and  to facilitate preliminary
              studies and other activities  related to the development of competitive NSF
              research  proposals.    This project will seek to quantify the state of
              swelling-  induced residual stress and strain in the anulus fibrosus, a  part
              of the intervertebral (spinal) disc.  Disc degeneration  causes great
              discomfort to a large number of individuals and  results of the investigation
              are expected to generate new  knowledge for consideration of appropriate tissue
               substitutes or chemical treatments to alleviate disc  degeneration.    The
              Principal Investigator is expected to submit a full  research proposal to NSF
              subsequent to the completion of  this project.            Gilbert B. Devey
