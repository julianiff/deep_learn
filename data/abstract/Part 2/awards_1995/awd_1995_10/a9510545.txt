Abstract    :
              9510545  Cheeks  The combination of magnetic devices with underlying electronic 
              circuitry has met with some success and continued progress in this  area will
              have many future device possibilities.  Here, we are  interested in combining
              magnetics with optoelectronic components  such as lasers, detectors and light
              emitting diodes, an area which  has not as yet received the same attention.  In
              particular, we will  investigate the materials compatibility issues that arise
              when  magneto-optic materials are combined with the semiconducting  materials
              used in optoelectronic devices.  Addressing issues such  as materials growth,
              interface chemistry and integrity of material  properties after deposition are
              of paramount importance in order to  enable magnetically controllable
              optoelectronic devices to evolve.   With advances in our understanding of these
              issues, it will be  possible to integrate these two components.  ***
