Abstract    :
                A large body of empirical evidence, including evidence from the Committee on
              the  Status of Women in the Economics Profession, has documented the increasing
              proportion  of economics Ph.D.s granted to women and the improved job placement
              and starting  salaries of female assistant ;professors. But, women's longer
              time to tenure, lower  probability of achieving tenure, relatively low
              publication rates, and a stagnating  percentage of women in the associate/full
              ranks and the top-ranked departments has been  documented thoroughly, with very
              little explanation offered by empirical research. This  project collects
              information detailing the critical first seven years in the job market for a 
              cohort of economists, in order to develop a better explanation of the patterns
              that appear  later in the career cycle.  Specifically, this project collects
              survey data for the purpose of exploring gender  differences in salary and
              employment outcomes among Ph.D. economists. These new  data will be merged with
              a data set constructed by the investigator in 1988-89 to create a  longitudinal
              data base of approximately 300 Ph.D. economists who began their careers  during
              Fall 1989. Women are somewhat over represented in the sample and academia is   
                      the major employment sector. The longitudinal nature of the data allows
              this project to   _  examine current employment outcomes while controlling for
              an unusually complete set            of explanatory variables collected when
              participants were just finishing graduate training     A 1  and extensive
              characteristics collected from the new survey instrument. A problem with  much
              of the previous research is the lack of adequate controls, a necessity for
              discerning  whether observed differences between men and women stem from
              discrimination or  human capital choices on the part of individuals.
