Abstract    :
                  9510703  Berman  The award will support the continued development of the
              Nucleic Acid Database, a database of three-dimensional structures of
              oligonucleotides and nucleic acids.  The goals of the project are to devise an
              easily accessible and user friendly resource that serves a broad, international
              group of users including crystallographers, theoreticians, modelers and other
              researchers interested in such structures.  The goals of the project are to
              expand the scope of the database and to refine existing and develop new,
              user-friendly software that facilitate data entry and research on the database,
              rather than simply on individual entries.  The expansion of scope will allow
              the database to accept direct entry by researchers of structural data on
              nucleic acids determined by x-ray crystallography.  The database will continue
              to cooperate closely with the Protein DataBank at Brookhaven National
              Laboratory, and will now itself include structural information on proteins and
              protein-nucleic acid complexes derived from the Protein DataBank.  In addition,
              the database will provide the first extensive test of the use of the mmCIF, a
              new, information-rich format for structural data on macromolecules that is
              expected to become a standard format for such data.  ***
