Abstract    :
              Thermal and mechanical processes during deformation of the middle crust affect
              the  style of tectonic interactions observed at the earth s surface, however
              not enough is known about the  middle crust to allow predictive models.  This
              project will use the extensively exposed middle crustal  rocks of the southwest
              United States to study the mutual interaction of plutonism, deformation and 
              metamorphism at middle crustal levels to attempt to determine its control on
              the strength and behavior  of the continental lithosphere during orogeny.  Work
              will focus on testing the idea that the middle  crust is heterogeneous but
              crudely rheologically  layered and that various depths have characteristic  Ptt
              loops.  Results will help clarify middle crustal deformation dynamics for the
              Proterozoic of the  Southwest, which should provide elements of general model
              for middle crustal deformation.
