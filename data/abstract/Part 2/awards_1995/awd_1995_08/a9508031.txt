Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    EAR-9508031  Thorbjarnarson    Two major categories of wetlands
              found in the coastal Southwestern United States are lagoonal fringe wetlands
              and riparian wetlands.  The hydrology of these has been little studied, and
              direct quantification of the groundwater contribution to most wetlands is even
              less well understood.  the goal of this Planning Grant is to assess the
              feasibility of particular field techniques in the evaluation of groundwater
              fluxes in these two major wetland categories.  The ultimate goal is a full
              research proposal to quantify the various contributors, with a significant
              emphasis on groundwater, to the water budget of a semiarid wetland.    The
              proposed preliminary research entails hydrogeologic and geochemical study of
              two field sites, the Tijuana estuary and the lower Santa Margarita River, and
              assessment of various hydraulic and tracer techniques to quantify the surface-
              and ground-water interactions.  Proposed work during the planning phase
              includes evaluation of: (1) temporal variability of ground-water fluxes, (2)
              permeabilities in bottom sediments, (3) chemical differences among potential
              contributors to the water budget, (4) potential uses of various tracers in
              measurement of water fluxes, (5) effectiveness of seepage meters in the
              lagoonal wetlands.
