              Task-Based Coordination of Intelligent Agents    Due to advances in technology,
              diverse and voluminous information  is becoming available.  This presents the
              potential for improved  decision support, but poses challenges in terms of
              building tools  to support users in accessing, filtering, evaluating and fusing
               information from heterogeneous information sources to support  user tasks. 
              Current explorations of Intelligent Agent technology  have considered a single
              agent for each task that acts as a  user's assistant.  This project explores
              coordination among  different agents that will collectively interact with other
               agents on a user's behalf to find, fuse and utilize information  in problem
              solving in support of user task.  A key component of  the proposed research
              will be collaboration with Dr. Lemaitre of  the LANIA Research Institute in
              Mexico.  Because of its bi-  national nature, the research effort is expected
              to have  additional benefits, such as promotion of international  scientific
              collaboration, and additional opportunities for  experimental testing of our
              theories and research results.
