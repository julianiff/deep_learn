Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry   Division,
              Profs. Robert C. Compton and Albert Tuinman of the Department   of Chemistry of
              the University of Tennessee will engage in a series of   investigations in the
              area of ion-molecule chemistry.  Specifically, the   investigators will study
              the properties of doubly charged negative ions   of polyatomic molecules.  The
              work consists of two parts.  1) Guided by   theoretical predictions, a search
              will be undertaken for multiply charged   negative molecular ions, and 2) the
              energy dependent cross sections of   the first and second electron attachments
              to such molecules as are found   in part 1) will be determined.   Special
              attention will be given to the   fullerene molecules C60 and C60F48.  The area
              of study of doubly charged negative ions has been beset with   great
              difficulties in the past, in consequence of which there has been a   lot of
              controversy.  Nearly all previous reports on doubly charged   negative
              molecular ions have been found to be based on spurious data and   experimental
              artifacts.  The present work is judged to have great promise   in achieving a
              breakthrough in this field.  This research is important   not only for its
              intrinsic value in an area of strong current interest,   but it also holds
              promise to be relevant to technical applications such   as the electrospray
              process.
