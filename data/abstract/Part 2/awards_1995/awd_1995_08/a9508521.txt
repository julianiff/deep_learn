Abstract    :
              With this award, the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program  
              supports research on odd-electron organometallic compounds by Dr. Rinaldo  
              Poli of the Chemistry Department, University of Maryland at College Park.   
              Dr. Poli will prepare new organometallic compounds of molybdenum,   chromium,
              vanadium, and tungsten which contain 15 or 17 electrons and   investigate their
              reactivity using EPR and other methods.  Pairing   energies and orbital
              splittings for the stabilization of these `open   shells` in organometallic
              systems will be determined, thus increasing   understanding of reactive
              intermediates in catalytic cycles.  Most stable organometallic compounds
              contain 18 valence electrons, or in   some instances 16, and do not exhibit a
              wide variety of oxidation states.    By investigating species which have an odd
              number of electrons and   accommodate a wider variety of ligands, information
              on the role of spin   pairing in reaction kinetics will be obtained.  This
              information will be   valuable in the design of reactive species which may
              serve as new   catalytic agents for organic synthesis.
