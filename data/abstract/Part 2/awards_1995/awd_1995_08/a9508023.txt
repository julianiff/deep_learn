Abstract    :
              9508023  Kay  One of the big stumbling blocks in understanding Central Andean
              magmatic source regions has been the lack of chemical constraints from
              primitive, mantle-derived basalt.  Analyses from basalts of this type have been
              touted as the required ingredient in making progress.  Within this framework,
              the recent discovery of two Pleistocene primitive basaltic lavas is extremely
              significant.  The major objective of this project is to collect and
              "completely" analyses a suite of the mafic lavas outcropping in the southern
              Central Volcanic Zone.  Mapping and sampling is being supported by Chilean and
              Argentine agencies in collaboration with South American colleagues Mpodozis and
              Coira.  A "complete" analyses means determining a full range of major and trace
              element by INAA, ICP-MS, XRF and microprobe techniques, as well as Pb, Nd and
              Sr isotopes.  These analyses will fill an important gap in compilations of
              primitive mafic lavas in arcs and provide a basis for beginning to unravel the
              complex mantle processes occurring beneath the thickened Andean Crust.
