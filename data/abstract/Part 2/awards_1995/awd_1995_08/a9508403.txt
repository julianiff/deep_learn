Abstract    :
              9508403  Slattery       The Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer 
              Science at Marquette University will purchase, one Sun SPARC  station 20, one
              Sun workstation upgrade, software, and  support staff. These machines will be
              dedicated to support  mathematical research in several projects including 1) 
              Computation in Finite Simple Groups and 2) Computation in  Finite Solvable
              Groups.
