Abstract    :
              9508604  Schmitz    This study will evaluate the importance of direct and
              indirect species interactions in structuring a terrestrial old-field food web. 
              Insight into species interactions will be obtained through detailed work in
              natural field settings involving plants, insect herbivores (grasshoppers,
              katydids, and beetles) and carnivores (hunting spiders).  The study will test a
              key hypothesis in food-web ecology that the strength of effects of one species
              on another will depend on species composition of the food web and the direct
              and indirect ways the two species interact through their linkages will other
              species in the system.  Field experiments will be conducted to quantify
              precisely and reliably the kinds of species interactions, their strengths and
              the network of pathways through which the effects of species interactions pass.
               Experimental food webs with varying numbers of species of old-field herbs and
              grasses, insect herbivores and spiders will be assembled in enclosure cages in
              the field to quantify the effect of increasing species diversity on species
              interactions in a food web.  The experiments will also evaluate whether or not
              food-web dynamics become altered if food-web structure is reduced through
              species removals.    This research will provide important information on the
              way species in natural old-field systems become linked together and it will
              offer insight into what happens when these linkages are disrupted by natural or
              human disturbances.  This information is crucial for the conservation of
              biological diversity.  Many ecologists have suggested that a reduction in
              biodiversity that disrupts the network of species linkages can have serious
              impacts on the dynamics of natural food webs.
