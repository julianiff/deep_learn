Abstract    :
                      9508624  Swartz  The purpose of the workshop is to bring together the
              leading  researchers in the field of fracture mechanics applications to 
              quasi-brittle materials in order to develop draft standards for  testing
              concrete to determine fracture mechanics properties.  Prior  to the workshop,
              draft reports will be prepared and distributed to  the attendees.  The size of
              the group will be on the order of 30 to  40 and will include persons from
              countries in Europe and other  countries who actively involved with the
              national organizations  which develop testing standards.  The interaction of
              the U.S.  participants with those from other countries is particularly 
              important at this time.  It is noted that the practicing engineers  in Europe
              and Japan are making great progress toward implementing  the concepts of
              fracture mechanics into forensic engineering and  design practice, while this
              has been lagging in the U.S.  The  results of this workshop will lead to
              testing standards which will  be proposed to ASTM for their adoption.
