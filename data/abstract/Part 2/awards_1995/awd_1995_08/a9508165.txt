Abstract    :
              9508165  Xue    This project entails the study of air-sea interaction processes 
              along the Gulf Stream front off the North Carolina coast using a 
              three-dimensional ocean model and a two-dimensional (vertical  slice) coupled
              atmosphere-ocean model.  The work focuses on the  following specific
              objectives:  (1)  an investigation of the  evolution of the atmospheric and
              oceanic boundary layers associated  with passing winter cyclones; (2)  to
              determine the relationship  between atmospherically induced oceanic motions and
              the regional  oceanic features, with emphasis on the Gulf Stream meanders; (3) 
               to demonstrate the air-sea coupling process during cold air  outbreaks; and,
              (4)  to quantify the feedback effects on the  mesoscale and synoptic scale
              motions in the atmosphere and ocean.
