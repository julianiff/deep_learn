Abstract    :
              9508662  Drew    The University-Industry Cooperative Research Programs in the
              Mathematical   Sciences are programs designed to establish a mechanism for
              exchange of mathematical   scientists between academia and industry at
              different stages of their careers. These   programs will strengthen the links
              between industry and academia and identify and   encourage new avenues of
              research in the mathematical sciences. The University-Based   Graduate Research
              Assistantships provide the opportunity for graduate students to spend   part of
              their time in the classroom and part of their time in an industrial setting.
              These   awards are a means of contributing to the future vitality of the
              scientific effort of the   nation.   This research will model the flow of a
              fluid containing a large number of small   paramagnetic particles. When this
              fluid is subjected to a magnetic field, the particles tend   to align
              (polymerize), and the flow properties of the fluid change dramatically. The
              aligned   states will be modeled using a probability density function for the
              length of chains of   particles. A Monte Carlo model for the distribution
              function will be derived, and   appropriate attachment and breaking models
              tested. This model will be coupled to the   fluid flow. The result of this work
              will be a prediction tool that incorporates the   microscopic physics of the
              processes involved in the lengths of the chains, and that can be   compared to
              flow data.
