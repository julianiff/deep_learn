Abstract    :
              9508711  Alber   The University-Industry Cooperative Research Programs in the
              Mathematical   Sciences are programs designed to establish a mechanism for
              exchange of mathematical   scientists between academia and industry at
              different stages of their careers. These   programs will strengthen the links
              between industry and academia and identify and   encourage new avenues of
              research in the mathematical sciences. The University-Industry   Postdoctoral
              Research Fellowships provide two years of support for recent recipients of  
              doctoral degrees in the mathematical sciences. These awards are a means of
              contributing   to the future vitality of the scientific effort of the nation.
              The postdoctoral fellow will   work closely with scientific advisors from both
              academia and industry.   Gregory G. Luther received his doctoral degree from
              the University of Rochester   and will work under the direction of Mark S.
              Alber at Notre Dame, Jerrold E. Marsden at   Berkeley, and Jonathan Robbins at
              Hewlett-Packard. Collaborators at Los Alamos   National Laboratory will also
              participate. The research will be on soliton-based long-haul   optical
              communications systems. Both advanced analytical and numerical techniques will 
               be used to study details of soliton and soliton-like solutions of the
              nonlinear wave   equations that model optical communications and information
              processing systems.
