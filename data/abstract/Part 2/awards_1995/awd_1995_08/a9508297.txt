Abstract    :
              9508297  Deppa       The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Winona
              State  University will purchase workstations with supporting software and 
              compilers which will be dedicated to the support of research in the 
              mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several research 
              projects, including in particular: development of a control chart for  tool
              wear situations with independent and correlated observations, the  non-regular
              polygonal central configurations of the 1 + n body problem  in celestial
              mechanics, partial residual plots for finding the correct  functional form for
              a predictor in the Cox proportional hazards model,  optimal designs for
              smoothing, and numerical partial differential  equations for groundwater flow
              models.
