Abstract    :
              9508275  Owen       Faculty members in the Department of Statistics at Stanford 
              University are researching computationally intensive statistical  methods aimed
              at problems in approximation, prediction, classification  and integration in
              high dimensional settings. Roughly 97.5% of the  award will help to support the
              hiring a computer support professional,  whose duties will be to maintain and
              improve research computing  facilities. Roughly 2.5% of the award will be used
              to help improve the  hardware on which the research is done. Both components of
              the award  are matched by University funds.
