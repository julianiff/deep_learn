Abstract    :
              ***  9508744  KAUFFMAN  In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry
              Program, John   Kauffman of the University of Missouri, Columbia will use
              subpicosecond   spectroscopic techniques to measure the Rotational Correlation
              Times of   anthracene and stilbene probe molecules in a variety of pure and
              mixed   supercritical fluids (SCF), including carbon dioxide, ethane, and
              carbon   dioxide-ethanol mixtures.  These investigations will provide valuable 
               information concerning the solvation characteristics of the fluids.  A  
              second series of experiments will use an anthracene-dimethylaniline   exciplex
              as a model system for reaction studies in supercritical fluids.    Information
              from these studies will be used to test current theories of   SCF solvation and
              clustering, determine the effects of solvent density,   viscosity, polarity and
              inhomogeneities on solvation, and provide insight   on the chemical
              reactivities in supercritical fluids.    Supercritical Fluid carbon dioxide has
              tremendous potential as an   environmentally benign solvent in which to perform
              chemical processes   such as extractions and synthesis.  In order to make use
              of this   potential, a microscopic understanding of the solvent environment
              around   a solute molecule and the influence of this solvation on chemical  
              reactivities.  Professor Kauffman's research will provide detailed  
              information on both these topics and will test current theoretical models   of
              supercritical fluid solvation.  ***
