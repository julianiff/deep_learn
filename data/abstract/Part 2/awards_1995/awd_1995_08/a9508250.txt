Abstract    :
              9508250   Karson   This project will conduct mapping and paleomagnetic studies
              of the East Greenland rifted margin along the northeast branch of the Atlantic
              Ocean, a uniquely uplifted and exposed area of rifted continental margin. The
              basaltic lavas of rifted margins are typically imaged on seismic reflection
              profiles as a series of seaward-dipping reflectors that record a progressive
              subsidence and flexure of the continental edge during the transition to
              seafloor spreading. Surface mapping will document the interaction of faulting
              and basalt intrusion, and the large fjords will afford natural cross sections
              of key parts of the major structures. The onshore data will be integrated with
              offshore data to provide a comprehensive view of the internal structure and
              composition of this continental margin. Logistical support is being provided by
              the Danish Geological Survey. The results of this project will provide a
              comprehensive view of the internal structure and composition of this
              continental margin, and will be applicable to other rifted margins in a variety
              of tectonic regimes.
