Abstract    :
              SBR-9508272  William C. Johnson  Kyeong Park  U. Kansas, Main Campus    Doctoral
              Dissertation Research:  Reconstruction of Later Quaternary Paleoclimates of the
              Central Great Plains Using Magnetic and Non-Magnetic Parameters    This
              dissertation-improvement award supports rock-magnetic analysis, radiocarbon
              dating, and carbon isotope analysis of  materials extracted from two sites in
              south-central Nebraska.  The purpose of the analysis is to reconstruct climate
              and climate change during the late Quaternary period.  The central Great Plains
              has experienced major climatic and associated environmental change during this
              period.  Little high-resolution climatic proxy record exists for the region,
              largely reflecting a lack of traditional information sources (such as peat bogs
              or natural lakes for botanical micro- and macro-fossil analysis).  An
              alternative source of proxy information is available in the nearly continuous
              loess and paleosol sequences in the region.  These will be the sources of the
              material to be analyzed in the dissertation research.  The results will include
              a high-resolution climatic reconstruction where none currently exists, better
              parameterization of rock-magnetic measurements, and combination of contrasting
              proxies in a single climatic record.
