Abstract    :
              950870  Phaff  This award provides partial support for the transfer of a large
              collection of yeasts and yeast-like organisms to long-term storage in liquid
              nitrogen, and for the systematic transfer of strain records and other
              information about the collection to a computerized form where it will be
              readily accessible by others.  The collection consists of strains isolated by
              the PI from desert environments over a period in excess of fifty years.  The
              collection is of proven and potential importance for both basic and applied
              biological research.  The effort supported through this award will help to
              insure continued availability of the collection and will facilitate access to
              information about the content and diversity of the collection.  ***
