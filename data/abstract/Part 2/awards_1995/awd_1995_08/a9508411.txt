Abstract    :
              9508411  Puckett       The Department of Mathematics at U. C. Davis proposes to
              purchase  a DEC Alpha 2100 computer and peripheral devices. This equipment will
               be used to support research in Large Scale Scientific Computation,  Geometry,
              Asymptotic Analysis and Mathematical Physics. This research  will include the
              use of symbolic mathematics computer languages and the  development of
              graphical interface tools for interactive computing and  the display of data.
