Abstract    :
              9508727    A conference on "Attribution Processes and Person Perception" will be
              held at Princeton University on March 23-25, 1995.  The purpose of the
              conference is to bring together experts in the fields of person perception and
              attribution theory to discuss the emergence of new perspectives on problems
              that owe their origin or direction to the work of Edward E. Jones who, with his
              students and colleagues, helped to forge and develop these areas of inquiry,
              which have been central to the field of Social Psychology for the last thirty
              years.   The conference goals will be achieved through a series of eight paper
              sessions. Each session will include presentation of a theory and empirical
              paper by a current, major figure in the field followed by two knowledgable
              discussants, who will react to the focal paper, as well as interactions with
              the audience. In addition, invited addresses by senior scientists will discuss
              the overall themes of social psychology and the influence that Ned Jones had on
              those themes before his untimely death in August, 1993.
