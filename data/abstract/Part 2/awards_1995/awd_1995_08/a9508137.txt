              Dissertation Improvement  Research: Lake-Catchment Based Evaluation of
              Medium-Term Sediment Yield and Sediment Dynamics From the Blue Ridge Mountains,
              Virginia  Patterns of sediment yield even in small watersheds reflect complex
              and poorly understood processes of temporary and long-term sediment storage. 
              These processes are related to the size and associated frequency of occurrence
              of runoff events and to past watershed  disturbance.  For this study lake
              sediment cores are used to provide sediment yield estimates over a  33-year
              period from an ungauged watershed in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. 
              Variations in  sediment yield through time will be compared with
              meteorological, dendrochronological, and watershed  disturbance records.    The
              lengthened analytical timescale makes possible a new and very relevant 
              perspective on the nature of erosionally dominant runoff events, sediment
              storage dynamics, and the  impacts of former landuse on sediment yield.  The
              results of the study will serve to further the goal  of understanding  physical
              landscape evolution at the more holistic ecosystem level.
