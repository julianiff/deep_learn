Abstract    :
              9508180  Peacor    This grant provides $125,000 as partial support for the 
              acquisition of a powder diffractometer system and ancillary  equipment
              including high and low-temperature attachments, a  monochromator, a
              position-sensitive detector, and controlling  hardware and software.  This
              system will be housed in the X-ray  Mineralogy Laboratory of the Department of
              Geological Sciences.  The university will provide 44% of the total cost of this
              system.  This equipment will replace an antiquated and presently  inadequate
              powder X-ray diffraction unit.  The present instrument  has heretofore served
              as the only powder diffractometer servicing  the entire Central Campus of the
              University of Michigan.  In  addition to its use in the principal
              investigator's highly  regarded research in clay mineralogy, the new facility
              will be  available to qualified students and faculty of other departments 
              including members of the Departments of Geological Sciences,  Chemistry,
              Physics and the College of Pharmacy and Dentistry.        ***
