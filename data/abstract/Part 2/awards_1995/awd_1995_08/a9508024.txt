Abstract    :
              9508024  Tauxe      The PIs will extend their experimental and numerical 
              characterization of hysteresis loops for geological materials from  single
              domain/superparamagnetic systems to other paleomagnetically  meaningful
              systems.  In this way they will provide the necessary  foundation to allow
              inversion of hysteresis loops for the rich  treasure of information concerning
              coercivity and domain state that  lies within the minerals.  ****
