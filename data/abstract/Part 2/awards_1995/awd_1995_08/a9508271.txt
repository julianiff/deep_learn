Abstract    :
              9508271  Khanbilvardi  Soil erosion is major scientific and environmental
              problem, but the laws governing this complex process are not yet completely
              clear, especially when radionuclides are involved.  These pollutants are being
              transported with soil particles down and out of the slopes, but at the same
              time they influence upon the erodibility of soils through various geo-and
              biochemical processes involving soil minerals, soil mecrobiota, soil moisture
              and traditional pollutants (predominantly agrochemical if the locality is far
              from urban or industrial objects).  A unique chance to select or better
              understand and develop a model predicting erosion-controlled transport of
              radioactive pollutants, based on both theoretical and field studies has been
              presented by the Chernobyl disaster which occurred in Ukraine in 1986.  Our
              cooperative project will use this opportunity to the fullest extent possible. 
              In the vicinity of Chernobyl there are facilities staffed and equipped to study
              the process in situ, using artificial rainfall. Numerous soil samples will be
              taken at various cross-sections and analyzed for moisture content, grain-size
              and aggregate distribution, chemical and particularly radioactive compounds,
              etc. both prior to, during and after field experiments.  Precipitation, runoff
              and erosion parameters will be observed, benchmarks installed and periodically
              leveled.  These experimental data would provide necessary input information for
              computerized mathematical modeling as planned for the second year of studies.
