Abstract    :
              9508302  Herrero-Bervera           The PI will, in collaboration with scientists
              from the  University of Miami, sample, by drilling, two magnetic polarity 
              transitional sections from Iceland in detail, carry out the  necessary
              laboratory measurements (both magnetic and dating), and  complete the analysis
              and interpretation of the results.  These  data may provide important
              additional information on polarity  transitions, which are important in our
              understanding of the  influence of the lower mantle structure on the geodynamo.
