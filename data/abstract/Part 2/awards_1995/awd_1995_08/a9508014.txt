Abstract    :
              9508014  Sohraby       Effective teletraffic analysis of communication networks
              is  essential for their successful design and engineering.  This  project will
              introduce and examine a new paradigm for the  teletraffic analysis of
              communication networks which is based on a  system theoretic approach that is
              well rooted in the field of  control theory.  This approach has the following
              features:       1) it is based on a dynamical system viewpoint for the 
              workload distribution in the system;  2) it provides both exact  solution and
              approximate solution (with less computational effort);    3) it is unifying in
              the sense that the method is capable of  solving most of the proposed
              teletraffic models in a unique and  simple framework, including fluid flow
              approximations, queues fed  with different correlated and bursty arrivals,
              general Markov  chains of M/G/1 or G/M/1 type, etc.;  4) the method can be
              viewed  as a "bridge" between the matrix analytic methods and spectral 
              decomposition techniques where it avoids the need for a large  number of
              iterations (especially in heavy traffic) encountered in  the methods of the
              former type and the ill-conditioned root finding  problem (especially when
              individual source characterization is  complex) of the problems of the latter
              type;  5) the method can be  easily implemented using traditional analog
              filtering theory; and  6) the method can also be implemented using known and
              effective  algorithms extensively used in the field of control theory for the 
              solution of Riccati equations.   ***
