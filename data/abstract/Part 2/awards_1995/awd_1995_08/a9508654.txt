Abstract    :
              CTS-9508654  Ydstie  Carnegie Mellon      The objective of this research is to
              develop design theory for a singularity free multivariable adaptive controller.
               This will be done by combining adaptive control theory with non-convex
              optimization, an approach which represents a departure from current design
              philosophies based on convexification, switching logic and/or persistent
              excitation.  Fast adaptation based on second order information and nonlinear
              programming should improve the convergence rate.  Matched control and
              estimation objectives will be applied so that optimal steady state performance
              can be achieved.  The optimization based algorithm will be based on theory and
              have few ad hoc tuning parameters.    The new concepts in this research are the
              "centered parameter", which gives optimal performance of a parameterized
              control system,  the use of non-convex optimization to solve singularity
              problems and the use of adaptive filters to match design and optimization
              objectives.  The theory will apply to a  broad class of certainty equivalence
              adaptive control algorithms including H infinity, LQG and predictive control.  
               The PIs will work on implementation of adaptive control to large scale
              industrial processes.  Experiments show that it is in multivariable
              applications that adaptive control shows greatest potential giving improvement
              in process operation.
