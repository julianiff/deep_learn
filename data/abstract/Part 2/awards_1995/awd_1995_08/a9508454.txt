Abstract    :
              Abstract  Senkan  CTS-9508454    The PI proposes to explore a new flow reactor
              process aimed at the synthesis of fullerenes and other related materials.  This
              process will exploit the highly exoergic reactions between halogenated carbons
              such as CCl4, C6Cl6 (perchlorobenzene) and C10Cl8 (perchloro-naphthalene) and
              the Group IA and IIA metals.  The PI claims that the innovative aspect of the
              proposed research lies in the use of completely halogenated starting materials,
              thus avoiding hydrogen in the feedstocks and the supposedly deleterious effects
              of hydrogen on the yields of fullerenes and fullerene derivatives.  Because
              simple salts such as MgCl2 and NaCl are produced as by-products, purification
              of the resulting fullerenes should be relatively simple.  Furthermore, since
              the flow reactor process is envisioned as being continuous, scale-up should be
              straight forward and easy.    The PI has requested funding for 12 months to
              explore the technical feasibility of the proposed process.
