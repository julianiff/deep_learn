Abstract    :
              9508987  Hillis   Biologists have long been interested in the history of life,
              and the last few decades have been accompanied by major expansion in the areas
              of biology concerned with reconstructing these histories. There are now many
              different methods that can be used to reconstruct history, and there have been
              several new applications of the methods, such as discovering the US hantavirus
              and its animal reservoirs, as well as helping to determine whether health
              professionals infected their patients with HIV. An inherent difficulty in this
              important field of science is that there is usually no way to truly know the
              histories of the organisms being studied, hence it is difficult to know hmw
              often reconstruction methods fail. In the study proposed here, we will overcome
              that limitation. A virus will be grown in the laboratory to generate lineages
              with known ancestries. DNA sequences and other characteristics will be obtained
              from the resulting lineages. The success of reconstruction methods will be
              tested directly by comparing the estimated histories with the known histories.
              The data will also be studied for unusual properties that may thwart recovering
              history, such as the possibility of molecular convergence resulting from common
              selective pressures.  %%%   This study should impact the field of systematic
              biology both in establishing an empirical methodology for experimental
              phylogeny construction and in providing direct tests of phylogenetic inference
              methodology.   ***
