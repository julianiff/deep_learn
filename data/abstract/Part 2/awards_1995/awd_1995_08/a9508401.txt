Abstract    :
              9508401  Nurmikko  The goal of this research is to initiate the development of a
              new  generation of blue-green semiconductor lasers, based on vertical  cavity
              and microresonator devices.  The lasers are based on wide  bandgap II-VI
              semiconductors which have recently seen a brisk pace  of development in the
              conventional edge emitter geometry.  The  principal investigator's group has
              been a part of these advances  and has achieved considerable experience in the
              physics and  engineering of these quantum well heterostructure devices, 
              expertise that will be of direct benefit in the proposed research.   For
              example, spectroscopic characterization of gain, application of  bandgap
              engineering techniques for electrical contacts,  nanostructure fabrication
              techniques, and low temperature device  processing methods have been
              accomplished.  From applications point  of view, the emergence of compact
              blue-green lasers has significant  potential impact on optical storage,
              display, and printing  technologies.  ***
