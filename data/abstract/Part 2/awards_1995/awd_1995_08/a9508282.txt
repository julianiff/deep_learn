              NCR-9508282  University of Southern California  Algorithmic Theory of Universal
              Source Coding with a Fidelity  Criterion and Related Topics  Zhen Zhang    This
              project addresses the question "Can one design an on-line universal  sequential
              source coding algorithm for lossy source coding?"  What is meant  by an on-line
              universal sequential lossy algorithm is that such an  algorithm is sequential,
              achieves in one pass the rate-distortion limit,  and has a short delay, good
              adaptivity, and relatively low coding  complexity, so that it is suitable for
              on-line implementation.  It will be  necessary to study the basic properties of
              a universal lossy source coding  algorithm,  and this will require the
              development of systematic methods for  algorithm analysis such as the analysis
              of the redundancy of an algorithm,  the analysis of the robustness and coding
              complexity of an algorithm and  other topics.
