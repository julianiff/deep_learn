Abstract    :
              9508325  Trangenstein       The Department of Mathematics at Duke University
              will purchase a  high end visualization machine with ample memory, fast
              communications  card, video equipment and disk drives that will be dedicated to
              the  support of research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be 
              used for several research projects, including the simulation of  surfactant
              enhanced aquifer remediation, multiple contact miscible gas  injection for
              enhanced oil recovery, network models for pore scale  modeling in three-phase
              flow in porous media and shear band formation  and growth in granular
              materials. The calculations will involve  sophisticated techniques for
              localizing the computational effort via  high-resolution finite difference
              methods, adaptive mesh refinement,  front tracking and molecular dynamics.
              Because of the large size of the  computations, a large amount of computer
              memory is needed (both RAM and  disk), and fast communications with
              supercomputers.
