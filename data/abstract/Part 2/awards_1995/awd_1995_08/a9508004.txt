Abstract    :
              9508004  Daines  This pilot study involves an experimental project on melt
              migration in peridotites.  It investigates the role of melt-rock reaction if
              the focusing of melt flow during melt migration in the upper mantle.  The
              research involves a series of experiments in which basaltic melts
              undersaturated in pyroxene infiltrate synthetic peridotites composed of
              different proportions of olivine and pyroxene.  The experiments will be
              analyzed through detailed characterization of microstructures, reaction fronts,
              and phase compositions, and by one-dimensional numerical simulations.
