Abstract    :
              9508414  Royster  The Department of Mathematics at the University of North
              Carolina at  Charlotte will purchase computer equipment which will be dedicated
              to  the support of research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment  will
              be used for several research projects, including in particular the  work of
              three Numerical Analysts and two Statisticians. The department  started a new
              Ph.D. program in Applied Mathematics in August, 1994. The  new equipment
              purchased will also be used to support research in the  new doctoral program in
              computational mathematics and applied  statistics.
