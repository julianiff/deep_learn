Abstract    :
              This  research concerns infrastructure for supporting  multiuser-  interfaces.  
              Two  important  criteria  for  evaluating  such  an  infrastructure are the
              flexibility of the supported paradigms for  (a)  application-user  interaction 
              and  (b)  user-user  sharing.  Currently,  an  infrastructure offers  either 
              great  interaction  flexibility  but  limited sharing flexibility, or  great 
              sharing  flexibility  but  limited interaction flexibility.   The  maximum 
              interaction  flexibility  is offered by  shared  window  systems,  which  allow
               multiple  users to share a single  logical  window.  However,  these  systems 
              offer  no  sharing  flexibility.    The  hypothesis   of  this  research  is 
              that  it  is   possible   to  significantly  increase the sharing flexibility
              of these  systems  without  reducing their interaction flexibility.   This 
              research  identifies  new  software  abstractions  and  architectures   for 
              establishing  this  hypothesis and uses  an  experimental  method  wherein  the
              new concepts are implemented and used in  validation  experiments.   If 
              successful, it will lead  to  a  new  kind  of  infrastructure that
              automatically meets the sharing  needs  of  a  large  class  of  multiuser
              user-interfaces that  must  today  be  implemented manually at great
              programming costs.
