Abstract    :
              9508030  Hofmeister         This grant provides $16,490 for 2/3 support of the
              cost of  upgrading control software for an infrared spectrometer at 
              Washington-St. Louis (WUSTL) used in studies of mineral physics.   A PC
              platform will be purchased with the PI's existing research  funds and will
              replace an outdated DEC PDP-11 platform.   Replacement hardware for these
              computers is becoming increasingly  scarce and software is no longer developed
              for these platforms.   The PI recently joined the faculty at Washington
              University-St.  Louis (WUSTL) and was able to bring much of her equipment from
              her  former laboratory at the University of California-Davis (UCD).  
              Conversion of the control system to a PC based platform will allow  the PI to
              streamline data reduction and analysis as it will remove  cross-platform
              transfer that was previously necessary.  The  principal investigator's research
              in mineral physics uses  vibrational spectroscopy at ambient and high pressures
              to elucidate  the thermochemical properties of rockforming minerals.  In this 
              regard she is considered a principal contributor to this unique  field.  Many
              collaborators maintained PCbased control systems for  their IR spectrometers
              and will donate reduction programs presently  available.  Further collaboration
              should be enhanced by development  of common platform data reduction programs.
