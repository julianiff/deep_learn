Abstract    :
              9508144  Cashman  Detailed measurements of the vesicle structure of two inflated
              sheet flows from Mauna Loa volcano and two inflated sheet flows in central
              Oregon will allow testing of the applicability of the model of Cashman et al.
              (in review) to flows of larger volume that typically produced by Kilauea
              Volcano.  This goal of interpreting the dynamics of the emplacement process is
              distinctly different from previous studies that have viewed the development of
              flow vesicularity as a static process.  This work will lay the foundation for
              addressing the emplacement of more enigmatic flows, such as flood basalts. 
              Temperature changes with transport distance will be determined for both of
              these flows using the completed glass geothermometer  with the goal of
              calibrating temperature loss with basalt eruption rate (and thus flow
              emplacement style).  A glass geothermometer will be calibrated experimentally
              for quantitative determination of temperature loss during transport and
              emplacement of the Gingko flow.  Finally, both pre- and post-emplacement 
              cooling rates of basalt flows are preserved in the microlite population of both
              glassy selvages and solidified flow interiors.  Experimental quantification of
              observed qualitative relationships between cooling rate and crystal number
              density will provide a new tool for determining cooling rate distributions in
              solidified basalt flows.
