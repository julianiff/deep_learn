Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Bert   Holmes of
              Lyon College is funded by a Research in Undergraduate   Institutions award to
              measure unimolecular and bimolecular rate constants   for a series of gas-phase
              reactions involving halocarbons using chemical   activation.  Studies will
              include the 1,2-dehydrohalogenation of   haloalkanes for which for which the
              nature of the transition states will   be determined, and 1,2-dehydration of
              chemically activated haloalcohols   for which rate constants and threshold
              energy barriers will be   determined.  The results from these studies will be
              used to test recent   theories concerning transitions states for bimolecular
              reactions of   haloalkyl radicals.  This work will provide an improved
              understanding of   some of the reaction resulting in ozone depletion. 
              Additionally, the   work will provide strong motivation for undergraduate
              students to pursue   careers in chemistry.  Ozone depletion is a complex
              problem involving gas-phase, liquid-phase,   and interfacial reactions.  In
              order to understand the problem, typical   unimolecular and bimolecular
              reactions of molecules known to contribute   to ozone depletion must be
              measured and understood.  Professor Holmes'   work will address some of the
              issues involved in this serious problem,   while at the same time giving
              undergraduate students the opportunity to   perform experiments in a timely and
              important area.
