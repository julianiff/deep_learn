Abstract    :
              This award, made in the Organic Dynamics Program, will provide continued  
              support for the research of Dr. Philip Shevlin at Auburn University on   the
              reactions of atomic carbon and related high-energy intermediates such  
              methylidynes, carbenes and nitrenes. Many of these high energy   intermediates
              have reactivities and specificities different from those   prepared by 
              traditional routes. Specifically,  Dr. Shevlin  will focus   on the reactions
              of atomic carbon with cycloalkenes,  N-substituted   pyrroles, imidazoles,
              substituted furans, and cyclopentadienes. In each   case, the mechanism of
              product formation will be studied and reactive   intermediates isolated.  
              Atomic carbon and small carbon molecules have been observed to grow into  
              large caged fullerene-like clusters, providing additional impetus for  
              understanding the reactivity of atomic carbon and the reactive   intermediates
              that can be derived from it.
