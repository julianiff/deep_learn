Abstract    :
              9508106  Barton   This award provides partial funding for the support of a
              laboratory technician who will oversee the operation and maintenance of two
              gas-source stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry laboratories at the
              University of Arizona. The mass spectrometers are an essential research tool of
              several faculty members and their students in the departments of geosciences,
              hydrology, and the University of Arizona Tree-Ring Laboratory. A broad variety
              of research carried out in these laboratories include studies in hydrothermal
              rock-fluid interactions, ground water chemistry, ecology, paleoecology and
              Quaternary paleoclimate research. The research depends critically on the
              analytical capabilities of the mass spectrometry labs. The primary
              responsibilities of the technician will include operation and maintenance of
              the two mass spectrometers and their associated gas extraction lines, as well
              as the training of student and senior users.   ***
