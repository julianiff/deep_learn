Abstract    :
                  9508642  Slocum    The process by which a single fertilized egg gives rise
              to  specialized cell types and structures in an adult organism remains  one of
              the major unsolved mysteries in developmental biology. In  plants,
              differentiated tissues and organ systems are defined early  in plant
              development and the occurrence of these differentiated  structures reflects the
              initial establishment of embryonic polarity  and subsequent differentiation of
              specific cell types. The body of  knowledge concerning the mechanisms of cell
              differentiation in  early plant embryogenesis is scant, in part due to
              difficulties in  accessing embryonic tissue in higher plants. The molecular
              basis of  polarity establishment and cell differentiation is being studied in 
              the brown alga, Pelvetia. In Pelvetia, eggs are abundant and easily  obtained.
              Unfertilized eggs are phenotypically apolar, but express  increasing asymmetry
              during the first cell cycle. The first zygotic  division gives rise to two
              distinct cell types with different  developmental fates. Experiments are being
              conducted to test the  hypothesis that mRNAs are segregated to different
              regions of the  developing Pelvetia zygote and are then unequally partitioned
              at  the first cell division. Subsequently, proteins translated from the 
              localized mRNAs determine the fates of the embryonic cells in which  they
              reside. Spatially localized mRNAs are being characterized to  determine how
              proteins from these mRNAs specify cell fate and to  determine how they get
              targeted to and localized in distinct  regions of the cytoplasm.  ***
