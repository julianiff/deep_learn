Abstract    :
              This proposal includes a thorough exploration of the linear  instability
              spectrum, using both eigenmode and initial-value  methods, and the two
              dimensional turbulence that results from the  nonlinear growth of these
              instabilities.  The PI will use measured  density and electric field profiles. 
              He will attempt to clarify  the role of short-wavelength instabilities in the
              presence of  dominant kilometer-scale structures, the distinctions in turbulent
               characteristics between the upper electrojet in daytime as well as  nighttime.
               Finally, he will ascertain (1) the role of velocity  shear, much more
              effective in damping short-wavelength  instabilities than long-wavelength ones,
              and (2) the self-  regulatory role of velocity shear, not only driven by the
              ambient  electric fields and neutral wind, but also possibly generated by a 
              dynamo effect due to the turbulent Reynolds stress at short  wavelengths.***
