Abstract    :
              9508054  Heinz      Under the direction of the PI, the University of Chicago
              will acquire a  neodymium-yttrium lanthanum fluoride (Nd-YLF) and C02 lasers, 
              associated stabilization equipment, new diamond anvil cells and a high 
              pressure gas loading apparatus. This equipment will both modernize and  add
              many necessary improvements to the diamond anvil laboratory at the  University
              for research in high temperature, high pressure mineral  physics.  The PI's
              research focuses on the accurate measurement of  melting curves for mantle and
              core minerals so as to constrain the  maximum temperature of the lower mantle
              and the temperature of the  inner-outer core boundary, a fundamental problem in
              the earth sciences.  In particular, the acquisition of a stable high power
              Nd-YLF laser will  enable detection of the enthalpy of fusion for Earth
              materials in the  laser-heated diamond anvils.  The acquisition of the CO2
              laser will  enable this laboratory to make melting measurements with bmth types
              of  laser for intra and inter-laboratory comparisons with the goal of 
              resolving these differences. Since the lasers couple with solids in  different
              ways, the types of materials that can be studied is greatly  increased by
              having both types of lasers.  Finally, due to the  stability of the new lasers,
              it will be possible to interface with the  synchrotron source currently being
              commissioned at the Consortium for  Advanced Radiation Sources (CARS) sector of
              the Advanced Photon Source  (APS), Argonne National Laboratory.      ***
