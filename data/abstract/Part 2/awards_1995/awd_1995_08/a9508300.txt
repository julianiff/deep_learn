Abstract    :
              9508300  Engebretson   This Research in Undergraduate Institutions project will
              investigate the regional geological significance of rock units within the
              eastern San Juan Islands of the Pacific Northwest. Preliminary work has shown
              there to be similarities between these rocks, those of the western San Juan
              Islands and those of the North Cascades to the east. The study will comprise
              detailed geological mapping of critical contacts, paleomagnetic analysis,
              geochemistry, and radiometric and paleontological age control. The data will
              provide an indication of the overall tectonic evolution of the area and its
              relationship to other parts of North America, and will be synthesized into
              up-to-date plate reconstruction models. Undergraduate students at Western
              Washington University will be involved in every phase of the study. The results
              will have significance for many other tectonic regions that contain
              ophiolitic/continental arc assemblages.
