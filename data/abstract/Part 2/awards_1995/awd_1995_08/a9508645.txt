Abstract    :
              9508645  Colucci     The purpose of this research is the explore the feasibility
              of applying current ensemble weather forecast methodologies to predicting the
              sensible surface weather for forecasts of 0-2 days (i.e., short-range ensemble
              forecasting, or SREF).  The primary research goal is to characterize if and
              when the existing perturbation methodology may be used for SREF. The principal
              datasets to be employed in the study are produced routinely by the National
              Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP).  The usefulness of the ensembles
              will be judged by comparisons of the 80 km eta model ensemble output with the
              single-run, high resolution (29 km) eta regional model forecasts and Model
              Output Statistics (MOS) from the Nested Grid Model (NGM).  The focus will be on
              determining under what conditions the use of current methodologies is effective
              and when other methodologies might be employed instead.     This award provides
              support for a doctoral research project that also has considerable potential
              for improving operational short-term forecasting.    ??
