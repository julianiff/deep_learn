Abstract    :
              9508735  PINTO  This project will provide the first phylogenetic analysis of
              relationships within the blister beetle family (Insecta: Meloidae). 
              Morphological and biological features of both adults and larvae will be
              utilized in this analysis.  Present classifications establish major groupings
              based on phoretic behavior (dissemination by hitchhiking on another organism,
              mostly other insects) of the first instar larvae and Dr. Pinto believes these
              are unnatural groupings because this behavior has probably arisen independently
              in different lineages.  A major contribution of this project will be keys to
              the blister beetle genera of the world (At present no keys exist.). 
              Availability of such keys will allow researchers in different parts of the
              world to undertake further research with these beetles, ranging from applied
              research concerning these agronomic pests to evolutionary studies of their
              unusual metamorphosis and other aspects of their biology.  %%%  Members of the
              family Meliodae are known as blister beetles because of the noxious, caustic
              defensive chemicals they produce.  Several species are important pests of crops
              in different parts of the world and others are threats to the health of
              livestock (e.g. in this country alone several horses become sick and some die
              each year from eating hay infested with meloid beetles).  This project will
              contribute to our knowledge of this element of insect biodiversity and offer
              information that may prove of use in reducing economic losses attributable to
              these pests.  ***
