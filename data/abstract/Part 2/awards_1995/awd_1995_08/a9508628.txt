Abstract    :
              9508628  Berner    Organisms  generate heat by the breakdown  of  fuels  during 
              cellular metabolism.  In endotherms, metabolic heat  can  be  produced fast
              enough to raise body temperature significantly  above  that  of the
              surroundings.  In ectotherms,  rates  of  metabolic  heat production are so low
              that body  temperature  is determined primarily by the surrounding environment.
               The  aim  of  this  research is to determine the mechanisms  that  permit
              endotherms to produce heat at a greater rate than can  ectotherms.   High 
              rates of metabolic heat  production  are  usually  linked  to  high  rates of
              oxygen  consumption  and  production of usable chemical potential energy. 
              These  last  two   processes   occur  in  subcellular   organelles,   the 
              mitochondria.   This  research will  contrast  the  rate  of  oxygen 
              consumption  and  chemical  potential  energy  (ATP)  production  by the
              mitochondria of endotherms and ectotherms  under a variety of conditions. 
              Experimental treatments will  include  varying  the temperature at which the 
              mitochondria  work  and varying the fuels provided to the mitochondria  as 
              they  perform their metabolic functions.  The research  will  improve 
              understanding  of  the mechanisms  responsible  for  metabolic differences
              between endotherms and ectotherms  and  of how these differences evolved.
