Abstract    :
              9508187  Rosenberger       The Department of Statistics at the Pennsylvania
              State  University will acquire  workstations and related equipment  to augment 
              its existing network for research in the  mathematical sciences. The equipment
              will be used for  several research projects including:   (1)  Statistical
              Analysis of High-Dimensional Data in  Regression and Discrimination Problems 
              (2) Robustness in Random Effects Models  (3) University Statistical Consulting 
              (4) Multilevel Models for Hierarchically Nested Event  Histories  (5)
              Observational Economy in Ecological and Environmental  Investigations      
              These projects involve five faculty members in the  department including the
              Statistical Consulting Center, the  Center for Statistical Ecology and
              Environmental Statistics  and the Center for Multivariate Analysis.       The
              research projects all involve the development of  fundamental statistical
              methodology and also have the  potential for immediate applications to the
              problems of  society. All of these projects involve highly  computationally
              intensive methods and all expect to make  these methods more efficient; all
              require high resolution  color graphics or ability to handle large amounts of
              data;  and all require high-speed transparent networking to make  optimal use
              of our computing resources and  facilitate  interaction between researchers.
