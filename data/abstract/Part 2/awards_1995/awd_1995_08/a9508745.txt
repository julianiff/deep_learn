Abstract    :
                 This project is developing and evaluating new techniques  for tool-assisted
              restructuring of large systems.  The excessive cost of  software evolution is
              due in large part to  inappropriate structure of a system,  relative to the
              changes taking place.  Tool-assisted program restructuring is studied for
              changing a system's structure at lower cost and risk than  making  changes  by
              hand.  In this approach, a tool user selects transformations  to apply to
              chosen program components.  The tool checks to make sure that each 
              transformation will preserve the functional behavior of the program.  If so, it
               performs the transformation to the chosen component and updates any related 
              components to preserve consistency.    Tool-assisted restructuring has not been
               demonstrated to be practical in industrial-scale applications.  For  example,
              exhaustive interprocedural data flow analysis is required by some  tools, but
              is costly to perform on large programs. Previous restructuring  research has
              not addressed common complicating constructs such as pointer  arithmetic,
              function pointers, comments, textual macros, and conditional  compilation.   
              To make the restructuring of large programs practical, this  project is
              developing and adapting techniques to address these problems.  Demand-driven
              data flow is being investigated to overcome many performance  problems of
              exhaustive data flow analysis. Query prioritization and caching of  replies are
              studied to minimize burdensome and potentially incorrect user  queries. Testing
              and semantic differencing may also provide checks of  correctness after
              restructuring.  A case study is intended to  evaluate the  techniques developed
              and the benefits of large-scale  restructuring.
