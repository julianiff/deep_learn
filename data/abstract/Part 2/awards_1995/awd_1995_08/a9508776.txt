Abstract    :
              This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) to develop an innovative
              model to  predict the maximum electron density in the F region ionosphere.  The
              model is unique in that  it uses a set of planetary scale geomagnetic indices
              as input.  The dependence of F region  ionization on these indices provides
              important insight into the physical mechanisms that  determine ionospheric
              electron density.  In particular, preliminary results show that the intensity 
              of the ring current in the magnetosphere is crucial in accurately specifying
              the global electron  density.  This is evidence for a direct coupling mechanism
              between the solar wind and the  ionosphere.  This SGER will allow further
              refinement and development of the model including  validation and verification
              of the results by comparison with global electron density  measurements.  In
              the course of the study, the dependence of ionospheric conditions on various 
              driving forces will be identified and quantified.
