Abstract    :
              9508728  DeLaune  The objective of this project is to obtain a better
              understanding  than now exists of the conditions that result in the production 
              of volatile sulfur and phosphorus-containing compounds during  domestic
              wastewater treatment processes and in the processing of  sludges derived from
              the treatment of wastewaters.  Sulfurous  compounds that are produced during
              wastewater treatment include  hydrogen sulfide, carbonyl sulfide, methanethiol,
              dimethyl  sulfide and carbon disulfide.  Phosphorus compounds that are 
              produced during wastewater treatment may also include phosphine,  a substance
              of special pollutional significance because of its  toxicity, carcinogenicity
              and mutagenicity.    Results of this research are expected to provide knowledge
              that  can be applied in the operation of existing wastewater treatment  plants
              to reduce or eliminate the production of air pollutants.  The knowledge gained
              through this research is also expected to be  utilized in improving engineering
              design of treatment plants to  minimize or avoid the production of air
              pollutants of toxic  and/or nuisance significance.***
