Abstract    :
                      9508706  Gordon  The purpose of this project is to enhance the
              participation  of minority students and faculty in plant science research  by
              supporting the costs for attendance at plant science  meetings.  This program
              is limited to minorities who are US  citizens, and attendance is open to any
              area of plant  science including regional meetings of plant science 
              professional societies and other related plant science  meetings.  Costs to be
              covered include transportation costs,  registration fees, and subsistence costs
              while in attendance  at these meetings.  Applicants will be asked to submit a 
              short proposal requesting funds to attend a specific  meeting.  The American
              Society of Plant Physiologists  Minority Affairs Committee will receive and
              review  applications.  Awards will be made on the merits of the  proposal. 
              Each award recipient will be required to submit a  report of the meeting
              attended to provide an assessment of  the impact of this project.
