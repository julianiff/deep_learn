Abstract    :
              9508328  Russell       The Center for Computational Mathematics at the 
              University of Colorado at Denver will purchase an  eight-processor Sun
              Microsystems SPARC server 1000E, which  will be dedicated to the support of
              research in the  mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for  several
              research projects, including in particular:       Parallel Implicit Multigrid
              Methods for Direct  Numerical Simulation of Time Dependent Compressible 
              Turbulent Flow around Flight Vehicles. Transitional and  turbulent flow at
              subsonic and hypersonic speeds will be  approximated directly, without
              turbulence models.       Eulerian-Lagrangian and Mixed Methods for Subsurface 
              Flows. Flows in porous media, with emphasis on applications  to oil recovery
              and groundwater contaminant transport, will  be simulated with new numerical
              methods designed to be  accurate for convection dominated flows through
              irregular  geological formations.       Stabilized Finite Element Methods and
              their Massively  Parallel Implementation. Discretizations with strong  accuracy
              and robustness for a wide range of applications  will be developed and
              analyzed, and domain-decomposition  equation solvers will be designed and
              implemented.       Parallel Iterative Methods. Robust, fast equation  solvers
              will be developed for equations arising from  discretizations of models of
              solid mechanics on highly  distorted finite element meshes.      
              Preconditioned Parallel Methods for Large Symmetric  Eigenproblems. Fast,
              accurate, robust methods will be  developed for computation of several extreme
              eigenpairs of  symmetric generalized eigenproblems.  The projects span major
              areas of scientific computation:  model development and application,
              discretization methods,  linear equations, and eigenvalue problems. All share 
              large-scale parallel computation as a central theme.
