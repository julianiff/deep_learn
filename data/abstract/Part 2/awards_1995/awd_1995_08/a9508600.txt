Abstract    :
                This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at the University of Nebraska--Lincoln
              in the purchase of a parallel  computational facility using IBM SP2.  This
              equipment will enhance research in a number of  areas including the following: 
              (1) Theory and Computer Simulations of Phase Transition,  (2) Crystallography,
              Molecular Modeling of Macromolecular Systems, (c) Molecular  Simulations and
              Modeling of Supramolecular Clusters, (d) NMR-related Theoretical  Studies, and
              (e) Molecular Modeling of Catalyst-Substrate Interactions.      A workstation
              network of fast, modern computer workstations is a new way to satisfy the  
              computing needs of chemistry departments.  Such a "computer network" also
              serves as a   development environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms,
              provides state-of-the-art  graphics and visualization facilities and supports
              research in state-of-the-art applications of  parallel processing.
