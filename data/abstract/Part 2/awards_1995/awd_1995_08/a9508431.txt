Abstract    :
              9508431  Weingarten   This is a request for holding a workshop on the timely
              subject on Social Aspects of the National Information Infrastructure.  This
              workshop will bring together computer scientists and social scientists to
              develop a research agenda for studying and predicting changes in work, social
              interactions, societal roles, and other changes that ubiquitous computing and
              communication will bring.  The results of the workshop will be threefold:    1.
               A report that will prioritize research themes and issues;    2.  Enhanced
              communications between social scientists, technologists, and technology
              assessment practitioners concerned with the social aspects of the NN;    3. 
              The (new) involvement of the social science research community in the ongoing
              activity of planning and implementing the NII.  ***
