Abstract    :
              9508458  Csorna       This is a proposal by two faculty in the physics 
              department at Vanderbilt University to do to investigate  heavy flavor mesons
              (beauty and charm) as part of the CLEO  collaboration at a new tracking chamber
              for the CLEO III  upgrade and to continue their investigations specializing in 
              hadronic decays of B and D mesons.  ***
