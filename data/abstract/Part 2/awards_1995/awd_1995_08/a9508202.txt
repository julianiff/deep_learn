              Between Stream Discharge and Fog Interception in a Guatemalan Tropical Cloud
              Forest    This dissertation improvement research will investigate the
              relationship between stream discharge and fog interception in a selected
              Guatemalan cloud forest.  The study examines the extent to which streamflow
              yield changes after cutting, determines the extent fog drip is a significant
              hydrological input to water supply, and evaluates the relationships between
              stream discharge and fog interception.  The research will improve understanding
              of the effects of tree cutting on the hydrological cycle in tropical cloud
              forests by building a long-term hydrological database useful for forest and
              water resource management.
