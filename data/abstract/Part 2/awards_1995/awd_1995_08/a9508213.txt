Abstract    :
              9508213  Coe      The PIs will conduct a study of the variation in geomagnetic
              signal  in sediments with differing properties of the sediments, such as 
              deposition rate, lithic composition, grainsize distribution, and 
              characteristics of the magnetic grains.  Samples from the sediments  that
              record the Mono Like geomagnetic excursion will be  investigated, as these have
              been measured in the past and will be  a useful standard.  Initially they will
              look at samples from around  Mono Lake and then at samples from elsewhere that
              record the  excursion.  ****
