Abstract    :
              9508013  Hanson   This project will conduct mapping and geochronological studies
              of the Zambezi orogenic belt in southern Africa.  Although this belt is highly
              significant to Neoproterozoic to early Paleozoic plate reconstructions, it is
              geologically very poorly understood.  The study will collect U/Pb, 40Ar/39Ar
              and Sm-Nd isotope data from critical samples in Zimbabwe during detailed
              mapping traverses.  The results will constitute the first data set of its kind
              from the Zambezi belt and will allow its tectonic history to be determined for
              this first time.  The data will also be significant for Neoproterozoic plate
              reconstructions and understanding the assembly of the central part of the
              Gondwana supercontinent.
