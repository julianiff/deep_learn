Abstract    :
                This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin at
              Madison with the purchase of a  nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. 
              This new instrumentation will enhance greatly  research in a number of areas
              including the following:  physical chemistry, polymer dynamics,  catalysis, and
              biophysical chemistry.    A nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer is
              used to obtain information about molecular  structure (what types of carbon
              and/or hydrogen atoms and/or hetero-atoms are present, what  are the relative
              number of each type of atoms and how are they connected to one another in the 
              molecule) and molecular dynamics (how rapidly are the various parts of the
              molecule moving).   This instrument is essential for any meaningful, modern
              synthetic chemistry research program.
