Abstract    :
              9508996  Hayes      This proposal addresses corticosterone and thyroid
              hormone-regulated gene expression during metamorphosis in two species  of
              anuran, Xenopus laevis and Bufo boreas.  The specific aims are 1) to
              characterize CORT-regulated genes isolated in previous studies 2) to isolate
              other hormone-regulated genes; 3) to further test for thyroid hormone-regulated
              genes in B. boreas; and 4) to determine if thyroid hormone-regulated genes are
              also regulated by CORT.  ***
