Abstract    :
              9508661  Isaacson    The University-Industry Cooperative Research Programs in
              the Mathematical   Sciences are programs designed to establish a mechanism for
              exchange of mathematical   scientists between academia and industry at
              different stages of their careers. These   programs will strengthen the links
              between industry and academia and identify and   encourage new avenues of
              research in the mathematical sciences. The University-Based   Graduate Research
              Assistantships provide the opportunity for graduate students to spend   part of
              their time in the classroom and part of their time in an industrial setting.
              These   awards are a means of contributing to the future vitality of the
              scientific effort of the   nation.   Three problems in nonlinear dynamics,
              acoustic seismology and medical   tomography will be studied by two graduate
              students under the supervision of   faculty and industrial scientists. The
              first problem is to use chaos theory to detect the   presence of a weak signal
              generated by a nonlinear mechanism in the presence of noise.   The second
              problem is to use acoustic detectors on the ocean floor to improve the  
              localization of earthquake sources. The third problem is to improve the
              localization and   prediction of epileptic seizures in children.
