Abstract    :
              9508128  Delaney  This research will measure precisely the ferric/ferrous ratios
              in micrometer-sized areas of a suite of glasses using synchrotron microXANES
              spectroscopy.  Samples characterized by Mossbauer spectroscopy and wet chemical
              analysis will be used to calibrate the relationship between synchrotron
              microXANES measurements and ferric/ferrous ratios in the glasses.  This
              technique provides, for the first time, the possibility of measuring cation
              partition coefficients for ferrous or ferric iron (instead of just elemental
              iron) because measurements of oxidation state can be made in coexisting phases
              on a petrologically realistic scale.  To calibrate the influence of oxygen
              fugacity on the ferric/ferrous ratio of glasses, several glasses will be
              equilibrated at a range of superliquidus temperatures in a controlled fugacity
              atmosphere and quenched to form glasses.
