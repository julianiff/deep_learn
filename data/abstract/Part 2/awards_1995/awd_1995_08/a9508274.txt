Abstract    :
              9508274  Towsley       Wide-area networks pose new communication-related
              challenges  for multimedia applications as packet loss, longer delays, and 
              larger user populations become important factors. While emerging  ATM networks
              provide communication services for supporting such  multimedia applications
              today's internetworked environment and  legacy make end-to-end ATM connectivity
              between two end hosts  unlikely in the foreseeable future.  Research in this
              project  represents a timely and important step in developing the network 
              infrastructure needed to support real-time multimedia applications.       This
              proposal includes a mix of theoretical and experimental  research aimed at the
              design and evaluation of scalable services  for supporting real-time multimedia
              applications in a wide-area  network or internetwork. Specifically, the
              researchers will:  1)  develop and evaluate receiver-oriented approaches for
              providing  scalable reliable multicast services. The fundamental concerns are 
              to understand how to allocate protocol functionality among the  sender and
              receivers, how to use multicast to provide reliable  multicast, and how to use
              application-specific semantic information  in error recovery protocols; and 2)
              develop and evaluate end host  mechanisms, such as playout adjustment  
              algorithms and  special-purpose error-recovery protocols, for enhancing the
              quality  of service attained by several different real-time applications.   The
              researchers will exploit application-specific information about  the component
              applications - in this case their different timing  constraints.  ***
