Abstract    :
              9508799  Cramb    This award provides partial financial support for a U.S. -
              Japanese  Seminar on Clean Steels for the twenty first Century, which is  being
              held in April 1996 in Japan.  This seminar will allow a free  exchange of
              information, extensive discussions, and opportunities  to promote international
              collaborative research.  This is the  fourth joint seminar in a series.  The
              other seminars were held in  1976, 1983, and 1991.  The main theme of the
              seminar is future  production of defect-free steel via near net shape
              processing that  is environmentally benign.  This theme is a radical departure
              from  the past the featured smoke stacks and air pollution.  University 
              scientists and engineers will be strongly encouraged to interact  with
              industrial participants on topics such as new iron production  techniques, new
              casting process, recycling of dust and sludge, and  economic impacts of
              recycling and environmental issues.    This topic has its roots in fundamental
              research, and the  information needed to change the infrastructure of steel
              making via  environmental benign processes is often proprietary.  This seminar 
              will promote free exchange of fundamental information on generic  problems that
              are precompetitive in nature.  These topics are of  major interest in industry
              and academia on both countries.    The Program Manager recommends Carnegie
              Mellon University be  awarded $14,000 for 18 months.
