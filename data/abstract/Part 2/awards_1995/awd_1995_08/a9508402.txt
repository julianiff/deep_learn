Abstract    :
              9508402  Chapman      The PI will modernize and extend his current laboratory
              facilities  and make a series of rock thermal diffusivity measurements to be 
              used in climate change studies.  He will upgrade his equipment by  the
              replacement of the existing microvoltmeter and the addition of  computer
              control, and will incorporate a new needle probe to permit  measurement of
              rocks unsuitable for the present setup that makes  use of a divided bar, and to
              allow measurement of thermal  diffusivity.  The experiments will measure rock
              samples from sites  where well-bores have allowed ground temperature
              determinations  over the last 2 centuries.  These experiments will allow 
              independent assessment of the accuracy of the bore-hole  measurements.  ****
