Abstract    :
              9508199  Shiller  Recent laboratory work has shown that there is a seasonal
              variation in the concentrations of dissolved trace elements in the Mississippi
              River, and limited evidence that other river systems undergo similar seasonal
              variations.  This variation can best be explained by seasonal changes reducing
              inputs to the river system.  The goals of this research are to 1) better
              understand the origin of the seasonal dissolved trace element variability in
              the Mississippi River system, 2) look for similar variability in other smaller
              river and stream systems, 3) lay the groundwork for future trace element work
              which will focus on the effects of erosional regime, rock composition, and
              solution chemistry on dissolved trace elements in streams, and 4) verify
              filtration methods.   Seasonal samples of the Mississippi River and its
              tributaries, as well as other rivers in Mississippi and California, will be
              collected to better define the seasonal effect and determine how widespread the
              phenomena is.  Also, experiments will be performed to detect
              temperature-dependent oxidation of manganese oxides -- a process which may play
              a role in the seasonal cycle.  Researchers will also verify filtration methods
              and develop an easier syringe filtration method which could be used by other
              workers collecting samples for the research.  River samples will be analyzed by
              atomic absorption, flow injection, and ICP-MS.  Characterizing the nature of
              seasonal variability is a vital component of understanding the concentrations
              of dissolved trace elements in rivers.  The results of this research will be
              important for understanding some of the controls on fluvial dissolved trace
              elements, designing and interpreting other basic research aimed at
              understanding fluvial dissolved trace element geochemistry, designing water
              quality programs, and interpreting water quality data.  ***
