                The scientific objective of the proposed research is to determine the
              influence of grain size on intrinsic ductility in nanocrystalline materials,
              which should help to elucidate the deformation mechanism.  Intrinsic ductility
              means defects (cracks, voids, etc.), impurities, or environmental effects (e.g.
               hydrogen embrittlement) which may mask the fundamental ductility behavior. 
              Since the ductilization of nominally brittle intermetallic compounds (by
              creating nanocrystalline microstructures) would be of significant scientific
              and technical importance, the materials to be emphasized are intermetallics and
              intermetallic-matrix in situ composites.  In order to eliminated extrinsic
              factors which may influence the ductility that are induced by a given
              processing route, at least two processing methods for production of
              nanocrystalline materials are selected.  These are (1) mechanical attrition and
              compaction of powders, and (2) crystallization of amorphous ribbons or foils
              prepared by rapid solidification.  Mechanical testing includes compression
              tests for screening purposes, but emphasizes tests with tensile components,
              i.e., miniaturized disk-bend tests and tensile tests.  %%%  This study of
              intrinsic ductility of intermetallics and intermetallic composites as a
              function of nanocrystalline grain size should provide insight into the
              deformation mechanism for such materials as well as determining the optimum
              grain size for ductility and toughness.  This program is a collaborative effort
              between North Carolina State University and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. 
              Special educational benefits to the graduate  students result from spending the
              summers doing research at Oak Ridge.  The proposed research will also be
              carried out under the guidance and interaction with Pratt & Whitney and its
              program on nanocrystalline composites.  ***   s  t      P  P
