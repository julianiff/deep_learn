Abstract    :
              9508597  Wolf       The Modern Analysis Group at the University of  California
              at Berkeley is composed of leading researchers in  most parts of modern
              analysis, including complex analysis,  knot theory, finite and infinite
              dimensional group theory,  topological vector spaces, quantum groups and
              mathematical  physics.  Because of the diversity and depth of this Group  there
              are unique opportunities for the training of graduate  students and for
              inter-action between graduate students,  young scientists, and established
              researchers. The Modern  Analysis Group has a history of close cooperation and 
              considerable success in such activities.       A comprehensive three-year
              program of support for  graduate students and postdoctoral visitors would
              enhance  the group's ability to conduct seminars, accelerate the  completion of
              individual Ph.D. programs, and contribute to  further interaction with young
              scientists near the beginning  of their most productive years.  This will make
              efficient  use of existing resources, and it will enhance the quality  of young
              scientists working in this rapidly growing area of  mathematics.  The resources
              of the Group Infrastructure  Grant would be used to support one half time
              postdoctoral  scholar and several of those graduate students at the most 
              productive segment of their doctoral training.
