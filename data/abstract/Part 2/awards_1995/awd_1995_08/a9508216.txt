Abstract    :
              9508216  Wright    Glacial Lake Agassiz was a huge lake fronting the retreating
              Laurentide ice sheet.  Its southern and eastern arms in northwestern Minnesota
              were occupied from about 11,600 to 11,000 radiocarbon years ago, but following
              a dry period contemporaneous with Younger Dryas interval only the southern arm
              was occupied, from 10,000 to 9,500 radiocarbon B.P.  This proposal aims to
              evaluate the effects of the cold glacial meltwaters of light  18O on the
              climate, vegetation, and small-lake limnology downwind on the adjacent moraines
              by stratigraphic analysis of varved sediments of small deep lakes.  analysis of
              pollen, stable-isotope and trace-element composition of ostracodes, stable
              isotope composition of cellulose in organic matter, and species composition of
              ostracode assemblages will be used along with varve counts and AMS radiocarbon
              dates to establish a dated stratigraphy to correlate with Lake Agassiz phases
              of expansion and reduction.  A site downwind of the eastern arm should show one
              interval of lake effects, of Lake Agassiz on the climate of the adjacent
              landscape.
