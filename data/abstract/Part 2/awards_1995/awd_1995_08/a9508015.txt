Abstract    :
              Terng  DMS-9508015  This project, administered by the Association for Women in
              Mathematics, provides travel support  for women to attend research conferences
              in the mathematical sciences.  The project would allow  partial travel support
              for approximately 75 travel awards over a three year period.  This travel 
              support would enhance the research activities of the awardees and would provide
              increased  visibility for women in the mathematical sciences which may help in
              addressing the problem of  under-representation in the discipline.
