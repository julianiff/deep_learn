Abstract    :
              9508574  Wake  This research involves study of the evolutionary relationships of
              terrestrial lungless salamanders , family Plethodontidae. The proposed work
              concentrates on obtaining DNA sequence data and new morphological data for the
              Bolitoglossini tribe so that explicit phylogenetic hypotheses can be tested at
              several hierarchical levels.  %%%  Not only does this study have value for
              understanding the evolutionary history of members of this group, but knowledge
              of this group will provide information of critical value in developing land use
              and conservation strategies in the future. Several of the taxa involved are
              federally listed species and some others may already be extinct.  ***
