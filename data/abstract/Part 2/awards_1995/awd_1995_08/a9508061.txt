Abstract    :
              SBR-9508061    This dissertation-improvement award supports travel, field
              assistants, and laboratory analyses for a study of relationships between
              cultural traditions and land-use practices in highland Guatemala. The purpose
              of the study is to understand how traditional farming practices reflect the
              local cultural and environmental contexts, and how these practices in turn
              affect the physical environment.  The overall theoretical approach is that of
              cultural ecology.  The empirical research involves both ethnographic and
              physical-process methodologies:  participant observation of farmers'
              perceptions of erosion and their actual erosion-control practices;  formal
              interviews with selected farmers;  field measurements of erosion over the
              year-long field study;  and analysis of collected soil samples using
              measurements of radiation emitted by atmospheric-fallout Cesium-137, in an
              attempt to determine eroded versus non-eroded and depositional horizons within
              the soil samples.  The results of the research should increase our
              understanding of traditional and changing farming systems in a highland
              setting, and contribute to a greater awareness, among development specialists
              and international aid institutions, of the need to examine local needs and
              priorities before initiating particular conservation programs.
