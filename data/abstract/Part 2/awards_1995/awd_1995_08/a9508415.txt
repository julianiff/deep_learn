Abstract    :
              9508415  Thompson       The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Hunter
              College,  The City of University of New York, will purchase a workstation, 
              X-terminals, and a postscript laser printer, which will be dedicated to  the
              support of research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment  will be used
              for several research projects, including in particular:  l. Computing the
              v1-periodic homotopy groups of SO(n).  2. Computing differential Galois groups
              in Hamiltonian dynamics,  determining lax pairs of matrices in Hamiltonian
              systems, and normal  forms in graded Lie algebras.  3. Studying amalgamated
              product decompositions of one-relator groups  with at least three generators. 
              4. Computations of the homology of subquotients of the Lambda algebra,  and
              determining relations among homology operations in the Morava  K-theory of
              infinite loop spaces.
