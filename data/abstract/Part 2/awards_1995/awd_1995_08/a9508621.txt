Abstract    :
              #ATM-9508621   Dixon     This project is a continuation of an REU (Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates) program at NMIMT. It will involve eight faculty
              members in the fields of atmospheric chemistry and physics and provide eight
              students per year with an opportunity to participate in research over a period
              of eight weeks. The program will start with overview seminars and conclude with
              presentations by the students on their work. A special effort is made to
              recruit women and minority students from nearby small colleges and universities
              that have limited research resources. Opportunities for recreational activities
              will add to the attraction of the program. The following research topics will 
              be available to the participants:   Cloud physics: Students will be able to
              participate in field measurements using aircraft to study the formation of
              large drops and processes leading to precipitation;  Cloud chemistry: Students
              will participate in the collection of aerosol particles and the measurement of
              trace species in the samples as well as analysis and interpretation with regard
              to SO2 oxidation in clouds  Radiative processes: Students will use radiative
              transfer models to study the influence of clouds and greenhouse gases on
              climate, and analyze satellite data to determine the radiative forcing due to
              greenhouse gases;  Atmospheric chemistry: Students will conduct laboratory
              studies on the effect of acid deposition on zooplankton, measure the direct
              emission of aldehydes and carboxylic acids from plants,  and perform laboratory
              studies on the effects of electrical discharge on the chemical composition of
              the local atmosphere;  Atmospheric radioactivity: Students will participate in
              outdoor measurements of natural Radon isotopes and analyze samples; 
              Atmospheric electricity: Students will study artificially formed fulgurites
              (tubes of earth fused by the heat of lightning currents); the effectiveness of
              different lightning rod designs, and participate in aircraft and balloon
              measurements of electric  field and precipitation particles in thunderclouds.
