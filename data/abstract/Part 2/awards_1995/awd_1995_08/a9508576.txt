Abstract    :
              9508576  Cumberbatch   The University-Industry Cooperative Research Programs in
              the Mathematical Sciences   are programs designed to establish a mechanism for
              exchange of mathematical scientists   between academia and industry at
              different stages of their careers. These programs will   strengthen the links
              between industry and academia and identify and encourage new avenues of  
              research in the mathematical sciences. The University-Industry Postdoctoral
              Research   Fellowships provide two years of support for recent recipients of
              doctoral degrees in the   mathematical sciences. These awards are a means of
              contributing to the future vitality of the   scientific effort of the nation.
              The postdoctoral fellow will work closely with scientific advisors   from both
              academia and industry.   The postdoctoral fellow will work under the dipection
              of Ellis Cumberbatch at   Claremont Graduate School and Tuncer Cebeci at
              McDonnell Douglas Aerospace. This   research will bring together computational
              fluid dynamics and computational structural   dynamics so that fluid-structural
              interaction problems can be analyzed. The results will be   applied to a
              wing/fuselage/nacelle/pylon configuration corresponding to a wide-body MD-12  
              airplane with a supercritical wing.
