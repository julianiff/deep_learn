Abstract    :
              9508538  Pohm   This SBIR Phase II is for research on the commercialization  of
              memories based on giant magnetoresistive materials.  Test arrays  of a small,
              high-output memory cell will be fabricated and  evaluated for defect statistics
              and performance.  Using the defect  statistics, suitable redundancy and sparing
              strategies will be  developed.  Test structures for evaluating power and data
              busses  will also be built and will be used to measure operating 
              characteristics of the bus designs.  Finally, a subsection of a 16  Megabit die
              will be fabricated for evaluation.
