Abstract    :
              Recent research has detailed a general decline in scientific literacy among the
              general American population and a concomitant rise in the belief in
              pseudoscientific theories.  Pseudoscience includes such views as alchemy and
              astrology.  One could argue that belief in such theories is largely harmless. 
              Yet, in the increasingly complex society that is developing in our country,
              anything that distracts the general citizenry from understanding of the way
              science and technology develop further divides citizens into technologically
              and scientifically literate and those who are illiterate with respect to these
              areas.  Unfortunately, the latter group will become increasingly marginalized
              in our future society.    Under the leadership of Professor Joseph Graves, a
              group of prominent African-American scientists and historians of science are
              seeking to determine how cultural and social factors have impacted the
              scientific literacy of the African-American community.  These scientists have
              committed significant time and energy to being the examination of the role of
              pseudoscience in producing patterns of underrepresentation of African-Americans
              in science and engineering.  This is a crucial issue which, if not addressed,
              could retard all the efforts made by national agencies to reverse this pattern
              of underrepresentation of African Americans in the natural sciences.    As part
              of this study, these interested African-American scientists are meeting in
              March, 1995 in Phoenix to plan a major symposium to address this problem.
