Abstract    :
              The reproducible preparation of gold electrodes modified by bilayers  
              containing cytochrome c oxidase is the goal of this research project  
              supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program. These   electrode
              surfaces will be designed to exhibit direct electron transfer   activity
              between the enzyme and the gold electrode surface, and   functional electron
              transfer mechanisms of oxidative phosphorylation will   be probed using these
              modified electrode surfaces.   The way in which electrons are transferred in
              membrane systems is of   fundamental importance to the understanding of many
              biochemical problems.   In this project model membrane bound protein systems
              will be attached to   gold surfaces and the electron transfer processes that
              occur in them will   be extensively characterized. This will both provide an
              increased   understanding of biological processes and will lay the groundwork
              for the   rational design of electrochemical biosensors.
