Abstract    :
              9508104  Spear  This study involves a systematic analysis of nucleation and
              growth processes of metamorphic porphyroblasts in regionally metamorphosed
              rocks with  a wide variety of P-T histories.  The primary goal is to examine
              the processes of garnet nucleation, growth and breakdown with increasing
              metamorphic grade from the first occurrence of garnet within the garnet zone to
              the occurrence of coexisting garnet and staurolite within the lower staurolite
              zone.  Research will focus on a suite of samples collected from western New
              Hampshire, eastern Vermont, and the Taconic Mountains near the NY- MA-CT
              tri-state area.  For each sample, data on the 3-dimensional spatial
              distribution, size distribution and compositional zoning will be determined for
              every garnet within the chosen volume of rock.  The proposed study will be
              among the first systematic studies to test the idea that garnet nucleation and
              growth processes may vary with metamorphic grade and P-T history.
