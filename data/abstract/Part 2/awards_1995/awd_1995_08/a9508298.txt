Abstract    :
              9508298  Luke       The Department of Mathematics and the Center for  Applied
              Mathematics and Statistics at the New Jersey  Institute of Technology will
              purchase Server which includes  a memory upgrade, mass storage devices, and
              scientific  software which will be dedicated to the support of research  in the
              mathematical sciences, and in addition will employ a  part-time systems
              administrator to oversee the network of  workstations, install software and
              hardware, and perform  routine maintenance tasks. The equipment will be used
              for  several projects, including in particular:  1. Dynamics of Turbulent
              Incinerator for Hazardous Waste  Remediation by Robert R. Barat, John Bechtold
              and Bruce  Bukiet  2. Microwave Heating of Ceramics: Applicator Effects by 
              Gregory A. Kriegsmann  3. Optimizing Matched Field Algorithms for Underwater 
              Communications by Zoe-Heleni  Michalopoulou  4. Dynamics of Multi-Fluid
              Interfacial Flows by Demetrios T.  Papageorgiou  5. Flow in a Collapsible Tube
              by Madeleine E. Rosar
