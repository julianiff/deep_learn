Abstract    :
              9508625  Zwanziger    Studies will be conducted on the short and intermediate 
              range structure in several oxide glass systems, based on  borate, tellurite,
              and phosphate.  Structural features of  the glass transition will be probed, as
              well as the  structural features responsible for various optical and  transport
              properties in these materials.  The experimental  methods to be used include
              one-and two-dimensional nuclear  magnetic resonance, Raman scattering, and
              thermal analysis.  These experiments are expected to reveal significant 
              microstructural details relevant both to fundamental and  applied aspects of
              glass technology.  %%%  Research efforts will be conducted, covering the
              fundamental  and technologically important issues in borates, tellurides  and
              phosphate glasses which will impact significantly in  understanding the
              nonlinear optical and infoared  transmission properties of glasses.
