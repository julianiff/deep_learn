Abstract    :
                 Many realistic image synthesis algorithms have been devised,  but
              unfortunately they tend to be very inefficient, often  requiring hours or  days
              of calculation.  As a result, the  visual cues provided by these algorithms 
              (shading, shadows,  transparency, reflections, etc.) still have not been used 
              routinely by applications requiring visualization, primarily  because they are 
              not supported in real-time on current  generation graphics workstations. 
              However, both increased  performance and greater functionality can be expected 
              in  future generation workstation. This research project  develops efficient 
              high quality image synthesis algorithms.  The project will attack several 
              specific areas.  Continuing  to develop the theory behind rendering so that it 
              has a  sound basis in physics and mathematics continuing the  development of 
              fast hierarchial algorithms based on wavelets  for solving the rendering 
              equation.  Investigating various  hybrid algorithms that combine the best 
              features of the finite  element and Monte Carlo approaches.  Finally
              investigating  various issues that result from the need to handle very  large,
              complex  environements.  The algorithms will be  implemented in an experimental
              image  synthesis system that  is being developed and they will be tested  on a
              variety  of  different scenes and environments.
