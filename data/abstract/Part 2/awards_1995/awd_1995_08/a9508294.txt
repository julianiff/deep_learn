              Vegetation in the Lower Amazon  This project  will investigate the extent and
              ways in which past and present activities of Amazonian peoples have  influenced
              the vegetation of Amazonian forests.  To do this the project will study the
              historical  ecology of the people and plants in the Arapiuns River Basin,
              Brazil.  This region is particularly  suited for learning about the human role
              in shaping a complex and diverse environment.  Species  composition, structure,
              diversity, use, and management will be compared with control forest plots.  The
              hypothesis is that in comparison to the surrounding forest, the study sites are
              distinct in  species composition and structure, have greater potential for crop
              productivity, have a greater  concentration of useful species, and present
              evidence of human-induced enhancement of biodiversity.  The results of the
              research should have important theoretical implications for both social and 
              ecological sciences and hold valuable le ssons for the applied fields of
              conservation, environmental  management, and development.
