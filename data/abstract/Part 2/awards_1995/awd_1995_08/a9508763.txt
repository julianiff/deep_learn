Abstract    :
              The dynamical behavior of interfacial systems is the subject of  this research
              project at Michigan State University supported by the  Analytical and Surface
              Chemistry Program.  Ultrafast spectroscopic  methods using interfacially bound
              fluorescent probe molecules are  applied to the study of defect structure,
              motional freedom of  molecules, permeability of solvent into the interface, and
              energy  migration and dissipation in two classes of well characterized 
              interfacial layers in this work.  Self-assembled monolayers of  alkanethiols on
              gold surfaces, and zirconium phosphonate  multilayers synthesized on metal and
              dielectric substrates serve as  the model systems for developing a molecular
              understanding of the  dynamical properties of interfacial materials.  This
              information is  crucial to the use of these materials in a variety of important
               technologies, including molecular electronic devices and  chromatographic
              separations.  Molecular interfaces play important roles in a range of critical 
              technologies, from catalysis to molecular electronic device  fabrication.  The
              work of this research project is devoted to  developing a molecular level
              understanding of the dynamics of  molecular interfaces using state-of-the-art
              fast spectroscopic  methods.  Information obtained from these studies is
              essential to  the rational design and application of interfacial molecular 
              layers.
