Abstract    :
              9508793  Eguchi  This project will convene a US-  Japan Workshop on Disaster 
              Prevention for lifeline  systems.  The objective is to  provide a continued 
              opportunity for researchers,  designers, and construction  specialists to
              exchange ideas  on the current state-of-the-  art in seismic risk  assessment,
              design and  construction for lifeline.  What future directions should  be
              pursued to improve current  methods, and what mutual  programs between the U.S.
              and  Japan can be initiated so that  the most effective use of  available
              information is  maximized will also be  discussed.    The possible areas of 
              collaboration identified for  discussion include:         -    Planning for
              urban  disaster prevention       -    Systems approach to  lifeline performance
                    -    Soil-Structure  interaction       -    Performance of  underground
              pipelines and  cables       -    Fire  prevention/protection       -   
              Geographical  Information Systems (GIS)       -    Cost-effective  ground
              improvement techniques       -    Development and  operation (including 
              restarting) of safe shutdown  systems.    This workshop is jointly  supported
              by NSF, National  Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST) in the U.S. 
              and Public Works Research  Institute (PWRI), Ministry of  Construction, in
              Japan.  ***
