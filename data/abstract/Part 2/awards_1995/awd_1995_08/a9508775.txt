Abstract    :
              9508775  Avellaneda    The University-Industry Cooperative Research Programs in
              the Mathematical   Sciences are programs designed to establish a mechanism for
              exchange of mathematical   scientists between academia and industry at
              different stages of their careers. These   programs will strengthen the links
              between industry and academia and identify and   encourage new avenues of
              research in the mathematical sciences. The University-Industry   Postdoctoral
              Research Fellowships provide two years of support for recent recipients of  
              doctoral degrees in the mathematical sciences. These awards are a means of
              contributing   to the future vitality of the scientific effort of the nation.
              The postdoctoral fellow will   work closely with scientific advisors from both
              academia and industry.   The postdoctoral fellow will work under the direction
              of Joseph Langsom at   Morgan Stanley Co. and Marco Avellaneda at the Courant
              Institute of Mathematical   Sciences, New York University. The research
              concerns models for the dynamics interest   rates and applications to pricing
              and hedging interest-rate derivative securities, such as call   and put options
              on U.S. Treasury bonds. This activity touches upon several areas of   applied
              mathematics, including analysis of multidimensional stochastic differential  
              equations, linear and nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations,
              numerical modeling   and Monte Carlo simulation.
