Abstract    :
              9508133  Lange  Despite the overwhelming evidence for the role of carbonatite
              melts as metasomatic agents in the mantle, the physical properties of these
              melts are poorly constrained.  Although carbonatite melts are known to have
              extremely low viscosities, their density and compressibility (particularly as a
              function of composition) are completely unknown.  The research goal of this
              study is to provide the first direct measurements of density, thermal expansion
              and compressibility on a wide variety of multicomponent (CaCO vya1
              3-MgCO3-FeCO3-SrCO3-BaCO3-Na2CO3-K2CO3) melts over a wide range of temperature
              (1000-17000oC) and pressure (0-35 kbars).  After developing a model equation
              appropriate to this seven-component system, experiments will be extended to
              carbonatite liquids containing dissolved SiO2, P2O5, and F.  The long-term
              teaching goals include:  the active recruitment, advising and support of
              undergraduates to pursue research for a senior thesis; teaching an upper
              division, required petrology course that allows the students to practice the
              application of calculus and thermodynamics to big-picture, tectonically-related
              problems of magmatism and metamorphism; teaching summer filed camp each year;
              development of a new introductory course that will demonstrate why a knowledge
              of geology has implications for understanding the political and economic
              structure of a developing country, like Mexico.     vya1
