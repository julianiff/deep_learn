Abstract    :
              9508296  Speckman       The Department of Statistics at the University of 
              Missouri-Columbia will purchase computing equipment which  will be dedicated to
              support research in applied and  mathematical statistics. The equipment will be
              used for  several research projects including, in particular:  (1) Topics in
              nonparametric function estimation  (2) Topics in Bayesian analysis  (3) Order
              restricted partial likelihood inferences  (4) Wavelets and image analysis  (5)
              Bootstrap prediction intervals in state-space processes
