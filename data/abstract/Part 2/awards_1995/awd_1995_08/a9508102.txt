Abstract    :
              Title: Plio-Pleistocene tephra correlations between the Turkana Basin and
              Arabian Sea: Constraining Africa climate-evolution hypotheses.  The early
              evolution of hominids may be tied to fluctuations of the climate in Africa, and
              the PIs wish to examine the relationship between climate and hominid evolution
              in the Turkana Basin of East Africa.  The ages of hominid fossils are estimated
              by dating volcanic ash in the same sediments that contain the fossils. 
              Volcanic ashes of similar age are also present in sediment cores recovered by
              the Ocean Drilling Program in the Arabian Sea.  These deep sea cores also
              contain microfissils that record precisely dated climate history dating back to
              the earliest Turkana Basin hominid fossils.  The PIs plan to correlate the
              ashes in the deep sea cores with an existing data set of ashes in the Turkana
              Basin, and to therefore give more precise ages of the hominid fossils, and to
              correlate changes in hominid evolution with changes in climate.
