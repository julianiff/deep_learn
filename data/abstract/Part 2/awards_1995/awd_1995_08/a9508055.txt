Abstract    :
              9508055  Banerjee      The PI will perform a detailed magnetic study of 9 m
              cores from the  Pittsburg Basin, southern Illinois, to determine
              multi-parameter  magnetic proxies for incorporation into an ongoing 
              multi-disciplinary climate change study for this site.  The robust,  internally
              validated magnetic proxies will be integrated with  equally important
              mineralogical, geochemical and sedimentalogical  proxies developed by the PI
              and other colleagues who use Mossbauer  spectroscopy, elemental and isotope
              geochemistry, palynology, and  quantitative grainsize distribution analyses.
