Abstract    :
              9508068  Greene       This grant is for support of students and young
              researchers  to attend the 1995 Gordon Conference on Atomic Physics at the 
              Brewster Academy.  This meeting continues the tradition of  dealing with
              emerging areas of research and major advances in  atomic physics in an informal
              setting including leading  specialists, students and young researchers as
              participants.  ***
