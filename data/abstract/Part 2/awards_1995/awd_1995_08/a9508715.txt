Abstract    :
              9508715  Smith   This research will investigate evolutionary and ecological
              response of woodrats to climatic change since the last glacial maxima.
              Species-specific primers for woodrat ancient DNA will be developed with the
              goal of reconstructing population genetic fluctuations during
              interglacial/glacial events.  %%%  This research in its examination of genetic
              variation in ancient woodrat populations will provide the necessary framework
              to examine the stability of habitats over time, determination of critical
              thresholds for species replacement, and the comparative genetics of populations
              at the periphery versus the center of their geographic range.   ***
