              Wisconsin  - Madison  Dissertation Improvement Research: Resource Use, Economic
              Change and Local Soil Knowledge Among Small-Scale Producers of Ilha Ituqui,
              Para, Brazil  The objective of this dissertation  improvement research is to
              understand the impact of a changing regional economy on local soil  knowledge. 
              The placement of  local systems of ecological knowledge within a broader
              sociological and  political economic framework is critical to their utility as
              guides to future sustainable resource  use.  The Ilha Ituqui floodplain island
              in the lower Amazon will serve as a setting to test  hypotheses.  The study
              will use an integration of human and physical geography methodologies.  Three 
              topics within the people-environment tradition of geography will be addressed
              by this research: local  soil knowledge studies, gendered knowledge, and soil
              quality maintenance.  The study approach  emphasizes the importance of
              evaluating local-level decision-making within a framework of broader 
              sociological and political economic arenas.  The study w ill demonstrate a link
              between economic  change and local ecological knowledge.  This link is a
              crucial connection for understanding  sustainable resource use because how
              small-scale producers of the area maintain soil quality in a  challenging
              flooded environment and under pressure of economic change will provide
              important insights  for other parts of the lowland tropics undergoing economic
              change.
