Abstract    :
              This project will support improvements for the Planktonic Invertebrates
              Collection of Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California,
              San Diego. This Collections has geographic and bathymetric strengths unequaled
              elsewhere in the world.  The Collection includes over 93,500 whole zooplankton
              samples and 10 8 specimens from most regions of the world ocean, with extensive
              and intensive geographic coverage of the Pacific.  It includes more than 30,800
              sorted, identified specimens.  The collection includes a unique and ongoing
              time series of continuous sampling of the Northeast Pacific ocean that began in
              1949.  The collection includes extensive expeditionary collections, as well as
              over 1,780 zooplankton trawls from depths ranging to 4,000m.  Beginning in
              early 1995 holdings of this Collection will be searchable on the Internet.  The
              Planktonic Invertebrates Collection is currently divided into 2 locations. 
              More the 80% of the collection is housed in a structure that has inadequate
              seismic  safeguards and no thermal insulation.  High temperatures (to 34.4
              degrees C) and ext ensive daily  temperature variations (to 10.2 degrees C)
              will eventually accelerate evaporative losses of preserving  fluids, pH
              changes, and could ultimately lead to long term degradation of collection
              specimens.  Prudent management of this Collection for posterity suggests that
              relocation of the Collection to a  new facility is essential.  A building has
              become available to house all of the Planktonic  Invertebrates Collection in a
              single location.  Relocation the collection to this building would  accomplish
              several desirable goals:  (1) Buffering of temperature variations experienced
              by the  samples, thus ensuring long term physical integrity of specimens, (2)
              improvement of seismic safety  through installation of earthquake bars on all
              collection shelving, (3) consolidation of all  Planktonic Invertebrates
              Collection holdings, (4) improvement of access to collection materials by 
              placing them in a central campus location close to research laboratories, (5)
              complete re-organization  of Collection holdings, and (6) provision for future
              growth.
