              Madison  Dissertation  Improvement Research: Environmental Degradation and
              Agricultural Change in Western Sao Paulo, Brazil,1900-1980  The objective of
              this dissertation improvement research is to understand changes in human
              -environment interactions from local and regional spatial scales.  This will be
              accomplished throughthe study of recent changes in specific watersheds to
              explain how settlers and small-holders created, perceived, and reacted to
              changing soil resources.  Local processes will be related to broader changes in
              Sao Paulo and Brazil s political economy.  Environmental analysis and empirical
              historical research will be conducted to determine the social consequences of
              soil degradation.  Soil and fluvial sediment samples will be taken from
              different landscape positions to determine post-settlement soil loss and
              sediment accumulation.  Historical documents will be used to reconstruct
              patterns of land use and land tenure in the area, and collected oral narratives
              will help to understand human perceptions of enviro  nmental and social
              changes.  The research will contribute to understanding the social implications
              of  human-induced environmental degradation
