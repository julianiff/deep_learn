Abstract    :
              9508284  Alexiades  The Department of Mathematics at the University of 
              Tennessee, Knoxville, will acquire high performance  computing equipment which
              will be dedicated to the support  of research in the mathematical sciences. The
              equipment will  be used for several research projects, including in 
              particular:  a) Solidification of multicomponent melts,  b) Computation in
              micromechanics,  c) Development of adaptive codes for nonlinear evolution 
              equations, and  d) Classification of knots and links.
