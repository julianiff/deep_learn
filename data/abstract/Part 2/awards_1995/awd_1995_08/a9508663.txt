Abstract    :
              9508663  Corliss   The University-Industry Cooperative Research Programs in the
              Mathematical   Sciences are programs designed to establish a mechanism for
              exchange of mathematiaal   scientists between academia and industry at
              different stages of their careers. These   programs will strengthen the links
              between industry and academia and identify and   encourage new avenues of
              research in the mathematical sciences. The University-Based   Graduate Research
              Assistantships provide the opportunity for graduate students to spend   part of
              their time in the classroom and part of their time in an industrial setting.
              These   awards are a means of contributing to the future vitality of the
              scientific effort of the nation.    Almost all systems of interest in a
              corporation involve many  interconnected systems and subsystems that impact the
              performance of the  enterprise.  The purpose of one part of this research is to
              investigate  the area of Hierarchical Modeling and Architectures and build a
              tool kit  of models that will combine the best features of analytical  queuing
              theory methodology; the new paradigms of object-oriented  programming
              techniques such as C++; advanced dynamic systems concepts; and  advanced
              operations research methods. A second area of research is a study of how to  
              manage information on a global basis to better understand consumers worldwide.
              This will   be done by working with a database established to facilitate
              learning from research through   cross-country and within-category analysis of
              consumer test results.
