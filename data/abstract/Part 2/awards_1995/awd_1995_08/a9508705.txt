Abstract    :
              9508705  Fieber  The experiments proposed in this study will address control of 
              neural function in the marine snail, Aplysia.  The simple nervous  system of
              this invertebrate is a model for the study of changes in  neural function that
              directly affect the animal's behavior.  The  neural control of egg laying in
              Aplysia is the physiological  phenomenon that will be examined.  The study will
              employ the  technique of single cell voltage clamping, which flows through 
              special channels in a group of neural cells called bag cells.  Two  specific
              goals of the study are:  1) to work out methods for  studying single sodium
              channels to understand how they execute  their role in the neural pattern that
              results in egg laying, and 2)  to identify certain hormones that circulate in
              the body of the  animal during egg laying that may change the way the sodium 
              currents operate.  These studies are the first step in a planned  study that
              will explore the idea that egg laying is dependent on  specific changes in
              these sodium currents.  Such studies have broad  relevance for understanding
              how an animal's nervous system controls  physiological or behavioral responses.
