Abstract    :
              9508783  Pinson    This award supports a one year postdoctoral fellowship for 
              Dr. Haru Pinson to study with Professor T. Miwa, an expert  on statistical
              mechanics at the Research Institute for  Mathematical Sciences at Kyoto
              University and Professor  Kashiwara also of Kyoto University.    Dr. Pinson
              will study the differential equation aspect of  two dimensional statistical
              mechanics on various topics  including the Ising model at criticality on
              Riemann  surfaces. Dr. Pinson has derived differential equations on  various
              statistical systems using conformal field theory.  Professor Miwa and his
              collaborators have also used  differential equations to study statistical
              systems but from  a completely different approach. Thus, the fellowship will 
              enable Dr. Pinson to study and combine the two different  techniques to gain a
              deeper understanding of two dimensional  critical statistical systems.  ***
