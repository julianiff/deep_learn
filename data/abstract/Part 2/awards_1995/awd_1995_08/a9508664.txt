              to visit Drs. Edwin O. and Yoshika O. Willis in  Sao Paulo, Brazil for the
              purpose of preparing a proposal to  study the endemic and highly endangered
              Neotropical avifauna  of southeastern Brazil.  They will combine genetic and 
              ecologic studies with the aim of understanding both its past  evolution and
              future prospects.          ***
