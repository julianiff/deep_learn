Abstract    :
              9508784  Reimer    This award supports a 12-month Japan Society for the
              Promotion of  Science Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Paul Meyer Reimer of the 
              Turner Precision X-ray Laboratory at Goshen College.  This  fellowship will
              enable Dr. Reimer to begin a collaboration with  Dr. Hiroo Hashizume of the
              Tokyo Institute of Technology to  develop new x-ray methods to investigate
              two-dimensional physics:  the understanding of surfaces and interfaces.  This
              project aims  to develop new methods of finding the atomic structures of 
              surfaces and interfaces based on high-intensity x-ray scattering  experiments. 
                The research program is in the spirit of the Program objectives  to transfer
              and exchange scientific knowledge through an  international collaboration.  As
              a postdoctoral fellow, Dr.  Reimer will make measurements and become familiar
              with research  techniques and equipment at the nearby Photon Factory
              synchrotron  in Tsukuba, in addition to other contributions to the research 
              effort.  The fellowship will enable Dr. Reimer to work with a premier 
              researcher, as well as developing personal and professional  connections with a
              wider group of researchers at one of Japan's  foremost research facilities.
