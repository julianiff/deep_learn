Abstract    :
              9508785  Teng    This award supports a 24-month Science and Technology Agency 
              of Japan Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Ho Teng of the  Hawaii Natural Energy
              Institute.  Dr. Teng will work with  Dr. Yuji Shindo of the National Institute
              of Materials and  Chemical Research (NIMC) of the Agency of Industrial Science 
              and Technology (AIST) within the Ministry of International  Trade and Industry
              (MITI) in Japan.  Dr. Teng will join the  on-going research effort led by Dr.
              Shindo and his team at  NIMC that are studying carbon dioxide-ocean interaction
              in  Japan. NIMC has one of the few experimental systems in the  world for
              studying the behavior of the carbon dioxide-water  system in the deep ocean. 
              The primary objective of the  proposed research is to investigate the effects
              of hydrate,  the ocean current, and ocean turbulence on the dispersion  and
              dissolution of the carbon dioxide disposed in the ocean.  It is believed that
              by knowing the hydrodynamic behavior of  the carbon dioxide droplets in the
              ocean, the ecological  impacts of carbon dioxide ocean disposal can be
              examined.  ***
