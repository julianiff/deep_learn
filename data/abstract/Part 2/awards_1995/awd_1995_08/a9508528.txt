              NCR-9508528  University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee  Multi-Sender and Multi-Receiver
              Network Security  Yvo Desmedt    State of the art network security is based on
              end-to-end encryption and  link encryption.  In many security operations there
              are multiple senders  and/or receivers.  The straightforward application of
              link or end-to-end  oriented techniques to network security implies either that
              the required  bandwidth increases dramatically or that a terrible key
              management problem  is created.  Several multi-sender-multi-receiver
              cryptosystems have been  presented previously.  One of these schemes guarantees
              unconditionally the  authenticity of broadcast.  Several schemes have been
              developed in which  the power to use a cryptosystem is shared non-interactively
              without the  need for having a trusted party.  The schemes protect against
              insiders  conspiring with outsiders.  Some of the schemes allow a majority of 
              co-senders to co-sign a document non-interactively without enabling a  minority
              to use the occasion to substitute a fraudulent message.  Others  allow a
              majority of co-receivers to co-decrypt a ciphertext.  A minority  cannot use
              such a decryption process to decrypt another ciphertext.  Different schemes
              allow for different security requirements (e.g. heuristic  and proven secure). 
              Having demonstrated previously the feasibility to  achieve several of the
              original objectives refinements are studied here  including (1) how one can
              detect and correct internal disrupters who jam  the co-production of a
              signature by sending erroneous data (and simi lar  problems will be addressed
              for the joint description of ciphertext), (2)  how to trace those who
              co-signed, in general those who used their share of  cryptographic power, and
              (3) how to improve previously developed schemes  and study bounds on
              performance.
