Abstract    :
              9508630  Wendel   A common natural phenomenon in plants is chromosome doubling
              or polyploidy.  More than two-thirds of all plant species are suspected of
              having passed through one or more rounds of chromosome doubling during their
              evolutionary history, including many economically important species such as the
              wheat, potato, cotton, soybean, and sugar cane.  Chromosome doubling is highly
              correlated with hybridization between closely related species.  One consequence
              of polyploidy is that all chromosomes, and hence genes, become duplicated in
              the new genome, thereby creating "genetic redundancy".  It has been
              hypothesized that this redundancy leads to new gene functions, because one copy
              of each gene is free to change while the other retains its original function.
              Alternatively, perhaps one of the duplicated copies is lost through mutation,
              or perhaps both copies maintain the original function.  There is very little
              known about the extent to which these processes operate in nature or their
              relative frequency.   Dr. Jonathan Wendel of Iowa State University is
              addressing the question, What happens to duplicated copies of genes in
              polyploid plants?  Using tools of molecular biology and a model system of
              diploids and polyploids from the cotton genus, Gossypium, duplicated genes will
              be isolated, sequenced, and compared to each other as well as to copies from
              their non-polyploid ancestral types.  Many different types of genes will be
              studied from different chromosomes with the aim of discovering general
              principles that guide the fate of duplicated genes in polyploids.  Results from
              this research will also help guide the choice of nuclear genes used for
              phylogenetic analysis of closely related species and genera.
