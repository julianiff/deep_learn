Abstract    :
               9508599 Tu  An International Conference on Chemical Beam Epitaxy is being held
              to address current topics in materials growth and characterization including
              several contemporary topics on epitaxy of increasing importance, namely:
              Epitaxy, Chemical Precursors; Characterization of films and interfaces.  There
              are also a number of sessions dealing with physics and device aspects with a
              strong emphasis on fundamental processes.  Additionally there will be an
              opportunity to assess the field, and to establish ties between universities,
              research institutions, and industry.  It is expected that top scientists in the
              field will attend, and that the Conference will provide an effective forum to
              discuss and delineate the critical scientific issues in this research area, and
              to consider and define the approaches and techniques needed to address them. 
              %%%  An evaluation of the progress and status of Chemical Beam Epitaxy and
              related processing, and especially critical materials research issues in
              epitaxy, processing, and the relationship of materials research to device and
              circuit fabrication along with current assessments of the most important
              contemporary research issues in this field will be of great value to the
              understanding and enhanced utilization of advanced materials in the field of
              electronics and photonics.    ***
