Abstract    :
              9508635  Ashman   The objectives of this research are to comprehensively
              evaluate several hypotheses that stem from theories of the evolution of dioecy
              (separate male and female flowering plants) from gynodioecy (hermaphrodites).
              The wild strawberry will be  used as a model system. The PI will obtain
              preliminary data on selection gradients in natural populations by examining
              plant size, sexual and attractive (eg. nectar production) characters. She will
              determine the best breeding design for quantitative genetic analysis, and
              evaluate characters targeted by selection.   %%%  The research should
              ultimately offer new insights for plant population biology and evolution.   ***
