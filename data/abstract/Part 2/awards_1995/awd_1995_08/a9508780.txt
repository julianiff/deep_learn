Abstract    :
              9508780  Hacke    This award supports a 24-month Science and Technology Agency 
              of Japan Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Peter Hacke of the  Electrotechnical
              Laboratory of the Agency of Industrial  Science and Technology (AIST) within
              the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry (MITI) in Tsukuba, Japan. 
              Dr. Hacke will work with Dr. Hideyo Okushi at the  Electrotechnical Laboratory
              examining the physics of the  gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductor.  The
              proposed research  aims to determine the nature of the impurities and defects 
              in GaN that create carrier traps in the band gap that can  reduce device
              performance.  Specifically, the investigators  would like to determine the
              cause of the deep donor levels  known to exist in n-type GaN and examine for
              the existence  of deeper levels.    As a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Hacke will
              have the  opportunity to become familiar with research techniques and 
              equipment at the Electrotechnical Laboratory while  contributing to the overall
              research effort.  Therefore,  this proposal fulfills the objectives of the
              Program in its  exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through an 
              international collaboration.  ***
