              Improvement Research:  Agricultural Change and Its Implications for Land-Cover
              Transformations in Madagascar  The primary  objective of this dissertation
              improvement research is to identify and explain the paths of  agricultural
              change occurring in agrarian landscapes adjacent to natural reserves in
              Madagascar, and  to associate these trajectories of change with spectral,
              spatial, and temporal land-cover patterns  identifiable with remotely-sensed
              imagery.  These forces and trajectories are identified with surveys  and field
              work within representative villages in these landscapes.  They are then linked
              with the use  of remotely-sensed imagery and GIS to their general patterns of
              land-cover consequences within not  only the cultivated areas but within the
              adjacent reserves.  The research will contribute to an  understanding of the
              local-level dynamics that give rise to particular paths of agricultural change 
              and their land-cover impacts.  In addition the research assesses the role of
              one kind of  institutionalized protected area (natu re reserves) on
              agricultural change--a role that has not been  well developed within the
              agricultural change literature.
