Abstract    :
              9508647  DANFORTH  This award will support DNA sequencing of part of two genes
              and the combination of these molecular data with the PI's recent morphological
              analysis of species and species group level phylogeny for the genus
              Lasioglossum (Insecta: Hymenoptera: Halictidae).  Many of the bees in this
              genus are solitary but other species show varying degrees of social behavior. 
              It is believed that eusociality has arisen and possibly reversed several times
              within the genus but the number of times is in dispute.  The phylogeny obtained
              by this study will be utilized to address questions of sex ratios and
              reproductive behaviors involved in the origins of eusociality as well as the
              distribution of social and presocial behaviors among the various lineages in
              the genus Lasioglossum.   %%%  This research will contribute to our knowledge
              of the biological diversity of a large genus of bees in the family Halictidae. 
              These insects are important pollinators, in general, including being the
              primary pollinators for certain crops like alfalfa.  The information on
              relationships among species and species groups in the genus Lasioglossum will
              be used to test basic research hypotheses about conditions related to origins
              of social behavior in insects.  ***
