Abstract    :
              9508537  SHEAR  Professor Shear is a recognized leader in the fossil studies of
              early land dwelling arthropods, including insects, spiders, mites, scorpions,
              etc..  His previous work, dealing mostly with materials from the Devonian
              Gilboa formation, has included several important discoveries and shed
              significant light on the transitions of animal life to a terrestrial existence.
               This award will provide funding for preparation (by hydroflouric acid
              maceration techniques), photographic documentation and comparative study of
              fossil arthropods from two new Devonian sites in New York and New Brunswick. 
              Initiation of work on material from two older Silurian sites is also proposed. 
               Specimens from the Devonian sites are exceptionally well preserved and should
              provide important paleontological evidence of character conditions in extinct
              taxa that will be valuable for polarizing characters for phylogenetic analysis
              of various groups.  %%%  This project will undoubtedly result in important
              fossil finds and contribute to our understanding of extinct communities at the
              important juncture of the transition to dwelling on land.  While Professor
              Shear's scientific contributions are important, equally important is his active
              involvement of students at a predominantly undergraduate institution in the
              research process.  Such contributions to the training of future scientists are
              essential and Dr. Shear is one of the few workers with the background
              specialization to train students in this exciting area.  ***
