Abstract    :
              9508285  Hagstrom       The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the
              University of  New Mexico will purchase hardware and software to better equip
              its  research computing laboratory.   The laboratory will be used by several 
              ongoing research projects in pure and applied mathematics including:  1.
              Cohomology and Geometries Associated to the Sporadic Simple Groups  2.
              Computational Analysis of Wave Propagation Problems with Multiple  Scales  3.
              Multiphase Flow and Interfaces
