Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9508409  J. W. Hoyt    The extension of the traditional dye streak
              visualization technique by using a "continous" string composed of shear
              thickening and drag reducing constituents will be investigated.  The proposed
              visualization method has applications in various flows where previous methods
              have limitations, such as unsteady flows, multiphase flow, large flow domain
              visualizations, turbulent diffusion and mixing.  The method will be calibrated
              for typical flow situations.  Then, various coherent turbulent structures and
              flow macrostructures will be investigated, such as flow through multiple
              cylinders, flow around a single cylinder near critical Reynolds number, and
              flow structures in turbulent boundary layer.  The project will be completed in
              collaboration and with the help of  the University of Bristol, where suitable
              experimental facilities are available to the P. I.    A special niche of
              application of the new method is in the complex flows where the streaklines
              have to be visualized.  The proposed method  provides an alternative to much
              more sophisticated and expensive techniques, and has unique features which can
              be exploited in various situations.  ***
