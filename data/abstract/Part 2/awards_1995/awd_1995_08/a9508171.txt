Abstract    :
              9508171  Banfield  This research will explore fundamental relationships among
              crystal size, structural energy and surface characteristics of finely
              crystalline (nanocrystalline) minerals.  Such nanocrystalline materials are
              common products of weathering and diagenetic reactions, and they account for a
              very large proportion of reactive sites in nature because of their inherently
              high surface areas.  The objectives of this project are to explore the nature
              of crystallization and growth of nanocrystalline materials at low temperatures,
              to quantitatively investigate connections between measured surface energy and
              thermodynamic stability, and to model relationships among surface energy,
              surface structure and reaction rates.
