Abstract    :
              9508075  Baldwin          This grant provides $30,000 as one-half support of the
              costs  of upgrading facilities at the University of Arizona, Center for 
              Thermochronology and Noble Gas Studies, mineral separation  laboratory. 
              Specifically, the upgrades will include a new Frantz  Magnetic Barrier
              Laboratory Separator, upgrade of an existing  Frantz Isodynamic separator to a
              Barrier separator, outfitting one  existing Frantz Isodynamic separator with a
              vertical feed  mechanism, a new vibratory polisher for fission track mineral
              mount  preparation, a microbalance and a research grade microscope with 
              attached CCD camera and video monitor which will be used for one-  on-one
              teaching of graduate students.  The theromchronology mineral  separation
              laboratory serves as the main facility for fission track  and 40Ar/39Ar sample
              preparation.  Both the fission track and  40Ar/39Ar facilities are
              state-of-the-art research laboratories,  and this upgrade of the mineral
              separation facility will  essentially be the first since its establishment in
              the early  1960's.  These upgrades will enable this group to become more 
              efficient and streamline sample preparation to aid in their  research focused
              on thermochronologic evolution of crustal terranes  and experimental
              determination of isotopically important diffusion  laws.
