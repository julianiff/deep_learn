Abstract    :
              9508944  Teleman   The Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships
              are awards to   recent recipients of doctoral degrees in the mathematical
              sciences. These awards are a   means of contributing to the future vitality of
              the scientific effort of the nation. As   researchers in the mathematical
              sciences expand their interactions with other disciplines,   and as the
              interplay increases between the various areas of mathematics itself,  
              opportunities for postdoctoral research and training are becoming increasingly
              important.   The Fellowships are designed to permit awardees to choose research
              environments that   will have maximal impact on their future scientific
              development. The fellowship is   designed to provide 24 months of support
              divided into 18 academic-year months and three   periods of two summer months.
              The recipient may choose (1) the Research Fellowship   option which allows for
              full time support for any 18 academic year months in a three year   period, in
              intervals not shorter than 3 consecutive months or (2) the Research  
              Instructorship option which allows the 18 months of academic year support to be
              taken as   nine months of full time support and 18 months of half time support.
              Not more than two   months of summer support from this Fellowship may be
              received in any calendar year.   Constantin Teleman received his doctoral
              degree from Harvard University and will   pursue research under the guidance of
              Ralph Cohen at Stanford University. The research   will be conducted in
              geometric analysis, specifically in the area of conformal field theory.
