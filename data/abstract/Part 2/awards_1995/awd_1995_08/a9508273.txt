Abstract    :
              9508273  Reddien       The Department of Mathematics at Southern Methodist 
              University will purchase equipment and software dedicated to  the support of
              research in the mathematical sciences.       This equipment and software will
              be used to support a  broad range of research in applied mathematics. The 
              investigators have proposed four projects in the following  areas:  Steepling
              in Upward Directional Solidification  Capillary-Gravity Waves and Wind-Drift
              Currents  The Numerical Computation of Linear Electromagnetic  Dispersive Waves
               Spatio-temporal Patterns Generated by Motile Bacteria
