Abstract    :
                 9508572 Cohen  This research aims at a definitive assessment of doping and
              diffusion effects in organometallic vapor phase epitaxy (OMVPE) with the study
              of GaAs, InP, and InGaAs.  The research emphasis is on atomicl level details of
              nucleation, epitaxy, and crystal dislocation formation.  Studies will be
              conducted to better understand and hence to control: (1) suppression of
              diffusion in order to minimize junction motion, precipitation in heavily doped
              regions, misfit dislocation formation, and (2) enhancement of diffusion to
              produce second phase formation including adjacent phases with potential
              application for lateral devices with different bandgaps.  Changes in
              diffusivity and dopant solubility will be related to Fermi level pinning and
              the orientation of the wafer surface.  The results will be characterized in
              terms of mesoscopic defect structures such as bunching of atomic steps,
              nucleation or suppression of misfit dislocations, and second condensed phase
              formation. %%% This  project will be important to gaining increased fundamental
              understanding of doping and diffusion related effects of compound semiconductor
              materials which occur during their synthesis and processing. An important
              feature of the program is the training of graduate and undergraduate students
              in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. The knowledge and
              understanding of materials, and materials processing resulting from this
              program is expected to contribute significantly to advanced devices used for
              information processing, computing, and telecommunications.  ***
