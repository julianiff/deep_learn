Abstract    :
              9508044  Wong      The PI will perform an experimental program to determine the 
              evolution of permeability and porosity with brittle failure in  rocks under
              triaxial pressure conditions.  The anisotropy of  permeability will be
              determined during cataclastic flow in  low-porosity crystalline rocks and
              porous clastic rocks.  Confocal  scanning microscopy will be used to image the
              3-D complexity of  pore geometry and damage.  Percolation and network models
              will be  used to simulate the hydraulic transport models.  All these results 
              plus acoustic emission data will be used to establish dynamical  links between
              evolution of permeability and micromechanics of  failure in crustal rocks.
