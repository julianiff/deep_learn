Abstract    :
              9508427  Eddy       The Department of Statistics at Carnegie Mellon  University
              will purchase an eight-node compute cluster for  use as a small parallel
              computer. This equipment will be  dedicated to support research in the
              mathematical sciences  and will be used for several research projects,
              including  in particular:  1. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging by William
              F. Eddy  and Christopher Gen  2. Nested Analysis of Variance Directed by
              Evolutionary  Graphs by Bernie Devlin and  Kathryn Roeder  3. Dynamic Methods
              for Modeling Sea Height Anomalies by Ngai  Hang Chan and  Joseph B. Kadane
