Abstract    :
              9508223  Wilkerson       The Department of Mathematics at Purdue University will
              purchase  four high performance workstations. These would be integrated with a 
              fileserver and highspeed networking to form a highspeed computing  cluster
              compatible with the existing departmental network. This  equipment will be
              dedicated to the support of research in the  mathematical sciences and will be
              used for research projects, including  in particular the following projects in
              pure and applied mathematics.       The projects from applied mathematics
              include the 3-D modeling of  flow in porous media, the numerical solution of
              3-D time dependent PDEs  by the gradient-weighted moving element method, and
              the application of  wavelets to fast nonlinear image processing in 2-D and 3-D.
                    Projects in pure mathematics propose to implement numerically new 
              decompositions of classical kernel functions from complex variables, to  apply
              symbolic calculation techniques to problems from commutative  algebra,
              algebraic geometry, and algebraic topology. These projects  share the demand
              for high performance, since in most instances the  current test cases demand
              many hours or days on the available  equipment.
