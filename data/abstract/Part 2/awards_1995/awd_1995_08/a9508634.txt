Abstract    :
              9508634  Holmes   The University-Industry Cooperative Research Programs in the
              Mathematical   Sciences are programs designed to establish a mechanism for
              exchange of mathematical   scientists between academia and industry at
              different stages of their careers. These   programs will strengthen the links
              between industry and academia and identify and   encourage new avenues of
              research in the mathematical sciences. The University-Industry   Postdoctoral
              Research Fellowships provide two years of support for recent recipients of  
              doctoral degrees in the mathematical sciences. These awards are a means of
              contributing   to the future vitality of the scientific effort of the nation.
              The postdoctoral fellow will   work closely with scientific advisors from both
              academia and industry.   Jose Nathan Kutz received his doctoral degree from
              Northwestern University and   will work under the direction of Philip Holmes at
              Princeton and Paul Wright and Pierre   Hohenberg at AT&T. The research will
              deal with optical fiber technology and nonlinear   wave propagation and pattern
              formation in spatially extended systems.  The common   mathematical ground
              linking these areas is the use of nonlinear partial differential   equations in
              modeling wave and pulse propagation in active and disordered media.  In  
              particular, equations of nonlinear Schroedinger (NLS) and Ginsburg-Landau type 
               frequently arise.
