Abstract    :
              9508291  Bergantz  The objectives of the proposed research are to extend
              recently developed, sophisticated numerical models for the generation and
              transport of melts formed by dehydration melting and to apply the results, in
              an iterative fashion, to the well-studied Ivrea-Verbano Zone of Italy.  Linking
              numerical modeling efforts to a well-studied field area is an essential and key
              element in understanding dehydration melting.  Partial melts produced during
              dehydration are becoming widely appreciated as geologically realistic agents of
              chemical transfer.  The mobility of such melts is important in the devleopment
              of granulite terranes and in the distribution of mantle "metasomatic" fluids.
