              Dissertation Improvement Research:  Exposure of Riparian Trees to Coal
              Emissions: Does It Produce Geographic Variation in Water Use Efficiency?    The
              proposed research will elucidate the effects of coal combustion on the
              photosynthesis and transpiration activities of the narrow leaf willow.  Both
              laboratory and field experiments will be used to investigate the effects of
              coal combustion on plant productivity.  Most physiological studies have exposed
              young crop species to unrealistically high concentrations of single atmospheric
              gases.  It is unclear whether these studies contribute to understanding the
              responses of natural vegetation to more complex atmospheric pollutants under
              field conditions.  This study will address this shortcoming by providing a more
              realistic understanding of the roles of two important component emissions on
              the gas exchange properties of the willow.  The study will also provide a
              modern test of  past biotic responses to changes in the concentrations of
              atmospheric carbon dioxide.  The work is intended to fill a gap in knowledge
              between studies at a micro-scale and air pollution modeling at a macro-scale.
