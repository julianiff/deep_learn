Abstract    :
              9508016  Heinz  The high-temperature phase equilibria of mantle materials place
              many constraints upon the thermal structure of the Earth's deep interior.  For
              instance, the melting curve of Fe-Mg silicate perovskite, which is believed to
              be the major mineral in the Earth's lower mantle, places a direct experimental
              bound on the temperature in the lower mantle since we know that the mantle is
              solid.  The melting curve of Fe places a constraint on the temperature at the
              inner-outer core boundary, provided one can take into account the presence of a
              lighter alloying component.  Melting curves of the major minerals from various
              laser heating laboratories are discrepant, and the differences need to be
              understood to be able to aprive at a consensus for the correct melting
              temperatures.  New experiments using the thermal analysis technique in the
              laser-heated diamond anvil cell, developed at the University of Chicago, will
              be used to measure the melting curves of Fe-Mg silicate perovskite, a mixture
              of Fe-Mg silicate perovskite and magnesiowustite, iron, nickel ,FeO, and FeS to
              pressures on the order of 100 Gpa.  it is hoped that the discrepancies, in the
              location of the melting curve in pressure temperature space, between various
              laboratories can be resolved.  The melting curves of mantle minerals can be
              used to place geochemical constraints on the current state and evolution of the
              Earth's mantle.
