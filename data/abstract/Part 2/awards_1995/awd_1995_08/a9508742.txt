Abstract    :
              9508742  Stiller   The University-Industry Cooperative Research Programs in the
              Mathematical   Sciences are programs designed to establish a mechanism for
              exchange of mathematical   scientists between academia and industry at
              different stages of their careers. These   programs will strengthen the links
              between industry and academia and identify and   encourage new avenues of
              research in the mathematical sciences. The University-Industry   Postdoctoral
              Research Fellowships provide two years of support for recent recipients of  
              doctoral degrees in the mathematical sciences. These awards are a means of
              contributing   to the future vitality of the scientific effort of the nation.
              The postdoctoral fellow will   work closely with scientific advisors from both
              academia and industry.   The Postdoctoral researcher will be engaged in a joint
              research effort that unites   researchers at Texas A&M University with a group
              at the David Sarnoff Research Center   in Princeton, New Jersey.  The research
              will focus on the application of techniques in   algebraic geometry, notably
              geometric invariant theory, and computational algebraic   geometry to problems
              in image recognition, image database indexing for content-based   retrieval,
              and computer vision.  The fellow will do original research to develop a theory
              of   equivariant correspondences coming out of questions motivated by problems
              in relating 3-  D objects to 2-D images and vice versa.  The work will involve
              the design of algorithms to   implement the results, as well as an analysis of
              their robustness with respect to geometric   variation.
