Abstract    :
              This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, is 
              directed towards the development of electrochemical methods to study chemical
              and biochemical  problems. During the tenure of this three-year continuing
              grant, Professor Allen J. Bard and his  students at the University of Texas at
              Austin will gain insights into protein structure, binding  constants,
              stoichiometry, and develop biosensors by exploiting the interaction of
              electroactive  agents with biomolecules. Changes in current and
              electrochemiluminescence responses caused  by interactions of biomacromolecules
              with these agents will be used to probe reactions involving  enzymes,
              antibodies, and DNA. In addition, scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM)
              will  be used to detect fast heterogeneous and coupled homogeneous reactions
              and to investigate  electron and ion transport across liquid-liquid interfaces,
              thus allowing characterization of  polymer films and self-assembled monolayers.
                 Electrochemical approaches have been used for generations to measure the
              composition,  concentration, and reactivity of numerous metal, organic,
              biological and semiconductor species.  These techniques are used routinely in
              industrial and clinical industries to make simple  determinations such as the
              pH of water in swimming pools, contaminants in drinking water, and  the
              identification of complex, trace level hormones in the body which signal
              pregnancy.  Professor Allen Bard and his students at the University of Texas at
              Austin have been leaders in  the field of electroanalytical chemistry and will
              be spearheading new analytical and surface  analysis methods useful in such
              fields as biotechnology, environmental analysis, and advance  manufacturing.
