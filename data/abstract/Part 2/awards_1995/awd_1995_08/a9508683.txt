Abstract    :
              9508683  Holl   This project constitutes the initial phase of a long-term study
              of tropical moist forest recovery from human-induced disturbance. The goals of
              this study are to better understand factors limiting the recovery of tropical
              moist forest ecosystems from human disturbance and to develop practical methods
              for accelerating such recovery. Surveys of vegetation, soil, microclimatic
              variables, and seed rain of primary forest, secondary forest, and agricultural
              land will provide baseline data on differences between these habitats from
              which to measure recovery of disturbed habitats. These data will also serve to
              generate hypotheses about factors potentially limiting recovery that will be
              tested following the planning period.  %%%   Strategies for accelerating
              recovery will be tested in small-scale manipulative plots. Initial experiments
              will focus on accelerating recovery by augmenting seed dispersal and
              ameliorating stressful microclimatic conditions. Mapping of land-use types in
              this area will provide a database for development of further studies of forest
              recovery. Jointly, these activities will serve as the basis for developing a
              large-scale research project of tropical moist forest restoration.  ***
