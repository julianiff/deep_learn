Abstract    :
              9508132  Bai      The PI will perform an experimental study of the mechanical 
              properties of Mn2GeO4 to determine the contrast in strength between  the
              olivine and spinel phases of this material, with application to  mantle
              convection.  He will also investigate the influence of water  on the rheology
              of both phases, to determine potential strength  contrasts across the phase
              transition.  Ultimately he will  determine the applicability of his results on
              analogues to the  Earth by a comparison with samples of natural olivine-spinel 
              deformed in the multi-anvil cell.  ****
