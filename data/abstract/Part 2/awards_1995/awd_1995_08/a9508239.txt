Abstract    :
              9508239  Mukherjee       This project will (i) explore new architectures for the
              next  generation of networks employing optical technology, in particular 
              wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM), for wide-area (nationwide)  coverage,
              and (ii) evaluate and stress-test the performance of  these networks by
              employing realistic workload (traffic) models.   This ``almost-all-optical''
              wide-area WDM network will utilize  wavelength multiplexers and optical
              switches in a routing node, so  that an arbitrary virtual topology can be
              imbedded on a given  physical fiber network.  The virtual topology, which is
              packet  switched and which consists of a set of ``all-optical lightpaths'',  is
              set up to exploit the relative strengths of both optics and  electronics --
              packets of information are carried by the virtual  topology ``as far as
              possible'' in the optical domain, but packet  forwarding from lightpath to
              lightpath is performed via electronic  switching, whenever required.       This
              WDM-based network architecture provides high aggregate  system capacity due to
              spatial reuse of wavelengths, support for a  large and scalable number of users
              given a limited number of  wavelengths, and very lenient requirements on the 
              wavelength-tunable optical devices of the individual users.  On a  microscopic
              level, this research will optimize the cost, efficiency  and throughput of the
              WDM routing node.  On a macroscopic level, we  will (a) investigate the overall
              design, analysis, upgradability,  and optimization (including cost vs.
              performance tradeoffs) of a  nationwide WDM network consistent with device
              capabilities; (b)  examine related device issues such as optical amplification,
              fiber  nonlinearities, etc.; (c) study traffic control issues related to 
              switching, routing, and performance management of the network to  develop
              ``adaptive reconfiguration algorithms'' in order to  reconfigure the virtual
              topology when the pattern of offered  traffic changes; and (d) develop optical
              hardware support and  algorithms for  emerging networking services such as
              multicasting.  ***      *******    Darleen Fisher  Program Manager  Networking
