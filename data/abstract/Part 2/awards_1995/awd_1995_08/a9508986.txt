Abstract    :
              9508986  Shores    Oxide scales that protect alloys during exposure to high 
              temperature oxidizing conditions invariably develop stresses  which can be
              large enough to cause the scale to fracture and  spall.  Scale origin,
              magnitude and evolution with time is not  well understood, yet mechanical
              damage to scales is often the  principal cause of failure.  In this work, scale
              and substrate  strains are measured as a function of time and temperature for 
              two nickel-base alloys.  This tests the hypothesis that stress  evolution
              during oxidation is a dynamic balance of stress  generation resulting from
              scale growth and stress relaxation from  creep of the metal substrate.  The
              research has several parts:  (a) obtain experimental stress history data to
              evaluate the  extent to which substrate creep or scale cracking is responsible 
              for stress relaxation; (b) develop a computer model to account  for the
              evolution of scale stresses in terms of materials  properties and scale growth
              mechanisms, considering especially  stress generation during isothermal
              oxidation and stress  relaxation by substrate creep; (c) input to the model 
              experimentally measured stresses and gradients in the scale  thickness
              direction; (d) characterize scale cracking at measured  stresses in terms of
              current theories.  %%%  This research project is important because of an
              understanding of  the origin of scale stresses.  Knowledge of their magnitudes
              and  evolution with time is necessary to characterize scale cracking  and
              spalling.  Such an understanding can provide a rational  design basis for
              improving the performance of scales on high  temperature alloys.  ***
