Abstract    :
              The herbarium at the University of Arizona, with about 315,000 sheets at
              present, is the largest herbarium in the region. It holds the largest
              collection of plants from Arizona and from the state of Sonora, Mexico, and
              significant holdings form all other parts of the arid southwest and
              northwestern Mexico.  A backlog of  some 80,000 specimens has accumulated over
              the course of the herbarium s history.  At the current rate  of accession, more
              than a decade would be required to process this material for addition to the 
              herbarium and for distribution of duplicates to other herbaria.  Much of the
              materials is of  historical significance and at least half of the backlog was
              collected form still poorly known areas  of northwestern Mexico.  Plants form
              this area are poorly represented in other herbaria, including  those in Mexico.
               Access to all of this material will expedite a number of ongoing systematic, 
              floristic, ethnobotanical and paleoclimatological research projects that are
              underway at the  University of Arizona and other institutions. A two-year
              project will be conducted to enable the  herbarium to work through about
              two-thirds of the backlog to be accessioned locally.  This will entail  the
              standard steps involved in preparing herbarium specimens for permanent archival
              or distribution:  preparation of labels from field notes, filing, sorting
              duplicates for distribution to herbaria with  which the herbarium has an
              exchange program, packing and shipping.
