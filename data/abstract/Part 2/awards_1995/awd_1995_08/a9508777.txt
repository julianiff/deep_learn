Abstract    :
              9508777  Brannen    This award provides support for a 12-month Japan Society for
              the  Promotion  of Science Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Noah  Brannen of the
              University of California at Davis.  The fellowship will allow Dr. Brannen to
              collaborate with Dr.  Tadashi Nagano of Sophia University.  Together they hope
              to prove  Petty's conjecture, a statement involving the relationship  between
              the volume of a convex body and that of its projection  body.  The conjecture
              is considered by many to be the outstanding  unsolved problem in the field of
              affine isoperimetric  inequalities.    Dr. Nagano was the recipient of last
              year's Outstanding Research  Award in Geometry from the Mathematical
              Association of Japan.  There are areas in Dr. Brannen's approach to proving the
               conjecture in which Dr. Nagano is uniquely qualified to provide  invaluable
              assistance.  Their collaboration will quite possibly  allow them to solve this
              difficult problem, and will definitely  provide an opportunity for the exchange
              of mathematical ideas and  techniques.  Dr. Brannen hopes that his experience
              in Japan will  lead to fruitful collaborative efforts with Dr. Nagano and other
               mathematicians in Japan.  ***
