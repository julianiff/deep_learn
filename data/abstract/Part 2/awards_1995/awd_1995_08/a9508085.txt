Abstract    :
              9508085  Evans         Under this CAREER award, Dr. Evans will examine the
              relationship between tropical  convection and the large-scale circulation.  It
              has long been hypothesized that the transports of  heat, moisture and momentum
              from the tropics to the extratropics, accomplished by tropical  convection,
              maintain the general circulation.  Dr. Evans further suggests that the degree
              to  which the convection is organized is determined by what is required to
              maintain the general  circulation, with highly organized systems playing a
              large, and necessary, role in maintaining  the Earth's energy balance.  Using
              satellite-based observations, Dr. Evans will classify various  types of
              tropical convective systems ranging from short-lived, disorganized convection
              to highly  organized tropical cyclones and mesoscale convective complexes, and
              then assess their impact  on the general circulation by analyzing the momentum
              and energy fluxes.  The analyses will  employ the gridded fields produced by
              the European Centre for Medium Range Forecasting for  a recent field experiment
              in the tropical Pacific.         Dr. Evans' educational program will focus on
              the recruitment and retention of talented  women at the graduate and
              undergraduate level, primarily through her work with the Women  in Science and
              Engineering Institute at Penn State.  She also will develop a new course on 
              climate modeling which will include special emphasis on current controversial
              topics related to  climate systems study and modeling.  ***
