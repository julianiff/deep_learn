Abstract    :
              9508769  Perline   The University-Industry Cooperative Research Programs in the
              Mathematical   Sciences are programs designed to establish a mechanism for
              exchange of mathematical   scientists between academia and industry at
              different stages of their careers. These   programs will strengthen the links
              between industry and academia and identify and   encourage new avenues of
              research in the mathematical sciences. The University-Industry   Senior
              Research Fellowships provide the opportunity for faculty members to broaden
              their   research perspectives through participation in industrial research
              activities.   This research involves a sabbatical collaboration between the
              principal investigator,   the applied mathematics group of AT&T Bell Labs at
              Murray Hill, and the soliton   transmission group at AT&T Bell Labs at Holmdel.
              The goal of this interaction is to   investigate mathematical issues related to
              implementation of commercially viable, large   scale data transmission systems
              based on the optical soliton concept. This includes, but is   not limited to,
              optimal design of "frequency-guiding" filters currently used to eliminate  
              noise and "jitter" in soliton signals. The proposed research is likely to make 
              substantial   use of  recent developments in numerical analysis and nonlinear
              wave theory. The focus of   the research is a topic which relates to designated
              national priorities, namely the High   Performance Computing and Communications
              initiative.
