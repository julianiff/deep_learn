Abstract    :
              SBR-9508550    This dissertation-improvement award will assist the Student's
              work in a village in northern  India, where she will combine ethnographic
              methods and field measurement to investigate  four sets of issues:  (1) the
              relationships between the spatial patterns of indigenous versus  non-indigenous
              knowledge of tree-management practices;  (2) relationships between tree- 
              management knowledge and the socio-economic and biophysical characteristics of
              the  immediate area;  (3) relationships between access to different sources of
              knowledge and  gender and socio-economic status;  (4) the effect of
              communication with non-village forest  managers on the distribution of
              tree-management-knowledge application among villagers;   and (5) ways in which
              individuals and households resolve discontinuities between knowledge  received
              from different sources.  The Student will undertake a resource and ownership 
              survey, and participant observation and interviews to elicit tree-management
              knowledge and  its sources.  The Student will analyze these data via structured
              qualitative and quantitative  methods.  This case study should contribute to
              the scientific understanding of how practical  knowledge is diffused and used,
              and thereby should contribute to practical attempts to diffuse  "best-practice"
              techniques among local populations.
