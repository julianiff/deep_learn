Abstract    :
              9508459  Seidel       This Career Advancement Award supports a study of  effects
              of radiation damage on the performance of silicon  semiconductor prototype
              pixel detectors.  These devices are  candidates for tracking components in
              detectors to be put  into operation at future high-energy, high-luminosity 
              accelerators.  These devices, with superior resolution,  signal-to-noise and
              radiation hardness are much preferred to  earlier strip-configuration detectors
              now in use in many  experiments.  Being rather a new technology, much R&D needs
               to be done to understand their operating characteristics.  The P.I. will
              contribute to that R&D instrumentation effort.  The P.I. will enhance her
              competence in microelectronics  techniques to improve her ability to make
              important  contributions in future experiments.  ***
