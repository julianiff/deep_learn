Abstract    :
              9508229  TALWANI    This research is to test the existence of a recently
              proposed  400-km-long, north northeast-trending fault system, which is 
              postulated to extend through the Coastal Plain of the Carolinas and  Virginia,
              by acquiring four 8- to 10-km-long high-resolution  seismic reflection profiles
              across its trend in South Carolina.   The objective of the profiling is to seek
              evidence of possible  offsets in a basalt flow (about 600-800 m depth) Jurassic
              in age  and in overlying sedimentary layers across its trend.  A team from  the
              University of Kansas will acquire and process the data.  The  proposed fault
              system is a candidate for the causal fault of the  1886 Charleston, S.C.,
              earthquake.  This research is a component of  the National Earthquake Hazard
              Reduction Program.  ***
