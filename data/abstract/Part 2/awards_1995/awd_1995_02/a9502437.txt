Abstract    :
              CTS-9502437  Y. S. Lin  CAREER    Mixed-conducting ceramic membranes containing
              copper-doped yttria-stabilized bismuth oxides will be synthesized and
              characterized.  These membranes have high intrinsic permeability for oxygen and
              excellent catalytic properties for oxidative coupling of methane.  Thin and
              ultrathin membranes will be prepared by suspension/slipcasting chemical vapor
              deposition and magnetron sputter deposition techniques, respectively.  Oxygen
              permeation will be investigated for different thickness and compositions of
              membranes.  Also, a new type of membrane reactor will be developed for the
              oxidative coupling of methane.  There is potential for the development of
              energy efficient and environmentally benign processes for simultaneous
              separation and reaction using membranes.  The educational plan involves the
              incorporation of materials science courses in chemical engineering curricula. 
              New courses will be developed for training both undergraduate and graduate
              students in advanced materials.
