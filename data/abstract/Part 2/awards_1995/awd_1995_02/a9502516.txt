Abstract    :
                 Over the past 15 years, processor speeds in modern computers  have increased
              at a much faster rate than main memory  speeds.  Thus, relative  memory
              latencies in both sequential  and parallel computers have become quite  large,
              and continue  to increase rapidly.  Such trends form the motivation for  this
              research, which attacks the issues of how to monitor,  analyze and improve 
              computer performance in the face of a  large processor-memory performance gap. 
              Because of this performance gap, it becomes increasingly  important to develop 
              performance monitoring systems that  allow programmers, compiler writers, and 
              system designers to  identify and tune portions of their design where memory 
              overhead is limiting performance.  To accomplish these  goals, this project 
              focuses on several area:  (i) exploring  hybrids of compile-time and run-time 
              software-based  techniques for application memory performance analysis, (ii) 
              combining these hybrid monitoring techniques with dynamic  compilation to 
              implement flexible, low-overhead, detailed  performance tools, (iii) designing 
              and implementing novel,  software-aware, hardware performance monitoring 
              techniques,  and (iv) designing software tools based on this novel  hardware 
              support.    By studying both hardware and software solutions  concurrently, one
               gains insights into the strong and weak  points of each approach.  The end 
              result of this research is  a suite of performance tools that span a range in 
              the level  of monitoring detail provided and the level of hardware  support 
              required.
