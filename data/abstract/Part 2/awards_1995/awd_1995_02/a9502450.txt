Abstract    :
              9502450  Love  This is an award to provide the support this investigator 
              requested in response to NSF 94-101, the National Science  Foundation Faculty
              Early Career Development (CAREER) Program  which has the intent of encouraging
              the early development of  academic faculty as educators and researchers.  The
              research  this  investigator plans to conduct is directed toward improving  our
               fundamental understanding of the biodegradation patterns of  benzene, toluene
              and xylene compounds in an anoxic/aerobic  sequencing batch, suspended biomass
              reaction process for  treatment of wastewater containing these pollutants.  The
               investigator's education plan involves incorporating the  research  procedures
              into courses to illustrate the beneficial  attributes  of combining physical
              and biological approaches to the  engineering design of systems to accomplish
              useful  environmental  goals and objectives.    Results of this investigator's
              research are likely to  improve the  approaches taken toward engineering design
              of sequencing  batch  reaction processes for removal of benzene, toluene xylene
               compounds from wastewater.  The teaching plan she plans to  pursue  is likely
              to produce innovations in the way that  environmental  engineering
              undergraduate courses are taught.  ***
