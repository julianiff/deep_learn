Abstract    :
              DMR-9502675  Clark    Experimental and modeling studies directed toward 
              understanding the  collective behavior of strongly interacting spherical 
              particle systems will be  carried out.  Experiments will exploit the large
              length and  time scales  characteristic of colloidal suspensions of polymer
              spheres  to probe  equilibrium and nonequilibrium collective properties such as
               melting, crystal  nucleation and growth, shear-induced melting and rheology. 
              Experimental  techniques include optical microscopy and digital image 
              analysis, static and  quasielastic light scattering, and x-ray diffraction. 
              The  modeling will focus  on exploring the roles of geometric and topological
              defects  on liquid  structure, equilibrium melting, and shear-induced melting. 
              %%%  Systems of interacting spherical particles (colloids) are of  fundamental 
              interest in condensed matter physics.  They are the simplest  way to exhibit 
              the still poorly understood melting-crystallization  transition.  Colloids 
              exhibit the unique combination of softness of interaction,  slowness in 
              motion, and large spacing between particles that enables  their effective use 
              in the study of spherical particle behavior.  Experiments  involving a variety 
              of optical techniques will be combined with model  calculations to study 
              recrystallization and glass formation as well as the  importance of structural 
              defects.  ***
