Abstract    :
              This project addresses three different areas.  The first is concerned with
              various topics in connection with the construction of local noetherian rings. 
              The principal investigator will consider formal fibers and birational
              extensions, questions concerning rings with low dimensional formal fibers, and
              a closure operation for local morphisms of local excellent rings.  The second
              part deals with a problem on divisor class groups in rings with the
              approximation property while the third part is concerned with a question on
              local-global annihilation of local cohomology.  This research is concerned with
              a number of questions in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.  Algebraic
              geometry studies solutions of families of polynomial equations.  One can either
              study the geometry of the solution set or approach problems algebraically by
              investigating certain functions on the solution set that form what is called a
              commutative ring.  This dual perspective creates a close connection between
              commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.
