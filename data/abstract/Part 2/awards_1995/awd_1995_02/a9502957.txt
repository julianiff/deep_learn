Abstract    :
              9502957  Levine    The proposed project is to add additional hardware
              infrastructure to provide low latency and high bandwidth connectivity between
              the vBNS and supercomputers at each supercomputing center. It will also connect
              network-attached disk arrays to provide very short term storage buffering for
              running the distributed applications. These added components will integrate the
              four independent supercomputing centers into a single distributed teraflop
              computing facility. This integration will provide a testbed for a number of
              development and development projects in applied computer science and
              computational sciences.  ***
