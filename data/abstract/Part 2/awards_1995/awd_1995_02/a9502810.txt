Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Denis Wirtz    This work is aimed at studying a variety of issues
              associated with magneto-rheological fluids.  Such fluids are analogous to the
              more widely studied electro-rheological fluids which undergo dramatic changes
              in their viscous properties when and electric field is   applied.  Many
              applications have been proposed for such materials, such as clutches and shock
              absorbers.  The principal aim of this work is to study the microstructure
              evolution when magnetic field is applied and also when both a magnetic and a
              shear field is applied.  Video microscopy and small angle light scattering will
              be used to probe the microstructure.
