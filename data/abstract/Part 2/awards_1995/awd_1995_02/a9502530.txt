Abstract    :
              9502530  Boulanger  The objective of this research project is to develop a 
              fundamental framework for understanding and describing the  behavior of
              "liquefiable" fine-grained soils subjected to cyclic  and monotonic undrained
              loading -- a necessary step in the  development of reliable design
              methodologies for assessing  liquefaction potential of soils.    The term
              "liquefiable" is used to denote fine-grained soils that  would be considered
              susceptible to severe strength loss during  earthquake loading. The primary
              task towards achieving this  objective is a comprehensive laboratory study of
              select  low-plasticity silts and clays over the wide range of conditions 
              necessary to establish a fundamental framework. The project  includes monotonic
              loading, cyclic loading, post-cyclic monotonic  loading, and consolidation
              tests over a wide range of confining  stresses and void ratios to investigate
              the interrelationships  between the undrained loading behavior and the
              conditions of  initial state, quasi-steady state, and steady state.  It also 
              includes an investigation of the influence of sample preparation  method,
              stress history, and loading path (i.e., triaxial versus  torsional shear) over
              a wide range of void ratios and confining  stresses    The results of this
              study will fill a vital gap in the  understanding of the behavior of
              fine-grained soils during  earthquake loading, and thereby assist in the
              development of  engineering procedures for assessing potential earthquake
              hazards  related to the earthquake loading response of fine-grained soils.   
              EDUCATION PLAN    The objective of the education plan is to equip civil
              engineering  students with a sound philosophy of engineering, a rigorous 
              grounding in engineering basics and fundamentals, and an  appreciation of the 
              complementary roles of theory and judgment.    The education plan covers
              several details which will enhance the  basic strength of the existing
              curriculum, and thereby contribute  to an inspiring, well-rounded education in
              civil  and  environmental engineering.  It includes the following items:  In 
              design courses, have a practicing professional assist in setting  up the design
              project, and then discuss alternative designs at  the end of the course; select
              these and other new course projects  to illustrate the complementary roles of
              fundamental theory and  engineering judgment in the practice of civil and
              environmental  engineering; develop an instructional video on drilling and 
              sampling procedures for site characterization; introduce computer-  based
              data-acquisition systems into the undergraduate laboratory  curriculum; involve
              undergraduates in research projects via  summer employment and independent
              research electives; and  introduce results from recent research in appropriate
              courses  ***
