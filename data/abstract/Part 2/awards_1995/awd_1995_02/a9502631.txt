Abstract    :
              9502631  Hanrahan    This award provides support for a high performance
              giga-flop compute server, a high performance 3D graphics server, a high
              performance image/video/data server, and a high bandwidth network to couple
              these machines together.  The requested equipment will contribute to the
              computational infrastructure of a new computer graphics laboratory.    Many
              national challenges such as  health care, education, manufacturing, and crisis
              management, require graphics and imaging technologies.  The investigators will
              be working in the areas of graphics systems and algorithms, involving research
              in efficient rendering algorithms, high-performance graphics architectures, and
              coupling compression and graphics; in scientific visualization with research in
              volume rendering for scientific and medical applications; in vision and
              graphics with research in the digitization of 3D models; and in imaging and
              video with a focus on the manipulation of image and video databases.
