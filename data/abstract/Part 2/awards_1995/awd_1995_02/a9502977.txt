Abstract    :
              9502977  Koberstein  This investigates two new concepts to increase adhesion and
               modify interfaces in immiscible polymer blends.  The first  concept uses
              polydisperse block copolymers adsorbed at the  blend interface to increase
              interpenetration and  entanglement of the copolymer into the homopolymer
              matrix.  The effects of polydispersity on the critical micelle  concentration,
              the rate of diffusion of the copolymer to the  interface and the interfacial
              tension reduction afforded by  the copolymer will be investigated.  The second
              concept uses  end-functional block copolymers as interfacial modifiers.  The
              concept, coined surface active adhesion promoters, is  based upon the
              end-functionalization of a surface active  block copolymer.  When the low
              energy block adsorbs at the  surface, it brings with it the end group, which
              lies just  below the surface.  When contacted with a polar material,  the end
              groups rearrange to interact or react with the polar  material, bridging the
              interface between the matrix polymer  and polar material, thereby acting as a
              surface active  adhesion promoter.  %%%  The control and polymer interfaces and
              surfaces will lead to  rapid advances in polymer blending, adhesives and
              coating  technologies vital to the science and technology base of US  industry.
