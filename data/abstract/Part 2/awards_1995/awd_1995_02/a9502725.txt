Abstract    :
              NCR-9502725  David B. Johnson      The availability of powerful mobile computing
              devices and wireless  networking products and services is increasing
              dramatically, making  it natural for users to expect to be able to access
              network  resources and to utilize the growing global internetwork at any  time
              and from any where. However, existing internetworking  protocols such as IP,
              ISO CLNP, NetWare IPX, and AppleTalk cannot  currently support this type of
              host mobility. Network applications  generally must be reconfigured and
              restarted when connecting to the  network at a different point, making host
              movement difficult, time  consuming, and error prone.    The objective of this
              research is to develop scalable and robust  protocols for providing  seamless
              support of transparent  internetworking for wireless and mobile hosts.  This
              research  addresses a number of areas in which new support is needed for this 
              goal, including internetwork routing to mobile hosts; routing among  mobile
              hosts in an ad hoc wireless network; internetwork  multicasting to and from
              mobile hosts; and protocol support to  allow higher-layer protocols and
              applications to adapt their  behavior in response to mobility.  The work in
              this project will  consist of designing new protocols, implementing each
              protocol, and  evaluating each protocol using performance measurement and 
              simulation studies over a range of environments and alternative  design
              choices.
