Abstract    :
                  9502123  Conway  This CAREER type award is to support research in cord
              mechanics  applied to biomechanics and in composite structures.  In particular 
              the role of helical construction of biological ligament and tendon  structures
              will be evaluated.  Existing models of tires exclude  some aspects of the
              helically wound wires which may be important to  their failure.  The research
              will attempt to provide better failure  models for the tire industry.  In
              addition report writing  assignments will be incorporated into the
              undergraduate design  curriculae and mentoring will be increased at the
              graduate level.  ***
