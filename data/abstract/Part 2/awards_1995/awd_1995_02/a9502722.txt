Abstract    :
              9502722   The objective of this research is to develop optimization tools for
              solving planning and scheduling problems of significant importance to the
              process industry.  In particular, the following problems are investigated: (1) 
              model formulation to support production and scheduling needs in the process
              industry, (2) decomposition algorithms to exploit special problem and model
              structures, (3) method of modification or revision of production plans to
              accommmdate unexpected changes in demand and/or the production process itself,
              and (4) how to account for uncertainly in solving production planning and
              scheduling problems.  The educational component of the project is focused on
              improving the way in which optimization, engineering design, and production
              planning and scheduling are taught to students. Interdisciplinary new courses
              will be developed while existing ones will be revised.   Successful realization
              of the objectives of this research can produce several valuable results.  It
              will provide production planning and scheduling tools for the process industry.
               It can produce significant savings in production cost to make the industry
              more economically competitive.  Teaching the needs of the process industry to
              students and introducing them to methods of modeling and analyzing such systems
              can pave the way for more future development.
