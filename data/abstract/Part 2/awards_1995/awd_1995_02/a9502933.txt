Abstract    :
                 Energy conservation is an important problem in battery  powered portable
              computers.  The objective of this  project is to investigate    software system
              techniques for conserving energy, using the  knowledge about current workload 
              and application  requirements.    More specifically, the project will:   (1) 
              Develop a systematic approach for evaluating energy  conservation techniques 
              whether they are implemented in  hardware or software. The evaluation will
              guide  the energy  driven hardware and software design.    (2) At the operating
              system  level, develop techniques to  control the devices using the mechanisms
              provided  by the  hardware to modify the behavior of common services for lower 
              energy  consumption.    (3) At the architecture level, design memory
              architectures  to  permit trade-off between performance and energy 
              consumption.    (4) Develop  file systems that exploit information about 
              applications' usage patterns and  the availability of low-  power solid-state
              memory.   (5) At the application  level, design program interfaces for 
              conveying information to operating system  about the usage  patterns and
              performance requirements.    A combination of  simulation and actual
              implementations will  be used to evaluate the techniques  described above.   
              The educational component of this CAREER project will  include the development
              of laboratory-oriented operating  systems courses for  both undergraduate and
              graduate  students. In addition, undergraduate students  enrolled in 
              independent studies will be encouraged to participate in the  research and
              development of software tools.
