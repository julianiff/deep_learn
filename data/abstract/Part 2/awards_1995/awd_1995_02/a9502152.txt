Abstract    :
              The research component involves case-based reasoning (CBR) a  technique  that 
              stores  and later applies  cases  of  known  problems  and their solutions to
              solve new problems.   Since  few  stored  cases  will exactly match a new 
              problem,  most  cases will be related at best by analogy to the new one.  In 
              that  case, it is necessary first to retrieve an appropriate  analogous   case,
               check  to see that  it  matches  the  new  problem  in  some essential ways,
              then adapt it to  the  new  problem  in  such a way as to infer a solution.  In
               storing  and  using  cases,  it is necessary to do some  abstraction,  either 
              at the time that they are stored away for later  use  or  at  the  time
              retrieved, to avoid having to store  large  numbers of very similar but
              slightly different cases.   This  project examines the advantages of developing
              a hierarchy of  abstraction  for  each  stored  case,  a  technique   called 
              "stratified  CBR".  The  stratified CBR  technique  will  be  applied  to  a 
              typical  search task (route  planning),  two  configuration   tasks  (artifact 
              design  and  goal-directed  activity   planning),   and  an   analytical   task
                (legal  reasoning),   in   order  to  test  hypotheses   about   the 
              superiority  of  the stratified CBR technique  and  to  gain  experience in
              using the technique. During the period of  the  grant,  an  educational plan
              will be developed that  exposes  students to the insights, perspectives, and
              tools of  AI  by  (1)  educating undergraduates about AI's basic  methods  and 
              concepts and about AI's philosophical, social, and cognitive  consequences, and
              (2) educating graduate students  in  other  fields about the AI techniques and
              tools applicable to their  fields.
