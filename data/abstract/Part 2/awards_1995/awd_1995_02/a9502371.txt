Abstract    :
              Abstract   Seitzman  GIT   CTS-9502371      The proposed research includes the
              development of non-intrusive combustion diagnostics to be applied to high
              pressure combustion environments such as encountered in gas turbines.  The PI
              intends to model candidate optical techniques in order to evaluate their
              feasibility as high pressure combustion diagnostics.  This approach was
              considered very innovative.  He has a creative educational plan which includes
              the development of teaching abilities, course development, student mentoring,
              and high school and community out-reach programs.  The Panel predicted he would
              be quite successful.
