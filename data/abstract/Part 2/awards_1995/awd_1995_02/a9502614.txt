Abstract    :
                NCR-9502614  Leandros Tassiulas      Wireless will be a method of choice for
              accessing the future  broadband integrated services network.  In wireless
              access the main  problem is to utilize efficiently the limited spectrum
              capacity in  order to accommodate the large traffic demands that will be 
              generated by Personal Communication Services (PCS).  In the digital  network
              there will be enhanced flexibility in signaling and control  to support
              sophisticated schemes.  Dynamic resource allocation  methods should be employed
              for network control in order  to achieve maximum utilization of the system. 
              The fundamental  problem of joint base-station assignment, power control and
              channel  allocation will be investigated here.  Such a problem arises during 
              hand-off, when the configuration of the system changes, as well as  at the time
              of a new connection.  Furthermore it should be solved  in a dynamic fashion
              during the operation of the system and for  system configurations that change
              randomly.  The problem is  formulated as an optimization problem that involves
              continuous and  discrete components.  The traffic capacity is defined as a
              quantity  that reflects the maximum number of mobiles per channel if the 
              optimal allocation algorithm is employed.  Preliminary results for  two base
              stations are reported.  The study of the general  problem with multiple base
              stations is proposed.  Several  approaches are briefly discussed including
              deterministic models for  the limiting traffic capacity, randomized search
              algorithms  including simulated annealing and genetic algorithms, and reuse 
              partitioning.        *******    Darleen Fisher  Program Manager  Networking and
