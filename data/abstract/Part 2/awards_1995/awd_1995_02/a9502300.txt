Abstract    :
              This research is on path delay testing.  Tools and techniques to  enable the
              development and evaluation of practical at-speed delay  tests are being
              investigated.  Test generators, fault simulators,  and techniques for the
              design of design-for-testability (DFT) and  built-in self-test (BIST) circuitry
              are being developed.  Special  attention is being paid to robust delay testing
              of the most  critical circuit paths.  Software tools which provide a practical 
              testing solution for large circuits are being developed.
