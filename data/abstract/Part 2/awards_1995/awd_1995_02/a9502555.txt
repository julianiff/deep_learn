Abstract    :
              9502555  Mullen    This CAREER grant contains two parts:  research and 
              teaching.  The research component concerns three theoretical  projects
              investigating helium 4:  the properties of films at  submonolayer coverages;
              the hydrodynamics and phase  transitions in a novel, low temperature state; and
              the  description of devices using lithographic technology to  pattern helium
              films.  Also planned is theoretical support  for ongoing experiments on two
              dimensional electron gasses  at the institution of the Principal Investigator. 
              The  teaching component is the revision of the Introductory  Physics course for
              majors, including the integration of  computers into the curriculum.  %%%  This

              component concerns three theoretical  projects investigating helium 4:  the
              properties of films at  coverages less than an atom thick; the hydrodynamics

              of devices using lithographic technology to  pattern helium films.  Also
