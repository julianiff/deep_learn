Abstract    :
              9502288  Green  The program of research is intended to strengthen the country's
              research infrastructure through the education of  M.S. and B.S. level engineers
              - those engineers who are necessary for day-to-day operation of industrial and
              research environments - in an emerging field of technology.  The proposed
              research topic, "Self-Aware Optical Elements," will result in advances in
              technology for optical systems.  The unifying feature of the various
              sub-projects described is that they are all intend, as a whole to advance the
              state of the art in manufacture of optical components with integrated sensors
              and actuators.  Through the success of this project, optical systems will
              become more robust because of elements which can measure their own performance.
               Optical technology will therefore become more readily available bringing the
              vast powers of optics for signal processing, computing, sensing and
              communication further from the laboratory table-top realm into everyday use. 
              Resulting advances in MEMS fabrication and device design techniques will be
              important to the emerging MEMS technology field.    Course development efforts
              will be directed towards the integration of engineering design skills within
              the framework of laboratory instruction.  Early efforts in course development
              have resulted in an undergraduate laboratory sequence which teaches engineering
              design as a series of exercises covering fundamental skills necessary for
              successful projects.  Fundamental design skills include communications skills,
              data interpretation skills, and significant practice in approaching open-ended
              problems.  It is emphasized to students that engineering is a creative
              discipline, and solutions to difficult problems come from a combination of
              technical training and ability to anticipate and interpret the vast sea of the
              unknown.  ***
