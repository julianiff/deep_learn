Abstract    :
              This award supports the continued study of certain invariants,  known as local
              Chern characters, defined for modules over  Noetherian rings.  While numerous
              properties of these invariants  have recently been discovered, there are still
              many open  questions.  The main line of study concerns invariants defined by 
              matrices in a free resolution of a module over a local ring,  where relations
              between these invariants and classical results in  commutative algebra have led
              to new interpretations of them,  which, although they are still conjectural in
              many cases, give  much easier methods for their computation.  Another line of 
              research concerns the details of the construction itself, and  gives
              alternative definitions for intersection multiplicities,  leading, among other
              things, to a new approach to Serre's  positivity conjecture.    This research
              is concerned with a number of questions in  commutative algebra and algebraic
              geometry.  Algebraic geometry  studies solutions of families of polynomial
              equations.  One can  either study the geometry of the solution set or approach 
              problems algebraically by investigating certain functions on the  solution set
              that form what is called a commutative ring.  This  dual perspective creates a
              close connection between commutative  algebra and algebraic geometry.
