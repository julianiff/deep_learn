Abstract    :
              Digital audio and video are increasingly common as data that are manipulated in
              computer and  communication systems. The use of information retrieval
              mechanisms (e.g., Mosaic, Gopher) that allow  the exchange and display of
              audio, stills, and video is rapidly becoming a major consumer of network 
              bandwidth and storage. Without filtering mechanisms or hierarchical coding
              schemes one must process a  great deal of data to yield sought information. To
              support future interactive information delivery  services such as
              entertainment, distance learning, home health care, and telecommuting, there is
              a  need to provide efficient means for locating, accessing, and delivering
              enormous amounts of video  content. The research described in this proposal
              seeks to enable fast access during browsing and  retrieval of this video
              content.  The ``fast access'' is proposed to be achieved by a combination of 
              approaches involving: (1) development of domain-specific information models for
              video content, (2)  development of automated information capture for
              hierarchical coding and scalable delivery in the  audio/video domains, (3) use 
              of video query/interface techniques tailored to the information models,  and
              (4) mapping of information content to developed delivery protocols. Anticipated
              results are  techniques and proof of concept for the proposed fast access.  
              Proposed teaching activities encompass  the development of courses to reflect
              the changing needs of computer engineers and the use,  evaluation, and
              promotion of computer-based instructional tools.
