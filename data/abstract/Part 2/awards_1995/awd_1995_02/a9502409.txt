Abstract    :
                    9502409  Lusk  This CAREER type grant will combine theory and experiment
              to study  the influence of applied strain on the morphology of mechanically 
              induced phase inclusions.  The modelling effort will be a continuum  one which
              includes the role surface effects on phase  transformations.  In the
              experimental component of the project,  single crystals of CU-Al-Ni will be
              subjected to a bending moment  and the role of the loading history on interface
              movement will be  observed.  The educational plan will emphasize open ended
              design  problems which combine interdisciplinary training, computational 
              modeling and multi-tier research.  ***
