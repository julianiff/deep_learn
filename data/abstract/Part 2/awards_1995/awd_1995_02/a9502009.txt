Abstract    :
              9502009  Sousounis        Under the Faculty Early Career Development Program
              (CAREER), the  Principal Investigator will perform research on the Great Lakes
              and integrate aspects  of this research into the educational curriculum.  The
              CAREER Program is an  National Science Foundation Program is intended to
              support junior faculty within the  context of their overall career development.
               It combines in a single program the  support of quality research and
              education.          For the research component, the Principal Investigator will
              utilized an  advanced mesoscale numerical model to study the aggregate effect
              of the Great  Lakes on larger scale meteorological systems.  The Great Lakes
              effect weather on a  variety of scales.  While intense lake-effect storms are
              primarily the result of forcing  from individual lakes, larger effects also
              occur in winter as a result of forcing from  all the Great Lakes (e.g. the
              Great Lakes aggregate).  Under certain cold air  conditions, a 2000 km wide and
              3 km deep circulation can develop that significantly  impact weak
              synoptic-scale systems.  The development and impact of lake-aggregate 
              circulations have not yet been studied.  The two primary research objectives
              are to  understand: how lake-aggregate circulations develop energetically; and
              how heat  aggregate-forced circulations depend on synoptic conditions and
              aggregate heating  characteristics.            The objectives of the
              educational component are to: bridge the gap between  classroom work,
              theoretical knowledge and  real-world  problems; give students an  in-depth
              look and hands-on experience on a problem concerning atmospheric scale 
              interactions; provide students with experience in the applications of advanced
              computer  technology.  The educational component will be attacked through the
              development of  homework problems; class projects and research opportunities.
