Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9502141    This effort lays the basis for replacing chlorine used
              for redispersion of supported metal catalysts with a (-diketone.  Previous work
              has shown that (-diketones react with transition metals and their oxides to
              form (-diketonates, and that these can be reduced back to active catalysts. 
              Preliminary experiments suggest that platinum on alumina can be redispersed by
              treatment with hexafluoro-2,4-pentanedione (hfac).  The present study examines
              the redispersion process in detail.  Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is
              used to determine if redispersion goes through an etching, mechanism or a
              spreading mechanism.  Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) is used to
              examine the interaction of (-diketones with metal surfaces and supports,
              including the variation of binding energy with nature of the ligand. 
              Spectroscopic and TPD measurements are correlated with redispersion rates. 
              Studies are done on both model catalysts and real industrial catalysts.   
              Current practice uses chlorine to redisperse supported metal catalysts.  While
              this process is regarded as technologically and economically satisfactory, it
              has some environmental  drawbacks relating both to release of chlorine to the
              atmosphere and the formation of chlorinated dioxins from chlorine residues left
              on the catalyst.  The approach investigated there avoids both of these
              problems, and may do so without any loss of effectiveness.  ***
