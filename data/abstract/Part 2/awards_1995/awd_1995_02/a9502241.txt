Abstract    :
              The PI seeks to explain the disagreement between motions inferred  from
              analyzing incoherent scatter and partial reflection radar  data, as measured
              during AIDA '89.  Data sources come from the  Arecibo UHF incoherent scatter
              radar and Utah State University  imaging doppler interferometry MF radar.  The
              PI will continue  investigating:  (1) scattering mechanisms involved, (2)
              whether IDI  scattering points are turbulent eddies carried by the mean flow, 
              (3) distribution of scattering points and their line of sight  velocities in
              each 3km altitude range, and (4) whether ISR results  are indicators of bulk
              motion, and whether the advection of  temperature discontinuities is also
              subject to gravity wave  influence.***
