Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of rhodium catalyzed  reactions
              for the formation of carbocyclic rings, the application  of the Baylis-Hillman
              reaction to asymmetric synthesis and the  synthesis of a propellane structure
              containing a sigma-allyl  cation. The focus of the educational plan involves
              the teaching of  chemistry by using a modular approach and developing an 
              undergraduate research seminar program.  With this CAREER award, the Synthetic
              Organic Program is supporting  the research and educational plan of Dr. James
              W. Leahy of the  Department of Chemistry at the University of California,
              Berkeley.  Professor Leahy will focus his research efforts on the development 
              of new methods for the catalytic formation of carbocyclic compounds  and the
              preparation of a  theoretically interesting fused-  ring system containing a
              novel carbocation. The focus of Professor   Leahy's  educational plan involves
              the teaching of chemistry by using a  modular approach and developing an
              undergraduate research seminar  program.
