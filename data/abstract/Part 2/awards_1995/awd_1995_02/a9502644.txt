Abstract    :
              In this Faculty Early Career Development Award funded by the Experimental  
              Physical Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, Lucio Frydman of   the
              University of Illinois at Chicago will develop and apply new   multidimensional
              NMR techniques to the analysis of complex solids.  These   new techniques will
              rely on non-Cartesian sampling of time-domain spaces   which will shorten the
              duration of multidimensional NMR acquisitions  and   establish new correlations
              between spin interactions.  These experiments   will also focus on new methods
              of characterization of quadrupolar spins,   which comprise a large majority of
              nuclides which play a key role in the   structures of inorganic solid
              materials.  The techniques will be applied   to characterization of high
              performance ceramics used in the aerospace   industry.  The educational
              component of this program involves integrating   state-of-the-art NMR analysis
              techniques into the undergraduate   curriculum and establishing new courses in
              the graduate Analytical   Chemistry program aimed at providing students with a
              practical background   currently demanded by industry.    NMR has proven to be
              a reliable and powerful diagnostic technique in the   biomedical profession. 
              Similar analysis of solids cannot currently be   accomplished due to the
              different physical interactions in the solid   phase.  Professor Frydman will
              develop techniques that will permit   characterization of solid materials such
              as high temperature ceramic   fibers used in the aerospace industry.
