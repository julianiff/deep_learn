Abstract    :
              NCR-9502615  Vojcic, Branimir      An objective of this research is to assess
              the performance limits  of communications systems employing multiuser detection
              and find  receiver structures with practical complexity that achieve near 
              optimum performance. Topics treated include: multiuser transmitter  precoding
              for synchronous channels; combined multiuser detection  and forward error
              correction; soft interference cancellation and  optimization in multiuser
              detection;  hybrid nonadaptive multiuser  detection and adaptive interference
              cancellation; multiuser  detection design for mismatched channels; limiting
              performance of  multiuser detection and interference cancellation in
              terrestrial,  satellite, and indoor communications.  In the education component
               symbolic computation and visualization software will be used to  improve the
              presentation and learning processes.  Combined  software/hardware simulation
              tools will be used and developed,  involving both undergraduate and graduate
              students.
