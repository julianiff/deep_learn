Abstract    :
              9502184  Przybycien  This project is on research to study protein aggregation. 
              One  area of focus is on the structural characterization of protein 
              aggregates.  This will include the development of new information  on the
              mechanism of aggregate formation, the impact of  environmental conditions or
              process parameters on aggregation,  and the ease of reconstitution of
              aggregates.  Another area of  focus is on the identification of specific
              interaction sites in  protein aggregates.  The ultimate goal is to obtain
              predictive  ability for the propensity of proteins to aggregate and protein- 
              specific strategies for the promotion or inhibition of  aggregation in
              cellular, production and storage environments.  In  addition to this research
              activity, the investigator will enhance  education by engaging in activities to
              produce instructional  innovation, curricular synergy, and educational
              excitement.  ***
