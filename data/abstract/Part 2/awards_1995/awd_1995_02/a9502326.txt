Abstract    :
              9502326  Lu    The  knowledge of constitutive behavior of a powder  compact  is 
              import in the manufacture of many material systems which  involve  the 
              sintering of inhomogeneous particle  packings.  However,  experimental data on
              the constitutive behavior  of  these  complex  systems  are scarce and 
              theoretical  models  predicting  the behavior differ significantly  from  one 
              to  another.   In  this  research project,  a  new  experimental  method  based
               on  noncontact  optical  techniques  will  be  demonstrated  and  further
              developed to gain  a  fundamental  understanding of constitutive behavior of
              powder compacts.  %%%  A  new  experimental  method, based  on  noncontact 
              optical  technique,   will  be  developed  to  gain   a   fundamental 
              understanding  of constitutive behavior of powder  compacts.  The applicant's
              career goal is to pursue teaching excellence  as  well  as  research excellence
              in the field of  Materials  Science and Engineering.  By teaching fundamental
              principles  and  problem  solving skills and promoting  active  learning 
              through   curriculum  innovations,  it  is   expected   that  graduates   will 
               be  better  equipped   to   develop   new  intellectual skills, increase their
              technical knowledge, and  make  technology  innovations that will serve  our 
              societal  needs and national goals.
