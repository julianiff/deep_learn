Abstract    :
              In this Faculty Early Career Development Award funded by the Experimental  
              Physical Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, Harry Floyd Davis   of
              Cornell University will study the physical and chemical interactions   between
              neutral transition metal atoms and complexes and small covalent   molecules
              such as methane.  Laser ablation will be used to produce   sufficient
              quantities of transition metals which will react with a   molecular beam of the
              covalent molecule. Laser spectroscopies will be   used to excite the resulting
              complex in either the van der Waals region   or the insertion intermediate
              region of the potential surface.     Electronic excitation and vibrational
              overtone excitation will be used to   obtain information on excited state and
              ground state unimolecular   decomposition products by measuring angular
              distributions and branching   ratios. Studies of bimolecular reactions using
              different initial   electronic configurations of the transition metal will also
              be   undertaken.  The educational component of the program will involve  
              undergraduates in studying chemical reactions at the fundamental level in   a
              research environment less structured than regular undergraduate   laboratory
              sessions.  Transition metals are important in a wide variety of catalytic
              systems   involving organic and inorganic molecules.  Professor Davis will
              study   the effects of electronic structure and energy in reactions of
              transition   metal atoms with small covalent molecules.   A determination of
              these   effects is important in controlling reactivities and understanding the 
               mechanisms involved in catalysis.
