Abstract    :
              NCR-9502582  Konstantopoulos, Takis    This is a proposal about the development
              of a rigorous approach  toward network management and performance analysis for
              high-speed  networks considering local and global aspects of a network 
              management system.  Local aspects include the design of flow  controllers at
              the edges of the network that take into account the  provision of quality of
              service and the interaction between users  in a network switch.  The
              investigator will extend recently  developed techniques that are based on the
              so-called reflection  mapping, develop testing techniques and simulations, and
              compare  these to existing schemes.    The investigator will also study traffic
              modeling.   He will  develop rigorous methods for validating self-similar
              traffic  processes arising from the operation of an integrated services 
              high-speed networks and use such models in establishing performance  analysis
              methods.    Studying the global aspects of a management system involves using 
              a macroscopic picture of the network currently being developed by  the
              investigator.  The picture strips out the minutiae of the  operation of the
              network, while retaining its dynamic character (it  is not static).  The
              investigator proposes the use of such a  picture by a network management system
              in order to predict,  prevent, and correct undesirable behavior that might lead
              to  degradation of services across the network.
