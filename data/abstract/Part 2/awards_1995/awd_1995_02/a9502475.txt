Abstract    :
              9502475  Ho  This proposal describes a four-year research program whose main 
              objective is to focus on the investigation of quantum and nonlinear  optical
              effects in nanofabricated optical Bragg structures for  novel optoelectronic
              and photonic applications.  It includes:  (i)  realization of a novel Bragg
              structure in semiconductor waveguides  to achieve ultra-broadband reflection
              (equal to or greater than 20%  of the optical bandwidth); (ii) experimental
              demonstration and  study of a new type of optical solitary wave called Bragg
              soliton  that exists in Bragg structures with third order optical 
              nonlinearities; (iii) realization of novel microcavity  semiconductor laser
              structures and studies of quantum effects in  such structures.    The PI's
              education plan includes:  (i) The introduction of a new  design course for
              undergraduate students in the area of optical  communications to enable the
              students to have hands-on experience  with optical communication system; (ii)
              The creation of  opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in 
              research; (iii) The development of a course and textbook on  "Introduction to
              Quantum Electronics" for senior  undergraduate/graduate students.  The PI takes
              a new approach where  the importance of classical mechanics to the foundation
              of quantum  mechanics is emphasized.  ***
