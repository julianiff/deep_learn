Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9502466  Colorado School of Mines  John R. Dorgan    Research
              activities focus on the development of novel hybrid polymer systems for the
              manufacture of advanced materials.  Three research projects are pursued, the
              first pursues the development of fundamental theory useful as an aide to
              processing liquid crystalline polymers into molecular composites and high
              tenacity fibers.  The second research project studies new chemistries for the
              production of polymeric monolayers on inorganic surfaces and involves the use
              of Monte Carlo simulation techniques to understand such systems.  The third
              research area involves the design and characterization of polymeric binding
              systems useful in  new manufacturing process for advanced ceramics.   
              Innovative teaching methods are described which allow the PI to serve as an
              effective instructor in the classroom.  Plans include the integration of
              computers and laboratory exercises into the curriculum.  Additionally, the
              development of teaching methods which allow different types of learners to be
              successful students are pursued.  The educational infrastructure of the
              Colorado School of Mines is greatly improved by having the interdisciplinary
              field of Polymer Science and Engineering represented on campus.
