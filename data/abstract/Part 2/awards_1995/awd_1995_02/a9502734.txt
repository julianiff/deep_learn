Abstract    :
              9502734  Ali  The goal of the research aspect of this work is to propose a
              multilayered network architecture that is robust to future evolution in network
              topologies or transmission formats and bit rates.  This is achieved by
              introducing an all-optical transparent layer in the transport network
              hierarchy.  Such a network must be able to support all types of existing and
              future network services.  The network must also be scalable to handle large
              geographical areas, while having the flexibility to adapt to shifting traffic
              patterns.  The proposed multilayered network architecture satisfies these
              objectives by combining optical wavelength division-multiplexing (WDM) with
              synchronous optical networking (SONET) and asynchronous-transfer mode (ATM)
              networking.    The educational aspect of this proposal focuses n developing and
              coordinating an undergraduate/graduate optical communications/lightwave
              networks curriculum in our department.  The ultimate goal is to prepare, in an
              accessible style using undergraduate level reasoning, a new generation of
              undergraduate students who can fully understand and appreciate the "all
              optical" revolution in networking that fiber optic technology is producing.
