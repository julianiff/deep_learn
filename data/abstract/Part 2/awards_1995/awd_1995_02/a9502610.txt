Abstract    :
              9502582  Murat Azizoglu    This proposal outlines a career development plan for
              the principal  investigator with a coherent integration of research and
              teaching   goals.  The research program addresses important issues in the 
              design of all-optical wide area networks.  The education plan  includes
              development of graduate-level courses on optical  communication systems and
              all-optical networking, integration of  communication networks into
              undergraduate curriculum and  development of a laboratory in which the students
              can  design, implement, and test prototype optical networks.    An all-optical
              network is a network in which the signals remain in  the optical domain from
              the source to the destination.  This  approach eliminates the speed mismatch
              between optical and  electronic devices by avoiding optical-to-electrical
              signal  conversion within the network.  When the electronic processing is 
              limited to the terminal nodes as prescribed, several challenging  problems
              arise which require new and innovative approaches. Among  these issues are
              traffic scheduling in circuit- and packet-switched  networks with Wavelength
              Division Multiple Access, all-optical  interconnection of all-optical LANs,
              dynamic vs. static  wavelength assignment in interconnecting bridges, and
              architectural  issues in interconnected networks. Solution to such problems
              must  take into account optical device limitations, such as laser tuning  delay
              and finite number of resolvable channels.
