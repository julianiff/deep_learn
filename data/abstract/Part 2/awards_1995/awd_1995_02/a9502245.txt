Abstract    :
              Flexibility  and  adaptability of a robotic  manipulator  can  be  achieved by
              incorporating vision and sensory information  in  the  feedback loop. Previous
              research by the PI introduced a framework  called ``controlled active vision''
              for efficient integration  of  the vision sensor in the feedback loop. This
              framework emphasized  eye-in-hand robotic systems (where the vision sensor  is 
              mounted  on or close to the manipulator's end-effector) and was applied to  the
               problem  of robotic visual tracking and servoing  with  very  promising
              results. This research extends the framework  to  other  problems of
              eye-in-hand robotic systems such as the derivation of  depth  maps from
              controlled motion; the vision-guided,  automatic  grasping  of  moving 
              objects;  the  active  calibration  of  the  robot-camera  system;  the 
              problem  of  automatically  detecting  moving  objects of interest; and the
              computation of the  relative  pose  of  the target from the camera. In
              addition, the  new  work  investigates  issues such as the stability and the
              robustness  of  the  algorithms. All the work is experimentally verified  on 
              the  Minnesota Robotic Visual Tracker (a flexible eye-in-hand  robotic 
              system).   This   research   has   potential   applications    to 
              transportation   (e.g.,   pedestrian  detection   and   tracking,  vision-based
              vehicle following), inspection, and assembly  (e.g.,  vision-guided
              manipulation of moving objects).
