Abstract    :
              9502636  Stankovic       This research project will explore the dynamics of
              power  systems and electric drives in the context of dissipative  dynamical
              systems.  Interesting connections between this class of  systems and the theory
              of nonlinear electrical circuits have been  established in the past while links
              to robust control design are  of a very recent origin.  Many control questions
              of interest for  power systems and electric drives can be addressed in this 
              framework, and it is felt that extensions (e.g. for the class of  nonlinear
              periodic systems) are also feasible.  One distinctive  feature of the intended
              approach is that it is deeply rooted in  the physical processes underlying
              electromechanical energy  conversion.  This can be contrasted with the approach
              that starts  from a chosen theoretical framework, and then looks for an 
              application area in which the framework could prove successful.   Design tools
              resulting from this second approach are often  conservative, and decoupled from
              the designer's engineering  intuition.  ***
