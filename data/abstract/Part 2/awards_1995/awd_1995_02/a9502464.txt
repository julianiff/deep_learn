Abstract    :
              The need to design, assemble, and manipulate synthetic models  of  the  physical
               world is common to many task domains  in  science,  engineering, education,
              and medicine. In robotics, attention  has  focused  recently on modular robots
              and modular  robot  tasks.  A  modular robot is one which is assembled from a
              predefined set  of  parts.  Typically, the set of parts is a small set;
              however,  the  space  of  robots that can be built from the parts set is 
              large.  This  research  focuses on creating powerful interactive  virtual 
              environments  that  will  enable  users  to  modify,  study,  and  experiment 
              and  interact with modular robots and  modular  robot  tasks.   This  research 
              explores  the  creation  of  a  software  environment  in  which one can take
              things apart  and  reassemble  them  (perhaps  incorrectly!); design, build and
              experiment  with  simulated physical mechanisms and objects; and in general
              explore  and  manipulate  the environment without being  limited  to  some 
              small  set of anticipated actions. A fundamental requirement  for  such  an 
              environment is that it possess physical solidity  -that  is,  objects  in the
              environment must be treated as  impenetrable  objects. Modeling physical
              solidity in simulated environments  is  extremely  difficult and as yet has
              only been  dealt  with  on  a  special-case basis. The research work in this
              project centers  on  constructing  and demonstrating virtual environments  that
               model  contact,  collision and friction in a general manner.  Topics  of 
              concern  are  fast  compute-times, an  extremely  high  level  of  reliability,
              and the ability to handle a diversity of models  and  environments.
