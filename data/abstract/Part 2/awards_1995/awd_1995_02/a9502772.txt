Abstract    :
              9502772  Parvin  This project will investigate the possible use of coil springs 
              for the support bearings of bridges in order to resist lateral  and vertical
              forces.  The investigation will determine the  resistance of various
              combinations of soil springs and tie-down  mechanisms for static and dynamic
              loads.  Experiments will be  conducted in laboratory on one-third scale models
