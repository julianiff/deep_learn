Abstract    :
              This research is an investigation of techniques for efficient and  effective
              testing of large sequential VLSI circuits.  Two avenues  are being pursued. 
              First is the development of self-initializing  memory elements and test time
              reduction techniques for circuits  employing scan design.  Second is
              development of new functional  test techniques for large sequential circuits. 
              The approach is to  model large circuits as a network of finite state machines.
               From  this model, algorithms for test generation are being developed.   The
              algorithms are being optimized to provide good coverage for  defects not
              modeled by stuck-at faults.  Software instantiations of  the test algorithms
              are being built.
