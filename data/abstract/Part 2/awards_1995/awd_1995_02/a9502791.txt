Abstract    :
              9502791  Zwaenepoel    This award provides support for the acquisition of a
              cluster of shared-memory multiprocessor nodes interconnected  by a high-speed
              network to support research in parallel programming systems, and algorithms and
              applications from a wide variety of disciplines.  The infrastructure will be
              used as a research vehicle for computer systems designers as well as
              computational scientists.    Research projects to be supported include work on
              compiler and runtimes for multiprocessor clusters, high-performance I/O, and
              performance visualization; and algorithms and applications in mixed integer
              programming, molecular dynamics, reservoir simulation, genetic linkage
              analysis, and seismic modeling.  The infrastructure will also be used in new
              graduate and undergraduate courses in multidisciplinary design optimization,
              and parallel computing.
