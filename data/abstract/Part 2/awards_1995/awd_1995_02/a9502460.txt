Abstract    :
              This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported  in the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focusses on the  study of structure
              and defect chemistry at grain boundaries in  conventional and nanocrystalline
              ceramics.  During the tenure of  this three-year continuing grant, Professor
              Tissue and his students  at Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University
              will approach  this problem using laser-excited fluorescence (LIF) techniques. 
               Rare earth ions will be incorporated into ceramic materials and  these local
              probes, which segregate at interfaces during materials  synthesis, will be
              interrogated using LIF.  The objectives of this  research are (1) to
              characterize the structure and defect chemistry  at grain boundaries, (2) to
              determine the utility of probe-ion  spectroscopy for interface
              characterization, and (3) to identify  novel optical properties of rare-earth
              ions in restricted  geometries.  Also during this grant period, Professor
              Tissue will  pursue an education plan that focusses on the development and 
              evaluation of chemistry hypermedia for undergraduate students in  instrumental
              analysis and analytical chemistry.    The ability to probe the structure and
              composition of grain  boundaries and defects in ceramic oxide materials is of
              crucial  importance in materials chemistry and processing.  This CAREER 
              research project utilizes rare-earth based laser induced  fluorescence in the
              development of an enabling analytical  technology with which to address this
              problem.  The educational  aspects of this CAREER project will give rise to the
              integration  state-of-the-art information technology in the teaching of 
              chemistry at the undergraduate and graduate levels.
