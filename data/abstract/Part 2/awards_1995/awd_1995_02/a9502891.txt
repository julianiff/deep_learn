Abstract    :
              9502891  Hwu-Sadwick  Rare earth-phosphide high speed, high temperature
              optoelectronic devices and circuits will be studied.  The growth of
              lattice-matched REP/III-V heterosystems will be undertaken to lay the
              foundation necessary to develop high speed and/or high temperature device
              concepts. Devices to be studied include resonant tunneling diodes and
              transistors and metal-based transistors.  ***
