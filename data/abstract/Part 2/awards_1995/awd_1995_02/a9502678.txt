Abstract    :
                  9502678  Ifju  The broad objective of the research component of this CAREER
              award  is to develop the capability of measuring, in composite materials,  the
              combined effects of various types of residual stresses and  applied loads.  The
              material systems that will be investigated  include typical thermoset and
              thermoplastic type polymer matrix  graphite fiber composites.  To meet these
              objectives, advances in  experimental mechanics capabilities will be made.  The
              educational  plan involves improved visual stimulation in the class room and 
              improving laboratory courses.  ***
