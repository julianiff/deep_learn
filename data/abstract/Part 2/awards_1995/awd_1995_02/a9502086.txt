Abstract    :
              9502086  Appelquist    The 1995 Aspen Winter Conference will devote one week to
              condensed  matter physics.  The focus will be on the physics of reduced 
              dimensionality systems.  The conference will be interdisciplinary,  and will
              bring together leading scientists from academia and  industry to critically
              assess the current level knowledge and what  remains to be learned in the
              future.  NSF support will provide  financial assistance to graduate students
              and young scientists.    % % %    The 1995 Aspen Winter Conference will devote
