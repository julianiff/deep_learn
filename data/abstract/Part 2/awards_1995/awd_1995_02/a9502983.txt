Abstract    :
              9502983  Lotto      This project involves work on spaces of holomorphic
              functions and operators on these spaces.. Particular problems in the proposal
              include the classification of the multipliers and interpolating sequences for
              de Branges-Rovnyak spaces, the boundedness of products of (possibly unbounded)
              Toeplitz and Hankel operators, the relationship of the noncyclic vectors of the
              backward shift to operator ranges, the classification of rigid functions in
              Hardy spaces and the behavior of such functions under composition, the use of
              disintegration of measures in the study of composition operators, the study of
              von Neumann's inequality for three or more commuting diagonalizable
              contractions, the perturbation of commuting operators to commuting
              diagonalizable operators and the cyclicity of the compression of analytic
              multiplication operators to an invariant subspace of the backward shift
              operator.       Hilbert space operators are infinite generalizations of
              matrices. The infinite generalization of a vector is frequently a function and
              for this reason Hilbert space operators are frequently modeled as the operator
              of multiplication on a space of functions. This project involves the study of
              many basic problems of multiplication models for operators acting on a variant
              of Hilbert spaces called de Branges-Rovnyak spaces. The theme that connects all
              these problems is the interplay among operator theory, functional analysis, and
              complex function theory. The interplay provides a richer and deeper
              understanding of all three of these topics than one could hope for by studying
              them individually  ***
