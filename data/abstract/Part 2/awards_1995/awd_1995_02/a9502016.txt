Abstract    :
              9502016  Terwilliger    The goal of this research is to develop a scientific
              basis  for the understanding of nanoscale ceramics with novel  electrical
              properties.  Enhanced electrical conductivity at  low temperatures relative to
              conventional polycrystalline  material is expected due to grain size-dependent 
              nonstoichiometry as a result of impinging space charge  layers.  The effects of
              grain size, temperature, and oxygen  partial pressure on de and ac conductivity
              will be evaluated  for cryochemically synthesized, highly dense nanoscale 
              titanium (grain size < 30 nm), both pure and doped with  donor and acceptor
              solutes.  Impedance spectroscopy and  quantitative microanalysis will be used
              in parallel to  establish correlations between grain boundary and bulk 
              conductivity and chemistry, from which a unified model of  defect chemistry in
              ultrafine-grained nonstoichiometric  oxides will be developed.  %%%  The goal
              of this research is to develop a scientific basis  for the understanding of
              nanoscale ceramics with novel  electrical properties.  Innovative uses of
              active and  cooperative learning, student team work, and peer-assisted 
              instruction will be developed and assessed quantitatively  for several courses,
              with a concentrated effort in  Introduction to Materials Science.  In addition,
              the  possibility of a cross-disciplinary team master's thesis as  an innovative
              approach to graduate training will be  explored.  A long-term objective is to
              provide leadership at  the local and national level in understanding the
              "pipeline"  issues that continue to result in an underrepresentation of  women
              in science and engineering.
