Abstract    :
              9502493  Grant  This is an award to provide the support this investigator 
              requested in response to NSF 94-101, the National Science  Foundation Faculty
              Early Career Development (CAREER) Program.  The intent of this program is to
              encourage the early development  of academic faculty as educators and
              researchers.  The research  this investigator plans to conduct is directed
              toward determining  the effects of biologically produced polymers on the rate
              at  which aggregates form and settle from aqueous suspension.  He  plans on
              characterizing the aggregation process by comparing a  relatively clean system
              using polystyrene microspheres with one  involving exocellular polysaccharides
              produced by heterotrophic  bacteria.  The investigator's education plan centers
              on  modernizing the laboratory component of a core undergraduate  course on
              microbial processes and coordinating this with other  laboratory based courses
              in the environmental core involving  physical and chemical processes.    The
              research this investigator plans on conducting is expected to  be used in
              improving procedures used in the engineering design of  processes for removal
              of particles originally present in aqueous  suspension or produced during water
              and wastewater treatment  processes.  The goal of the educational component of
              this project  is to provide undergraduate engineering students illustrations of
               the fundamental relationships that exist between chemical and  microbial
              systems used in environmental engineer practice.  ***
