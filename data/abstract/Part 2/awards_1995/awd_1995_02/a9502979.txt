Abstract    :
              9502979  Du    This award provides support to develop a prototype distributed
              computing, storage and scientific visualization facility for the National
              Information Infrastructure (NII).  Key elements of the facility include a
              distributed parallel storage system with several physically distributed RAID
              systems with high speed ATM connections and a high-bandwidth disk system with
              direct connection to a FIBER Channel swith, a distributed computing server with
              clusters of high-end workstations and multiprocessors, a high resolution
              display unit, and a high-speed local, metropolitan, and wide area network
              infrastructure.    Projects include technology development in the areas of
              multimedia servers and database servers; network research in the areas of
              network design, control and performance; and research in parallel architecture
              and system software.  Applications areas to be supported include manufacturing,
              healthcare, scientific computing, and scientific visualization.
