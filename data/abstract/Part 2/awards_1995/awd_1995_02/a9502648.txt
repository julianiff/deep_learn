Abstract    :
              9502648  DiMilla  This   project   is   on   research  to  study  
              cell-biomaterial  interactions.   The elements of this research  include:  (1) 
              the  synthesis  of  polysiloxanes in which the rheological  properties  will be
              systematically varied; (2) the further alteration of this  media   by 
              fibronectin  adsorption,  or  the  incorporation   of  biologically  active 
              peptides;  (3)  the  measurement   of   the  motility,  morphology, and
              proliferation of adherent glioblastoma  cells  on  these  materials;  and  (4) 
              the  development   of   a  mathematical   model  to  describe  the  influence  
              of   surface  mechanical  properties on cell behavior.   In  addition  to  this
               research  activity,  the investigator will enhance  education  by  developing 
              a  new  course,  and  eventually  a  book,   on   the  engineering analysis of
              cell and tissue systems.  ***
