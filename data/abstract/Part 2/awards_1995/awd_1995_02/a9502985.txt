Abstract    :
              9502985  Blaisten-Barojas    This   Americas  Program  award  will  support 
              Professor  Estela  Blaisten-Barojas  of  George  Mason  University  in  a  
              research  collaboration  with  Professor Agustin  Gonzalez  Flores  of  the 
              Instituto  de  Fisica  of the Universidad  Nacional  Autonoma  de  Mexico
              (UNAM), in Mexico City.  The researchers plan to engage in  computer modeling
              of colloidal and aerosol aggregation of  binary  and multicomponent mixtures.  
               The  study  of  colloidal  and aerosol aggregation  is  important  because  of
               its technological applications.  From a  theoretical  perspective,  important
              progress has been made  recently  in  the  understanding  of  one-component 
              colloidal  aggregation  through  computer experiments.  However, when the
              complexity of the system  increases   to  better  mimic  real  systems,  the 
              corresponding  computer  simulations  require  high  performance 
              supercomputing  tools.  The researchers intend to pursue the study of binary 
              and  multicomponent   mixtures,  developing   and   implementing   all 
              algorithms  in  massively  parallel  computing  platforms.   This  project 
              will  serve to strengthen collaborative efforts  between  two   groups   of 
              experienced  researchers  in   the   area   of  computational modeling.  ***
