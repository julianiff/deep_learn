Abstract    :
              Dr. Lynn C. Francesconi, Chemistry Department, CUNY Hunter College, is  
              supported by the Inorganic,  Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry  
              Program of the Chemistry Division under a Faculty Early Career   Advancement
              Award to prepare technetium oxide molecules and to pursue a   five pronged
              program to improve the educational experiences offered at   Hunter College. In
              the research component technicium will be incorported   into cage polyoxoanion
              structures of tungsten, molybdenum, vanadium, and   phosphorus. In the
              educational component outside institutional research   collaborations will be
              established and the supervision of undergraduate   research students will be
              delegated to graduate students in order the   improve the relevance and
              vitality of the graduate training. At the   undergraduate level increased
              laboratory participation will be   accomplished by a redesign of the courses
              and the undergraduate research   experience, communication and student
              involvement will be increased in   the freshman course through the institution
              of a workshop approach, and a   new inorganic chemistry lecture course will be
              devised.  Technecium is used as an imaging agent in medicine and occurs as a  
              component in radioactive wastes. This research will produce new compounds  
              which may be valuable both in the imaging application and point the way   to
              substances which can efficiently remove technecium from water   solutions. The
              educational efforts will improve the teaching program at   Hunter College,
              particularly as it relates to minority students.
