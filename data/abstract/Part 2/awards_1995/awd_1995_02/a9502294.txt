Abstract    :
              The goal of this project are 1) determining the communication,  synchronization,
              and architectural requirements for supporting DSM  and 2) developing design
              guidelines to build efficient wormhole-  routed networks for supporting the DSM
              models.  The research is  focused on four research directions: developing
              multicast  algorithms for effective cache-coherency, mechanisms and algorithms 
              for barrier synchronization, techniques to alleviate hop-spot  problems, and
              determining the necessary architectural supports.   Theoretical and
              probabilistic analysis together with simulation  experiments are being used to
              develop and validate the results.    The educational activities of this project
              include enhancing and  strengthening the computer architecture curriculum
              (undergraduate,  graduate core, and graduate research courses), formulating a 
              capstone design course, undergraduate mentoring, and creating  challenging and
              interactive environment for graduate learning.
