Abstract    :
                The classical theory of NP-completeness shows that many  optimization problems
              of practical interest are hard to solve: i.e.,  NP-hard problems that have no
              polynomial-time algorithms (assuming P   is not equal to NP).  A popular method
              for dealing with such an NP-complete   problem is to try to compute approximate
              solutions: i.e., solutions   whose cost is within some multiplicative  factor
              of the cost of the   exact solution.  The focus of this project is to
              demonstrate   that computing approximate solutions for NP-hard problems  is no
              easier than computing exact solutions.  The underlying idea   which is
              exploited, is that of a new probabilistic definition of   the NP complexity
              class, a definition  based on probabilistically   checkable proofs (PCP's). 
              Some of the  major goals of the  project include: (1) To better understand the
              approximability of NP-hard  optimization problems (including cataloging the
              hardness  of approximation of  many problems, improving existing  results about
              the hardness of approximation,  and  understanding the limitation of these
              techniques); (2) To develop  further connections between the theory of  PCP's
              and cryptography; (3) To   improve existing ways of representing data by
              error-correcting codes;  (4) To simplify the techniques used in the proof of
              this new  definition of NP.  The Educational Component of this CAREER Grant
              includes: (a) Development  of CORE undergraduate computer science courses
              (including Theory of Computation  and Applied  Discrete Mathematics); (b)
              Development of a graduate  computer science course and a corresponding text
              dealing with PCP's   and (approximate) complexity theory.
