Abstract    :
              9502470  Goel  The primary objective of this  project is to develop an
              innovative  composite structural system  utilizing open web steel joists 
              encased in advanced fiber  reinforced concrete materials for  improved economy
              and performance  for seismic resistance.  Analysis  and practical design
              procedures  will be formulated.    It is widely recognized that  innovative
              uses of two or more  different materials generally leads  to more efficient
              systems for  resisting seismic forces.  Recent  studies show that structural 
              systems consisting of composite  members made of open web steel  joists encased
              in fiber reinforced  concrete hold great promise,  especially for seismic
              resistance.  In such members composite action is  achieved through interlocking
               effect between concrete and open  web steel joists without shear  connectors,
              and the use of fiber  reinforced concrete eliminates the  need for conventional
              reinforcement  which is quite labor intensive.  Connections are made through
              steel  plates sticking out of the encasing  concrete.  Therefore, this system 
              can be suitable for cast-in-place  as well as precast concrete.    The research
              will begin by testing  half to one-third scale beam-column  specimens under
              combined axial load  and reversed cyclic bending.  The  test results will be 
              used to  develop analytical models for the  member behavior.  This work will be
               followed by analytical studies of  the selected theme structure.  The  last
              phase will include testing and  analytical work on critical  subassemblages
              taken from the theme  structure.  The focus will be on  study of beam-to-column
              connections  behavior and development of  recommendations for connection 
              details in order to achieve desired  performance.    This is a project
              supported under  the year 1 program of the Civil  Infrastructure Systems (CIS) 
              solicitation NSF 94-154.  ***
