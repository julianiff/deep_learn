Abstract    :
                     This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation
              Research Program.  This is a study of the factors contributing to the incidence
              and prominence of private pensions as well as the relation between private and
              public pensions.  Theoretical issues deal with the role of  old age pensions in
              the growth and transformation of the welfare state.  Countries compared are
              Belgium, Canada, Denmark, the United States, and New Zealand.  Analysis is
              based on systematic qualitiative comparisons, case studies, and quantitative
              cross-sectional data from 1960 to 1990.  %%%   This research will contribute to
              the sociological understanding of  the origins and effects of pension policies
              and the changing nature of the welfare state.  By examining alternative
              policies adopted by different states and the implications that follow from
              these, the findings should be useful to policy makers concerned about the
              growth of pension entitlements.  In addition to the scientific gains to be
              achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a highly promising
              student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes
              to the future scientific manpower of the nation and the thorough training of
              the next generation of social scientists.
