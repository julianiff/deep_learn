Abstract    :
              9502121  Liang  This project is on research to further the technological 
              development of magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy  techniques.  It is
              aimed at optimizing the data acquisition  and processing methods so as to
              provide sufficient spatial  resolution, temporal resolution, and
              signal-to-noise for the  study of complex brain functions.  Specifically, this 
              research will seek to develop two novel methods: one for  three-dimensional
              continuous imaging and the other for high-  resolution metabolic imaging.  ***
