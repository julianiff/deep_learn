              CAREER: Planning, Execution, and Learning in Autonomous Robotic  Agents   
              Autonomous robotic agents need the ability to plan for and  achieve high-level
              tasks. Current agents can achieve low-level  execution goals such as object
              avoidance, but lack the ability to  reason about and to carry out multiple
              interacting tasks.  Integrating planning and execution by a robot is a complex
              task,  requiring learning from prior experience to improve significantly  the
              overall capabilities of the intelligent agent. We will  explore the integration
              of planning, execution, and learning,  where the robot's successes and failures
              are incorporated into a  knowledge base to improve future goal-achievement
              performance.  This project entails the investigation of a variety of system and
               knowledge engineering issues, including: communication between  the planner
              and the executor; interaction between the robotic  agent, the planning system,
              and the human user who may, at any  time, request that certain tasks be
              performed; and gathering and  interpretation of information to learn from
              experience.  The  scientific goal underlying this research is to understand the
              use  of past experience to solve problems in complex situations  affected by
              multiple factors with different degrees of  controllability and
              interdependency.  Even partial achievement of  this goal could be of great
              significance to both the robotics and  cognitive science or artificial
              intelligence research  communities, bridging the representation and reasoning
              gap  between high level planner-learner and autonomous agent executing  tasks
              in the real world
