Abstract    :
              This research involves the development of efficient, reliable, and  real-time
              realizable coding algorithms and techniques for  compressing and transporting
              audio-visual signals, targeting  particularly the visual-telephone application.
              For a total channel  bit-rate of 64 kb/s or less, our goal is to achieve
              superior  grade-of-service by treating the compression of the audio (speech) 
              and video signals as an integrated problem. Our thrust centers  around the use
              of vector quantization techniques, and schemes that  jointly optimize the
              signal analysis and quantization functions. We  place particular emphasis on
              finding an efficient representation of  the displacement ("motion") field for
              motion compensated prediction  of the video signal. To facilitate personal
              wireless  communications, we are exploring adaptive coding schemes that 
              exploit the prioritized transmission of encoded data. For  compressing speech
              signals, we are exploring variable rate coding  schemes, and are allocating
              bits  between the speech and video signals to optimize the overall 
              grade-of-service. Achieving our goal would give significant impetus  to the
              development of the emergent Information Superhighway, which  can form part  of
              an infrastructure for supporting high performance computing.    Educational
              activities undertaken in conjunction with the above  research include but are
              not exclusive to: the development of  undergraduate digital signal processing
              laboratory courses; the  introduction of graduate courses in the area of
              audio-visual  information processing and communications; increasing the use of 
              computer-based multimedia instruction in the classroom; assisting  in speeding
              up the digitization of the library and networking of  its databases.
