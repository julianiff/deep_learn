Abstract    :
                 The project will create operating system support and a  programming 
              environment for developing and maintaining long-running  parallel  and 
              distributed applications that are continually evolving, such  as automated 
              manufacturing and scientific computation. Supporting changes  at runtime 
              requires an efficient, dynamic reconfiguration  facility and  an extensible 
              programming environment.  The scope of the research includes  building  toolkit
               at the system level, end-user environment for  developing  applications 
              including algorithm design, prototyping, and  evaluation of the  efficiency and
               usefulness of the facility. The toolkit will  utilize  partial-order semantics
               and is based on the  hierarchical  state machine  formalism. The programming 
              environment is based on a  scalable software  architecture for specifying and 
              verifying application  behavior.    The educational component of the CAREER 
              project will develop  advanced and  introductory courses, and computer 
              laboratories on parallel  processing.  These developments, present  effective 
              venue for providing  advanced  education and research training to graduate and 
              undergraduate minority  students and equipping them to meet challenges in a 
              world  that is  increasingly dependent on distributed computer systems.
