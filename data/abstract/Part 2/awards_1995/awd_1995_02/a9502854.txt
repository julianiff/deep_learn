Abstract    :
                Coleman  9502854   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              addresses the problem of integrating high efficiency conventional power sources
              with renewable power sources in support of operations at remote cold regions
              research bases and communities.  Specific research focus is on the rigid
              operating requirements and environmental constraints at the Amundsen-Scott
              South Pole Station of the United States Antarctic Program for which a major
              infrastructure redevelopment is being planned.   The overall objective of the
              project is to provide a plan for renewable energy integration at the South Pole
              Station that serves as a model for other applications.  The project will
              address and document in a comprehensive manner integration issues such as
              intelligent power systems management and dispersed hybrid power system layout. 
              Wind power will be the subject renewable power source but system design will
              accommodate other sources such as photovoltaic arrays.  The work will include
              data gathering, hardware qualification, engineering , and planning activities.
