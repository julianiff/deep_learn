Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9502276    A Combined research and educational program is proposed
              in the area of colloid science and engineering.  The main objectives are
              understanding the role of electric field on material behavior, and determining
              the rheology properties of non-Brownian suspensions.  Modeling efforts are
              designed to reveal controlling mechanisms, and make connections between the
              underlying mechanisms, relevant physical properties and macroscopic behavior. 
              Experiments on well-characterized electrorheological fluids will be performed. 
              A variety of undergraduate and graduate student courses and activities are
              planned in the area of particulate, multiphase flow and interfacial phenomena
              at the University of Wisconsin.  ***
