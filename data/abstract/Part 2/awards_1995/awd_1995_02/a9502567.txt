Abstract    :
              9502567  Strganac  This is a career award for young  engineering investigators. 
              A  program of  research and associated  education is undertaken which  examines
              the dynamic interaction of  fluids, structures, and control  systems are
              insufficient because  these systems inherently contain  structural and
              flow-induced  nonlinearities.  The nonlinearities  result from unsteady flow
              sources,  large strain-displacement  conditions, and partial loss of 
              structural or control integrity,  and, as a consequence, these  systems exhibit
              nonlinear dynamic  response characteristics such as  limit cycle oscillations,
              internal  resonances, and chaotic motions.    This project consists of both 
              theoretical and experimental  elements.  Research objectives  include the
              development of an  analytical model for the nonlinear  fluid-structure-control
              system, the  development of adaptive control  models for the fluid-structure- 
              control system with time-varying  distributed parameters, and the  supporting
              investigation through  several experiments developed to  substantiate and
              improve the  theoretical models.  Two analytical  models will be used as a
              basis for  the theoretical research: a  nonlinear aeroelastic system 
              constrained to finite modes of  motion, and is a structural system  exposed to
              fluid flow and  distributed damage of the control  system.  Experiments will be
               carried out to investigate the  active control with distributed  actuators and
              the adaptive control  of time-varying control systems.  Innovative methods to
              measure and  identify system characteristics and  stability behavior will also
              be  explored.  ***
