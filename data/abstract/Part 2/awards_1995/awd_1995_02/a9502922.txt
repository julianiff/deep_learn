Abstract    :
              Cooke  DMS-9502922    Cooke will study systems of equations with multiple
              delays.  Existence of periodic solutions will be proved for some systems
              satisfying a suitably defined negative feedback condition.  A new method for
              finding periodic solutions of difference equations, or establishing that there
              are no such solutions, will be exploited.  A second part of the project will be
              the study of mathematical models for the description of biological phenomena. 
              One model describes the transmission of infectious diseases within a
              population.  It will be analyzed to determine the effect of incubation and
              infectious periods.  Lastly, a general model for the interaction of the immune
              system with an invading virus in human tissue will be studied.    Differential
              equations form the backbone of mathematical modeling in the biological
              sciences.  Phenomena which involve continuous change such as that seen in
              motion, materials and energy are known to obey certain general laws which are
              expressible in terms of the interactions and relationships between partial
              derivatives.  The key role of mathematics is not only to state the
              relationships, but also to extract qualitative and quantitative meaning from
              them.
