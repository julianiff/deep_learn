Abstract    :
               9502645   Truszczynski   This award provides support for the acquisition of a
              high-performance distributed cluster-based computing system consisting of a
              number of high-performance multiprocessor workstations interconnected by a
              high-speed LAN.  These LAN-connected clusters will themselves be interconnected
              by a high-speed ATM backbone network.  The Computer Science department will
              thus build a distributed multicomputer based on a scalable, distributed shared
              memory paradigm which will facilitate the department s research efforts in
              distributed and parallel computing, distributed multimedia, vision and
              scientific computation, and distributed control for manufacturing.
