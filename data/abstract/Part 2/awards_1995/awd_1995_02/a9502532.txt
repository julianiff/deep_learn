Abstract    :
              Abstract  McNeal    McNeal will investigate the ways that the boundary of a
              smooth domain in C^n determines the size of holomorphic objects on the domain. 
              Particular aspects to be discussed are: Holder estimates on the solution to the
              d-bar equations in convex domains, estimating the Bergman kernel, on and off
              diagonal, for a general pseudoconvex domain, computing the asymptotic volume of
              sets defined by and ideal of holomorphic functions, and estimating solutions to
              second order subelliptic operators by scaling methods.    McNeal will also
              implement several education initiatives.  These include: teaching a
              multivariable calculus course with computer assignments as an integral
              component, conducting a junior seminar on topics in several complex variables,
              developing a uniform core curriculum for the first two years of the math major,
              and reforming the initial advising policy for entering graduate students in his
              capacity as Director of Graduate Studies.
