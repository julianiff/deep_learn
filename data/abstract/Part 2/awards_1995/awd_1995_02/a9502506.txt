Abstract    :
                    The difficulty in developing reliable software has been an  obstacle in 
              using distributed systems. This project will study and advance the  use of
              formal techniques in distributed protocol design. The objective is to develop a
               framework which allows a complex protocol to be  structured as a composition
              of  simpler protocols. The project will  develop notations for specifying the 
              interactions between the  component protocols, develop a proof system, and
              build  a software  tool supporting our methodology. The framework will be
              applied to  various domains such as design of adaptive protocols, 
              reconfigurable protocols,  and structuring of control protocols.    The
              educational component of the CAREER  prooject will involve students in the 
              protocol development. This will include  emphasis of formal techniques in 
              courses, increasing  laboratory component to  provide experience and forming 
              alliances with the  industry to re-train  computer professionals (via 
              television courses), and involving undergraduates  in research.
