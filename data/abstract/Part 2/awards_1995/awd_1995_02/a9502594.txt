Abstract    :
                      9502594  Raghavan  The primary objective of Raghavan's research is to
              develop algorithms and software for a scalable, fully parallel solution of
              large, sparse linear systems of equations using  direct methods; the solver
              developed will be used in a key application both to demonstrate the
              significance of the work and to help study and resolve issues of interface.  A
              secondary objective is to provide tools suitable for other areas of scientific
              computing obtained as variants of some of the algorithms developed.
