Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    CTS-9502263  Nicholas Abbott  University of Cal Davis    The
              research focuses on the design of self-assembly systems using non-covalent
              interactions.  External fields such a light or electric potential will be
              applied to control the molecular interactions and thereby modify macroscopic
              properties of the surfactant systems.  Also, self assembled monolayers will be
              used to direct the anchoring of mesogens within thermotropic liquid crystals
              and obtain macroscopically anisotropic electrical and optical properties.  The
              research may contribute to the development of drug-delivery systems, new
              separation techniques, optical sensors and liquid crystalline displays.  The
              educational plan includes the development of an undergraduate laboratory for
              biochemical engineering, and the introduction of graduate courses in molecular
              simulations and design of advanced materials.
