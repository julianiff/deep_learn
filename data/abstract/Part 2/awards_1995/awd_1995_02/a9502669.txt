Abstract    :
              This proposal aims to answer a set of critical questions dealing  with
              communication systems by way of the development and use of a  simulation and
              implementation modeling environment for virtual  circuit switches.  The first
              question concerns systematic,  standardized performance comparisons.  Using
              relevant traffic  models and trace data from actual applications, this study is
               standardizing performance measurements, eliminating the apples-to-  oranges
              comparisons that result when considering performance  results from different
              research groups.  The second question  concerns cost and implementation
              modeling.  This work is  integrating the design of system architecture and
              implementation.   The particular focus is on electronic implementation and
              multichip  module packaging technology.  The third question concerns the role 
              of architecture in providing quality of service guarantees.  The  usual
              abstraction of the switch as a queue hides too much detail  about internal
              architecture that is relevant to traffic behavior  when traversing a switch. 
              This work is characterizing the effect  on traffic of different switch
              architectures, and developing switch  mechalisms to work in concert with other
              mechanisms in providing  quality of service guarantees.    The educational part
              of the project is using the simulation and  implementation modeling environment
              as a key component of a  graduate course in High Speed Switching Networks.  In
              addition,  portions of the research amp appear in two undergraduate courses, 
              one on VLSI Design and the other on Modeling.  Other education  efforts include
              significant mentoring activity and ongoing  improvement in teaching.
