Abstract    :
                This research focuses on the development of geometric    methods and  their
              numerical applications.  The project involves  the   design of efficient 
              algorithms for a variety of fundamental  problems in parallel   geometric and 
              numerical computing and the  implementation of these   algorithms on both
              modern  supercomputers  and workstation clusters. The research has   two
              principal  directions.    Geometric Methods for Unstructured Mesh  
              Partitioning and  Generation: The main theoretical and software question is how
                to  make use of  underlying geometric structures and numerical  conditions to
                generate an unstructured finite element  mesh and partition   it for
              subsequent  parallel numerical  simulations.    Parallel Numerical and  
              Applications: The primary goal  is to apply geometric mesh   techniques to the 
              parallel solution of large sparse linear   systems, to adaptive  and 
              hierarchical computations, to distributed COSMOS circuit    simulation, and  to
              dynamic load balancing for parallel N-body  simulations.      The companion 
              education plan is to design and teach courses in  computer   science, in the
              newly  introduced Scientific Computation  Program at the University   of
              Minnesota, and  in the areas that  bridge the two.  It involves the  
              development of research  programs  and projects for graduate and undergraduate 
               students who are  interested in interdisciplinary research.  It also involves 
               the  development of  summer professional programs for professionals  from
              industry   companies,  government research labs, and other  universities, to  
              initiate the collaboration  between universities  and industry.
