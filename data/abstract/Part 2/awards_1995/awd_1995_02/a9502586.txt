Abstract    :
              9502586  Brenner    This CAREER grant contains both research and educational 
              thrusts that address the application of computer modeling  techniques to
              problems in materials science and engineering.  The research component focuses
              on a particular area, namely  the development of a fundamental understanding of
              mechanical  properties of solids at the nanometer scale, and the use of  this
              understanding to choose appropriate tip shapes and  applied stresses to
              mechanically build specific nanometer-  scale structures.  The education
              component will broaden the  department's curriculum in theory and modeling by
              the  development of graduate and undergraduate computer  applications courses,
              including hands-on experience through  computer laboratories.  %%%  This CAREER
