Abstract    :
              9502775    Paul    The overall objective of this research project is to
              understand  the significance of lysogeny in the marine environment.  Toward 
              that end, the proposal addresses three questions: How prevalent  is lysogeny in
              the marine environment?  What environmental  factors control or influence the
              lysogenic decision? and Why does  lysogeny impart a competitive (or does it
              impart) over  nonlysogens?  These studies will be performed with populations 
              and isolates collected along a trophic gradient from estuarine to  oligotrophic
              surface waters of the southeastern Gulf of Mexico  and the South Atlantic Bight
              and from surface waters to deep  aphotic environments.  The research will
              address environmental  factors that have been shown to influence the "lysogenic
               decision" (nutrient status, pressure, temperature, mutagenic  radiation and
              xenobiotics) on natural populations and lysogenic  isolates.  Finally the
              research will examine if the presence of a  prophage in a bacterium results in
              a competitive advantage as  determined by growth rates and expression of
              prophage encoded  genes.  Overall this study will provide insight into many of 
              these processes and expand the knowledge of the interactions of  viruses with
              the rest of the water column microbial community.    ***
