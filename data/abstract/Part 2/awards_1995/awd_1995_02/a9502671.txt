Abstract    :
              IRI-9502671  Pratt, Lorien  Colorado School of Mines    CAREER: Development of
              Techniques for Neural Network Transfer, as  Applied to Hazardous Waste
              Characterization.    In recent years, neural network systems have been used to
              provide  solutions to a variety of problems, from speech recognition and 
              manufacturing control to forensic hair analysis and medical  diagnosis.  This
              project uses an application to a problem of  national interest -- remediation
              of hazardous waste sites -- as  the focus of a program of research with broader
              implications.  Networks built as part of this project are being used to aid in 
              the interpretation of data supplied by noninvasive sensors such  as magnetic
              devices and ground penetrating radar, in order to  characterize the location
              and nature of buried waste before it is  dug up or treated in situ.  Students
              at both the undergraduate  and graduate levels are involved in this project,
              which serves  both educational and research purposes.    Within the work on
              waste remediation, research is being  undertaken on transfer of knowledge.  
              Neural networks are  automatically constructed ("trained") from a set of data 
              representing desired system input and output, and neural network  transfer
              addresses the question of how a network trained for one  task can be used to
              aid in training a network for a new but  related task.  Without transfer,
              training times for a new task  can be lengthy, and a large amount of training
              data can be  required.  With transfer, both of these factors can be reduced. 
              Transfer applied to the hazardous waste remediation problem  addresses
              important practical concerns in that type of  application.  For example, a
              network trained to interpret sensors  at one site can be used to facilitate
              training for a network with  different geophysical characteristics.  Also, a
              network trained  on data generated from a synthetic sensor model can be used to
               facilitate training  on field data.
