Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9502677    A combined research ad education program is proposed in
              the areas of multiphase flow, viscoelastic fluids, and polymer science and
              engineering.  The main objectives are understanding the role of interactions
              between different physical phenomena on the flow stability and dynamics of the
              system.  The relevance of the research is in the area of polymer melt,
              stability analysis and control in materials processing, modeling of flow of
              composite materials, and bioseparation with application to environmental
              technologies.  A variety  of undergraduate and graduate student courses and
              activities are planned in the area of multiphase flow, mathematical theory of
              flow instability, and dynamic control at the University of Wisconsin.
