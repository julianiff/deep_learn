Abstract    :
              This new proposal requests funds to support the coordination of the  NSF
              Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) workshops.  The GEM  workshops are
              comprised annually of a week-long workshop during the  summer and a half-day
              mini-workshop in conjunction with each Fall  American Geophysical Union (AGU)
              meeting.  The next summer workshop  will be held in Snowmass, Colorado in late
              June 1995.  Funds will  support all facets of workshop coordination, including:
              facility  planning, meeting logistics organization, room and audio-visual 
              rental, student and scientist travel support, and associated  administrative
              support.  The goals of the workshops are to identify  and work toward solutions
              of outstanding problems in several  focused research areas that will contribute
              to the ultimate  development of a magnetospheric global circulation model.  The
              goal  of the workshop coordination is to provide organized forums in  order to
              foster the community-wide discussions and research needed  to achieve the GEM
              initiative goals.
