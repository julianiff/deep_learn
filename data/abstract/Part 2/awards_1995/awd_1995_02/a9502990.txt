Abstract    :
              This is the 1st-year  of a 3-year continuing award.  The objective of this
              research is to widen the currently narrow `information pipeline` between humans
              and machine learners; instead of solely providing  labeled training examples to
              the learner as is typically done, the algorithms  being designed also allow
              humans to provide broadly applicable advice  regarding the task at hand.  The
              human advice-giver does not have to  understand the machine learner's internal
              representations and algorithms, nor  does the provided advice have to be
              completely correct or fully explicit.  The  algorithms being developed use
              techniques from connectionist reinforcement  learning to (slowly) learn from
              the feedback provided by the learner's  environment.  The advice-giver observes
              the machine learner's decision making  and occasionally makes suggestions,
              expressed as instructions in a simple  programming language.  Based on
              techniques from the field of knowledge-based  neural networks, the advice is
              inserted directly into the agent's knowledge  base.  Importantly, the learner
              can subsequently refine the assimilated advice  both by neural training based
              on further experience and additional advice from  the human advisor.  This work
              promises to simplify the interaction between  humans and machine learners, and
              may lead to flexible, adaptive software that  tunes itself to specific users
              via this project's flexible advice-giving  framework.
