Abstract    :
              CTS-9502235  Roger Harrison  U of Oklahoma      Research will be performed to
              improve the purification of recombinant proteins by avoiding the initial
              expression of these proteins as insoluble inclusion bodies.  A primary goal is
              to test new fusion proteins that are predicted to enhance the solubility of
              normally insoluble recombinant proteins.  Four proteins with very high
              solubility in Escherichia coli will be combined with two different target
              proteins known to have low solubility.  The fusion proteins with highest
              expression levels will be purified.  The target protein will be purified after
              its cleavage from the fusion protein and characterized further.  The
              experiments will test the validity of a model proposed to predict the
              solubility of fusion proteins. The results may lead to fundamental advances in
              fusion protein technology which could have significant impact in biotechnology.
