Abstract    :
              9502138 Michielssen  Research  The objective functions that arise in the context
              of electromagnetic optimization and component design are often highly
              non-linear, stiff, multi-external, sometimes non-differentiable, and almost
              always computationally expensive to evaluate.  the effectiveness of Genetic
              Algorithms (Gas) is investigated within the context of electromagnetic
              component design by developing global GA- based optimizers for a number of
              electromagnetic systems, e.g., reflect arrays, frequency scanned grating
              antennas, waveguide components, and broadband antennas systems.  It is
              conjectured that the proposed research will engender novel solution techniques
              for a variety of electromagnetic optimization problems and bring about a number
              of powerful, highly efficient and systematic design techniques for a
              aforementioned electromagnetic components.  This study will also permit the
              formulation of guidelines regarding the suitability of Gas for other
              electromagnetic optimization problems in terms of number and the character of
              those parameter that require optimization the computational complexity of the
              forward analysis problem, and the available computing platform.  Education 
              Teaching excellence is an important component of all first-class undergraduate
              and graduate programs.   This young faculty member in electromagnetic will be
              committed to significantly revise a number of electromagnetics courses during
              the next for years in order to maintain and improve  the quality of the
              undergraduate and graduate electromagnetic curricula at the  University of 
              Illinois at Urbans-Champaign (UIUC).  The recently established College of
              Engineering's interdisciplinary program in Computational Science and
              Engineering (CSE) will instrumental in achieving the goal.  Furthermore,  he
              will foster discussions regarding the establishment and the promotion of an
              exchange program for undergraduate and graduate students between the Colleges
              of Engineering at the UIUC and Belgian universities.
