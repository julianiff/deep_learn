Abstract    :
              9502216  Ammons       This proposed work seeks to continue efforts to develop  a
              qualitative and quantitative fundamental understanding of  hadronic matter by
              using quantum chromodynamics to solve for  the structure and dynamics of
              hadrons, Our specific efforts  will be an attempt to generate effective
              Hamiltonians for  the front-form formulation of the scalar field, quantum 
              electrodynamics, and quantum chromodynamics using the  evolving methods of
              Hamiltonian renormalization.  We will  also solve these Hamiltonians using
              basis function  techniques and other numerical methods.  ***
