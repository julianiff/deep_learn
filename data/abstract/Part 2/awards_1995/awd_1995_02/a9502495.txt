Abstract    :
              9502495  Keasling  This project is on research to develop a methodology whereby 
              bacterial  metabolism can be redirected  to  synthesize  all  precursors
              necessary or the production of a desired, complex  compound  from an
              inexpensive carbon source, and to  control  metabolism in such a way that a
              defined composition  can  be  achieved.   The  general aims of the research 
              are:  (1)  to  introduce multiple metabolic pathways from various organisms 
              into  a  single bacterium: (2) to determine how  to  balance  production  of 
              enzyme  subunits  at  stoichiometric  levels  sufficient  for  a  functioning
              complex: (3)  to  develop  a  mathematical model to predict how to balance more
               than  one  flux   necessary  for  a  desired  product:   and   (4)   to 
              coordinately express the genes encoding the enzymes for  the  pathway  at the
              desired level.  In addition to this research  activity,   the  investigator 
              will  enhance  education   by  developing relevant laboratory experiments.  ***
