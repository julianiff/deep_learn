Abstract    :
              9502639  Kurose    This award provides support to equip a networked,
              experimental testbed to enable research in the development of the operating
              system, I/O, networking, object management, and information retrieval
              components of future networked multimedia information systems.  The testbed
              will consist of two shared-memory multiprocessor facilities attached to several
              parallel mass storage I/O devices and a high-speed ATM network.    The research
              team will be developing several key hardware and software technologies needed
              to support future networked, multimedia information systems.  Specific research
              areas include operating systems, I/O, networking, object management and
              information retrieval.
