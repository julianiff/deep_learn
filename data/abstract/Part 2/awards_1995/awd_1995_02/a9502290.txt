Abstract    :
              The objective of this CAREER research program is to determine the effects of ion
              beam  bombardment on the magnetic and electrical properties of evaporated
              Permalloy-nitrogen-iron thin  films. The electrical, magnetoresistive and
              magnetic properties of the films are measured as a  function of ion species,
              flux and energy, substrate temperature, and post-deposition annealing 
              treatment.  The microstructure of the films is characterized and correlated to
              the electrical and  magnetic properties.  This research is a collaborative
              project with IBM Almaden Research Center.   The  educational objectives include
              course and curriculum development in electronic, optical and magnetic 
              materials, as well as undergraduate and graduate research supervision,
              advising, and educational  outreach.  The curriculum development efforts are
              focused on an interdisciplinary course sequence for  electrical and materials
              engineering students in electronic materials processing in a team-based, 
              open-ended design laboratory setting. %%% Ion beam bombardment during electron
              beam evaporation of  Permalloy films is used to imp rove the magnetoresistive
              response of films used in magnetoresistive  read heads in magnetic disk drives.
