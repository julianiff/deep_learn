Abstract    :
              9502705  Hall  New optoelectronic structures will be fabricated using a 
              revolutionary new oxidation technology for aluminum-bearing alloy 
              semiconductors (the "native" oxide of aluminum-gallium-arsenide  (AlGaAs)). 
              The planar waveguide lenses, buried strip waveguides,  and integrated laser
              sources to be developed will be useful  "building block" components broadly
              applicable in the further  evolution of OEICs.  These components will be
              applied for the  realization of novel and higher-performance integrated master 
              oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) devices."    Two new
              optoelectronics/photonics courses will be developed at  Notre Dame by drawing
              on the PI's background of experiment research  in semiconductor lasers at the
              University of Illinois, and research  on high-power MOPA devices and new
              optical techniques for their  characterization as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the
              Naval Research  Laboratory.  The aim of the new undergraduate Modern Photonics 
              laboratory course is to expose seniors to the broad span of  photonics
              technologies important in today's commercial sector,  while introducing them to
              current optoelectronics research advances  (to be incorporated as special
              projects) which promise to be the  leading technologies of the future.  The
              graduate Optoelectronics  Devices course will fill an important need in the
              curriculum at  Notre Dame and serve as a core course to prepare graduate
              students  to join in the new optoelectronics research efforts.  ***
