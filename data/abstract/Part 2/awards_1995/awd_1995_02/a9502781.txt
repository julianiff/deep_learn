Abstract    :
              9502781  Wysin    This U.S.-Brazil Collaborative Research grant will support 
              the research of Gary Wysin, Kansas State University, in  collaboration with A.
              S. T. Piers and M. E. Gouvea of the  Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais to
              perform theoretical  and computational analyses of the properties of
              topological  nonlinear excitations in quasi-two-dimensional magnets.  The 
              research will extend the current understanding of the  properties of the
              vortex, soliton, and spinwave excitations  in these systems.  The magnetic
              properties of topological  excitations will be determined partly by
              perturbation theory  from exactly known solutions, and partly by numerical 
              simulations.    The proposed studies will provide a better understanding of 
              the particular spin structures that make up the topological  excitations in
              two-dimensional magnets, as well as determine  the internal normal modes of the
              excitations.  An important  contribution will be the characterization of the
              role of  topological excitations in the phase transitions in such  magnets. 
              While topological defects have been shown to be  significant factors in phase
              transitions in superfluids and  superconductors, in liquid crystals, and in
              other physical  systems, the proposed work will carry the investigation of 
              these effects to easy-plane and easy-axis two-dimensional  magnets.  The
              Brazilian group brings experience in the  analytical study of such properties,
              while the U.S. group  has experience in computer simulation of the same class
              of  properties.  ***
