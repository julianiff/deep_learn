Abstract    :
                  9502020  Phillips  This CAREER type grant is to improve the linkage between
              material  behavior at small scale lengths and macroscopic response.  Recent 
              advances in the atomistic modeling of materials now permits direct  calculation
              of the constitutive models for problems that involve  dislocation structure and
              mobility changes associated with  martensitic transformations.  The educational
              plan is to attempt to  make specific courses more interesting and to help
              advanced  undergraduates appreciate the connection between material behavior 
              at different scale lengths.  ***
