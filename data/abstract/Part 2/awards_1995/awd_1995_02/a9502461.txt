Abstract    :
                   The research portion of this CAREER project seeks to  develop a  conceptual
              framework and prototypes for an organizational  learning  approach to software
              development.    The project addresses the codification of  knowledge as it
              emerges  in development organizations.  The goal is a form that can be  used as
              the  basis for the continual improvement of software products and the 
              development process.  A domain lifecycle methodology is being  developed that 
              shifts the focus from individual projects to  recurring design problems and 
              solutions developed by an  organization.  The research is based on empirical 
              observations of  a large software development organization.  Project goals 
              include:  (1) Creation of reuse-based software development  methodologies 
              incorporating organizational learning tools; (2)  Development of domain
              knowledge  from individual cases to design  guidelines to formal reasoning
              systems  supporting domain-oriented  design; (3) Development of prototype
              systems using  case-based  technology to support organizational learning; (4)
              Provision of a body  of  empirical results based on studies of real world
              development  projects and  evaluations of prototypes supporting organizational 
              learning.    The  educational goals of this project are to: (1) develop active 
              learning techniques  for teaching software design concepts; (2)  stimulate
              lifelong learning through  organizational learning  techniques.  While
              organizational learning is  integrated with the  research portion of this
              project, active learning  techniques are  explored through the development of a
              multimedia design studio  for teaching software design concepts.
