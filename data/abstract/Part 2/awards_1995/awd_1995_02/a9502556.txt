Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with performance optimization of high-  speed
              synchronous digital circuits It addresses the application of  timing
              optimizations to pipelines and general sequential circuits  in high-performance
              systems.  The core of the research effort is  directed towards the method of
              retiming at the gate level.   Retiming is a sequential logic optimization
              technique that  repositions memory elements, namely, edge-triggered flip-flops
              and  level-triggered latches, within a circuits to optimize the timing 
              behavior of the circuit.  The use of retiming optimization methods,  chiefly
              device sizing, is also being investigated.    Under the educational part of
              this project, the PI is incorporating  CAD techniques in the undergraduate
              program from the sophomore  level by the use of CAD tools in teaching.  At the
              graduate level,  he is involved in developing courses, the supporting existing 
              courses, and in advising graduate students.  He is also exposing 
              undergraduates to his research for a better appreciation of the  state of the
              art, and to motivate them towards higher education.   he is also contributing
              towards outreach activities by focusing  towards distance education through
              teaching courses to sites in the  state of Iowa via television, and around the
              country through the  medium of satellite.
