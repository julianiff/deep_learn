Abstract    :
              This research is developing a new approach to manufacturing test of  VLSI chips.
               Digital signals are treated as analog waveforms, so  that logic events at
              internal nodes can be understood.  To do this,  rise-fall and glitching
              characteristics of output signals are being  studied using time and frequency
              domain analog signal analysis  techniques.  Using this approach: 1. failure
              methods are being  determined; 2. test generation algorithms for stuck-at
              faults in  combinational and sequential circuits are being investigated; 3. 
              methods to detect marginal chips are being explored; 4. very rapid  wave
              pipelined testing is being developed.  A signal waveform  analysis system is
              being designed.
