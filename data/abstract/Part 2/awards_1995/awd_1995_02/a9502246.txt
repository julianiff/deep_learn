Abstract    :
              9502246  Beckham  Through two distinct projects, detailed characterization of 
              molecular mobilities will be conducted and then used to  engineer improved or
              novel polymers and fibrous substrates.  Advanced nuclear magnetic resonance
              (NMR) techniques will be  employed to specify molecular mobilities not only by 
              timescale, but also by geometry (2D exchange spectroscopy),  and by spatial
              direction (NMR imaging).  The following two  projects are described:  (1)
              solid-state polymer molecular  dynamics, and (2) water distribution and
              diffusion in  engineered fibrous substrates.  In both projects, 
              multidimensional NMR methods will be used to elucidate that  historically
              "missing link" for the correlation of molecular  structure with macroscopic
              properties in materials, that is,  detailed descriptions of molecular
              movements.  %%%  This research is important because it provides links to 
              important questions in polymer and textile science, and  covers both basic and
              applied subjects.    The educational component of this grant consists of 
              introducing modern topics into textile courses and to  develop new teaching
              methods in which students are activley  involved in the teaching process.  ***
