              Title: NANSEN Arctic Drilling Program Secretariat FY 95 and FY 96    This award
              supports the program Secretariat for the NANSEN Arctic  Drilling Program (NAD),
              a major international research effort  designed to understand the geological
              evolution of the Arctic as  well as the history of Arctic environmental change
              and its forcing  functions.  This knowledge will help predict the future of the
               Arctic basin and its effect on global processes.  NAD is developing  strategic
              plans for acquiring long, high-resolution sediment cores  and deep basement
              cores needed to understand the Cenozoic and  Mesozoic paleoceanography,
              paleobiology, and structural history of  the Arctic region.  The program is
              composed of eight member  countries (Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Norway,
              Sweden, United  Kingdom, and the USA) and four observer countries (Denmark, 
              Iceland, The Netherlands, and Russia).  The NAD Secretariat which  is housed at
              Joint Oceanographic Institutions Inc. and will provide  logistical support,
              communication, public awareness, and inter-  program cooperation.
