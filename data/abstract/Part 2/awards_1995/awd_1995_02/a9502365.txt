Abstract    :
                 This is an award under the Grants for Improving Dissertation Research
              Program.  This study is concerned with the environmental movement's bases of
              action, composition, and organizational character.  It appraises competing
              theories of social movements--grievance-based, resource mobilization, and
              identity-based.  The research is based on face to face interviews and a mailed
              survey, and survey results will be compared to a similar study conducted in
              1979.    %%%   The research will contribute to sociological understanding of 
              social movements and to the factors leading to continuity and change in the
              environmental movement.  It will be useful to formulating policies designed to
              encourage citizen participation in efforts to protect the environment.  In
              addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award
              will materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for
              the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower
              of the nation and the thorough training of the next generation of social
              scientists.
