Abstract    :
              9502901  Sierks  This project is on research to develop a methodology for the 
              selection of catalytic antibodies with specific protease  activity.  This
              research combines a new technology of phage  display for generation of a large
              number of antibody  sequences with a novel selection methodology employing 
              peptidase deficient auxotyphoic strains of s. typhimuvium  where only those
              cells possessing antibodies having the  desired protease activity will grow. 
              The results of this  research could have important applications in medicine and
               in industry.  ***
