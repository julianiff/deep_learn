Abstract    :
              Chai   95-02186    Professor Chai will continue his work on moduli spaces of
              Abelian  varieties. In particular, he wishes to study the density of Hecke 
              orbits in certain Shimura varieties. He also wishes to study the  canonical
              lifting of Abelian varieties and certain classes of  motives. He hopes to apply
              his results to prove the existence of  certain canonical integral models.   
              This project falls into the general area of arithmetic geometry -  a subject
              that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics:  number theory and
              geometry.  This combination has proved  extraordinarily fruitful - having
              recently solved problems that  withstood generations.  Among its many
              consequences are new error  correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for
              both modern  computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
