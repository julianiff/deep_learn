Abstract    :
              9502069  Dong  This project is on research to better understand cell  adhesion
              under flow and cell motility.  The aims of this  research are: (1) to develop
              the experimental capability to  elucidate the cellular processes of adhesion
              and motility  and their related biological behavior, (2) to develop the 
              theoretical capability to derive satisfactory comparisons of  the model
              predictions with experimental results and to  obtain the mechanistic parameters
              affecting cellular  processes, and (3) to establish a foundation for an 
              integrated cellular engineering research program.  Cell  adhesion and motility
              are two intimately related biological  processes that affect the course of the
              inflammatory process  and the metastasis of cancer cells.  ***
