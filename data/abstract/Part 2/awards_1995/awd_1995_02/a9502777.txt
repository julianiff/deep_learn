Abstract    :
              9502777  Faust  Kinetic and mechanistic studies on the additions of 1,1- 
              diphenylethylene and related highly reactive but non-  polymerizable monomers
              to living cationic polymers will be  carried out.  Conductance measurement and
              UV-vis  spectroscopy combined with structure analysis will determine  the
              kinetics and mode of addition, the extent of chain end  ionization and
              dissociation.  The kinetics of the addition  of diphenylcarbenium ions to
              monomers will also be studied,  and the absolute rate constants will be
              determined for free  ions and ion-pairs.  The results will be used in the 
              synthesis of well-defined block copolymers by sequential  monomer addition when
              the reactivity of the second monomer  is higher then that of the first monomer.
               The method  involves capping with a reactive but non-polymerizable  monomer
              such as 1,1-diphenylethylene, followed by tailoring  the Lewis acidity to the
              reactivity of the second monomer by  the addition of titanium(IV) alkoxide, by
              replacing the  Lewis acid with a weaker one or by the use of a common ion 
              salt.  Another objective of the proposal is to explore the  synthesis of
              end-functional polymers by in-situ  functionalization (end-quenching) of the
              living ends.  The  last objective of the proposal is to investigate the 
              combination of living cationic and living anionic-group  transfer
              polymerization for the synthesis of linear and  hetero-arm star block
              copolymers.  Two different methods are  proposed based on 1,1-diphenylethylene
              capping; one based on  site transformation and the other based on mutual 
              annihilation of the living polymer cations and anions.  %%%  This research
              provides a novel approach to the synthesis of  various well-defined polymers
              with precisely known  architecture.  Such polymers are needed to study the 
              fundamental physical properties as a function of structure.  ***
