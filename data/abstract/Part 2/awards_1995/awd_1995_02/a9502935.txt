Abstract    :
              The proposal calls for the development of a versatile high-  repetition rate
              short-pulse laser system and the associated  ability to carry out correlation
              and coincidence measurements on  electron and ion time-of-flight signals. 
              These tools will be  applied to a wide range of problems including: 
              Correlation  techniques to unambiguously determine dissociation pathways of 
              highly ionized diatomic molecules in strong laser fields, Curve  crossing in
              transient states of molecular ions, and Fundamental  measurements in the
              above-threshold-ionization of atoms by strong  laser fields.  ***
