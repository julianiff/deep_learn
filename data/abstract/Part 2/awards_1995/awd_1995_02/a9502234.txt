Abstract    :
              9502234  Agah  This award supports a 24-month Science and Technology Agency  of
              Japan Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Arvin Agah of the  Institute for Robotics
              and Intelligent Systems of the  University of Southern California.  This
              fellowship  opportunity will enable Dr. Agah to begin a collaborative  research
              effort with Dr. Kazuo Tanie, the director of the  Biorobotics Division of
              Mechanical Engineering Laboratory.  The investigators plan to study multi-robot
              systems,  biologically-inspired robotics, autonomous robots,  applications of
              virtual reality and multi-media to robotics,  and computer simulation of
              intelligent robots.  The proposed  project will help develop a scientific
              collaboration with a  leading robotics researcher in Japan.    As a
              postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Agah will have the opportunity  to become familiar
              with the research projects, both in  theoretical and engineering terms, at
              Mechanical Engineering  Laboratory, while contributing to the overall research 
              effort.  Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of  the Program in
              its exchange and transfer of scientific  knowledge through an international
              collaboration.  ***
