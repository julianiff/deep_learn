Abstract    :
              9502224  Murray  This CAREER award emphasizes the use of two-degree-of-  freedom
              design techniques for generating nonlinear  controllers for mechanical systems
              performing motion control  tasks. Typical applications include high performance
              control  of piloted aircrafts using vectored thrust propulsion,  navigation and
              control of unmanned flight vehicles  performing surveillance and other tasks,
              motion control and  stabilization of underwater vehicles , and control of land 
              based robotic locomotion systems. The nonlinear controller  synthesis problem
              is initially separated into the design of  a feasible trajectory for the
              nominal model of the system,  followed by regulation around that trajectory
              using  controllers that have guaranteed performance in presence of 
              uncertainties. New methods are devised for quickly  generating suboptimal
              trajectories that accomplish a desired  control objective. Educational
              activities include  development of innovative curriculum in control and 
              dynamical systems, setting up experimental laboratories for  graduate and
              undergraduate teaching, and involving  undergraduate students in independent
              research-oriented  projects.***
