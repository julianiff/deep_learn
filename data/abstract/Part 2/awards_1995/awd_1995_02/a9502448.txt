Abstract    :
              9502448  Filz  Even though soil-bentonite cutoff walls are widely used, the 
              state of  practice is that they are designed and built without a  fundamental 
              understanding of the mechanics of the interaction between  the trench  backfill
              and the adjacent ground.  The consequences of this  are that  neither the
              hydraulic conductivity of the backfill nor the  settlement of  the adjacent
              ground can be accurately predicted.  The  principal objective  of this research
              is to put design of these walls on a sound  theoretical  basis.  The methods to
              be employed include laboratory  testing,  instrumentation of a full-scale
              cutoff wall, analytical  work, and numerical  analyses.  Methods used for the
              educational component  include:  1) a  version of multimedia developed to
              improve classroom  efficiency and to  create time for students to exercise new
              knowledge as soon  as they learn it  and get immediate feedback on their
              performance, 2) and  interdisciplinary  educational program will be developed
              that will involve the  environmental,  hydrosystems, and geotechnical
              engineering groups, and 3)  undergraduates  will participate in the
              soil-bentonite cutoff wall research.  ***
