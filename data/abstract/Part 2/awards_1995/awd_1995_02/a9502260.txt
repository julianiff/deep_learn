Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to scale up the applicability of  planning  
              algorithms  developed  in  the  field  of   Artificial  Intelligence. The basic
              research component of the project  is  to  first   investigate  techniques  for
               improving  scalability   of  planning  using  parallel  techniques, then  to 
              explore  machine  learning  techniques  for reusing and refining  generated 
              plans.  Industrial  applications  of  AI planning  algorithms  have  been 
              limited  largely by the computational complexity of the  planning  task. The
              significant speedup that can be obtained using parallel  hardware  and  machine
              learning techniques  can  bridge  the  gap  between  research and a wide
              variety of industrial  applications.  To  demonstrate the power of the
              techniques developed here,  they  will  not only be formally verified but will
              be applied  to  such  applications  as automated assembly and cooperative 
              planning  of  unmanned  ground  vehicles. The CAREER project will  also  impact
               graduate and undergraduate education. Existing seminar courses in  Parallel 
              AI  and in Planning and Robotics will be  refined.   An  industrial  team will
              be formed to suggest topics and to  oversee  class  projects. All course
              materials developed for these classes  will be packaged and available for
              general dissemination over the  Internet.
