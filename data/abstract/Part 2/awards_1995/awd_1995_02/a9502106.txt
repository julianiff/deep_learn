Abstract    :
              In this Faculty Early Career Development Award funded by the Theoretical   and
              Computational Chemistry Program at NSF, Daniel Neuhauser at the   Chemistry
              Department of the University of California at Los Angeles will   investigate
              problems in three distinct research areas in molecular   structure and
              molecular dynamics. The work in all three areas is based on   related
              mathematical approaches for the efficient diagonalization of   large matrices.
              The first area uses a Quantum Monte-Carlo approach to   obtain accurate
              electronic wavefunctions and potential energy surfaces   for molecular systems.
              The second area involves efficient solutions of   path-integral simulations of
              molecular dynamics and scattering, both   reactive and non-reactive. The third
              area involves the determination of   the normal modes for the vibrations of
              proteins.  Neuhauser's teaching   plans include an increased emphasis on
              undergraduate research and the   introduction of computational chemistry
              projects into undergraduate   coursework.   The work in each of these three
              areas of research will extend the   understanding of the fundamental processes
              which underlie many important   chemical reactions. The reactions to be studied
              initially in the first   two areas were chosen because of their relevance to
              combustion processes.   One of the goals of the studies of the normal modes in
              proteins, the   third research area, is to obtain information necessary for the
                simulation of reactions involved in photosynthesis.
