Abstract    :
              9502808  Watson  Oregon State University  In this project in the Physical
              Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Philip Watson of the
              Chemistry Department of Oregon State University will investigate the properties
              of the gas-liquid interface at the molecular level. The compositional profile
              and the orientation of molecules in the surface will be investigated using the
              method of time-of-flight ion scattering and recoil spectrometry (TOF-SARS). 
              The immediate goals of this project are 1) the construction and calibration of
              a liquid surface TOF-SARS system capable of generating uncontaminated and
              representative surfaces for low vapor pressure liquids and providing
              quantitative surface composition data and, 2) to establish the capabilities of
              the method to describe surface compositions and molecular orientations for a
              range of organic liquids and solutions.        The properties of the
              liquid-surface interface pose one of the vexing problems in contemporary
              physical chemistry.  The results of this research would contribute answers to
              questions such as:  1) what are the structure-property relationships that
              operate at the liquid-vapor interface?,  2) is it possible to formulate
              predictive rules that will link the segregation and orientation of molecules at
              the liquid surface with their structure, the presence of particular
              functionalities, and the presence of hydrogen-bonding?,  3) what is the surface
              concentration of solutions?  how do experimental results compare with the
              predictions of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics?,  4) how do polymers
              fold at solution interfaces?  Answers to these and other questions promise to
              be of significance in a number of important applied areas, such as the
              utilization of surface segregation in the mass transfer of pollutants.
