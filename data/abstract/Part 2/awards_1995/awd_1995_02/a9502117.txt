Abstract    :
                 9502117 Goorsky  This research program aims to develop a deeper understanding
              of the connection between microscopic materials structure and performance in
              compound semiconductors.  The relationship among substrate properties, initial
              defect nucleation, and device performance in GaAs- and InP-based
              heterostructures will be studied. The role of substrate perfection and
              substrate miscut on the initial stages of misfit dislocation formation and
              related defects in strained epitaxial structures will be explored as well as
              the behavior of layers grown under either tensile or compressive strain.  This
              will help develop a fundamental understanding of precisely how the magnitude
              and sign of stress in the layers influences the formation of defects. %%% This
              research will contribute to improving the general performance and to the
              realization of advanced devices and integrated circuits used in computing,
              information processing, and telecommunications.  An important feature of the
              program is the training of graduate and undergraduate students in a
              fundamentally and technologically significant area of materials and processing
              research.    ***
