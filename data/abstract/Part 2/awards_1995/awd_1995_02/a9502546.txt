Abstract    :
              9502546  Pantazidou  The presence of Dense Nonaqueous Phase Liquids (DNAPLs) in 
              the subsurface  may control the ultimate success or failure of remediation  at
              a hazardous  waste site.  Our ability to evaluate DNAPL risks us limited  by
              both  inadequate field characterization techniques and by our  sketchy 
              understanding of DNAPL migration potential.  In this study,  centrifuge 
              modeling will be used to quantify the parameters that  determine the  mobility
              of DNAPLs, with emphasis on low-permeability soils.  Numerical  modeling will
              be used to provide further insight into the  physics of DNAPL  transport. 
              Development of noninvasive characterization  methods will be  pursued to assist
              in estimating the potential for DNAPL  occurrence at  contaminated sites.  In
              the educational plan, an  environmental geotechnics  module, which can be
              inserted in any traditional  introductory undergraduate  soil mechanics course,
              is under preparation.  On the  graduate level, a new  course will be designed
              with the objective of introducing  students to  geoenvironmental applications,
              which are presented in the  framework of site  characterization and
              remediation.  There will be a  concentrated effort in  both aspects to narrow
              the gap between educational  experiences and  industrial projects through
              selection of lecture topics and  interactions  with current and prospective
              students outside the classroom.  ***
