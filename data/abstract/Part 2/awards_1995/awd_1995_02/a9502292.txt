Abstract    :
              9502292  Bramley  The work proposed here involves research and teaching in
              scientific computation.  The research primarily uses partial orthogonalization
              methods for solving applications that include incompressible fluid flows.
              First, a new class of incomplete orthogonalization preconditioners that
              preliminary results have shown to be more effective than standard
              preconditioners will be further developed and analyzed. Secondly, methods for
              solving constrained systems using orthogonal projectors will be further
              developed, and extended to nonsymmetric (full Navier-Stokes equations)
              problems, and other problems in fields such as electromagnetics. Both as a tool
              and a separate research interest a unified package of methods for computing
              orthogonal projections will be developed and distributed.
