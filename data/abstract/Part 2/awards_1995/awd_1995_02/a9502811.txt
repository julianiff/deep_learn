Abstract    :
              Brian Laird is supported by a CAREER grant from the Theoretical and  
              Computational Chemistry Program to investigate the theory of solid-liquid  
              interfaces.  Molecular dynamics simulations of solid-liquid interfaces   will
              be performed for a variety of materials using both idealized and   realistic
              models.  Existing density-functional theories will be evaluated   in light of
              the simulation results and modified in order to correct   observed deficiencies
              in an attempt to extend the level of theory to   materials displaying long
              range intermolecular interactions and   multi-component systems.  The long term
              objective of the research project   is to understand, at a microscopic level,
              the solid-liquid interface of a   variety of materials, primarily mixtures
              (alloys),  and molecular systems   with orientationally dependent interactions.
               Most crystals of current technological interest,  such as semiconductors,  
              metals and alloys, are grown from the melt, and information on the  
              microscopic structure, dynamics and thermodynamics of such interfaces is   of
              fundamental importance in studies of crystal growth and homogeneous  
              nucleation.  A better molecular level understanding of the solid-liquid  
              interface in such systems could help to produce better defect-free single  
              crystals of such technologically important materials.
