Abstract    :
              The thrust of this proposal is on backward recovery schemes for  multicomputer
              and distributed systems.  The proposed research is  based on a two-level
              approach that uses a low overhead recovery  scheme to tolerate more probable
              failures, while the less probable  failures may be tolerated with a higher
              overhead.  By minimizing  the overhead for the more frequently occurring
              failure scenarios,  the proposed two-level approach will achieve lower average 
              performance overheads as compared to existing recovery schemes.   Objectives of
              the proposed research are 1) the design of efficient  two-level recovery
              schemes, 2) the development of optimization  techniques for two-level recovery
              schemes to determine various  parameters (e.g., checkpointing frequency) that
              willminimize the  average performance overhead fo the recovery scheme, 3) the 
              implementation of two level recovery schemes on a 64 processor  nCUBE-2
              multicomputer and on a network of workstations, and 4) the  experimental
              evaluation of two-level recovery schemes to  demonstrate their ability to
              achieve better performance than the  existing recovery schemes.    The goal of
              the proposed education activities is to incorporate the  results of recent
              research into undergraduate and graduate  curriculum.  specific objectives fo
              the education plan are 1) the  development of an undergraduate introductory
              course on fault  tolerance and a graduate course on fault tolerance techniques
              for  parallel and distrubuted systems, 2) the development of an  associated
              undergraduate research effort, and 3) the development of  a software toolkit to
              facilitate experimetns in the proposed  courses.
