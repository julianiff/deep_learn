Abstract    :
              This research is on the development of methods for synthesis and  verification
              of asynchronous circuits.  The approach is to extend  approximation techniques
              for state exploration, that have been  successfully applied to
              speed-independent circuits, to semi-custom  timed circuits.  Tools and
              techniques being developed include: 1.  estimators of circuit area,
              performance, and power at  architectural, gate, and circuit levels; 2. a
              synthesis tool that  accepts behavioral specifications and derives gate-level
              circuits;  and 3. a hierarchical verification tool for timed circuits.  The 
              verification and synthesis tools are integrated so as to support  advanced
              logic optimizations.
