Abstract    :
              This proposal has two components, a research proposal and an education plan. 
              The objective of the research program is to develop innovative concepts and
              technologies to fabricate long wavelength (1.3/1.55 micron) vertical-cavity
              surface- emitting lasers (VC-SELs) and WDM surface emitting laser arrays for
              communication, interconnect, and signal processing.  The VC-SELs developed in
              this program are expected to outperform the existing devices in terms of
              threshold current and spectral purity.  Above all, the VC-SELs should have a
              substantial cost advantage over conventional single mode DFB and DBR lasers.
              The goal of the proposers education plan is to educate future university
              teachers, to educate capable and conscientious engineers who can contribute to
              the advance of sciences and technologies, and to cultivate engineers who can
              educate themselves to fit in the ever changing, increasingly challenging work
              environment.  Two other important aspects in his education plan are in the
              improvement of minority and pre-college science education.
