Abstract    :
              9502728   Shapiro  A major roadblock for rapid prototyping of mechanical systems
              is the absence of   combinatorial models to describe mechanical forms,
              functions, and fabrication processes in terms of   discrete, simple, and
              interacting primitives.  The goal of this research is to investigate a  
              combinatorial relationship among mechanical form, function, and fabrication for
              single-part mechanical   components by (1)  studying, experimenting with, and
              modifying existing production practices for a   class of industrial parts; (2) 
              developing a new theory capable of supporting systematic creation and  
              modification of combinatorial models of such parts based on physical and
              manufacturing   characteristics; and (3)  developing computer algorithms,
              representations, and systems that can be   used in conjunction with existing
              commercial CAD software.    The education plan considers solid   modeling as an
              intermediate stage in the evolution of engineering languages.  With new
              knowledge   resulting from the research, subjects in engineering analysis,
              design, and manufacturing can be   reorganized and systematized.  This will
              contribute to progress along a migration path from solid   modeling toward the
              more general disciplines of mechanical and physical modeling.    Insights and
              new   knowledge resulting from this research should lead to better approaches
              toward engineering design,   more effective communication among many
              engineering activities, and more efficient production   processes. 
              Generalizing these results to mechanical functions, processes and systems that
              involve   multiple interacting parts and phenomena can improve our ability to
              effectively automate some aspects   of design while still incorporating
              important human engineering knowledge and experimentation.
