Abstract    :
              9502824  Billard       The Department of Statistics at the University of 
              Georgia will purchase computer equipment consisting of a Sun  SPARC station 20
              model, two Sun SPARC station 5 models, one  SPARC station IPC and a NEWS
              printer 20 laser printer.  This  equipment will be dedicated to support
              research on several  projects including statistical analyses and inferential 
              methodologies for standard autoregressive time series models  and nonlinear
              time series including threshold and bilinear  models for both space and time
              models, partial differential  equations, Gibbs sampling, bootstrapping and
              other  resampling methods, function estimation, and various  statistical
              inference problems in response-adaptive  dose-response designs such as
              bootstrapping, efficiency of  estimators, edgeworth expansions and sequential
              estimation.
