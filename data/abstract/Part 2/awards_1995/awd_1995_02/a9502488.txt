Abstract    :
              AGRAWAL  9502488      This Small Business Innovation Research Phase-II project
              is  directed at the completion of a research/commercial prototype  multi-point
              laser velocimeter for use in laboratories and also for  use unattended in the
              ocean. Measurements of velocity at a single  point are seldom sufficient in
              nature; when only single-point  velocimeters are available, profiling is
              employed to obtain  information regarding structures of a flow-field. Profile 
              information has invariably been derived by mechanical traversing of  a sensor
              'head'.  Not only is synopticity sacrificed in this  manner, causing loss of
              order in structure data, but also all  information on spatial structures,
              coherent motions, and space-time  scales is lost. Driven by needs in his
              research, the P.I. has  devised a multi-point velocimetry system which forms
              several sample  volumes in the flow field simultaneously. Signals from these
              sample  volumes are separately carried to photo-detectors.  A multi-signal 
              processor is then required to convert the signal to simultaneous-  multi-point
              velocity data, retaining information on order inherent  in the flow, and all
              information for deriving space-time scales of  fluid structures.  In Phase-I,
              we have successfully demonstrated  the principle of the method by constructing
              a single-velocity-  component multi-point velocimeter, as first explained in
              the Phase-  I proposal.  In Phase-II, we shall expand capabilities to a 2-axis 
              multi-point velocimeter, with direction discrimination optics and  a complete
              multi-signal processor. The instrument will be tested in  the laboratory and
              the field.
