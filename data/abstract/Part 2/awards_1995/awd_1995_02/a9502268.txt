Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    9502268  Henning, Patricia    This award is made under the auspices
              of the NSF Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program.  As a CAREER
              awardee the investigator is expected to pursue an active education plan in
              addition to her scientific research project.      About one quarter of the
              extragalactic sky is blocked by the dust and high star density of our Galaxy,
              the Milky Way.  Several superclusters of galaxies disappear into this so-called
              Zone of Avoidance (ZOA), so their true sizes and possible connections with
              visible structures are not known.  Dr. Henning will conduct a survey of the
              galaxies in the northern ZOA using the Dwingeloo telescope in the Netherlands
              to observe the 21-cm wavelength spectral line of neutral atomic hydrogen.  This
              line is not affected by the foreground dust, and the distribution of the
              galaxies can be determined.  The results of the survey will be used as a tracer
              of large-scale structure in the Universe, to investigate the space density of
              dwarf type galaxies, and to constrain models of their formation.  In the
              southern hemisphere, specifically selected galaxies will be observed, also at
              21-cm wavelength, using the Parkes telescope in Australia.  In her education
              component, Dr. Henning will design innovative educational programs in
              conjunction with the Astronomy Science Center being formed by a consortium led
              by the University of New Mexico, with the goal of true combination of education
              and research.       ***  ??
