Abstract    :
              The  approach of this Career Research  Project is to apply   weak  classifiers 
              in  machine  learning  systems  to  produce   better  learning  rules.  Weak
              classifiers are those that do   not  allow  correct  concept  identification
              all the  time,  but   that  work  better than random guesses.  Alone, they are
              not good enough  for  applications,  but in combinations, they may  be  useful.
                There  are  two  major  considerations -  efficiency   of  learning  and 
              generalization error.    Within this approach, the goal  of  this  research  is
              to  rigorously investigate the fundamental  problems  of  learning   systems 
              in  supervised learning  performance  and  efficiency    (2)   to  apply 
              adaptive  learning   machines   to  intelligent network management.
