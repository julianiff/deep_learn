Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to develop a system that reliably resolves
              ellipsis in English.  The  system will accept syntactically annotated input,
              and it will produce output in which elliptical  expressions are resolved,
              either by producing a non-elliptical paraphrase or by linking the elliptical 
              expression to its antecedent.  The system will be develmped using the Penn
              Treebank, a syntactically  annotated corpus of several million words,
              containing a wide range of texts of varying styles.  This  research makes
              crucial use of newly available syntactic annotation and associated tools in the
              Penn  Treebank.  The system will be tested on examples from the Treebank to
              determine the percentage of  cases in which ellipsis is correctly resolved. 
              The primary goal of the system is to develop a  practical solution to a major
              outstanding problem in computational linguistics: determining the  antecedent
              for ellipsis occurrences. The project will also have an important secondary
              benefit: it  will result in a massive amount of valuable data for theoreticians
              studying ellipsis and related  phenomena.
