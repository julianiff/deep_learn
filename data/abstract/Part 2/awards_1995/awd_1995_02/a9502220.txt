Abstract    :
              9502220  Schaefer    This award is made under the auspices of the NSF Faculty
              Early Career  Development (CAREER) program.  As a CAREER awardee the
              investigator is  expected to pursue an active education plan in addition to his
              scientific  research project.      Gamma Ray Bursts are enigmatic flashes of
              gamma radiation which last  typically from a second to a minute in duration. 
              When they are bursting,  their brightness varies chaotically, and they are by
              far the brightest source in  the gamma ray sky.  They are seen roughly once a
              day, from random  directions, and at unpredictable times.  Virtually no
              positive facts are known  concerning the cause of gamma ray bursts, and this is
              traceable to the  unfortunate circumstances that the distance scale to the
              bursters cannot be  constrained to within 13 orders of magnitude.  The
              population of bursts  might be distributed among distant galaxies, in an
              extended halo around our  Milky Way, or in our Sun's Oort Cloud.  Until this
              distance scale question can  be solved, gamma ray bursts must remain one of the
              biggest mysteries in  modern astrophysics.  Dr. Schaefer will attack the
              distance scale problem  from several perspectives with the goal of finding a
              solution.  In his  education activities, Dr. Schaefer plans to integrate
              undergraduate and  graduate students into the research projects through
              opportunities for  undergraduate summer work, senior projects, graduate student
              summer  work, and graduate thesis work.  He will also continue public education
               activities with amateur astronomers to strengthen professional/amateur 
              relationships.
