Abstract    :
                  9502221  Davisson  This award renews NSF support of the Mouse Mutant Stocks
              Center (MMSC) at The Jackson Laboratory, an internationally renowned center for
              genetic studies of the laboratory mouse.  The mouse is the primary experimental
              system for study of a variety of aspects of mammalian genetics and development.
               The MMSC has two missions: 1) to maintain and distribute strains of mutant
              mice and information about the strains to the scientific community, and 2)
              discover and characterize new spontaneous mutations in the mouse. 
              Approximately 950 spontaneous mutations have been detected in the mouse; of
              these, 121 mutations are represented by the stocks maintained by the MMSC.  In
              addition, the large breeding colonies of genetically well-characterized mice
              maintained at The Jackson Laboratory are a particularly convenient and
              inexpensive source of new spontaneous mutations.  Each year, the NSF support
              for this collection benefits a large number of academic, non-profit, government
              and industrial researchers who request with known or newly detected mutations.
