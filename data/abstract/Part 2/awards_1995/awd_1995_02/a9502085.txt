Abstract    :
              9502085  Hautala    The deep water mass exchange between the South and North
              Pacific through the Samoan passage  will be quantified by conducting an
              hydrographic line between Fiji and Tahiti across the Samoan  passage and the
              Pehring basin. Water temperature, salinity, nutrients and dissolved oxygen will
               be extracted from water samples collected every 30 nautical miles. This
              experiment is a  component of the one-time hydrographic survey of the World
              Ocean Circulation Experiment  (WOCE).
