Abstract    :
              In this project funded through the Faculty Early Career Development   (CAREER)
              Program  of the Chemistry Division, Professor Susan Graul  of   the Department
              of Chemistry of the Carnegie- Mellon University will study   the
              thermochemistry, kinetics, and dynamics of gas-phase ion-molecule   reactions. 
              Reaction cross sections and product angular and energy   distributions will be
              determined using mass-analyzed ion kinetic energy   spectrometry and guided
              ion-beam techniques.  Initial studies will focus   on the exothermic
              bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reactions   of methyl halides CH3X
              (X=Cl,Br,I) with F- and Cl- ions.  These studies   will be extended to other
              systems such as the reactions of F- and Cl-   ions with chloroacetonitrile and
              bromoacetonitrile, and others.    Furthermore, bimolecular elimination
              reactions will also be investigated.    These experimental studies will be
              complemented by electronic structure   calculations for relevant reaction
              intermediates and transition states,   and statistical theoretical modeling of
              the reactions studied for   comparison with experimental results.  Accompanying
              the research activity   is a specified education effort appropriate to the
              development of a full,   balanced, academic career.   The chemistry of
              ion-molecule reactions is at the forefront of gas phase   reaction chemistry. 
              As such it plays an important role in the chemistry   of combustion processes,
              the chemistry of the upper atmosphere, and other   areas. This research will
              contribute to our understanding of these   processes by providing data suitable
              for the development of advanced   theoretical, molecular based  models of
              chemical reactions.
