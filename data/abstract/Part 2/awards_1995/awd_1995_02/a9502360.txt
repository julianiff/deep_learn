Abstract    :
              9502360  Dougherty    This award provides funding under the "Self-Sufficient 
              Partnership for Research" Program for one year to the  Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center for Dielectric  Studies at the Pennsylvania State
              University.  The Center was  founded in 1983 to do research on ceramic
              dielectric materials  that serve as the technological basis for vital
              components used  in electronic circuits.  The Center's aim is to improve the 
              fundamental understanding of the synthesis, processing, and  properties of
              dielectric materials used in electronic devices.   The Center derives financial
              support from industrial members who  use the results of the Center's research
              to guide their  industrial development of products of technological interest. 
              At  present there are fifteen corporate members.  The research  emphasizes the
              study of multilayer ceramic dielectrics to include  the problems of putting
              diverse materials together into a single  integrated ceramics package that
              contains capacitors,  interconnects, thick and thin films, sensors, and
              polymers.    The Center conducts research to improve basic scientific 
              understanding and techniques that will serve as the basis for  future
              generations of products, while industrial members develop  the generic advanced
              technologies used to manufacture and test  advanced dielectric devices.  These
              devices are critical to the  electronics, communications, and computer
              industries.    The Program Manager recommends Pennsylvania State University be 
              awarded $21,500 for one year.
