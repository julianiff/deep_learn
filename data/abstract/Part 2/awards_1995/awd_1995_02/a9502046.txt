Abstract    :
              9502046  Kenny  This is a CAREER award which emphasizes the combined aspects of
              research and education in the area of  MicroElectroMechanical Structures
              (MEMS).  Particular emphasis will be placed in the research program on an
              improved understanding of micromechanical properties with experiments conducted
              over a wide temperature range on phonon (thermal) transport in confined
              geometries and acoustic wave transmission through isolated microstructures. 
              The materials employed will be amorphous, polycrystal-line and single-crystal
              microstructures.  The teaching program will involve both undergraduate and
              graduate courses in MEMS with particular emphasis on development of a new
              micromechanical systems course.  ***
