Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Julie d'Itri    The focus of the research is the development of new
              processes for conversion of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) to environmentally more
              benign hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by catalytic hydrodechlorination.  The initial
              model under investigation is the hydrodechlorination of 1,1-
              dichlorotetrafluoroethane catalyzed by palladium supported on various
              materials.  Emphasis is placed on elucidating the factors that dictate
              selectivity towards 1,1,1,2- tetrafluoroethane.  Quantitative rate measurements
              provide fundamental kinetics parameters such as heat of adsorption, activation
              energy, and intrinsic rate constant.  The influences of metal particle size,
              metal-support interactions, and support acidity on each of these parameters are
              determined.  The mechanism and transition state are examined using isotopic
              transient experiments and linear free energy relationships.    The results of
              this research are important for the destruction of chlorofluorocarbons in
              industrial wastes, for control of CFC emissions, and for the production of
              substitute refrigerants, cleaning agents, blowing agents, and propellants that
              are more tolerable environmentally.    Curricular materials in the forms of 
              both classroom courses and laboratory experiments are developed in tandem with
              this research.  Students at both undergraduate and graduate levels are exposed
              the concepts and goals of environmentally benign chemical processing.  The
              intent is to instill new standards of engineering practice that include
              recognition of environmental concerns and needs.
