Abstract    :
              Abstract   Parker  CO Schl/Mines   CTS-9502481      Dr. Parker is an experienced
              researcher and has proposed a difficult and innovative research plan in the
              area of spray droplet combustion under high pressure conditions which makes use
              of picosecond laser diagnostics in the infrared.  The problem is important and
              the nominee has the experience to be successful.  His teaching plan which
              includes curriculum development and undergraduate research appears to be
              realistic and innovative.  His proposal was well thought out and very well
              written.
