Abstract    :
              9502170  Harmon  This  is  an  award  to  provide the  support  this 
              investigator  requested  in  response  to  NSF  94-101,  the  National  Science
               Foundation  Faculty  Early  Career Development  (CAREER)  Program  which  has 
              the  intent of encouraging the early  development  of  academic faculty as
              educators and researchers.  The objective  of  his  research  is  to  link
              common soil  characteristics  to  the  specific  phase  distribution and
              accessibility or extractability  of  nonvolatile  organic  chemicals in
              soil-water  systems.   His  secondary  objective is to evaluate supercritical
              carbon  dioxide  extraction   as   a   laboratory-based  analytical   method  
              for  decontamination   of   soil  groundwater.    The   investigator's 
              education plan involves activities that will help him to maintain  a 
              career-long  focus  on  educational advances  in  science  and  engineering.  
              He  plans to address this by developing  a  viable  research group at all
              academic levels and presenting courses that  are  consistent  with  his
              research interests,  departmental  and  accreditation issues and developing
              courses that integrate theory  and technology for researchers and practicing
              engineers.    Results  of this investigator's research are expected to  improve
               the  engineering  design  of procedures  to  decontaminate  soil.  Targeted 
              results  include correlations  of  soil  properties  to  predict    their  
              responsive   behavior   when   subjected    to  decontamination procedures. 
              This investigator's educational plan  is  expected  to result in improved
              approaches to integration  of  advances in knowledge gained from his research
              into the education  of  engineers  and  to  continue his  participation  in 
              outreach  programs  for  local pre-college students and  displaced  defense 
              workers.  ***
