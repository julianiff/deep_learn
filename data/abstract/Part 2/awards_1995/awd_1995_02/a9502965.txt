Abstract    :
              9502965  Adler     The proposed research aims to give a mathematical formulation
              of string theory. The investigator proposes to work on the string equation and
              its discrete analogs: these equations are related to matrix models,
              KP-hierarchy and W-algebras. The proposed research will use the
              Duistermaat-Heckman integral (Fourier transform of the Liouville measure of a
              symplectic manifold with a group action) to evaluate matrix integrals arising
              in the string equation.    String theory provides a global model for the
              universe encompassing Einstein's general theory of relativity. And this
              research is an attempt to lay a rigorous mathematical foundation for it.
