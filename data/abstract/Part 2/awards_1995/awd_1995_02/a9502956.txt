Abstract    :
              9502956  Schnabel    This award provides support for high-speed networking
              equipment, high-performance multiprocessor workstation servers. a high-speed
              disk array, and multimedia devices for collaboration, exposition and
              visualization.  The University of Colorado department of Computer Science will
              be addressing issues of data movement in Grand Challenge and National
              Information Infrastructure (NII) applications.  This in conjunction with the
              floating point needs of Grand Challenge computations, leads to their request
              for high-speed computation and communication infrastructure.    The research
              associated with the infrastructure falls into four inter-related projects in
              the area of scientific computing, distributed systems, and resource discovery. 
              These four projects are data movement in Grand Challenge computing, global
              optimization algorithms for molecular configuration problems, compiler-assisted
              network runtime systems, and resource discovery and information sharing.
