Abstract    :
              Advances in computer and telecommunication technologies enable network
              communication from any location and mobility that will lead to new
              collaborative database applications. This research focuses on data management
              demanded by these new mobile applications, that extends beyond the traditional
              distributed database management. Specifically, its goal is to develop
              appropriate protocols (1) for the management of mobile data replicated on both
              mobile and stationary hosts over low-bandwidth and tenuous wireless network
              connections, and (2) for the processing of transactions and activities that
              produce and access these mobile data. Given the inherent resource limitations
              on a mobile host and the fact that disconnections do not necessarily imply the
              failure of the disconnected machine, recovery and  disconnection management are
              approached in an integrated manner. This research combines both  theoretical
              investigation, building on the ACTA extended transaction framework, and
              empirical  evaluation that will result in an experimental platform for mobile
              and wireless distributed computer  systems. By considering t he pragmatic
              issues in developing protocols for mobile data management, this  investigation
              will facilitate the development of such important applications as telemedicine
              that  support remote diagnostics or surgical interventions. The experimental
              laboratory to be established  will also provide hands-on experience for
              undergraduate students exposing them to the research process  itself, thereby
              encouraging their development of mature scientific thinking.
