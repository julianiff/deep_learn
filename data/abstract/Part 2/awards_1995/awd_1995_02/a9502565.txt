Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9502565  Kevin Howell  Texas A&M University    The molecular
              thermodynamics of polymer blends and solutions will be investigated using new
              liquid state theories, computer simulations and small-angle neutron scattering
              (SANS).  Integral-equation methods, such as PRISM theory, will be developed to
              understand the interplay between chain conformations and phase behavior in
              solutions.  The computer simulations will employ the Gibbs ensemble approach to
              study symmetric binary blends and osmotic equilibrium in polymeric solutions. 
              SANS experiments will probe the phase behavior of polyolefins as a function of
              molecular weight, architecture and composition.  The research may contribute to
              improved processing of recycled plastics and development of advanced polymeric
              materials.  The educational plan includes revision of thermodynamics course and
              introduction of a course in experimental design at the undergraduate level. 
              New graduate courses will be developed in statistical mechanics and polymer
              physics.
