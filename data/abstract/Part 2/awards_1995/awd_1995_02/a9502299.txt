Abstract    :
              This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported  in the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focusses on the  development of
              highly selective and sensitive fiber optic  biosensors that employ genetically
              designed bacteria as the sensing  element.  During the tenure of this
              three-year continuing grant,  Professor Daunert and her students at the
              University of Kentucky  will develop recombinant bacteria that luminesce in the
              presence of  toxic heavy metals such as chromium, arsenic, and nickel, 
              incorporate these bacteria as the active elements in fiber optic  sensors, and
              optimize the resulting devices.  Specific targets  include (a) coupling the
              mechanism of resistance of bacteria to  chromate, arsenic, or nickel with the
              luciferase bioluminescence  system; (b) preparing bacterial systems that will
              bioluminesce in  the presence of the targeted metal; and (c) developing
              biosensors  using these engineered bacteria and validating their performance 
              with real samples.  Also during this grant period, Professor  Daunert will
              pursue an educational development plan that includes  broad involvement of
              undergraduates in research, increased public  appreciation of chemistry, and
              the attraction, mentoring, and  retention of undergraduate students from
              underrepresented  demographic groups.    The development of more rapid and
              accurate techniques for  monitoring low-level concentrations of toxic chemicals
              is important  to progress in environmental protection.  By combining the tools
              of  modern molecular biology with fiber optic sensor technology, this  CAREER
              research project should lead to new highly selective and  sensitive probes for
              low concentrations of toxic heavy metals.  The  educational aspects of this
              CAREER project will expand the role of  research in the training of
              undergraduates at the University of  Kentucky and should increase the
              participation of women and  underrepresented minorities in science at that
              institution.
