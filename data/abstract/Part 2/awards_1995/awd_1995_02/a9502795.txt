Abstract    :
              9502795  Osisanya  Wellbore instability in shale formations is a costly problem 
              in the oil and  gas industry and difficult to assess because it is time- 
              dependent.  One of  the keys to maintaining wellbore stability in shale 
              formations is the  ability to reduce mechanical aggravation of the shale which 
              can initiate  wellbore instability during the drilling operation.  There  are
              at present  no systematic means to monitor on-site the combined effects  of the
               mechanical aggravation and drilling fluid rheology.  Wellbore stability 
              models currently applied in the industry cannot account for  the wide range  of
              shale compositions encountered while drilling, and they  do not account  for
              changes in the rheological parameters of the drilling  fluid caused by  the
              dispersion of shale cuttings.    The proposed research will develop a
              systematic approach for  solving  wellbore instability problems at the well
              site.  The  approach will be based  on correlating results from time-dependent
              well site shale  dispersion and  swelling tests under atmospheric conditions to
              similar  results developed in  the laboratory for various shales under
              simulated downhole  conditions.  The  correlations will be used to develop
              rheology/hydraulics  programs.  The  corresponding educational plan includes
              design curricula  including a  Socratic approach, and incorporating practical
              experience  into course  content and lectures.  ***
