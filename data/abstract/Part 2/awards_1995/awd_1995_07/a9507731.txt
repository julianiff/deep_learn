Abstract    :
              This project supports the dissertation research of a student of cultural
              anthropology from the City University of New York.  The student will study the
              factors leading to the expulsion of some rural Mayan Indians from their
              traditional communities in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas.  The student
              will measure the impacts of proselytization, political conflict, poverty,
              marginality, illness and alcoholism as causes of religious conversion in this
              one community.  Using a combination of a survey of a community of resettled
              Indians, ethnographic research in their community of origin as well as their
              community of residence, the student will estimate the strengths of the distinct
              factors leading to religious conversion as well as the importance of conversion
              compared with political factionalism in the expulsions.  This research is
              important because it will add to our expertise about this important area of the
              world, as well as shed light on the multiple factors leading to religious
              changes, local community conflict and urbanization in an under-developed
              society.  This case study will be valuable for the construction of general
              theory on these issues.
