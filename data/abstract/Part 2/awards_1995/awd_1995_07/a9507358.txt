Abstract    :
              9507358  Wourms      Viviparity, i.e. giving birth to living young, first
              evolved among the vertebrates in fishes.  Fishes display an extraordinary
              diversity of specializations for viviparity.  The transition from oviparity
              (egg-laying) to viviparity established a variety of new functional
              relationships, one of which involves maternal-embryonic nutrient transfer. 
              Specialized tissues, such as the placenta, evolved for transfer.  Live-bearing
              goodeid fishes will be used as a model system to study maternal-embryonic
              nutrient transfer across a structure known as the trophotaenial placenta,
              comprised of the epithelial lining of the ovary and external projections of the
              embryonic intestine, termed trophotaeniae.  The cellular basis of
              maternal-embryonic transfer of nutrients across the trophotaenial placenta will
              be characterized using fluorescence and electron microscopy and
              immunocytochemistry to trace the uptake, transport, and fate of proteins.  The
              differentiation of embryonic gut and trophotaenial cells will be analyzed using
              fluorescence and electron microscopy.  An evolutionary model that trophotaeniae
              evolved from embryonic gut tissue by an acceleration of the rates of cell
              division and differentiation in the hindgut relative to other regions of the
              gut and the overall growth of the embryo will be tested.  These studies will
              enhance the understanding of viviparity; provide a detailed functional analysis
              of placental development in fishes; and contribute to evolutionary biology by
              elucidating the evolution of a new organ through modification of embryonic
              development.  ***
