Abstract    :
              IBN-9507171  Dores, Robert M.      Previous attempts at evaluating phylogeny of
              vertebrates by  comparing sequences of low molecular weight polypeptide hormone
               families have yielded, in general, unsatisfactory phylogentic  trees.  This is
              due to the small size and high degree of  conservation, such that there are not
              adequate differences in  peptide structure to construct appropriate trees. 
              Moreover,  construction of trees based on these data have lead to errors in 
              establishing the relationship of one species to another.  However,  Dr. Robert
              Dores believes that phylogenetically relevant  information may be obtained by
              investigating the structure of the  precursor molecules for the pituitary
              hormones, due to their larger  size as opposed to the hormones themselves.  In
              the present  studies, Dr. Dores proposes to isolate and sequence the gene 
              encoding proopiomelanocortin from the pituitary of a number of  different
              species.  By comparing the sequences of these genes using  maximum parsimony
              procedures, development of an accurate  phylogenetic map relating these species
              with other vertebrates will  be possible.  This new information about
              proopiomelanocortin, the  precursor molecule for corticotropin, melanocortin
              and  beta-endorphin, a potent endogenous analgesic molecule, will  provide more
              direct evidence for the relationship between several  species.  In addition, by
              sequencing the gene encoding  proopiomelanocortin, the precursor for the
              important mammalian  stress molecule, corticotropin, new information about
              stress  responses in humans may be obtained.
