Abstract    :
                  9507157  Gasser    The ovules of higher plants play a central role in plant 
              reproduction. In addition, because ovules are the precursors to  seeds, ovule
              development is a critical component of crop  productivity. Ovule development
              includes processes which typify  development in all multicellular organisms and
              can be used as a  model for studying fundamental mechanisms regulating
              morphogenesis  and tissue differentiation in all organisms. Dr. Gasser will use
               Arabidopsis thaliana as a model organism for elucidation of the  genetic
              pathway regulating ovule development. The primary tool in  this analysis will
              be a set of mutants with defects in genes which  regulate this process. He has
              already isolated five such mutants  with specific lesions in ovule development
              and will continue to add  to this set through ongoing mutant screens. He will
              determine the  specific phenotypic effects of these mutations and will 
              characterize their interactions through epistatic analyses. The  results of
              these studies will allow identification of critical  regulatory steps in ovule
              morphogenesis and will enable the  construction of models of the regulatory
              pathway governing ovule  development. Completion of the proposed research will
              significantly  contribute to our knowledge of regulation of reproductive 
              development in higher plants and to a general understanding of  genetic control
              of morphogenesis and histogenesis that can be  applicable to all organisms.
