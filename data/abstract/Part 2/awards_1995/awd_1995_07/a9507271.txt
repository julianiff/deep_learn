              Geographic Information Among Environmental  Agencies  This project seeks to
              determine why so few environmental agencies, not in the business of  providing
              environmental data,  share geographic information, despite the need to
              collaborate in  protecting shared natural resources and the recent growth of
              networked information facilities.  Initial studies suggest the reasons are a
              still-unclear combination of both technical and non-  technical factors.  An
              in-depth case study will analyze and compare four `coalitions` of government 
              agencies in the U.S. that are building `sharing infrastructures` to exchange
              environmental data and  use it meaningfully.  The study will search for impacts
              of networked-shared information on the work of  environmental managers, then
              determine and compare the intent, design, and architecture of the  `sharing
              infrastructures,` and the quality and quantity of shared information that has
              resulted.  The  study will focus t he development of technical solutions to
              information sharing, evaluate present-day  networks for information sharing,
              and highlight effective organizational strategies and technological  growth
              paths for information-based collaboration.
