Abstract    :
              9507061  Hoffman  Multifrequency advanced paramagnetic resonance (amr)
              spectroscopy  will be used to characterize the catalytic centers of multi- 
              metallic enzymes as part of a multidisciplinary effort that  involves
              biochemists, molecular biologists, and microbiologists.   This research, which
              will utilize a unique capacity to employ CW  and pulsed electron-nuclear double
              resonance (endor)and electrol  spin-echo envelope modulation (eseem) techniques
              at both X and Q  Bands, involves a number of protein systems, emphasizing three
               areas: (I) Binuclear non-heme iron centers and amr of non-Kramers  (NK)
              doublets of integer-spin systems (nk-amr); (II) The  nitrogenase MoFe protein;
              (III) Enzymes from hyperthermophiles.  %%%  AMR methods provide detailed
              analytical, structural, and electronic  information about the catalytic sites
              of metalloenzymes, and thus  play a vital role in characterizing their
              mechanisms of function.   It is of course necessary to obtain this information
              because  metalloenzymes play key roles in biological processes.  However,  this
              effort is acquiring increasing significance because of the  growing importance
              of such enzymes in industry and biotechnology  (eg., nitrile hydratase, a
              nonheme Fe enzyme is used to convert  acrylonitrile to acrylamide), in
              agriculture (nitrogenase is the  enzyme that fixes nitrogen in nature), and in
              efforts at  bioremediation of toxic wastes (eg., oxygenases).  ***
