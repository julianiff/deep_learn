Abstract    :
              9507423    This project will use genetic analysis to determine the  patterns of
              paternity and male reproductive success in the  chimpanzees and baboons of
              Gombe National Park, Tanzania.  These populations have been studied under the
              direction of  Dr. Jane Goodall for 35 and 28 years, respectively.  In both 
              species, females mate with many males, and males show a  variety of mating
              strategies including mating at high  frequencies, aggressive competition for
              access to females,  possessive behavior, the formation of consortships, and the
               cultivation of special relationships with females.  However,  little is known
              of the relative effectiveness of these  strategies in achieving paternity
              because genetic analysis  has not been possible.  This project will use a
              non-invasive  procedure, the extraction of DNA from feces, to obtain  genetic
              material for analysis.  Samples from 250 baboons in  five troops, and 20
              chimpanzees in one community, have  already been collected, and techniques for
              DNA extraction  have been perfected.  Samples will be collected from 
              additional infants and unsampled potential parents in six  baboon troops and
              two chimpanzee communities to yield total  sample sizes of 150 infant baboons
              and 20 infant  chimpanzees.  Approximately 8 hypervariable regions of the 
              nuclear DNA will be amplified by the polymerase chain  reaction (PCR), and
              paternity will be determined by  comparing the genotypes of infants, their
              mothers, and  potential fathers.  In combination with the detailed  behavioral
              records, knowledge of paternity will allow  assessment of the effectiveness of
              different mating  strategies.  The study will provide new information about 
              patterns mf relatedness within groups and will provide new  insights into the
              evolution of competitive behavior and  affiliative relationships in these
              species.
