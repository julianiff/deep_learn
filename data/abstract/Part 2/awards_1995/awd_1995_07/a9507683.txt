Abstract    :
              9507683  Tung       Quantum Chromodynamics or QCD is the generally accepted 
              theory of the strong interactions.  There are a variety of  important
              parameters such as the constituent's particles momentum  distributions, etc.,
              that need to be determined before accurate  predictions can be made about the
              results of high energy  experiments.       This research seeks to address such
              questions and to propose  experimental tests for exploring scattering
              mechanisms in high  energy collisions at present and future accelerators.      
              The research also will address questions in the symmetry  breaking of the
              electroweak interactions.  ***
