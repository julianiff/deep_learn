Abstract    :
              9507441  Heath      White whales endure oxygen deficits, extreme cold and
              pressure, and rapid changes in pressure when they perform repeated prolonged
              breathhold dives to greater than 1800 feet.  This study will examine how these
              factors affect important body functions such heart beat, circulation and oxygen
              delivery to tissues.  Of particular interest are specific adaptations that
              allow the whales to perform such dives repeatedly without incurring any harmful
              physiological side-effects.  ***
