Abstract    :
                  9507680  Stein    The field of motor control has advanced rapidly in the
              past twenty years.  Researchers have learned about important basic principles
              that explain how circuits of brain cells produce coordinated movements.  One
              force in moving the field has been an international conference (held every ten
              years) of researchers from many disciplines with a common interest in
              biological motor control.  This award will provide support for the third such
              meeting.  By advancing the field toward the next century, this meeting will
              have a great impact on our understanding of the physiology of movement, the
              neural mechanisms and feedback control of behavior, and the engineering
              analysis of complex neural functions.   ***
