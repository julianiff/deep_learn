Abstract    :
              This grant supports the planning and initial development of  a database for
              neurons of the zebrafish nervous system.  Neurons are the integrative units of
              nervous systems. A  common goal in many areas of neuroscience research is to 
              understand nervous system organization and function in terms  of the properties
              of individual neurons. The zebrafish  nervous system contains large numbers of
              identifiable  neurons, some of which have been characterized in terms of  their
              detailed anatomical, physiological, developmental and  genetic properties. The
              objectives of this grant are: to  develop a prototype database system for
              neuronal, genetic  and developmental zebrafish data which will provide 
              meaningful ways of relating various neuronal properties (and  thus help
              understand neuron functions) and to make that  database publicly available over
              the Internet.
