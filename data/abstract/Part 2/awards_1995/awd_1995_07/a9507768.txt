Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to undertake theoretical and  empirical research
              into the problem of fraudulent claims filed in  insurance markets.  A growing
              body of empirical work aims to  document the existence of fraudulent or
              exaggerated claims in  selected insurance markets, and to aid insurers in
              identifying  particular claims which may be fraudulent.  Theoretical analyses 
              have focused on designing optimal schemes for the auditing of  claims which are
              filed to detect and deter fraudulent claims.   This project fills and an
              important gap in both the theoretical  and empirical literature on insurance
              fraud by considering  contractual mechanisms by which insures might manage the
              problem  of fraud.  Rather than simply designing and implementing ex-post 
              situations such as claims audits, the project examines how the  initial
              insurance contract might be designed in order to provide  incentives of
              claimants not to cheat.  Since efficient policy  approaches to the problem of
              fraud are likely to entail ex-ante  incentives as well as ex-post sanctions,
              this research promises  to provide important insights into a heretofore ignored
              aspect of  effective fraud management.  The theoretical contracting model  will
              be tested using a large and detailed dataset on automobile  settlements.
