Abstract    :
                This project, to be conducted under the guidance of the US National Committee
              for  the Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) of the
              International  Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU), will consist of an
              interdisciplinary study of  international access to scientific and technical
              (S&T) data.  The primary focus of  the study will be on d ata in electronic
              form, a topic of increasing complexity and  importance in scientific research
              and international collaboration.  It will begin  by outlining the needs for
              data in the major research areas of current scientific  interest in the
              astronomical, biological, geological and physical sciences.  It  will then
              characterize the legal, economic,  policy, and technical factors and trends
              that have an influence on access to data  by the scientific community.  It will
              also identify and analyze the barriers to  international access to S&T data. 
              The study will recommend approaches that might  help overcome barriers to
              access in the international context.  NSF is sharing  support for this project
