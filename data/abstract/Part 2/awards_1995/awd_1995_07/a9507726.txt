Abstract    :
              9507726  Cable    This award supports a one-year postdoctoral fellowship from
              the  Japan Society for the Promotion of Science for Dr. Samuel B.  Cable. This
              fellowship will make it possible for Dr. Cable to  collaborate with Prof.
              Yutaka Uchida of the Science University of  Tokyo and the University of Tokyo. 
               They will use three  dimensional magnetohydrodynamic computer modeling to test
               alternative theories of the origins of solar flares.  New  theories of flare
              origin are needed because many of the  traditional ideas in this field have met
              with serious, perhaps  insurmountable, difficulties in light of the data from
              the  Japanese "Yohkoh" satellite.    This project fulfills the Program's
              objective of exchange of  scientific knowledge through international
              collaboration.  As a  postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Cable will be able to
              familiarize  himself with the Yohkoh data (unquestionably the best data on 
              solar flares available to date)  and with new theories regarding solar flares
              developed by the  Yohkoh research staff.  He will also contribute to the 
              development and testing of these theories.  ***
