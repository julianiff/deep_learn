Abstract    :
              9507349  Cook       This is a proposal by three faculty and two senior  staff in
              the physics department at the Univ. of Washington  to continue a diverse
              program in experimental high energy  physics.  They are engaged in the SLD
              experiment at the  Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, the ALEPH experiment at 
              the CERN laboratory  in Geneva, Switzerland and they are  members of the U.S.
              group which is planning for  participation in the ATLAS experiment which will
              be a part  of the LHC experimental program at CERN when the accelerator  is
              finished in 2004.  ***
