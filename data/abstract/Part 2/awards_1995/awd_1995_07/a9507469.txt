Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks supplemental funding to conduct a survey of Black Americans
              during the 1996 Presidential election.  This survey will build on earlier 1984
              and 1988 surveys of the Black electorate and help answer questions about the
              impact of political environment and legislative representation (areas omitted
              in the earlier studies) on Black voting behavior.  The following issues will be
              addressed: the impact of Black congressional representation and electoral
              arrangements on Black voting behavior and public opinion, the impact of
              political context on Black turnout, the impact of respondent's subjective
              evaluation of political culture on their behaviors and attitudes, the
              determinants of Black vote, the salience and weight of racial identification,
              the level of Black satisfaction with political gains in the post-civil rights
              era.  The data will also permit intergroup comparisons with the 1996 National
              Election Study respondents.
