Abstract    :
                  Nontechnical Summary, Nevin J. IBN-9507584    "Resistance to Change,
              Preference, and the Law of Effect"        One of the oldest principles of
              psychology is the Law of Effect,  which states that rewards strengthen the
              behavior that produces  them.  However, the relation between the value of a
              reward and  its effectiveness in strengthening behavior remains unclear.  Over
              the past 20 years, PI has interpreted the strength of  behavior as the
              resistance of well-learned behavior to change,  and has shown that resistance
              to change depends directly on the  frequency or amount of reward signaled by a
              distinctive stimulus  situation.  At the same time, methods for measuring
              reward value,  interpreted as preference between stimulus situations that
              signal  various frequencies or amounts of reward, have become  progressively
              more precise.  Both lines of research have led to  findings that are quite
              general across species and situations;  however, no research has attempted to
              measure preference and  resistance to change at the same time, in an individual
              subject,  which is necessary to determine how these measures are related to 
              each other.  The proposed experiments will study preference and  resistance to
              change in pigeons working for food rewards under a  variety of conditions
              designed to isolate a mathematical  expression relating them.  That relation
              will be a quantitative  statement of the Law of Effect.
