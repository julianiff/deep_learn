Abstract    :
              9507577  Weertman      This U.S.-Mexico award will support Prof. Julia Weertman
              of  Lorthwestern University in a research collaboration with  Profs. Jorge
              Cabanas Moreno and Hector Calderon Benavides of  the Instituto Politecnico
              Nacional (IPN) in Mexico City, for  research on the mechanical behavior and
              characterization of  nanocrystalline metals, and the kinetics of coarsening of 
              coherent particles in nickel and iron-based alloys.  In  studying the
              mechanical properties and internal structure of  nanocrystalline metals,
              samples will be prepared by  mechanical alloying/mechanical milling and two
              other  synthesis routes.  Thus the influence of preparation method  on
              properties and grain boundary behavior will be examined.  The coarsening
              behavior of coherent particles in metal  alloys will be studied as a function
              of lattice mismatch in  samples containing bimodal particle distributions.   
              The proposed research collaboration will benefit from the  extensive experience
              at Northwestern University on the  mechanical properties and internal structure
              of  nanocrystalline materials and the synthesis and processing  routes followed
              by the Mexican side.  This award will also  facilitate the travel of students,
              thus providing them with  an international research experience early in their
              careers.  ***
