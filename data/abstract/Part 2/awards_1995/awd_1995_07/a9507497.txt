Abstract    :
              Alpert  9507497      Clonal plants include some of the moat invasive, rapidly
              spreading, and persistent species known.  They are also unique among plants in
              their capacities to place potentially independent units (ramets) non-randomly
              and to share resources among connected ramets. Two central hypotheses have been
              developed about clonal plants: (1) that integration among ramets confers
              significant advantages in habitats where resources are concentrated in small
              patches; and (2) differences in the degree of integration among clones reflect
              selection in response to different patterns of resource patchiness - i.e.,
              clonal plants with a certain pattern of how ramets are placed and how they are
              integrated will be best adapted to an environment with a very specific
              distribution of light, water, nutrients, etc.  Given the invasive potential of
              clonal plants, understanding the role of  plant architecture in allowing the
              transfer of materials from patches where resources are abundant to patches
              where resources are limiting is critical in order to be able to predict and
              mitigate clonal plant invasions of natural or agricultural landscapes.    The
              clonal herb, Fragaria Chiloensis, beach strawberry, is common in coastal sand
              dunes and grassland communities in Northern California where it plays an
              important ecological role.  On dunes, the nitrogen fixing shrub, Lupinus
              arboreous, creates a landscape in which high light and soil nitrogen levels
              occur in different places.  In grassland, Lupinus creates high soil nitrogen
              patches in a uniformly low light environment. In this study it will be
              determined whether: (1) connected ramets grow faster than unconnected ramets in
              the field due to resource sharing; and (2) differences in clonal architecture
              and the degree of sharing will vary between populations taken from dunes versus
              those from grasslands in a manner consistent with the patchiness of resources
              in those habitats..
