Abstract    :
              9507399  McIntosh  An international meeting, "Plant Mitochondria: From Gene to
              Function" will be held at Durham North Carolina from April 7 to April 12, 1995.
              The meeting will bring together different communities of scientists asking
              questions about plant mitochondria. The overriding goal of this meeting will be
              to bring together those individuals working on the function of mitochondrial
              processes and those working on genetic structure and regulation to intermingle
              their ideas and approaches.  ***
