Abstract    :
              The study of the origin and evolution of humans necessarily includes as subject
              matter our nearest relatives, the non human primates.  Understanding how living
              primates use their bodies (muscles and bones) to move about in different ways
              provides the proper context for the reconstruction of ancient lifestyles of our
              ancestors.  We need to understand the relationship between body form and
              function, and know different structures work, or what it is for, if we are to
              be able to interpret fossil finds correctly.    This project concerns the
              application of certain experimental methods to such analyses of anatomical form
              and function in living non human primates, using bone strain analysis,
              telemetered electromyography, and the analysis of kinematics and kinetics
              through triplanr videotaping and the use of an electronic pressure measurement
              system.  These are all extremely sophisticated ways of monitoring muscle
              activity and bone stress and strain of animals perform different sets of
              movements - walking, arm swinging, knuckle walking, and so on.  The information
              obtained will be  used to help interpret the adaptive significance of features
              distinguishing living monkeys, apes and humans, and to apply that understanding
              to the interpretation of the fossil evidence for human and primate evolution.
