                                  Non-Technical Summary                                  IBN 
              95-07178    Evolution of Social Systems    Robert R. Warner      The objective
              of Dr. Warner's research is to employ a new  approach to the study of the
              evolution of social systems.  He will use a well-known marine fish (the
              bluehead wrasse)  as a model system.  Initially, the study employs a 
              mathematical modeling technique in which the decisions of  one group (e.g.,
              subordinate males) act as inputs to the  decision-making process in another
              group (e.g., females) and  vice-versa.  In this way, Warner will explore how
              several  groups interact and resolve conflicts; the social system is  an
              outcome of this resolution.  Secondly, he will quantify  an important part of
              the model by using DNA techniques to  relate effort in producing gametes to
              resulting paternity.  This is particularly important to know in situations
              where  gamete competition occurs.  Lastly, the PI will test the  predictions of
              the model in a series of manipulative field  experiments.  These will include
              (1) studies of allocation  of energy by males between gamete production and
              defense;  (2) a test of  the hypothesis that courtship behaviors can  indicate
              local safety; and (3) studies of allocation of  aggression by males.
