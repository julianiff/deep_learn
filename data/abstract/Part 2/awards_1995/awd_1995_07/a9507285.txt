Abstract    :
              Cole  9507285  The goal of this research is to initiate a cellular and genetic
              analysis of development during Tetrahymena conjugation. To that end, we will,
              1.) Determine developmental dependencies during conjugation. by a combination
              of isolating mutants or/and physically manipulating the mating conditions,  2.)
              Search for developmental checkpoints by searching for mutations that relieve
              the developmental dependency, and 3.) Identify and characterize the functions
              of gene products that participate in specific conjugal events.  %%%  The
              objective of this research is to understand the cellular and molecular
              mechanisms by which Tetrahymena thermophila, a species of ciliated protozoan,
              controls its passage through the complex cytoplasmic and nuclear events
              associated with mating. Mutants relevant to this process will be isolated and
              characterized. Also the mating conditions will be physically manipulated.   ***
