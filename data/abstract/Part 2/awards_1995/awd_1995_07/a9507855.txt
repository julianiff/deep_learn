Abstract    :
              The investigator undertakes to complete establishing connections between two
              separate contemporary areas of statistics, namely geo- and spatial statistics. 
              These connections are developed (1) by analyzing popular scientific models in
              both of these sub-fields; (2) by evaluating these models within the context of
              the sizes and shapes of geographic regions to which they are applied; (3) by
              studying the role geographic direction plays in preserving or altering these
              connections; and (4) by investigating properties of these models for geographic
              maps upon which similar or markedly different classificatory color codings tend
              to cluster.  Much of the theoretical research will be pursued with the use of
              computers.  Selected U.S. EPA Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program
              (EMAP) data already obtained for the Chesapeake and Delaware estuaries and the
              northeast forest inventory will be used for empirical analysis and
              demonstration purposes.  The practical importance of this proposed research
              arises within the U.S. EPA EMAP project, a major national endeavor in which
              statistics are being applied to environmental issues as well as monitoring and
              analysis undertakings.  Articulation of a common foundation for geo- and
              spatial statistics will better enable consistent statistical application and
              analysis of the massive amounts of geo-referenced, or locationally tagged, EMAP
              data becoming available.  These data currently are being collected and
              geo-referenced in terms of a network of approximately 12,600 hexagons overlayed
              on the continental United States.
