Abstract    :
              This proposal calls for the study of, "Microwave/Optical  Spectroscopy of Helium
              and H2 Rydberg States".  The focus is  the study of high Rydberg states in
              these two electron  systems under conditions which allow virtually complete 
              spatial separation of the electrons.  The circumstances  provides an
              opportunity for extremely precise calculations  of the structure of such
              states, incorporating relativistic  and radiative corrections without
              uncertainty in the non-  relativistic structure.  It becomes a testing ground
              for  fundamental atomic theory, especially as specialized to few  electron
              systems.  The Rydberg states are produced by  neutralizing an accelerated ion
              beam.  The high-L Rydberg  states are detected using a CO2 laser and Stark
              ionization.  High precision spectroscopy is carried out using microwave 
              methods to look at transitions between states of the same n.
