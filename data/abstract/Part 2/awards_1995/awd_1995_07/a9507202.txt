Abstract    :
              9507202  Fletcher  To study the reaction mechanism which governs the 3he(d,p)4He
               reaction at very low energies, we will design, construct, and  test a proton
              polarimeter which we will use to measure relevant  polarization transfer
              coefficients.  The device will be designed  and built at SUNY-Geneseo, and
              tested using unpolarized beams  from the Geneseo 2-MV Van de Graaff
              accelerator.  The  polarization measurements will be made using the atomic beam
               polarized ion source at Triangle Universities Nuclear Lab, in  collaboration
              with researchers from the University of North  Carolina-Chapel Hill. 
              Undergraduates students from Geneseo will  be involved in all phases of the
              project, from polarimeter design  to analysis of the data.  The result of this
              project will be the  first measurements of polarization transfer in the
              3He(d,p)4He  reaction near the 3/2+ resonance.  These data will be useful in 
              understanding the 3He(d,p)4He reaction and in evaluation the  importance of
              different reaction mechanisms below the resonance  energy.  ***
