Abstract    :
              IBN-9507972  Lephart, Edwin D.        The sex steroid hormones can be
              transformed from one class to  another by certain enzymes.  The conversion of
              androgens (e.g.  testosterone) to estrogens by an enzyme known as aromatase 
              cytochrome P450 plays an important role in influencing the  development of the
              central nervous system.  The dramatic impact of  estrogen formation via the
              aromatase enzyme is responsible for  structural differences between males and
              females in specific brain  regions.  These structural differences determine how
              the central  nervous system will function along male versus female patterns for
               hormone secretion and the regulation of sexual behavior.  This  study will
              determine how brain estrogen biosynthesis is controlled  by the aromatase gene.
               This will be accomplished by utilizing  various molecular biological
              techniques.  The goal of these studies  is to determine the molecular basis of
              brain aromatase regulation  by determining the regulatory elements governing
              how the aromatase  gene is activated.  To accomplish this goal, Dr. Lephart
              will  characterize the regulatory sequences upstream of the start site of 
              transcription for the aromatase gene and whether these elements  change during
              development.  The regulation of aromatase gene  expression by androgen will be
              investigated and the message in  brain encoding this critical enzyme will also
              be studied.  The  outcome of these studies will allow the development of a
              picture  about how the proteins in the brain control the expression of  enyzmes
              critical for the development of essential centers in the  brain.
