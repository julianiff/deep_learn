Abstract    :
              9507260  Hedin       A group of faculty and students at Northern Illinois 
              University are engaged in research with the DO collaboration  who operate at
              the Tevatron proton-antiproton collider at  Fermilab (FNAL) and do simulation
              on backgrounds to be  expected in detectors at higher-energy, higher-luminosity
               colliders.  The model for that latter is the ATLAS detector  planned for the
              Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN  laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. 
              The group has a  particular expertise in muon detection systems including  data
              acquisition, calibration, trigger software and track  reconstruction.  As such
              it has important responsibilities  in the currently active upgrade of the DO
              detector and  focuses on analysis of related phenomena, events with muon 
              signatures.  support is prided to three senior faculty, a  junior faculty
              member, a postdoctoral research associate  and, in part, a senior research
              associate as well as two  graduate students and, as an REU supplement, two 
              undergraduate students.  ***
