Abstract    :
              9507648  Przeworksi    This research investigation examines 1)  whether
              political  regimes--defined as democracy, autocracy, and bureaucracy--affect 
              the aggregate economic size of governments, and 2) whether  government size has
              consequences for economic performance,  measured in terms of growth,
              consumption, investment, inflation,  and population dynamics.  The impact of
              different types of  democratic institutions, mainly parliamentarism and 
              presidentialism, is also distinguished    The emphasis is placed on the
              objectives of governments and the  mechanisms of accountability they face under
              different political  institutions.  Empirical predictions concerning the size
              of  government and economic performance are derived from a formal  model. 
              These predictions are tested, using data for 139  countries between 1950 and
              1990, by estimating the probability  that incumbents lose office as a result of
              bad economic  performance and by estimating equations which relate government 
              size to economic performance.  The analysis is conducted  separately for each
              type of political institution, taking account  of the fact that regimes are
              endogenous with regard to economic  performance.    The project will elucidate
              the impact of political institutions  on the accountability of governments and
              on their economic  behavior.  In particular, it will assess whether democracy
              can be  expected to generate better economic policies and better  performance
              than different types of dictatorship and whether  different democratic
              institutions affect policies and  performance.  These results have direct
              consequences for issues  of institutional engineering, particularly applicable
              to new  democracies.  ***
