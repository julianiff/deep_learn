Abstract    :
                This collaborative research grant supports the international linkage costs to
              enable Dr.  W. A. Clemens, Professor in the Department of Paleontology,
              University of California, Berkeley, and two colleagues, to conduct one month's
              field reconnaissance research in January 1996, to amplify previous discoveries
              of Mesozoic vertebrate fossils in Ethiopia and Tigray.  The team will
              intensively prospect exposures of Mesozoic sediments in the Abay (Upper Blue
              Nile) River Basin.  Prospecting will be directed toward discovery of remains of
              both small vertebrates as well as the larger dinosaurs and other reptiles.  The
              research is expected to yield data concerning questions of phylogenetic
              interrelationships of lineages of Jurassic African vertebrates and their
              changing biogeographic distributions.  The foreign partners are the Dr. Getaneh
              Assefa, of the Department of Geology and Geophysics, Addis Ababa University,
              and Dr. Jara Haile Mariam, the Director of the Natural History Museum, Addis
              Ababa.  The collaboration with the Ethiopian institutions, which are making
              their laboratory and curatorial facilities available for the team's use, is
              expected to lead to definition of future, long-term research projects.  The
              strengthening of academic relations between the US and Ethiopian institutions
              will create new opportunities for field experience for US students, and
              training of Ethiopian students.
