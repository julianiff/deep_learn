Abstract    :
              Lay Abstract    9507361    As one defense against herbivory, many plants produce
              proteinase inhibitors that interact with digestive enzymes produced by insect
              herbivores.  The inhibitors reduce the insect's ability to digest plant tissue.
               Some insects, however, respond to proteinase inhibitors by producing forms of
              the digestive enzymes that are not susceptible to the inhibitor.  This ability
              may permit some insects to feed successfully and grow rapidly on a wide range
              of plants, using a different suite of digestive enzymes for each.  This
              research will test that hypothesis by comparing two insects, a dietary
              specialist (the black cutworm) and a dietary generalist (the corn earworm). 
              The genes that code for the digestive enzymes called trypsins will be isolated
              and characterized in each species, and the susceptibility of each form of
              trypsin to inhibitors will be determined. The results should yield insight into
              the diversity and regulation of digestive enzymes in plant-eating insects, the
              importance of plant proteinase inhibitors as defenses against insect attack,
              and the importance of digestive physiology in controlling the range of plants
              on which a particular insect can feed.  Ultimately, the research may lead to
              development of effective strategies for controlling herbivorous insects by
              manipulating the level and diversity of proteinase inhibitors in agricultural
              and horticultural plants, and/or disrupting the mechanisms that insects use to
              regulate digestive enzyme production and secretion.
