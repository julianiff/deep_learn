Abstract    :
              9507551  Jaluria  Description:  This proposal requests travel  support for US
              participation at the Second  Conference of the Indian Society for  Heat and 
              Mass Transfer (ISHMT) to be held December, 1995  in  Mangalore, India.  ISHMT
              is the nodal agency in  India for stimulating research in this area of  thermal
              sciences.  Heat and mass transfer play  a very important role in manufacturing 
              industries and in industrial processes.   Understanding of the phenomena that
              underlie  industrial processes is essential for the  optimal design of
              equipment, components, and  efficiency of processes.  The objectives of the 
              conference are to promote the exchange of  technical information in this
              rapidly evolving  field, to identify areas of cooperation between  industry and
              research institutions, and to  further enhance the existing level of US-Indo 
              collaborations.  Participants will have the  opportunity to discuss the
              state-of-the-art in  areas of prime interest in both countries and  to visit
              India's leading research centers such  as the IITs, the Indian Institute of
              Science  and the  National Aeronautical Laboratory,  Bangalore.       Scope: 
              Thermal sciences are expected to play  an important role in the development of 
              national critical technologies in the next  decade.  In addition to the
              national effort,  there is considerable effort to  internationalize research
              and technology  development in thermal sciences, particularly  in the area of
              heat and mass transfer.  India  is one of the leading countries in Asia that 
              conduct significant research in heat and mass  transfer.  The conference is
              organized to allow  for dialogue among potential collaborators and  the
              development of focused research proposals.    US-Indo collaboration is
              currently well below  its potential considering the level of activity  in the
              field in each country. ***
