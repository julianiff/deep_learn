Abstract    :
              9507137  Diehl    This U.S.-Czech cooperative research project between Dr. Jimmy
               Diehl of Michigan Technological University and Dr. Jaroslav  Kadlec of the
              Czech Geological Survey will involve measurement of  variations in the amounts,
              types and grain sizes of magnetic  particles contained in cave sediments.  The
              researchers intend to  obtain this magnetic property data, carbon 14 dates, and
              pollen  analyses from the interior floodwater deposits of Spiralka Cave  and
              the entrance facie sediments of the Kulna Cave, both of which  are located in
              the Moravian Karst of the Czech Republic.  Results  should be useful in
              interpreting measurements from other cave  deposits in Central Europe and for
              eventual reconstruction of the  regionally variable response to global climate
              change during the  Late Pleistocene/Holocene eras.      This project in
              geophysics and paleontology fulfills the program  objectives of advancing
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading  experts in the United States and
              Eastern Europe to combine  complementary talents and pool research resources in
              areas of  strong mutual interest and competence.  ***
