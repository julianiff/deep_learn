Abstract    :
                  9507392  Gardner  Support is requested for an international conference on 
              plant growth regulators to be held in Minneapolis, MN, July  14-18, 1995.  This
              conference will be the 15th in a series  of conferences sponsored by the
              International Plant Growth  Substance Association (IPGSA).  Progress in
              understanding  the perception and action of plant hormones is advancing at  a
              rapid pace as a result of technological advances in the  areas of genetics and
              molecular cloning.  These advances  have led to the identificaiton of genes
              that are involved in  the perception of hormonal signals, and plant biologists
              are  now beginning to unravel the signal transduction pathways  that link
              hormone receptors to the cellular response.  The  goals of the 15th
              International Conference on Plant Growth  Substances are to bring together
              researchers who are working  in this field to report on new developments and to
              share new  ideas.  Topics to be covered in plenary sessions and  symposia
              include signal transduction, hormonal regulation of  gene expression,
              integration of growth processes, the use  and application of transgenic plants
              in hormone research ,  identification of new signalling molecules, hormone 
              biosynthesis and metabolism, and hormone perception and  sensitivity.  Two
              non-plant biologists, Ira Herskowitz and  Keith Yamamoto, have also been
              invited to participate in our  plenary sessions to provide breadth to the
              topics of signal  transduction and hormonal regulation of gene expression.  The
              program promises to be exciting and to stimulate  research on plant growth. 
              These compounds have long been  established as important for U.S. agriculture,
              and our  understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of their  action is
              essential for the long-term sustainability of  agriculture.
