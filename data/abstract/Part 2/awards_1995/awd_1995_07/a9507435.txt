Abstract    :
              9507435  Bradley      Small insects have a large surface to volume ratio.  Since
              the loss of body water occurs across the integument, such a ratio leads to
              severe water loss in insects.  A major site of water loss in all animals is the
              respiratory system.  Insects control this loss through the action of valves
              (spiracles) on their breathing tubes (tracheae).  Dr. Bradley will study the
              action of the spiracles in fruit flies selected for resistance to desiccation. 
              His hypothesis is that the respiratory pattern in these insects will be highly
              modified to conserve water.  This study will be of interest to insect
              physiologists and ecologists interested in the distribution and survival of
              insects and in the control of insect pests by disruption of the respiratory and
              water conservation systems.  ***
