Abstract    :
                      9507319  Storm  The Gordon Research Conferences are held every summer to
              discuss recent findings and current thinking in various areas of science.
              Although participation is limited, the attendees usually consist of established
              scientists, young investigators who are making important contributions in these
              areas, and post doctoral fellows. They are usually held in small isolated New
              England towns away from other distractions and are conducive to the free
              exchange of ideas. These conferences have a recognized value for presenting the
              latest advances in research and also indicating the future trends which are
              likely to be most productive.  ***
