Abstract    :
              9507412  Napolitano       Research will be carried out in high energy electron 
              scattering and photonuclear reactions centered on the study of  baryon and
              meson structure and spectroscopy.  Research in these  areas will advance our
              understanding of the quark and gluon  structure of these systems.  These topics
              are high priority  activities in contemporary nuclear physics.  The work will
              be  carried out largely at CEBAF, although some complementary studies  will be
              carried out at the MIT Bates Laboratory and at Brookhaven  National Laboratory.
                Development, construction, and utilization  of major state-of-the-art
              equipment, including Cherenkov  detectors and drift chambers for the CEBAF CLAS
              and SOS  spectrometers, is integral to this activity.  Education of  graduate
              and undergraduate students and postdocs is  a strong  component in every aspect
              of this grant for this Rensselaer  Polytechnic Institute group.  ***
