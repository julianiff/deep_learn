Abstract    :
              9507688  Reno       The unified theory of electroweak interactions has several 
              unresolved problems, the key ones being the understanding of what  is the
              mechanism that breaks the symmetry between the weak and  electromagnetic
              interactions and how are the fermion masses  generated.       This research
              seeks to propose experimental tests for  discovering the symmetry breaking
              mechanisms in high energy  collisions at present and future colliders.  ***
