Abstract    :
              ***  9507665  Voight      This proposal requests funds to host a regional
              workshop on  the hazard management  of Decade Volcano Merapi proposed by  Drs.
              Barry Voight and Kirby Young,  the Pennsylvania State  University and Dr. Wimpy
              Tjetjep, Volcanological Survey of  Indonesia.    The workshop will be held in
              Yogyakarta,  Indonesia, on October 6-9, 1995.  Volcano  Merapi has been 
              identified by the United Nations-sanctioned International  Decade of Natural
              Disaster Reduction (IDNDR) as one of a few  selected volcanoes that pose
              extraordinary hazards to  people.   Ten scientists from the U.S. and five
              scientists  from the developing countries in Southeast Asia will be  attending
              this workshop.  The participants are experts in  this area.    The meeting can
              provide an excellent  opportunity for discussing the issues important to
              volcanoes  monitoring and development of basic ideas on how volcanoes  work.  
              This meeting addresses important issues on  natural  disaster reduction.  The
              result can be useful to research  communities in planning future cooperative
              research  activities on volcanology in Indonesia.  ***
