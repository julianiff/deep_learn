Abstract    :
              9507366  Nelson    This is a theoretical research grant jointly funded by the 
              Divisions of Materials Research, Physics and Molecular and  Cellular Biology. 
              The research focuses on the physics of  bilayer membranes.  Such membranes are
              of great interest  because they model the real biomembranes surrounding cells 
              and their constituent organelles.  They also have a host of  technological
              applications to microencapsulation, drug  delivery, biosensors, and as the
              foundation for novel  materials with desirable optoelectronic, transport and 
              biocompatibility properties.    While the equilibrium conformations of
              artificial, one-  component membranes are well studied and developed, the 
              dynamics of membranes is less well developed.  The following  topics will be
              studied on the current grant: shapes of  monolayer domains; response of
              artificial membranes to  perturbation, and in particular newly emerging laser
              tweezer  technology for creating fast, precise, delicate  disturbances;
              dynamics of more realistic membranes  containing active pumps, budding
              proteins, and other  simplified machines; and, the formation of patterns both 
              within one membrane and in aggregates of active membranes,  in particular in
              aggregates of biological cells.  %%%  This is a theoretical research grant
