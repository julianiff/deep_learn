Abstract    :
                   Klallam is an endangered and little-documented native American  language of
              the Salishan language family. Although there is great  interest among the
              Klallam tribes in preserving the language,  Klallam is today still spoken
              fluently by only a small number of  elders living in the area of three
              reservations on the north shore  of Washington's Olympic Peninsula.       The
              aim of this project is the production of a first full  grammar of the Klallam
              language together with a collection of  transcribed and translated speech in
              various genres: traditional  narratives, personal anecdotes, community history,
              jokes, formal  speeches, songs, and conversation. The grammar will be written
              in  a general typological framework that will make it accessible and  useful
              both to specialists in Salishan languages and to other  linguists of various
              theoretical persuasions.       The PI has for the last three years assisted the
              Klallam  tribes in their efforts to preserve and revitalize their  language. A
              large amount of various kinds of language data has  been collected and
              archived. This project will build on this  preliminary work.
