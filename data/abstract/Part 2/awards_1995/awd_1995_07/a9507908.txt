Abstract    :
              The research focus of this project will be on the testing of  low acoustic loss
              material for the construction of a massive  "Truncated Icosahedron
              Gravitational-wave Antenna" (TIGA).  The most promising TIGA fabrication
              process identified so  far is to explosively bond a number of aluminum plates
              to  build up a large block of aluminum from which to machine the  TIGA.  U.S.
              Industry has the capability to produce such  material.  The main emphasis of
              the research will be to test  the acoustic loss of samples at cryogenic
              temperatures and  attempt to find a fabrication process and post-fabrication 
              processing that will allow the intrinsic low acoustic loss  of aluminum to be
              retained in samples prepared by this  technique.    This characterization of
              this new material will be an  important input for the planning of the next
              generation of  acoustic gravitational-wave receivers throughout the world.
