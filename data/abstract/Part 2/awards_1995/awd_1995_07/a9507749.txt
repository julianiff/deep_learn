Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support, the Peabody Museum of Harvard
              University will curate the approximately half a million photographic images in
              its collections. It will install environmental controls in a room dedicated to
              this purpose. Included is an air filtration system. Custom-fitted powder coated
              steel shelving units with proper storage enclosures will be installed and these
              will provide a cost effective means of long-term preservation of sensitive
              historical photographic materials. A computerized shelf inventory will assist
              researchers.  Although color slides in the Peabody Museum holdings have been
              conserved and placed in proper storage, the remainder of this invaluable
              collection is subject to deterioration given current storage conditions. These
              materials constitute an extremely important body of scientific data and some
              are over 130 years of age. Together these photographs span the range of
              archaeology, cultural and physical anthropology and document sites, people and
              cultures which no longer exist. Photographs constitute an important scientific
              resource and the collections at Peabody Museum are widely used for research
              purposes. This award will assure the survival of these materials and increase
              their accessibility to the scientific community.
