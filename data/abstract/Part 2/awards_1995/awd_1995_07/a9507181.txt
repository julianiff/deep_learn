Abstract    :
              9501332  Cappo   In this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project,
              Learning in Motion is developing a collection of assessment items to support
              mathematics instruction in grades K-2 that is aligned with the NCTM Standards. 
              The collection of items was begun in 1994 and is being evaluated and augmented
              with additional items with the cooperation of Thomas A. Romberg of the
              University of Wisconsin and Jan de Lange of the Freudenthal Institute in the
              Netherlands.  Scoring rubrics are being developed and the items and rubrics are
              being tested in schools.  a Teacher enhancement component is being designed to
              help teachers build their own expertise in the area of assessment.  The
              collection of assessment items is being made available for Macintosh and
              Windows environments and the accompanying software allows teachers to search
              for items using a variety of criteria, including level of difficulty, grade
              level, content strand, role of context, and length of time for completion.  
              This project will create an assessment tool offering dynamic reporting  thus
              giving teachers the direction they need to make important curriculum and
              testing decisions at the classroom level.  Teachers will be able to assess
              their students' understanding of mathematics at higher levels and to build
              better assessment programs overall.
