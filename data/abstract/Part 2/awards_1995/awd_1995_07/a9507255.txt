Abstract    :
              9507255  Tasayco  The goal of the research is to establish the principles
              underlying  the folding of  -sheets.  The approach chosen is to study the 
              structure, stability, dynamics and folding of a family of protein  fragments. 
              It is proposed to dissect E. coli thioredoxin, a well-  characterized small
              monomeric protein with a mixed   -structure,  into fragments.  They will be
              generated using tools of  biochemistry, chemistry and molecular biology.  These
              fragments  will be characterized using a combination of biochemical and 
              biophysical tools with increasing level of structural detail.   Circular
              dichroism in the far and near UV, fluorescence,  multidimensional nuclear
              magnetic resonance spectroscopy and  computer modeling will also be used. The
              educational aspect of this  proposal aims to complement the lectures of the
              standard  one-semester Physical Chemistry course for Biochemistry majors  using
              the Inverse Prediction Approach, which consists of building  a physical
              3D-model of a macromolecular and using it to predict its  biophysical
              properties.   %%%  The ability to correlate structural changes with ahanges in
              the  biological function holds the key to the understanding of the 
              structure-function relationship of biological macromolecules.   However,
              protein structures are not established at the same pace at  which new amino
              acid sequence are generated.  Thus solving the  "protein folding problem," that
              is, predicting the three  dimensional structure of a protein based solely on
              its primary  sequence, has become an area of intense research.  Much progress 
              has been made in the understanding of the principles behind the  formation of
              one kind of structure commonly found in proteins, the   -helix. However, little
              is known about the formation of  -sheets,  another equally important structural
              component.  This research will  compare the structure, stability and folding of
              the fragments of  thioredoxin and their association products with those of the 
              original protein to elucidate the folding of  the still little  understood 
              -sheets.  ***
