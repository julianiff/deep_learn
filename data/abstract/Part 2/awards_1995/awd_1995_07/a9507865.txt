Abstract    :
                   This research is undertaken in order to complete a reference  grammar of
              Itzaj Maya, a Yucatecan Mayan language on the verge of  extinction in Peten,
              Guatemala. No modern reference grammars  exist for any of the extant Yucatecan
              languages. The Itzaj Maya  were the last major indigenous group in Mesoamerica
              to be  conquered by the Spanish and were conservators of Mayan culture, 
              including hieroglyphic writing, long after most Mayan groups were  overwhelmed
              by the Spanish invaders. It is critically important  for Mayan linguistics and
              epigraphy to document Itzaj as soon as  possible.       The grammar will
              complete basic documentation of the Itzaj  Maya language. Based on prior
              grammatical research and drawing on  extensive textual and lexical databases, a
              comprehensive, heavily  exemplified grammar will be prepared for use by
              linguists,  anthropologists, epigraphers, those involved in language  pedagogy,
              and others interested in a general reference work. The  grammar will be
              completed in twelve months, including two months  of fieldwork with an
              experienced language consultant.
