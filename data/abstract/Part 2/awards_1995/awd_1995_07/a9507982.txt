Abstract    :
              Frictional fusion occurs during high strain-rate events and is recorded by
              pseudotachylyte.  Thus potentially, this material may provide information on
              several parameters of the brittle faulting process that are currently difficult
              to obtain, such as frictional temperature attained, the presence of a fluid
              during faulting and degree of elemental and isotopic reequilibration attained
              `efore quench.  This research will utilize electron microbeam techniques and
              laser heating isotopic methods to examine these factors in natural and
              synthetic pseudotachylyte.  Results have the potential of yielding significant
              insight into the factors attending frictional fusion, and therefore could
              provide a tool for understanding the behavior of brittle faults in the high
              strain-rate or seismogenic regime.
