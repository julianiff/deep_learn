Abstract    :
              9507151  Hardin         This work will seek to investigate a specific
              interaction  between mesenchymal and epithelial cells, the attachment of 
              secondary mesenchyme cells (SMCs) to animal pole ectoderm.  This  interaction
              occurs during the process of gastrulation in the sea  urchin embryo.  The sea
              urchin offers the advantage of ease of  manipulation and observation of single
              cells.  This laboratory will  use both embryological manipulations and
              molecular biological  techniques, taking advantage of available sea urchin
              homologues of  mesoderm-specific transcription factors to examine the
              interaction  of these cells with their target epithelium.  The following 
              questions will be investigated: i). what is the time course of  molecular
              differentiation of a known target for mesenchymal  attachment, the animal
              pole?, ii). is msx-2 gene expression  regulated by cell-cell interactions in
              the animal pole target  region?, iii). how does incorrect expression of msx-2
              transcripts  affect epithelial-mesenchymal interactions?, and iv). how is 
              expression of the snail gene regulated during mesenchymal  interaction?  This
              work is likely to provide important information  regarding the nature of
              epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during  development.  ***
