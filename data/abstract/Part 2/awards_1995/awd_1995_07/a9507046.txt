              Weiner The CCA-adding enzyme synthesizes and regenerates the 3  terminal CCA of
              tRNA.  It is not yet known, from either a biochemical or an evolutionary
              perspective, whether the CCA-adding enzyme is a specialized polymerase or a
              sequence specific terminal transferase.  The project will test the hypothesis
              that the enzyme may resemble a polymerase in structure, with amino acid
              residues functioning as an internal template for ribonucleotide addition. These
              experiments plan an integrated approach to the structure, function, and
              evolution of this unusual enzyme. Specifically,  PCR will be used to obtain
              additional sequences for phylogenetically diverse CCA adding enzymes, and these
              sequences will be compared to identify conserved regions and residues, as well
              as phylogenetically variable domains of the enzyme; and the effect of mutations
              in conserved regions and residues, as well as the effect of deleting
              phylogenetically variable domains, will be tested both in vitro and in vivo, to
              identify regions critical for function. %%% The CCA adding enzyme is the only
              known polymerase that can synthesiz e a defined nucleotide sequence without
              using a nucleic acid template. It is not yet known--from either a biochemical
              or an evolutionary perspective--whether the CCA adding enzyme is a specialized
              polymerase or a sequence specific terminal transferase. The P.I. proposes an
              integrated approach to the structure, function, and evolution of the CCA adding
              enzyme. He will obtain sequences for phylogenetically diverse CCA adding
              enzymes and compare the protein sequences of these diverse CCA adding enzymes
              to identify conserved regions as well as phylogenetically variable domains. The
               P.I. hypothesizes that the CCA adding enzyme may be structurally or
              functionally related to the family of template dependent polymerases, and this
              proposal will also test that hypothesis. If so, previous studies of the enzyme
              can now be revisited in light of the newly emerging view of polymerase
              structure and function. ***                                 @
