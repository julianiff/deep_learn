Abstract    :
                                    NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY                                   
              Phillips, John  IBN-9507826             Dr. Phillips' research will investigate
              the use of the    earth's magnetic field to determine geographic position.
              Previous    studies of migratory/homing orientation have provided evidence   
              for the involvement of a specialized magnetoreception mechanism    in the "map"
              component of homing, and for effects of small    changes in magnetic
              inclination or intensity on migratory/homing    orientation.  Studies of
              map-based homing (i.e., true navigation)    will be carried out under
              controlled laboratory conditions where    the response to manipulation of
              individual parameters of the    magnetic field can be investigated.  Two forms
              of orientation    that involve the earth's magnetic field will be studied,
              i.e.,    magnetic compass orientation (requiring only compass information)   
              and long-distance homing or true navigation (requiring both map    and compass
              information).  This will make it possible to    distinguish effects of
              experimental manipulations on the map or    geographic-position sense from
              effects on the compass.  In    addition, a graphical model of bicoordinate
              navigation developed    for this work will be used to estimate the local
              gradients of    magnetic field parameters in the vicinity of the animal's home 
                from their behavioral responses to experimental manipulation of    these
              parameters.  These estimates can then be compared with    future measured
              values of geographic variation in the magnetic    field.  Dr. Phillips'
              research will provide information about the    sensitivity of biological
              systems to weak magnetic fields which    will contribute to the current debate
              concerning possible effects    of artificial sources of EMF (power lines,
              electrical appliances,    etc.) on human health.
