Abstract    :
                  Refinetti  9507452    Physiological variables such as body temperature are
              normally buffered against changes by homeostatic regulatory responses. 
              However, there is a normal daily fluctuation in body temperature that is driven
              by a circadian biological clock.  It is presently unclear how the clock
              mechanism interacts with the systems that normally keep body temperature
              constant in order to produce the daily temperature fluctuations.  With this
              CAREER award, Dr. Refinetti will lead a research team of undergraduates to
              investigate the interactions between the brain's circadian clock and the
              thermoregulatory system.  He will also devote time to the development of  an
              integrated teaching program in biological psychology.    ***
