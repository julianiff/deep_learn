Abstract    :
              9507385  Berg  Light-avoiding leaf movement (paraheliotropism) is an important
              stress response that allows some plants to reduce water loss, lower leaf
              temperature and decreases photodamage to leaves under hot, dry, bright
              condition.  The capacity to reduce light interception is one of the properties
              that confers drought resistance on some legumes.  While the factors known to
              stimulate paraheliotropism are well described (high temperature, drought, high
              light intensity), almost nothing is known about the cellular mechanisms
              underlying the movement of leaves.  The movement involves the swelling and
              shrinking of cells of the motor organ at the base of leaves, requiring a
              consideration of ion channels, osmotic properties, cell size change, and
              physical forces.  The proposed project has three principal objectives: 1) to
              compare how the stimuli known to cause paraheliotropism act differently upon
              excised tissue, isolated cells and protoplaqts from the motor organ; 2) to
              determine the fate of the cytoskeleton when motor cells change size; and 3) to
              determine which ion channels are are involved in cell size change associated
              with paraheliotropism.  This project will advance scientific knowledge by
              establishing the functional relationships between the two major groups of
              reversibly expandable plant cells, one well studied, the other barely examined
              at this time.  It will determine the mechanisms that underlie paraheliotropism,
              a stress response important for the survival and projectivity of native species
              and agronomically important plants.
