              Jakob, Elizabeth  IBN-9507417                              Abstract             
                                     In order to understand how social behavior evolves, it 
              is necessary to have a clear understanding of the relative  costs and benefits
              of group and solitary living for each  individual.  Dr. Jakob will conduct a
              quantitative study of  a species that is at an early stage in social evolution
              and  that exhibits both group and solitary living. This will  permit her to
              examine factors that influence decision-making  with regard to patterns of
              social interaction.  Based on the  results of these studies, Dr. Jakob will
              develop a dynamic  model that will predict optimal social behavior. 
              Mathematical models are valuable because they generate  rigorous, testable
              predictions with explicitly stated  assumptions.  A dynamic model is an
              excellent tool for  modeling individual choices in this system because dynamic 
              models incorporate variables which describe a condition,  such as energy level
              or current location, that can change  over time and that influences the optimal
              decision.  Importantly,  the predictions of  this model can then be  tested in
              the field.  Dr. Jakob has also integrated the  participation of students in her
              research plan.
