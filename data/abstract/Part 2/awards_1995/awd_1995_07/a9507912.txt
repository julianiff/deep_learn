Abstract    :
              Matthew Jackson  Northwestern University  SBR-9507912     The objective of this
              proposal is to model trading relationships.  The proposal consistst of three
              related projects.  The first project is a study of "recurring games"-- repeated
              play of the same game by different players who can learn by observing previous
              play.  The focus will be on the way information affects the learning process. 
              The second project is a study of the endogenous formation of trading networks
              in the absence of organized markets. The P.I. aims to identify the conditions
              under which efficient relationships form.  The third project is concerned with
              the design of organized markets and the ways in which the equilibrium
              allocation depends on the rules governing trade.  The goal of the research is
              to identify all the allocations that can obtained and the market designs that
              achieve them.
