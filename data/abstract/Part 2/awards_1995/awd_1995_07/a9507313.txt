Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to evolve generic initial  data for
              cosmological models to determine its asymptotic  behavior.  So far, this method
              has been successfully applied  to the plane symmetric (vacuum) Gowdy cosmology
              on the 3-  torus where strong support for its conjectured velocity  dominated
              singularity has been obtained and interesting  nonlinear interactions between
              the two polarizations of  gravitational waves in the model have been observed. 
                Cosmological observations indicate that, on the largest  distance scales, the
              dynamics of the Universe today can be  described by Einstein's theory of
              general relativity.  It  has long been known that, followed backward in time, 
              Einstein's equations imply that a singular state of infinite  density and
              temperature (the Big Bang) occurred a finite  time ago.  However, the nature of
              this predicted generic  singularity is not known.  The primary focus of this 
              research is a long term numerical study to determine the  nature of the generic
              cosmological singularity.
