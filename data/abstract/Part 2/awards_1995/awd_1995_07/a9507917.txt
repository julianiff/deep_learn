Abstract    :
              9507917  Basu    This project focuses on a continuing puzzle in macroeconomics: 
              why is aggregate productivity procyclical?  Initially interpreted as unobserved
              changes in utilization, this stylized fact has been reinterpreted as an
              indication of large changes in production technology and, more recently, as
              evidence of large increasing returns to scale in production.  This project
              explores an explanation based on composition effects: the idea that inputs may
              consistently move, in cyclcial fashion, from less- to more-productive uses. 
              For example, industries with higher returns to scale (e.g. durables) also
              account for a larger fraction of input growth in booms.  A numerical example
              shows that composition effects can lead to a large overestimate of the degree
              of returns to scale and a severe overstatement of the importance of technology
              shocks.  A preliminary application of these ideas to U.S. manufacturing data
              shows they are quantitatively significant: correcting for compostiion bias
              reduces the correlation between output and technology shocks by one-half, and
              the estimate of increasing returns by two-thirds.  These preliminary results
              indicate that neither large technology shocks nor large firm-level returns to
              scale are plausible building blocks of business cycle theory.  The project
              conducts more empirical work to document the full magnitude of compostiion
              effects; analyzes the link between aggregate productivity and welfare; studies
              how composition effects may arise naturally in a purely neoclassical model with
              multiple sectors and quasi-fixed inputs, since quasi-fixity naturally creates
              divergences between marginal products of inputs across sectors; and models
              composition effects within the context of endogenous-fluctuation models.  The
              education plan has four components: course development for intermediate
              macroeconomics that emphasizes giving students practice in evaluating policy
              debates; written handouts for graduate macroeconomics that better prepare
              students for future research; prog ram development to smooth the transition
              from graduate coursework to disertation research; and the development of a plan
              to increase minority student retention in the graduate program.    ??
