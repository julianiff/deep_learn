              Snowdon, Charles  IBN-9507565                                Abstract           
                                    The International Ethological Conference is the only 
              international gathering in the field of ethology which  brings together
              scientists studying all aspects of animal  behavior, including mechanisms,
              development, evolution and  function (behavioral ecology).The purpose of this
              grant is  to provide partial travel support for 15 young United States 
              Scientists to attend the 24th IEC to be held in Honolulu,  Hawaii, 10-17
              August, 1995.  This conference, hosted by G.  Losey and E. Reese and the
              University of Hawaii will attract  scientists from over 40 nations covering a
              multitude of  disciplines including ethology, comparative psychology,  ecology,
              evolution, neurobiology, sociology, anthropology,  psychobiology, animal
              science, conservation, primatology,  and human ethology.  Previous awards have
              benefited numerous  outstanding younger ethologists.
