Abstract    :
              9507466    The recent discovery of genes controlling the development of the
              animal body plan (homeobox genes) provides an opportunity to address one of the
              most fundamental questions in biology.  That is, what mechanisms have led to
              the appearance of new characters or body plans that characterize major
              radiations in  biological diversity?  We understand how species adapt to
              environmental changes by modifying a given body plan, but we do not yet
              understand how a particular body plan came into existence in the first place. 
              For example, frogs differ from related amphibians in having two ankle bones
              that are greatly elongated, improving jumping ability.  This research will test
              the hypothesis that changes in expression of homeobox genes led to this
              morphological innovation.  It will study the expression of genes in the frog
              limb that, in other vertebrates, control the differentiation into lower leg
              (long bones) and ankle (usually short bones).  The results will show whether
              the gene responsible for lower leg elongation is active during elongation of
              the ankle bones of frogs, but not in other vertebrates. If so, it will show
              that a vertebrate character can undergo a major evolutionary change via
              alteration in the expression of a few developmental control genes. The results
              could increase understanding of genetic mechanisms, of evolutionary history and
              account for the rapid appearance of certain morphological innovations in the
              fossil record.
