Abstract    :
              This award will support planning for an environmental  database which will
              integrate a suite of computer  application software to facilitate access to an
              analytic  laboratory database through a networked geographic  information
              system interface. Initial work will focus on  data collected by the McMurdo
              Long-Term Ecological Research  project, a large environmental research project
              located in  the antarctic. Planning activities will include a 
              goals/requirements definition workshop. Additional  development and workshop
              activities are contemplated to  transfer the results of the project to other
              Long-Term  Ecological Research sites and the community of environmental 
              researchers in general.
