Abstract    :
                  9507173  Delidow    Regulation of pituitary prolactin (PRL) gene expression
              involves  the actions of a number of neurotransmitters, hormones, growth 
              factors and other soluble signaling molecules. In addition it has  been shown
              that changes in extracellular matrix components can  regulate PRL gene
              expression, and that agents which regulate PRL  can also induce changes in cell
              adhesiveness. Preliminary data has  shown that PRL gene expression in the rat
              pituitary tumor 235-1  cells is induces under culture conditions in which large
              cell  aggregates form, and that high PRL mRNA levels are dependent upon  the
              presence of these aggregates. To persue these observations, the  proposed
              research will attempt to: 1. Determine by cell culture  studies whether
              induction of PRL gene expression requires contact  with aggregates, or whether
              a soluble factor(s) is produced by  aggregates and acts independently of cell
              contact. If the signal  appears to be a soluble factor, aggregate-conditioned
              media will be  assayed for the ability to induce PRL mRNA. 2. Determine by 
              agonist/inhibitor studies whether the signal is transduced via  cellular kinase
              pathways.  Actin and tubulin staining will be used  to examine changes in
              cytoskeletal organization. The presence of  beta1-integrins, cadherins and
              neural cell adhesion molecules will  also be determined. 3. Determine whether
              the increase in PRL mRNA  occurs at the transcriptional level. These studies
              will provide a  base of information for future studies on contact regulation of
              PRL  gene expression.  ***
