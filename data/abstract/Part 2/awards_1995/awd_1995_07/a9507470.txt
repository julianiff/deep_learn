Abstract    :
              Cole, Blaine  IBN-9507470                              Abstract    A critical
              assumption of empirical and theoretical studies  of reproductive allocation in
              social insects is that size  variation does not affect reproductive success. 
              However, if  males vary in their probability of mating or if females vary  in
              their probability of founding a colony as a function of  body size, then the
              optimal investment cannot be predicted  without knowledge of how size affects
              reproductive success.  The objective of the proposed research is to test the
              above  stated assumption by determining the relationship between  the size of
              an individual and its reproductive success.  In  addition, the variation in the
              size and number of males and  females within and among colonies will be
              quantified to  evaluate whether colonies have maximized their reproductive 
              success.  Finally, the relationship between the availability  of food and the
              pattern of investment will be examined in  order to assess the degree of
              lability among colonies.  This  project should help to fill a gap in our
              knowledge  concerning patterns of reproductive investment in social  insects.
