Abstract    :
              9507062  Schriber       A Particle Accelerator Conference, the latest in a 
              series that occur biennially, this year combined with the  International
              Conference on High Energy Accelerators, is  supported in part this grant.  this
              provides a forum for  presentation of the newest developments in accelerator 
              technology, and for exchanges of ideas to stimulate further  advances and
              generate new ideas.  The published proceedings,  available in print as well as
              on CD-ROM, are valuable  references for researchers in acceleration methods and
               technology.  ***
