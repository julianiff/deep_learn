Abstract    :
              9507639  Meystre       The effects of the long range atomic interactions on 
              optically driven atoms is studied theoretically using a mean  field
              approximation.  This results in an effective, non-linear  equation which is
              solved numerically using modern computational  techniques.  this regime, which
              is termed nonlinear atom optics,  suggests that it should be possible to
              observe atomic solitons,  atomic wave mixing and atomic phase conjugation in
              ultra-cold  atom collisions.  Even more intriguing is the possibility of 
              observing a coherent atomic beam generator which would be the  rough equivalent
              in atom optics of a laser.  ***
