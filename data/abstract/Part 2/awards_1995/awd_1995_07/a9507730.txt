Abstract    :
                 This project involves the dissertation research of a student from the
              University of California-Davis.   The project is to study marriage strategies
              of traditional people in Nepal.  The student will examine monogamous, fraternal
              polyandrous, and polygynandrous marriages, examining the decision rules used to
              guide people into each type of marriage.  The methods will include household
              survey censuses, retrospective fertility and marital histories, and in-depth
              interviews.  The student will test hypotheses that individuals will select
              marriage forms that enhance their individual economic positions with
              consequences for their behavioral ecological fitness.     This research is
              important because it adds to our understanding of alternative forms of
              marriage, which are increasingly rare in the world.  In addition  the project
              trains a social scientist in research methods and enhances our knowledge of
              this exotic but important region of the world.
