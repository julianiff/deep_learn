Abstract    :
                This international workshop will be held at the University of Cape Town in
              South Africa from April 24-29, 1995.  Researchers from the Carnegie Institute
              of Washington and the Massachussetts Institute of Technology will meet with
              their South African colleagues from the University of Cape Town, the University
              of Witwatersrand and the University of Natal in Pietermaritzburg to disseminate
              and share research data and ideas on the history of the development and
              assembly of the continental crust and associated upper mantle that make up the
              Kaapvaapl Craton of Southern Africa.  South Africa is the ideal location to
              study how continents originate and evolve over time, and the worshop will
              expose US scientists to the unique research sites in South Africa. The workshop
              will lead to the submission of collaborative grant proposals among US and South
              African geologists, geochemists and geophysicists who are interested in the
              origin and evolution of the ancient lithosphere of Southern Africa.
