Abstract    :
              9507994  HEDLIN     This research is to analyze global network recordings of
              short-  period precursors to the inner-core seismic phase PKP(DF) in order  to
              test the feasibility of directly imaging small scatterers at or  near the
              core-mantle boundary (CMB).  The expectation is that  migration techniques
              developed for crustal scattering problems can  be used to back-project
              precursor energy from the free-surface to  the CMB.  A goal is to identify
              areas in which we have sufficient  resolution to image small-scale CMB
              scatterers and to discriminate  between core entry and exit point structure. 
              Following synthetic  experiments, a comprehensive analysis will be done of
              PKP(DF)  precursors in all available short-period and broadband data from  the
              global seismic networks.  This research is a component of the  Cooperative
              Studies of the Earth's Deep Interior program.  ***
