Abstract    :
              9507681  Koch  Adaptive plasticity of form is one of the most remarkable
              features of multicelled plants.  At least one contributor to this flexibility
              appears to be the sensitivity of specific plant genes to sugar levels (ie.
              photosynthate availability).  Among these are the genes for sucrose
              metabolizing enzymes.  Import of translocated sucrose by growing organs can be
              strongly affected by the capacity for sucrose metabolism, which is catalyzed by
              only two known pathways in plant (invertase and the reversible sucrose synthase
              reaction).  Under previous NSF grant, Dr. Koch has demonstrated that genes
              encoding both these enzymes in maize are carbohydrate-responsive, providing a
              potential mechanism for coarse adjustment of capacity for sucrose use relative
              to its overall availability.  In addition, the newly cloned isozyme genes for
              invertase exhibit a differential carbohydrate responsiveness with surprising
              similarity to that observed among isozyme genes of sucrose synthase.  In this
              project, Dr. Koch will address the significance of these developments using a
              combined molecular, genetic and physiological approach.  Probes for an
              invertase gene family (putatively soluble) provide an opportunity to address
              the relationship between sugar-responsive gene expression and the widespread
              role of soluble invertases in initial growth by newly expanding sink tissues.
