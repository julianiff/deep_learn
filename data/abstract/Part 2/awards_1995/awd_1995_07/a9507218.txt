Abstract    :
              9507218  Meeks-Wagner   The long term goal of this research is to understand the
              molecular mechanisms that regulate the initiation of flowering in response to
              changes in daylength. As a first step toward reaching this goal, the
              photoperiod-sensitive genetic pathway(s) controlling inflorescence initiation
              and development in Arabidopsis thaliana will be investigated.  A mutation, 
              Early Flowering 3 , (ELF3) has been isolated and results suggest that it may
              function as a key component of circadian rhythm regulation, as well as a
              regulator of inflorescence and floral meristem identity . We will:  1. Define
              the role of ELF3  gene in the circadian regulation of gene expression and
              developmental processes.  2. Isolate a molecular clone of ELF 3 and complete
              the basic characterization of the gene.  3. Define the genetic pathways related
              to ELF3 gene function that regulate floral initiation and floral meristem
              identity in Arabidopsis.  %%%  The research to be done is directed toward
              testing the hypothesis that the ELF 3 gene product plays a critical role in
              regulating photoperiodism by "linking" the biological clock (s) to the genetic
              pathways that control floral initiation and flower meristem development. The
              gene will be cloned and characterized and the function of its product studied.
              Completion of these aims should provide valuable information on the genetic
              regulation of circadian responses and the photoperiodic induction of flowering.
              The results will enhance our basic knowledge as well l as provide information
              which could have possible economic ramifications.  ***
