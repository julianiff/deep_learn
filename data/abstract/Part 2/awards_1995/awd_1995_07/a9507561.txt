Abstract    :
              9507561  Thompson    The largely unanticipated end of the Cold War, and the
              consequent  difficulties in explaining its demise, underline the need to 
              better understand the phenomenon of rivalries in world politics.   But there is
              much more at stake than the history of the Soviet-  American relationship for a
              respectable proportion of  international conflict is embedded within the
              contexts of  specific dyadic feuds with pasts and futures.  To ignore these 
              contexts may seriously distort the entire analytical undertaking  of
              international relations.      This investigation identifies rivalries in terms
              of decision-  maker perceptions of a hierarchy of competitive, principal 
              opponents as opposed to the number of disputes in which states  engage.  Basic
              rivalry data, including information on  participants, length, perceptions of
              the security threat posed by  the competitor and the issues at stake, are
              gathered on all major  powers from 1494 to 1993 and all minor powers from 1816
              to 1993.   Other types of information that might be desirable in the study  of
              rivalries already exists in other data sets and are not being  duplicated.  The
              project creates a rivalry set that can be  integrated into other existing
              research programs.  ***
