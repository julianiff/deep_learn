Abstract    :
              James Cox and Bart Wilson SBR-9507526   For the last twenty years, so-called new
              Keynesian  macroeconomists have been trying to construct their macroeconomic
              theories from solid microeconomic  foundations.  They have proposed models in
              which prices and wages are sticky and monetary policy has  real effects in the
              short run.  This work has rested on the assumptions of imperfect competition,
              menu  costs, and real rigidities.  Menu costs are the cost of changing prices. 
              A real rigidity is a failure  of the firm s costs of fully adjust to an
              aggregate demand shock. Real rigidities are a consequence of  efficiency wages.
               Efficiency wages are wages above the competitive equilibrium level that firms
              pay  in order to reduce shirking by its workers.  This proposal consists of two
              experiments designed to  test the assumptions of new Keynesian macroeconomic
              models.  The first experiment will test Mankiw s  menu cost model using an
              experimental design in which monopoly sellers face fluctuations in nominal 
              demand and cost.  The second experiment will test an efficiency wage model
              using an experimental  design in which p roducers face menu costs and workers
              can shirk.  The results of these experiments  will shed light on the dynamics
              of price and wage adjustment to demand shocks and suggest the  directions in
              which the current theories need to be developed.
