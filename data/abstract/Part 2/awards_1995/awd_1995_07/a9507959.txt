Abstract    :
              9507959  Echt  This proposal for the study of "Energetics and Dynamics of 
              Metallofullerenes", deals with the stability of metal atoms  encaged in the
              newly discovered carbon structures called  fullerenes.  The approach will
              involve collisions between a  pulsed beam of charged metal atoms of defined,
              tunable kinetic  energy with a thermal beam of fullerenes at low vibrational 
              energy.  Experiments will be performed on C60, C70, and possibly  some higher
              fullerenes.  Among the metal that will be used are Y,  Sc, La, Several rare
              earth elements, Na, K, Mg and Ca.  Knowing  the energetics of metallofullerenes
              will help in identifying  species that are potentially useful for applications
              and in  designing strategies to produce and isolate them in macroscopic 
              quantities.  ***
