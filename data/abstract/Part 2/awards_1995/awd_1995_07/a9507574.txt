Abstract    :
              9507574  Jensen       Theoretical investigations into experimentally accessible 
              problems in quantum chaos continues.  The research includes  studies of scarred
              wavefunctions, stabilization of atoms in super-  intense fields, excitation and
              ionization of atoms by single-  cycle pulses and ballistic electron transport
              in semiconductor  microstructures.  ***
