Abstract    :
              9507407  Suarez      It is important, if one is to understand the nature of
              physiological and biochemical processes, the manner in which they are
              regulated, how they might go wrong under pathological conditions, to have a
              fundamental understanding of the rules that govern functional design.  At the
              level of the whole animal, the understanding of why humans and various species
              of animals might have so much lung, or heart, or intestine, and how the
              functional capacities of these organs relate to maximum physiological
              requirements is increasing.  This approach to the analysis of design has not
              been adopted in studies of the design of metabolic pathways.  By examining
              maximum rates of metabolism in muscles and by comparing these maximum rates
              with the capacities of the biochemical systems that make them possible, Dr.
              Suarez hopes to gain valuable insights into how metabolism actually works and
              is regulated in exercising muscles as well as into the rules of nature
              regarding the relationships between biochemical design and physiological
              performance.  ***
