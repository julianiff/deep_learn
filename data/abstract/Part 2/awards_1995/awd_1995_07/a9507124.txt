              Lidstrom This is an award for partial support for the Eighth International
              Symposium on Metabolism of C1 Compounds to be held August 17-September 1 at the
              Bahia Resort Hotel, San Diego, California.  This prestigious meeting is held
              once every three years and brings together the international community of
              scientists and engineers working on a variety of aspects of C1 metabolism by
              microorganisms, including both methylotrophic and autotrophic cells.  The small
              size and traditional informality of this conference provide a unique
              opportunity for researchers from different disciplines to interact, share
              information, and develop long-lasting ties.  It is traditional for all speakers
              and poster presenters to provide their latest, unpublished data and, as a
              result, this conference always serves as the focal point for future research in
              this diverse field.  A wide range of research topics will be presented
              including discussions on catalytic mechanisms of oxidases, oxygenases and
              quinoproteins, genetic regulation of complex genetic regulons, and new
              approaches for understanding and manipulating microb ial metabolism for both
              environmental and commercial applications. %%% This NSF award is funded by the
