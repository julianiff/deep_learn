Abstract    :
              Molecular beam epitaxy has led to quantum wells which  confine electrons and
              holes in one direction and  microcavities which confine photons in one
              direction.  In  this proposal, 2D and 3D confinement of electrons is studied 
              by using a magnetic field of up to 14 Tesla to quantize the  quantum-well
              energy levels in one or both of the directions  perpendicular to the direction
              of growth of the  semiconductor cavity.  By applying no field, a field 
              parallel to the layers, and a field perpendicular to the  lasers it is proposed
              to compare carrier relaxation and  microcavity lasing for quantum wells,
              quantum wires and  quantum dots, respectively, using the same quantum well and 
              microcavity.  Although fundamentally conceived and oriented,  this research is
              strategic for manufacturing of low-  threshold microlasers for use in the
              information  superhighway, optical data storage, large panel displays,  etc.
