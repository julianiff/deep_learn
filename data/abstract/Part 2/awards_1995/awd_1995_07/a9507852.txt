Abstract    :
              9507852  Mader       This grant will support the study of nuclear systems  under
              the extreme conditions created in heavy-ion  collisions.  The goal is to better
              understand the nuclear  force through model simulations of heavy-ion
              collisions.  Model simulation allows the effects from the individual 
              nucleon-nucleon collisions, the strong nuclear force and the  finite size of
              the nucleus to be probed individually.  Through comparison of model predictions
              with experimental  measurements, assumptions of the model can be tested and 
              improved leading to a better understanding of the nuclear  force.  This grant
              will support summer research by a faculty  member and several undergraduate
              students at Hope College.  ***
