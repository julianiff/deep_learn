Abstract    :
                This award provides support for the 1995 ACEDB Conference  and Workshop. ACEDB
              is a database which focuses on  the  biology of the intensively studied
              nematode worm  Caenorhabditis elegans. The workshop will facilitate 
              communication between database developers and users leading  to continued rapid
              evolution of software and techniques for  managing the increasingly large
              volume of information on  this widely used model species. The 1995 workshop
              will be  the fourth in a series of workshops on ACEDB dating back to  1992.
