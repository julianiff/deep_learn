Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to study infant care behavior in the spectral tarsier,
              Tarsier spectrum.  Spectral  tarsiers are small, nocturnal, insectivorous
              primates found only on the island of Sulawesi,  Indonesia.  Spectral tarsiers
              exhibit a very unusual parental care strategy whereby the mother  transports
              her infant in her mouth ant then `parks` it on branches throughout the forest. 
              It has  been suggested that the exceptionally large size of the infant relative
              to the mother prevents her  from transporting it on her chest or back as
              observed in most other primates.  The goal of the  study is to ascertain how
              long the infant is left alone, if other group members babysit parked  infants,
              the distance between the parked infants, mothers and other group members.  In
              addition,  other aspects of infant development, including a very lengthy
              gestation period, will be monitored.   Continuous observations of mothers will
              be accomplished through the assistance of radio  telemetry equipment.
