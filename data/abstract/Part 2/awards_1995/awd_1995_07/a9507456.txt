Abstract    :
              9507456  Kormanik      Sharks provide models, not only for studying the
              metabolic handling of waste nitrogen, but also the means by which nitrogen is
              provided for developing embryos.  Uterine tissue will examined for potential
              carrier enzymes associated with the transfer of ammonia.  Acid secretion
              associated with detoxification of this ammonia will be examined.  Ammonia
              nitrogen incorporation into the embryo will also be measured.  Undergraduates
              will be engaged and trained in all steps of the investigation.  Information
              gained will be useful to those studying evolution of nitrogen metabolism,
              modelling nitrogen waste processing in fish and other animals as well as of
              practical use to those involved in the study of ammonia toxicity in mariculture
              of fish and other aquatic organisms.  ***
