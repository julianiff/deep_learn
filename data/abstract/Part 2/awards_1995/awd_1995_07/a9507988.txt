Abstract    :
              9507988  Lutwak     The proposed research lies in the area of geometric
              convexity; more specifically, it focuses on the Brunn-Minkowski theory,
              otherwise known as the theory of mixed volumes. Various problems concerning
              convex bodies in space are proposed: the Minkowski problem, affine
              isoperimetric inequalities, and possible duals to the Brunn-Minkowski theory
              (replacing projections by intersections) are considered.    The theory of mixed
              volumes has already found a wide variety of applications. In probability and
              statistics, it is used to supplement the Monte Carlo method. In geometric
              tomography, the theory is applied to various imaging (X-rays, and MRI scanners
              in particular) problems . One of the basic problems in the theory is the
              reconstruction of a convex body from a minimal set of its cross sections or
              projections.
