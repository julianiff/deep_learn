Abstract    :
                  Frostig  9507936    It has become clear just recently that the adult brain
              can reorganize its connections.  One of the situations during which connections
              seem to change is when new behaviors are learned.  With this award, Dr. Frostig
              will study how the brain's representation of different sound frequencies is
              altered as an animal is trained to discriminate certain frequencies.  This will
              be done using new techniques to repeatedly image the activity levels of brain
              tissue in a non-invasive way.  This work will provide new information on the
              time course of plastic changes in the brain, and will allow Dr. Frostig's group
              to study the relationship of specific behavioral capacities to specific changes
              in brain organization.     ***
