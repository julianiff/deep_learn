Abstract    :
                      9507539  Newton  The Tenth International Congress on Nitrogen Fixation
              will  be held in St. Petersburg, Russia from May 28 to June 3,  1995.  Nitrogen
              fixation is one of the most important  subject areas relating to the support of
              life on Earth and  encompasses concerns related to natural resource 
              conservation, particularly fossil fuels, plant-microbe  signalling and
              interaction, regulatory mechanisms,  nutrition, food production, etc.  This
              Congress is the  single most important meeting for the scientific field. 
              Participants from over 30 different countries are expected  to attend.  The
              topics to be discussed will include  virtually all aspects of biological and
              non-biological  nitrogen fixation, including the following major symposia:    I
                 Chemistry and Biochemistry of Nitrogenase  II   Genetics and Regulation of
              Nitrogen Fixation  III  Signalling Processes in Plant-Microbe Interactions  IV 
              Structure and Evolution of the Nodule Bacterial Genome  V   Plant Response in
              Symbiosis  VI  Carbon, Nitrogen, and Oxygen Metabolism  VII Agricultural and
              Ecological Aspect of Nitrogen Fixation    Of the 77 scientists who have been
              invited to participate in  the Congress, 20 are from the United States.  The
              award will  support travel for approximately 10 graduate students who  are the
              recipient of the Russian grants to cover in-Russia  expenses.  It will also be
              used to support the travel of  younger U.S. scientists, women and minorities
              who attend the  Congress.
