              Fuller The major objective of the research project is to continue our
              innovative program on the study of the synthesis, material properties,
              containment and degradation of microbial thermoplastics.  This program has
              involved the closely coordinated activities of three Principal Investigators,
              PIs, including a polymer chemist, a biochemist and a microbiologist.  In the
              studies on the containment and degradation of poly-(-hydroxyalkanoates (PHAs),
              the inclusion bodies or PHA granules in Pseudomonas oleovorans, the bacterium
              of choice, have been clearly shown to contain at least five proteins, tow of
              which are polymerases, one a depolymerase, and two that have a unique
              paracrystalline array lattice-like structure.  We will particularly concentrate
              on the structure and function of these latter two structural polypeptides.  In
              the polymer chemistry studies on biosynthesis and materials properties studies,
              an extensive array of new microbial polyesters has been produced and examined,
              including flexible homopolymers, elastomeric and adhesive copolymers,
              functionalized polymers and chemically modifi ed bacterial polyesters with
              specific materials properties.  All of these have been made available from
              several, biologically diverse microorganisms.  In addition, emphasis will be
              pursued investigating the mechanisms, control processes and the enzymology of
              both intra- and extra-cellular PHA depolymerase enzyme systems. This research
              program is being supported jointly by the Division of Molecular and Cellular
              Biosciences (Directorate fmr Biosciences) and the Division for Materials
              Research (Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences. %%% The major
