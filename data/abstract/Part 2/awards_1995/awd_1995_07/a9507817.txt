Abstract    :
              9507817  Russett    Nineteenth century liberals advocated policies to expand
              liberty  and increase prosperity.  Politically, they sought to shift  control
              of the government from aristocrats to commoners,  especially the commercial
              class.  In the realm of economics, they  repudiated the protectionist policies
              of mercantilism. They  believed that free trade and democratization,l
              beneficial in  their own right, would also reduce the incidence of war.  Their 
              views continue to inform theoretical and policy debates.    The relationship
              between democracy and international conflict has  received careful attention in
              recent scholarship on international  relations; a wide range of formal and
              empirical studies have  established that democracies rarely fight each other,
              even at  relatively low levels of violence.  The relationship between  economic
              interdependence and international conflict, however, has  received less
              systematic attention.  During the past year the  investigators have conducted
              new analyses on the period 1950-1986  that incorporate a measure of economic
              interdependence derived  from bilateral trade flows.  Following closely earlier
              analyses  of the effect of democracy on conflict, the researchers found  that
              economic interdependence also has important effects in  reducing conflict.   
              In this project the investigators extend this line of research by  estimating a
              model to clarity the reciprocal influence between  trade and international
              conflict.  They also evaluate the  pacifying influence of democracy and
              economic interdependence  while controlling for the expected utility of the use
              of force.   In the process the researchers explore whether democratic 
              countries are more likely to trade with each other than with non-  democracies,
              check the implications of new measures for joint  democracy and economic
              interdependence., apply new sensitivity  checks on the findings, and extend the
              dataset into the 1990s to  assess the impact of the recent dramatic spread of
              democracy in  the post-cold  war world.  ***
