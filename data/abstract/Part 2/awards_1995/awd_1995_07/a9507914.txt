Abstract    :
               This is a study of how work establishments form ties with other organizations
              in order to recruit and train workers.  Using a national sample of work
              establishments, stratified by size,  in a two-wave panel, questions will be
              asked about how those firms rely on outside organizations for labor contracting
              and job training.  Hypotheses tested deal with the effects of stable
              organizational environments, tight labor markets, the role of labor unions, and
              the institutionalization of common practices in labor contracting and job
              training.  By relying on a network perspective to determine how links with
              recruiting and contracting organizations shape individual firm decisions, this
              research makes a theoretical contribution that sets it apart from two
              prevailing views.  In one,  there is the assumption that labor costs are
              entirely external to the firm, and thus dependent on market relations.  In the
              other, there is the contrary assumption that labor costs are entirely internal
              and therefore subject only to hierarchical relations.  Instead, these
              researchers look at interorganizational networks as the basis of change within
              firms.   %%%   This research addresses fundamental questions about how changes
              in the formation of human capital may be taking place when employers establish
              ties with outside organizations for the recruitment and training of workers.  
              It will demonstrate how the characteristics of network relations between
              employers and their sources of labor recruitment and training affect the the
              employing firms and the opportunities available to their workers.  Research
              findings will have major implications for understanding how cost and quality
              are affected by these recruitment and training practices.
