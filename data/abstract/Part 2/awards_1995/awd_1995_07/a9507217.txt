              Drosophila is an important research organism for the study of molecular
              genetics of neuronal development and the neuronal basis of behavior. Among
              complex nervous systems, that of the insect ranks as one of the most accessible
              experimentally. Defined and quantifiable behaviors can be related to subsets of
              uniquely identified receptor, central, and efferent neurons, whose combined
              actions can be considered in the context of animal behavior. Biomedical
              interest in this relationship derives from the recognition that many regions of
              the insect nervous system have architectures similar to brain areas of higher
              vertebrates, and that sensory neuropils in both share common computational
              properties. Comprehensive understanding of how cooperative activity between
              layers of identifiable neurons leads to complex behavioral repertoires requires
              that neural data derived by many different researchers be made available
              through a database.                          ;
