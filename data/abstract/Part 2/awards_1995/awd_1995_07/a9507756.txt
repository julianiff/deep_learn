Abstract    :
              9507756  Condon   In an effort to increase the number of women entering graduate
              school in CISE disciplines, the Computing Research Association (CRA) has been
              awarded a continuation of the Distributed Mentor Project (Award CDA-9302536)
              where 20-25 female students are matched with a number of female professors in
              CISE research areas each of the years 1996-1998, to participate in a summer of
              research at the mentor's institution.  The students will most likely be
              computer science or computer engineering majors although this is not required. 
                In addition, the pi's have been funded to conduct a longitudinal evaluation
              of the two projects over the years 1994-1998.  The evaluation will measure how
              well the projects have met the goal on increasing the number of women in CISE
              disciplines entering graduate school.  The most useful aspect of the
              mentoring/research will also be assessed on an annual basis in order to provide
              feedback for improving the remaining years of the project.    The CRA is an
              association of U.S. and Canadian academic departments of Computer Science and
              Computer Engineering, and Industrial Laboratories engaging in basic computing
              research.  The mission of CRA is to represent and inform the computing research
              community and to support and promote its interests.  Dr. Weingarten is the
              Executive Director of CRA. Dr. Anne Condon, the academic leader of this
              project, is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of
              Wisconsin.  ***
