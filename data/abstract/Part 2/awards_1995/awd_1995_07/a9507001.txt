Abstract    :
              MCB 9507001  Bin-Tao Pan     Ras, a small GTP binding protein, plays a pivotal
              role in cellular proliferation, differentiation, development, and
              transformation.  Elucidation of how Ras controls the cell cycle is important in
              understanding how Ras regulates these cellular processes.  In this project the
              Xenopus egg system is used to study how permanently active Ras (oncogenic Ras)
              controls the cell cycle.  Oncogenic Ras induces chromatin changes, inhibits
              cdc2 kinase, and blocks or delays the progression of the cell cycle into
              M-phase.  This project will test the hypothesis that oncogenic Ras persistently
              activates a 96 kD histone kinase which then feeds back to inhibit cdc2 kinase
              and results in arrest of the cell cycle.  To address this hypothesis the gene
              coding for the 96 kD histone kinase will be cloned and full length transcripts
              from cDNA will be used to test whether chromatin changes, inhibition of cdc2
              and arrest of the cell cycle can be induced.  In addition, the cDNA will be
              used for structural and functional analysis of the 96 kD kinase.  %%%  This
              project investigates how the process of cell division is regulated from outside
              the cell by mechanisms associated with the outer membrane of the cell.  The
              mechanism of transducing information that regulates cell division through the
              cells outer membrane is poorly understood.  GTP binding proteins (the Ras
              protein employed in this project) represent one intracellular component thought
              to have a role.  Consequently, examination of the function of the Ras protein
              in cells is likely in increase our understanding of how cell division is
              regulated.  ***
