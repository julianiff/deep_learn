Abstract    :
              Two topics will be investigated in this research project.  First, to gain a
              physical insight of Einstein's general  relativity (in strong gravitational
              fields) Professor  Esteban will study the bending of light, periastron shift, 
              and time delays near millisecond pulsars and rotating black  holes.  To this
              purpose an alternative procedure to the  standard methods found in the
              literature will be developed.  Neither spacetime curvature nor relativistic
              rotational  effects will be neglected.  Secondly, he will investigate  the
              physical implications of Weyl gravity's linear term in  the gravitational
              potentials of self-gravitating ellipsoids  and disks.  This is important
              because in astrophysics,  ellipsoids often have been considered as models of
              galactic  bars.  To confront Weyl gravity with observations and  experiments he
              will study light bending and time delays by  using an exact exterior solution
              for a static, spherically  symmetric gravitating source in locally conformal
              invariant  Weyl gravity.  This solution is the analog of the exterior 
              Schwarzschild vacuum solution of Einstein's general  relativity.    One
              important aim of this project is to involve physics and  mathematics students
              in undergraduate research experiences.  This project will provide talented
              students with the  opportunity for planning, carrying out, and reporting 
              scientific research.  By using advanced computational tools,  they will develop
              computing skills needed for their future  advancement in science or
              engineering.
