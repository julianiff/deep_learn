Abstract    :
              9507872  Spearow      Recent studies have discovered major genetic differences
              in the control of reproduction, especially in ovarian responsiveness to
              hormones.  Dr. Spearow has found that the hormone-induced ovulation rate (HIOR)
              of one strain of mice is six times higher than in a second genetic strain of
              mice.  Furthermore, the enzyme aromatase, responsible for generating the
              hormone, is 16 to 21 times higher in the second strain of mice.  This enzyme
              converts androgens into estrogens.  He has found that genetic differences in
              these reproductive traits segregate in crosses as though they are controlled by
              the action of a small number of loci with major effects.  The proposed studies
              will utilize mouse genetic models to confirm and characterize the physiological
              mechanisms by which genes on mouse chromosome 2 control major differences in
              ovarian response to gonadotropins.  These studies will also characterize and
              clone the genes which control major genetic differences in ovarian function. 
              Identifying genetic markers for divergent hormone responsive genotypes, and
              determining the physiological mechanisms through which these genes control
              differences in ovarian function could aid in improving and controlling
              reproduction in a wide range of mammalian species.  ***
