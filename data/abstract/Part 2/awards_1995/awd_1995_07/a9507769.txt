Abstract    :
              9507769  Perk       This is a continuing research project for the study of  many
              of the unsolved problems in the chiral Potts models or  generalized chiral
              clock models.  New solvable cases will be  pursued and connections between
              various fields of  mathematics, physics, and other sciences will be explored.
