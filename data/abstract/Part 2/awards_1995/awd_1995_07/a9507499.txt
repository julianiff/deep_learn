Abstract    :
              9507499    Rapid  exchange of heat across the gills prevents most  fish  from 
              being warmer than the water in which they  swim.   The  scombroid fish
              (mackerels, tunas, marlins and swordfish) are  a  group  of  about  100 species
              in which  endothermy,   the  ability   to  keep  some  tissues  (muscles, 
              brain,   eyes,  digestive  systems) warmer than the surrounding  sea  water, 
              has  evolved several times.  This research will examine  the  mechanisms  and
              adaptive significance of such endothermy  in  these  fish  at  levels ranging
              from molecular  analyses  to  oceanographic studies at sea.  The biochemistry 
              of  changes  in  skeletal  muscle that increase its ability  to  generate  heat
               will be determined.  Laboratory and field measurements  of  free-swimming
              warm-bodied tunas and closely related fish  that  are  not  endothermic will
              test hypotheses  about  the  advantages  of endothermy.  The physiological and
              ecological  significance of having warm body muscles or a "brain heater"  will 
              be  studied  by  examining the movements  and  thermal  ecology of
              free-swimming endothermic fish.  These data  will  show   how   endothermy 
              influences   muscular  performance,  locomotor capabilities and ecological
              diversity in scombroid  fish.  It will contribute to understanding of the
              advantages  of  increasing the temperature at which tissues  and  organs 
              operate.     The   multidisciplinary   approach   integrates  information  
              from  molecular,  cellular,   ecological   and  evolutionary studies. It will
              lead to a better understanding  of  the advantages of endothermy, its
              ecological importance,  and its impact on the ecological diversity of marine
              fish.
