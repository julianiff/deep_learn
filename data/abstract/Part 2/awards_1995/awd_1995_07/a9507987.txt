Abstract    :
              9507987  Fu         This project involves the application of state-of-the-art 
              climate observations, especially satellite data, and simple  numerical models
              to clarify the processes that control the amount  and distribution of water
              vapor in the upper troposphere in the  middle latitudes.  Understanding these
              processes is critical to  understanding the earth's radiation budget and the
              potential for  global warming.  The objectives of the project are to: (1)
              identify  the main sources of and mechanisms controlling upper tropospheric 
              water vapor in the middle latitudes, especially the relative  importance of
              large-scale horizontal advection and vertical  transport by local convection
              and (2) examine whether these  processes are adequately represented in general
              circulation models.   The research will contribute directly to the goals of
              NSF's Water  and Energy - Atmospheric, Vegetative, and Earth Interactions 
              (WEAVE) effort.         The educational component of this CAREER award consists
              of a  variety of activities involving both graduate and undergraduate  students
              and an effort to encourage underrepresented groups,  particularly women, to
              pursue careers in the physical sciences.***
