Abstract    :
                   A new type of polarized target based on frozen hydrogen-  deuterium
              molecules will be developed.  The techniques will be  adapted from the
              technology developed for producing pellets used  in laser-driven fusion
              studies.  With nuclear spins aligned,  these targets will be used to explore
              the spin-dependent  structure of the nucleon.  Specifically, a theoretical sum
              rule  (the Drell-Hearn-Gerasimov sum rule) will be tested which  relates, on
              one side, the difference in the integrated total  photo-absorption
              cross-section between measurements with photon  spin aligned and opposed to the
              nuclear spin direction, to, on  the other side, the anomalous magnetic moment
              of the nucleon.  This is a very high priority experiment within nuclear physics
               which relates to our fundamental understanding of the structure  of the
              nucleon.  The new technology will permit an order of  magnitude increase in
              precision of such measurements.  Education  is also integral to this activity. 
              The state-of-the-art  technology developed will involve many skills including
              low  temperature techniques.  Graduate students and postdoctoral  fellows will
              be involved in all phases of the work.  The training  will be useful in many
              other settings.
