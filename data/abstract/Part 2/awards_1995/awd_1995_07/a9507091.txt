Abstract    :
              Rykowski  9507091  The overall objective of this work is to determine the
              complete 3-dimensional interphase chromosome structure of specific genes of
              Drosophila melanogaster at several critical times in development in diploid
              embryonic chromosomes. The parameters of the ultra-high resolution in situ
              hybridization (URISH) and computational optical microscopy and image analysis
              will be characterized followed by a characterization of cell by cell variation
              in transcription using the Notch gene. The effect of global structure on gene
              activity will also be determined. There will be on-going software development
              which should be of use in other studies as well as this work.  %%%  An integral
              part of gene regulation is the structure of the gene itself. Proteins
              associated with the chromosome on a constitutive basis act to modulate the
              action of transcription factors and replication machinery. Alterations in
              chromatin structure early in embryonic development can lead to the wholesale
              silencing of the genes. Clearly, the structure of interphase chromosomes is an
              active player in gene regulation. Using high resolution in situ hybridization
              and computational optical microscopy, the structures of the gene changes during
              development and as a result of cell cycle progression will be determined.  ***
