Abstract    :
              The research described spans two classes of problems which  involve different
              methods, but which are unified by the  common roots in general relativity,
              Einstein's theory of  gravitation.    One set of problems is centered on
              astrophysical facets of  general relativity, especially black holes and
              gravitational  waves, and much of it is motivated by the problem of 
              determining the gravitational wave signal produced by black  hole interactions.
               The approach will involve numerical and  symbolic computation, but will not
              directly involve solving  the full set of Einstein equations on supercomputers.
               Rather, analytic and approximation methods will be used to  find and
              understand gravitational wave outputs.    Another set of problems aims at
              understanding the canonical  quantization of Einstein's theory.  Black holes
              are again at  the center of attention, now at the submicroscopic scale. 
              Semiclassically, they evaporate by Hawking radiation.  To go  beyond the
              semiclassical description, midisuperspace  quantization will be applied to a
              number of spherically  symmetric models.  It is expected that the
              reconstruction of  privileged spacetime coordinates from the canonical data 
              will simplify the quantum theory both at the conceptual and  technical levels. 
              A study of these models should clarify  such questions as what happens to the
              horizon and curvature  singularities in quantum theory.
