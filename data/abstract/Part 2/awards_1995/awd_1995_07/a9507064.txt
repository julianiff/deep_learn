Abstract    :
              The 1995 Aspen Winter Elementary Particle Physics Conference  will, for the
              first time, devote a fourth week, January 22-  28, 1995, to a conference on
              Gravitational Waves and their  Detection.  The Conference provides for
              approximately 65  participants, six days of close interaction where problems 
              and recent results can be discussed in detail.    The Aspen Winter Conference
              on Gravitational Waves and Their  Detection has several aims.  One of these is
              to involve  physicists from other fields.  To this end, physicists from  the
              frequency stabilization, quantum optics and elementary  particle physics
              communities will participate.  In order to  familiarize the newcomers with the
              status and aims of the  field, the program will begin with overviews of 
              gravitational wave physics, of astrophysical sources, and of  detectors such as
              interferometers, resonant bars and space  based detectors.  Another aim is to
              bring together  gravitational physicists who have varying perspectives on  how
              to best accomplish the task of detecting gravitational  waves.  The program,
              will thus include detailed discussions  of acoustic detectors-both bar and
              spherical, as well as a  historical perspective.
