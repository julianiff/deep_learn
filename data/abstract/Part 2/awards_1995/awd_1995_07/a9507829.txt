Abstract    :
              9507829  Alvarez       Quantum field theory is the primary tool for studying 
              elementary particle theory.  It has several unresolved problems,  a key one
              being the relationship between fermions and bosons  (supersymmetry).  It is
              believed that there are other symmetries  which have not yet been discovered
              and that new mathematical  techniques will need to be found to analyze them.   
                 This research seeks to address these problems in part  directly and in part
              through knowledge acquired in the study of  statistical mechanics systems and
              of string theory.  ***
