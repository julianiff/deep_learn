Abstract    :
              9507649  Bagger       In recent years there has been a significant cross 
              fertilization between the areas of particle physics and  cosmology, leading to
              major advances in both fields.  At the same  time string theory has been
              proposed as a unifying theory.  String theory also describes a quantum theory
              of gravity, leading  to a synthesis in our understanding of all forces.      
              PASCOS is a conference on Particles, Strings and Cosmology.  The proposed
              conference is the fifth in the series of annually  held PASCOS meetings and is
              likely to be as successful as the  other four have been.  It is being hosted
              this year by Johns  Hopkins University.  ***
