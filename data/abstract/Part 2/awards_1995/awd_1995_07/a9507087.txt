Abstract    :
              MCB 0507087  LeAnn Lindsay and Jerry Hedrick    Specific objectives for the
              project are to:  (1) complete the cloning and expression of ovochymase cDNA to
              determine its primary structure for structure-function correlation with other
              members of the serine active site protease family; this information will define
              its proenzyme form, active site, substrate specificity and potential mechanisms
              for regulation of its enzymatic activity; (2) define the cleavage site(s) of
              ovochymase's vitelline envelope substrate (gp69,64) by determining the
              glycoprotein's amino acid sequence by peptide sequencing and recombinant DNA
              methods, and search for homologies with other extracellular matrix
              glycoproteins, particularly the mammalian zona pellucida glycoproteins; (3)
              confirm the perivitelline space location of ovochymase and ascertain its
              extracellular location before and after fertilization using antibody prepared
              against the expressed protein and immunocytochemical methods;  (4) establish if
              expressed and purified ovochymase will hydrolyze its substrate gp69,64 in situ
              in the egg envelope and effect a block to polyspermy.  The results of this
              study will provide an increased understanding of the regulation of cell-cell
              interactions through proteolytic processing of the extracellular matrix.  %%% 
              This project will study the influence of cell surface molecules on  sperm and
              egg interactions during fertilization using frog cells.  The DNAs for an enzyme
              which hydrolyzes proteins, a protease called ovochymase, and its extracellular
              protein substrate, will be cloned.  The extracellular location of ovochymase
              before and after fertilization will be determined.  This information will
              provide a means to understand how cell-cell interactions are regulated by
              modification of cell surface molecules.  ***
