Abstract    :
              9507990  PARK                             This research is to study azimuthal
              anisotropy in upper-mantle  seismic velocity, which can be related to the
              preferred orientation  of olivine and orthopyroxene crystals in deformed
              peridotite.  This  offers an opportunity to investigate both active and fossil 
              deformation of the lithosphere and asthenosphere.  This project  will develop
              the software tools, apply them to data, test whether  anisotropy models derived
              from shear-wave splitting can be  reconciled with observations of long-period
              Love-Rayleigh  scattering, and extend the results to coupled free oscillations
              to  test the robustness of shear-wave splitting and other scattering  analysis.
               This research is a component of the Cooperative Studies  of the Earth's Deep
              Interior program.   ***
