Abstract    :
              9507166  Ecker  The experiments described in this proposal are designed to
              identify new components and characterize existing components of the ethylene
              signal transduction pathway that link perception of the gas with changes in
              cell morphology and gene activation.  The proposed studies will integrate
              genetic, molecular and biochemical approaches to unravel the actions of
              ethylene in sensitivity (EIN) genes in response pathway.  More specifically, we
              aim to:  1) Continue genetic dissection of the ethylene response pathway using
              mutation and epistasis analysis; 2) Examine interactions among the ethylene
              response proteins using biochemical and yeast genetic approaches, 3) Identify
              new genes whose products functionally interact with EIN2 and EIN3; 4)
              Characterize the biochemical properties of the EIN3 gene product.  %%%  The
              application describes experiments designed to elucidate the molecular
              mechanisms of ethylene action in plants.  Plants utilize gaseous ethylene as an
              important stress signal to regulate both development and metabolic processes. 
              The long-term goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms by which
              this simple hydrocarbon is perceived and its signal transmitted to nucleus to
              affect general information about signal transduction mechanisms  in plants.
