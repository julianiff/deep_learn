Abstract    :
                 Over the last two decades, Elwyn Simons' excavations at the Fayum Depression
              in Egypt have provided the major discoveries and documentation of early monkey
              evolution.  It is a remarkable site, and Dr. Simons has been extremely diligent
              and industrious.  The period for which this site has almost come to be
              synonymous with is the Oligocene, roughly 30 million years ago, near the time
              when the first monkeys began to appear.  Recently, Simons and his colleagues
              have found a new locality at the Fayum which dates from an earlier period, the
              Eocene, extending back the time depth of fossil monkeys to the time of their
              origination.  They have just begun to investigate this deposit, known as
              Locality 41. Already, the finds have demonstrated the following:   1.  a
              surprisingly high number of different monkeys (anthropoids) and a       
              `bushiness` of early monkey evolution - lots of experimentation.     2.  broad
              adaptive diversity of early monkeys.   3.  the structurally primitive qualityof
              these animals.  This new award for three years will undoubtedly lead to a whole
              host of new fossil primate and other vertebrate finds.  All the Eocene primates
              collected thusfar at L-41 represent new taa and many are more complete than
              those found elsewhere.  This is a very exciting excavation with extremely good
              prospects for new discoveries.
