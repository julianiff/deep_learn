Abstract    :
              NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY    IBN: 9507356    Hailman, J.      This proposal is a
              request for support for a symposium on  "Conservation and Behavior in the Wild"
              to be held at the  annual meeting of the Animal Behavior Society to be held 
              July 8 - 13 at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln.  The  purpose of the
              symposium is to address the role of  Behavioral Science in biological
              conservation.  As  biological conservation is a topic of utmost importance 
              today, it is essential that all pertinent knowledge be  brought to bear on the
              issue.  Clearly an increase in  sophistication concerning animal behavior would
              be of great  benefit to the conservation efforts.  The objective of this 
              symposium is to foster functional links between biologists  working directly
              with conservation and with those more basic  scientists who study animal
              behavior.
