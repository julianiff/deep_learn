Abstract    :
              9507794  Schedl    This U.S.-Hungary research project, between Dr. Paul Schedl
              of  Princeton University and Drs. Janos Gausz and Henrik Gyurokovics  of the
              Hungarian Biological Research Center, will address a  Drosophila protein, GAGA,
              that appears to play a critical role in  generating accessible, nucleosome free
              regions of chromatin.   Binding of this protein to chromatin in vivo is thought
              to  facilitate transcription of particular genes.  Together, the  researchers
              intend to characterize the phenotypic effects of  mutations in this Drosophila
              gene, called the GAGA factor.  They  will use a combination of molecular,
              genetic and developmental  approaches.  Results are expected to yield new basic
              information  on the genetic hierarchy of regulation in this incompletely 
              understood type of DNA-binding protein.    This project in genetic biology
              fulfills the program objective of  advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
              leading experts in the  United States and Eastern Europe to combine
              complementary talents  and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual
              interest  and competence.  ***
