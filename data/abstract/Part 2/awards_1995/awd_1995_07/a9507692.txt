Abstract    :
              9507692  Dixit    Redistribution of income affects both individuals and
              businesses.   Redistribution may be between rich and poor and individuals or 
              businesses and subsidized businesses.  Political parties and  politicians
              determine redistributive policy.  Redistributive  policies do not necessarily
              lead to desirable economic outcomes.     The proposed research agenda will
              determine if some  redistributive policies have more desirable effects in the
              long  run than in the short run.  It will examine the impact of  redistributive
              polices on occupational and geographic choices and  the effect of political
              parties having distinctly different  preferences for progressive
              redistribution.  Finally, it will  look at the relocation choices made by
              individuals and businesses  as determined by the redistributive decisions made
              by different  localities and different levels of government (federal, state, 
              and local).  The emphasis will be on theoretical foundations for  this
              analysis, but some instances case studies will be done.
