Abstract    :
              9507693  Miller  This grant supports a 36-month research collaboration and 
              faculty exchange program between the University of Rochester  (UR) and the
              Institute for Molecular Science (IMS) in  Okazaki, Japan.  This exchange
              program will enable extended  research leaves for researchers at IMS and the UR
              in order  to conduct research that cannot be done at their own  institutions. 
              Through NSF funding, two UR postdoctoral or  graduate students will spend up to
              six months in IMS  laboratories per year; in addition, their research advisors 
              will make short-term visits to Japan at the beginning and  end of each research
              exchange.  Through funding from Japan,  IMS research scientists will work in
              laboratories at the UR.    Research to be conducted under this exchange
              examines  fundamental factors that control the rates and efficiencies  of
              electron transfer, charge separation, and charge  transport in various media
              and systems.  It further examines  how these factors can be manipulated to
              obtain new chemistry  and useful reaction products that may have application to
               materials and devices for photoscience-based technology.  The research will
              take advantage of highly advanced  equipment available at one or the other of
              the sites.  The  quality of the work done by the American students and  faculty
              will be significantly enhanced by access to  additional resources both in
              instrumentation and expertise.  ***
