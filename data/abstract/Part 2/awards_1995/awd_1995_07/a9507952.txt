Abstract    :
              IBN-9507952  Nillni, Eduardo A.    Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is a
              peptide of great  biological interest because of its diverse functions within
              the  central nervous system ranging from a critical role in regulating 
              endocrine function to modulating behavior.  TRH is synthesized as  a large
              precursor molecule containing multiple copies of the  peptide.  A lingering
              question has been how this precursor molecule  is processed to yield mature TRH
              within the central nervous system.   Previously, Dr. Eduardo Nillni and his
              laboratory have made  significant contributions to our understanding of
              precursor  processing.  In the present work, he will continue to examine the 
              role of subcellular organelles in processing of the TRH precursor  and the role
              of several compartment specific enzymes in the  processing.  In addition, these
              studies have the potential to  significant new information about differential
              processing of the  two ends of the precursor molecule and the mechanisms
              regulating  this differential processing.  The studies proposed by Dr. Nillni 
              form the basis for understanding the mechanisms the brain and other  organs use
              for generating the messenger molecules the cells of the  body use to
              communicate with one another.  Aberrations in these  normal cellular processes
              may have serious consequences for human  health and disease.
