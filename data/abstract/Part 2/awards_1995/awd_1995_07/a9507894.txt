Abstract    :
              Jeroen Swinkels  Northwestern University  SBR-9507894     The P.I. proposes to
              explore the equilibrium behavior of auctions when the number of participants is
              large.  The motivation for this research program is the restrictiveness of the
              assumptions required to ensure that auction outcomes are efficient: a single
              unit for sale for a single period, symmetry of bidder preferences and beliefs,
              and risk neutrality of bidders. The P.I. conjectures that efficiency is
              recovered if the number of players becomes large enough and has already
              obtained such a result for the single-unit, independent value case with
              asymmetric risk-nuetral bidders.  The proposal is to extend this to auctions
              with multiple units, multiple periods, multidimensional signals, and risk
              averse bidders.
