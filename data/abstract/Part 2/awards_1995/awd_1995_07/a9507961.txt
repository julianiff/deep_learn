Abstract    :
              IBN-9507961  Lutz, Peter L.      The brain of most vertebrates, including
              humans, has such an  obligatory high energy demand that even a short term
              interruption  in brain oxygen supply can result in irreversible neuronal
              damage.   However, in some unique species the brain can survive and recover 
              from the absence of oxygen for many hours.  Interestingly, the  mechanisms
              allowing this survival are recapitulated in the initial  phases of the
              mammalian brain responses to the absence of oxygen.   Clearly, chemicals in the
              brain functioning as messenger molecules  are of paramount importance in
              regulating brain activity.  Dr. Lutz  proposes to investigate the role of these
              messengers in tolerating  oxygen deprivation.  One messenger seems to play a
              paramount role  in the response to oxygen deprivation, and that messenger is 
              adenosine.  Therefore, Dr. Lutz will determine the role of  adenosine in
              conserving brain energy stores during oxygen  deprivation and also in
              protecting the brain from the ravages of  cell loss during periods of low
              oxygen levels.  By learning the  mechanisms by which the system survives oxygen
              deprivation,  valuable insights will be provided into the processes underlying 
              the harmful changes that occur during oxygen deprivation in  mammalian species
              and humans.
