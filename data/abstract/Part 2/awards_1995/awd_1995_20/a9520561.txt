Abstract    :
              9520561  Dorsinville  The PI plans to fabricate organic light emitting diodes
              (LEDs) and  study their characteristics.  He proposes to take advantage of the 
              high luminescent quantum efficiency and extremely narrow emission  bands of
              organo-metallic complexes of lanthanide ions (Ln3+) to  fabricate and
              characterize efficient and bright electroluminescent  devices.     The PI also
              plans to investigate polymer emitters with a well  defined microstructure to
              study the role of structural changes on  the efficiency of photoluminescence
              and electroluminescence.  He  will carry out FTIR, EPR, Raman, steady state and
              time resolved  photoluminescence and photoconductivity measurements to gain a
              good  understanding of the nature of the different physical processes in 
              emitter materials.  Specific issues to be addressed in the  framework of this
              project is the synthesis of new polymer emitters  and the improvement of long
              term stability of organic  electroluminescent devices.  ***
