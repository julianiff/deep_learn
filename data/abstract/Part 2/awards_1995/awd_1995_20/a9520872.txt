Abstract    :
              9520873  Riding In  The last several decades have witnessed a dramatic increase
              in the use of international and human rights law to resolve conflicts. 
              Increasingly, indigenous peoples are turning to international law in efforts to
              achieve greater self-determination.  This project will involve a preliminary
              evaluation of the capacity of international and human rights law to address
              these efforts.  It will be based on a case study of one American Indian
              nation's involvement in the international legal arena as part of a worldwide
              movement.  The case study will draw upon fieldwork in the local, national, and
              international contexts in which this group works.    %%%%  The last several
