Abstract    :
              9520600  Singer    Metapopulations are collections of populations that interact
              through dispersal.  Their persistence in the face of population extinctions
              relies on colonization; the establishment of new populations in unused habitat.
               However, mechanistic studies of colonization in natural systems are lacking,
              even though mechanism at this scale may strongly structure large-scale
              metapopulation dynamics.  The goal of this research is to investigate the
              behavioral and ecological mechanisms that structure colonization in a
              metapopulation of the checkerspot butterfly.  The metapopulation, located in
              the Sierra Nevada of California, recently suffered a set of weather-induced
              population extinctions, and provides unoccupied habitat patches for study. 
              Behavioral mechanisms to be studied include habitat preference and host-plant
              search efficiency within habitats.  The ecological mechanisms are temporal and
              spatial patterns in habitat quality and host-parasitoid relations between the
              checkerspot butterfly and a braconid wasp.  Preliminary results indicate that
              colonization is occurring slowly, that habitat quality is highly structured
              temporally, and that habitat preference is not optimal, but depends instead on
              history of host use at the study site.    This study will contribute
              significantly to basic understanding of the role of dispersal in maintaining
              metapopulation structure, and some of the mechanisms governing colonization of
              new habitat patches.  The results will have broad application to resource
              management strategies and attempts to conserve biodiversity.
