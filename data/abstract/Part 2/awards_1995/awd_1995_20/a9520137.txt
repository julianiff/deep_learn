Abstract    :
                Although a number of important new fossil finds relating to the emergence of
              humans have been discovered in the past twenty years, there remains a great
              deal of controversy surrounding their interpretation - for example,  how the
              animals such as the `Lucy` finds got around - did they walk like us, or
              shuffle, or arm-swing, or do something different.  This dissertation project
              will analyze the evidence from hand bones to the debate about the locomotion of
              A. afarensis, the `Lucy` species.  Unlike the hands of all other primates, our
              hands have little or not role in locomotion.  This research will examine the
              metacarpals and finger bones (phalanges) of a number of extant and fossil
              monkeys in order to determine the structural correlates of locomotor
              differences.  Data will be obtained from x-rays, molding, and measuring
              original specimens and casts.  Correlations will be made betwen metacarpal
              cross-secional geometric properties, mid-shpft shape of metacarpals and
              phalanges, and their curvatures, and a comparison will be performed, taking
              into account the different body sizes.  A pilot study has already confirmed the
              usefullness of these measurements, showing that there are structural features
              of the long bones of the hand which do correlate with different locomotor
              repertoires.    These features will in turn help to elucidate the locomotor
              behaviors of A. afarensis, and should be useful in determining such behaviors
              in other extinct hominoids.     This award will also enhance the training of an
              energetic and excellent professional prospect.
