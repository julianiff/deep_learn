Abstract    :
              9520840  Mittelbach  Ecologists have long understood the importance of resource
              use in defining species interactions and the population and community level
              consequences of these interactions. In stage-structured species, different
              stages may utilize resources which themselves interact, thereby influencing
              dynamics between the stages. This dissertation research will examine such a
              situation by studying the dynamics of larval and adult bluegill in relation to
              their resources, small and large zooplankton. These two resources are often
              negatively correlated in lakes, possibly due to competition, predation, or the
              presence of a refuge from predation. The zooplankton size-structure of a lake
              may affect the growth and survival of each bluegill stage because growth of
              adult bluegill is positively related to the abundance of large zooplankton,
              while larval bluegill are gape-limited foragers. Comparative and experimental
              studies will be conducted to test predictions of stage-specific growth and
              survival of bluegill as mediated by resource interactions. This research seeks
              to improve upon our mechanistic understanding of the processes that regulate
              stage-structured populations, thereby helping to clarify the contribution that
              these species make to community structure and function.
