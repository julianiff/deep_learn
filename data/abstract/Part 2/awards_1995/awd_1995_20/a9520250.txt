Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the synthesis of enantiomerically pure   molecules
              using free radical reactions as the key synthetic step.  This   is based on the
              observation that small, seemingly reactive ring systems   can be converted into
              radicals and be induced to undergo cyclization   faster than rearrangement.
              This forms a new strategy for the construction   of carbon-carbon bonds, and
              ultimately, more complex materials.  Kinetics   of these rapid radical
              rearrangements will also be studied.    Oxiranylcarbinyl and aziridinyl
              radicals will be the focus of these   studies. With this renewal award, the
              Synthetic Organic Program is   supporting the research of Dr. Fred E. Ziegler
              of the Department of   Chemistry at Yale University.  Professor Ziegler will
              focus his research   on carbon-carbon- bond formation, a fundamental process in
              the synthesis   of organic molecules, using free radical reactions to provide  
              enantiomerically pure materials.  These studies will provide new avenues   of
              synthesis that may be applicable to the preparation of important   antibiotics
              through pathways inaccessible by anionic and cationic methods
