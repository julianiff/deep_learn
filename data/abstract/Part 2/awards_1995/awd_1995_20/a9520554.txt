Abstract    :
              9520554  Cohen  This grant supports a long-range, broad based research  program
              in condensed matter physics and materials science.  The research projects cover
              the fields of semiconductors,  metals, surfaces, defects, superconductivity,
              materials  under pressure, clusters, fullerene-based materials,  nanotubes, and
              many-body effects in solids.  The major  objective is to use quantum theory to
              explain and predict  the properties of materials.  Emphasis is placed on using 
              realistic models, close collaborations with  experimentalists, investigations
              and suggestions for  producing novel and useful materials, development of new 
              theoretical approaches, and predictions related to  electronic and structural
              properties of solids.  %%%  This grant supports a long-range, broad based
