Abstract    :
              SBR-9520710      Doctoral Dissertation Research:  "The Cultural Politics of
              Anatomy and the Problem of Death, Dissection, and Embodiment"      This study
              integrates the formal history of physiology, anatomy, and medical education
              into the broader field of social and cultural history by illuminating the place
              of class, gender, and race in medical decision-making as well as in legislation
              concerning ethics in medicine.  More particularly, it shows how physicians used
              anatomy to develop a vital identity and authority over both the living and the
              dead -- and how women, the poor, unorthodox healers, and radicals contested
              that authority and appropriated anatomy for their own purposes.    Dissection
              was a potent method of producing knowledge but also a powerful metaphor. 
              Anatomists crossed the boundary between life and death, cut into the body,
              reduced it to parts, and framed it with moral commentary.  The dissected body
              was used to demonstrate that social categories were natural and conferred an
              epistemologically privileged status upon the profession.  But dissection
              depended upon confiscation of the dead.  As demand grew, black-markets in
              bodies flourished, and with them legal, social, and philosophical clashes over
              the nature and disposition of the dead.  These issues were debated in pulpits
              and lecture halls, fought out in riots against medical schools, and decided in
              courts and legislatures, profoundly affecting death practices, and the legal
              and moral status of the body.
