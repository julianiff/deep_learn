Abstract    :
              9520743  VIRGINIA  Aridland productivity is closely linked to the organic carbon
              cycle.  Few studies address changes in soil carbon resulting from
              desertification.  Previous studies suggest that desertification results
              primarily from modifications in soil carbon source / sink relationships and
              long-term ecosystem stability.  These impacts may reduce the economic potential
              of aridland regions.  The proposed study tests these hypotheses using organic
              carbon abundance techniques and radiocarbon dating to quantify changes in
              modern carbon cycles.  The study will provide initial quantification of
              long-term accumulation / decomposition process in a changing aridland
              environment, characterize changes in total soil carbon due to desertification,
              and compare modern desertification rates with past community changes and
              climatic history.
