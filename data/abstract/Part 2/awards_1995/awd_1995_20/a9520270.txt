Abstract    :

              telecast will be delivered on Wednesday, February 22, 1995, and is part of the
              National Engineers Week.  The teleconference features women in engineering and
              describes career opportunities for women engineers.    Two parallel satellite
              delivery modes, compressed digital and analog.    In 1994 the telecast was
              viewed by more than 5000 middle school and high school students and their
              teachers.  The majority of the participants were hosted by local industry,
              government, or college facilities at 237 different sites.  The teleconference
              is being planned to encourage young people , and especially women, to pursue
              careers in engineering.  ***
