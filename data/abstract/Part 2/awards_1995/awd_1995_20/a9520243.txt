              Average Reward Reinforcement Learning    Reinforcement learning is the
              improvement of performance of an  agent due to rewards and punishments.  Most
              studies of the  phenomenon so far have assumed that the learning proceeds 
              through maximizing the discounted total reward from the  environment.
              Discounting tends to favor the sacrifice of higher  long-term rewards in favor
              of short-term rewards.  On the other  hand, performance is often better
              enhanced in real situations  by the use of average reward per unit time.   One
              such  application is the scheduling of automatic guided vehicles  (AGVs -
              robots used for material handling tasks in flexible  manufacturing systems),
              where optimization of discounted total  reward will influence the robots to
              serve machines that are  close and neglect those far away, leading to stoppage
              of the  more distant machines, and perhaps to the halting of the entire 
              manufacturing system.  The objective of this project is to use  the AGV
              scheduling problem as a means of studying reinforcement  learning methods that
              optimize average reward to avoid such  pitfalls,  leading to a better
              understanding of the factors  that influence performance under automated
              average reward  reinforcement learning.
