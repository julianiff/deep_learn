Abstract    :
              Tagg  9520111    An interdisciplinary meeting is proposed on the  mathematics
              and physics of fluid flow between rotating cylinders  (the  Couette-Taylor
              problem) and other flows involving instabilities  that  arise in curved
              geometries due to centrifugal forces. The  Couette-Taylor  problem is a
              prototype that has led to several advances in  understanding  the nonlinear
              dynamics and evolution of complexity in fluid  flows.  The subject is unique
              for the degree to which it brings together  mathematicians, experts in
              computational fluid dynamics,  physicists,  and engineers to discuss a wide
              variety of theoretical,  numerical, and  experimental techniques that may be
              first proven with this system  and later extended to more general problems. The
              meeting consists  of  a day of invited talks honoring the 65th year of
              physicist  Russell Donnelly,  followed by three days of contributed talks. A
              one-day  pre-conference  workshop will also be held with the intention of
              attracting  under-represented  groups and researchers from small institutions
              to a broader range  of  research topics in fluid instabilities, pattern
              formation, and  the  origins of turbulence.  %%%  An interdisciplinary meeting
              in proposed on the  mathematics and physics of fluid flow between rotating
              cylinders  and related fluid flow problems. This area of work has been  a
              prototype for several advances in the understanding of  instability and the
              onset of turbulence in fluid dynamics.  These advances include connections
              between chaotic dynamics and  turbulence, the spontaneous formation of patterns
               in physical systems, the nonlinear dynamics of waves, and an  astonishing
              variety of ways that turbulence occurs. More than 100  mathematicians,
              computational experts, physicists, and engineers  are  expected to attend.
              Special features of the meeting include a  pre-conference workshop that is
              intended to enable  under-represented  groups to begin work in this field as
              well as a day of invited  talks  honoring the 65th year of the distingui shed
              physicist Russell  Donnelly.  ***
