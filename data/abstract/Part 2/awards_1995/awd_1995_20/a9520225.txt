Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
              Department of  Chemistry at Trinity University acquire a 300 MHz NMR
              spectrometer which will be used in  research investigations in the following
              areas of chemistry:  (1) highly enantioselective  transformations catalyzed by
              chiral dirhodium(II) carboxamides; (2) anti-aromaticity and  hypervalency in
              hydrocarbon dications; and (3) site directed photochemistry:  cycloadditions 
              to anthracene derivatives perturbed by electronic and strain effects.   
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
              available to  chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.  It
              is used to identify unknown  substances, characterize specific arrangements of
              atoms within molecules, and to study the  dynamics of interactions between
              molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR  spectrometry is
              essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.  The results from
               these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as polymers and catalysis, and
              in biology.
