Abstract    :
              9520849  TAYLOR  Paleo-ecological reconstructions clarify long-term climatic
              patterns, explain current ecosystem structure, and predict ecological outcomes
              given certain changes in climate or management scenarios.  The sequence of
              climatic changes affecting the development of natural wetland ecosystems of the
              Upper Atlantic Coastal Plain of the southeastern United States has not been
              well elucidated.  The PI's propose to resolve this sequence of local climatic
              change by using the record of fossilized diatoms, sponge spicules, and plant
              phytoliths.  These systems are attractive candidates for the research because
              they are non-fluvial precipitation basins whose sediments directly reflect
              local climate.  The vertical sequence of microfossils and physical sediment
              components will be assessed in horizontal transects of sediment cores taken
              throughout several Carolina bays.
