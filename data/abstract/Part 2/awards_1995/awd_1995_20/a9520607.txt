Abstract    :
              9520607  Rowe    This research involves determination of the evolutionary
              relationships among fossil marine reptiles.  Morphological, morphometric and
              biogeographical evidence will be evaluated.  The proposed research will yield
              significant new phylogenetic information regarding the interrelationships of
              members of this reptilian family.  In addition the study will provide an
              evaluation of different methods for recovery of the best estimate of amniote
              phylogeny. A final consideration will be the power of a phylogemy to predict
              morphological changes.
