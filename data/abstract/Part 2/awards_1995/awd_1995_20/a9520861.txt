Abstract    :
              Strassmann  9520861                              Abstract                       
                        In species where genetic divergence between populations has 
              occurred, mating across population boundaries may reduce  reproductive success.
               Multiple mating may provide an  effective defense against by permitting
              females to screen  out genetically incompatible gametes.  This research will 
              test that hypothesis using a species in which pedigree  analysis and single
              locus, minisatellite DNA fingerprinting  have detected meiotic drive and
              female-biased sex ratios.  These phenomena are linked to reduced female
              reproductive  success in mice and Drosophila.  The hypothesis will be  tested
              by investigation of the reproductive consequences of  crosses between
              populations that have diverged to the point  of partial reproductive
              incompatibility.  Hybrids that  combine alleles capable of segregation
              distortion and/or  skewing of sex ratios with responder loci lacking coevolved 
              insensitivity to such alleles may produce such  incompatibility.  Single-locus
              DNA fingerprinting will  determine whether suppressed intragenomic or nucleo 
              cytoplasmic conflict is unleashed in hybrids.  It will test  the prediction
              that multiple mating enables females to  safeguard their reproductive
              investment either by shunting  resources to viable embryos, or through cryptic
              choice of  genetically compatible sperm.
