Abstract    :
              9520898  Martin       The institute of International Education (IIE) seeks
              $357,191  over four years from the National Science Foundation to implement 
              the Global Engineering Education Exchange (GE3), through which U.S. 
              engineering undergraduates can participate in overseas academic  study and
              research for credit, working in academic and corporate  laboratories in Europe,
              Pacific Rim, and Latin America.  Through a  consortium of U.S. and foreign
              engineering schools, GE3 provides an  efficient and cost-effective mechanism
              through which U.S. faculty  can secure overseas placements for large numbers of
              their students.   Participating students will maintain progress towards their
              degree  while studying and working abroad with academic mentors, at no 
              additional tuition cost and with stipends form internships  offsetting overseas
              living cost.
