Abstract    :
              Antonovics  9520754   The majority of plant species have both male and female
              flowers.  However, some species have male and female flowers on different
              plants.  Plant ecologists and geneticists are keenly interested in the forces
              that determine the transitions between these two types of breeding systems. 
              The proposed research will study how this transition is being manifested in an
              herbaceous plant, Astilbe biternata, which has an intermediate breeding system.
               Understanding this transition will increase knowledge of how genes can be
              transmitted in plants and will help to plan long-term conservation strategies
              for dioecious species.
