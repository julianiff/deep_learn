Abstract    :
              9520839  Zewail    Over the past three years, this research has been centered 
              on the use of ultrafast laser spectroscopy to probe  molecular dynamics.  The
              new research will focus on three  directions: (a) studies of real-time dynamics
              in large  (nano) molecular clusters; (b) studies of the photophysical  and
              photochemical dynamics of materials under high pressure,  reaching up to 4000
              atmospheres; and (c) the use of novel  laser techniques to examine and control
              selective processes  in inhomogeneous systems.  The objectives are to resolve
              the  primary picosecond and femtosecond dynamics under these  novel conditions
              of controlled, size, density and distance,  and to learn about forces governing
              the transition to the  condensed phase limit.  %%%  This research is concerned
              with the investigation of the  ultrafast dynamics in clusters and at high
              pressures.  The  goal is to use ultrafast laser techniques, with picosecond 
              and femtosecond lasers, to resolve and study important  features of the
              dynamics involved in the transition from the  isolated molecule to the
              condensed-phase limit.  Studies of  microscopic large clusters and systems at
              high pressures  offers unique opportunities to test, on a fundamental level, 
              molecular interactions under controlled conditions of size,  density, and
              distance.  These studies will cover elementary  and complex molecular systems.
