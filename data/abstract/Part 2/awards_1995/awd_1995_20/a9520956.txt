Abstract    :
              9520956  Bennett  A generalized inverse, or four-dimensional variational
              assimilation  scheme for the Equatorial Pacific ocean will be developed. A 
              time-dependent, multi-level, non-linear primitive equation model  will be a
              weak constraint. Initial conditions and forcing will   be varied in order to
              fit data from the TOGA TAO Array, surface  drifters, tidegauges and altimetry.
              The produced fields will allow  detailed interpretation of the TOGA TAO data
              and provide more  accurate and dynamically consistent initial conditions   for
              forecast models.
