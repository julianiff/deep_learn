Abstract    :
              9520947  Densmore    This research involves collection of samples of a
              rhacophorid frog fauna from five hypothesized areas of endemism which comprise
              the Japan Archipelago and Taiwan, and phylogenetically related or
              geographically proximate taxa from the Asian continent.  From these specimens,
              two independent data sets derived from mtDNA and morphology will be analyzed
              independently and in concert to construct phylogenetic hypotheses for two
              distinct lineages which have representatives inhabiting these areas of
              endemism.  The resulting phylogenies will be used to test whether the present
              distribution patterns of these frogs are the result of past vicariant events
              and to present a hypothesis of their historical biogeography.  This hypothesis
              will then be analyzed along with the known geology of the archipelago to yield
              a general biogeographic hypothesis for the Japan Archipelago, which can be used
              to evaluate distributional patterns of other fauna and flora in Japan and Asia.
