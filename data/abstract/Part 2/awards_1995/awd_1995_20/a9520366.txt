Abstract    :
              The development of scanning tunneling microscopy for the imaging of  molecular
              adsorbates is the goal of this research project,  supported in the Analytical
              and Surface Chemistry Program.  An  ultra high vacuum scanning tunneling
              microscope will be used to  image selected molecular adsorbate systems and
              surface chemical  reactions.  Small aromatic molecules adsorbed on Pd(111)
              surfaces  will be investigated both experimentally and theoretically to 
              develop an understanding of the STM imaging mechanism, and to  determine the
              limits of real space and real time observation of  chemical reactions on
              surfaces.  Cyclization of acetylene to  benzene will form the focus of reaction
              studies.    In order to develop a microscopic understanding of chemical 
              reactions catalyzed by noble metal surfaces, real space and real  time
              structural information must be obtained.  The goal of this  research project is
              to develop both the experimental methods and  the theoretical understanding
              needed to use scanning tunneling  microscopy to provide this structural
              information.
