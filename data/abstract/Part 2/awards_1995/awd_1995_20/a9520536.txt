Abstract    :
              9520536  Wilson  The research combines high-resolution laser ablation with
              laser-induced electrical conductivity to address the problem of copper
              deposition on polyimide.  There are significant advantages of a
              copper/polyimide inner-connect system arising from the polyimide low dielectric
              constant and the high electrical conductivity of copper; however, there are
              fundamental problems, such as the resolution and adhesion of copper to
              polyimide.  If these problems can be addressed and solved, then improved
              performances and decreased cost will result in chip metalization, Multi-Chip
              Module (MCM) interconnects and printed circuit wiring boards (PCBs).  The
              research addresses these issues and, in particular, offers a solution to the
              chip-interconnect problem.  An innovative approach to the fabrication of MOS
              Transistors with the use of the above techniques to form a conductive gate
              electrode over a multi-insulator, polyimide gate dielectric layer.  ***
