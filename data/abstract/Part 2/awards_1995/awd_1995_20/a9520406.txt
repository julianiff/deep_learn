Abstract    :
              9520406  Wiley    The microparasite-induced collapse of populations of a
              dominant insect competitor in cold water streams in Michigan has provided a
              unique natural experiment for examining the organization of entire stream
              communities.  In work completed to date, the kinds and magnitudes of indirect
              dynamic responses observed to the removal of a strong interactor, the caddisfly
              grazer Glossosoma nigrior, by the microsporidian Cougourdella sp., clearly
              indicate that herbivory, and competition between herbivores, play a major role
              in organizing these communities.  Strong effects have been observed at all
              major trophic levels.  The present research will continue and expand this study
              by testing a series of mechanistic hypotheses concerning the generality, and
              details of the role, of endogenous biotic processes in structuring trout stream
              food webs.  The major objectives are:  1) to utilize natural experiments
              generated by the Glossosoma-Cougourdella system as an ecological probe to
              examine a series of explicit mechanistic models of trout stream community
              dynamics, 2) to determine whether, in the long-term, the dynamical nature of
              the Glossosoma-Cougourdella interaction is cyclic or stable, and 3) to
              determine the extent to which observations of communities structured by strong
              biotic interactions in the Michigan sites can be generalized to cold water
              systems of other regions.    This research will allow a more general assessment
              of the importance of parasites, and of the relative importance of biotic and
              abiotic factors in affecting the composition and structure of stream
              communities.  In addition, little information is available for any system
              concerning the stability, and the mechanisms promoting the long-term stability,
              of a given community configuration.  This research will provide valuable
              information regarding both issues.
