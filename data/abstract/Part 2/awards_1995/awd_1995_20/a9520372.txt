Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to develop and apply scalable numerical methods and
              a software infrastructure for the first principles prediction of the properties
              of materials. These materials typically have complex structures and
              compositions, a large number of atoms (n>100) and little or no symmetry.  For
              many important examples reliable theoretical predictions are not possible using
              present day approaches.  Here a new method is being tested; preliminary results
              show that it promises to remove a major roadblock to the wider application of
              first principle calculations to real materials, thereby greatly expanding the
              problems that can be treated.    As part of the project this new method will be
              applied to an important problem, the oxidation of carbon based materials.  The
              project builds on a novel computational approach to solving the LAD equations
              based on a parallel, real-space, adaptive multigrid eigenvalue solver.  Unlike
              Fourier methods, this adaptive method locally refines the solution to capture
              the short length scales in the problem; for example, the short length in near
              oxygen region in the carbon oxygen system.  The investigators' preliminary
              calculations are currently limited to model problems with structures similar to
              the real materials Schrodinger eigenvalue equation.  However, the new
              computational method shows promising improvements in convergence and efficiency
              over present algorithms.  The purpose of this program is to enhance the
              proposed solver to enable application of an adaptive method to real materials.
