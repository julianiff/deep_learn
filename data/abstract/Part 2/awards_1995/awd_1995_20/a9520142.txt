Abstract    :
              The focus of this research will be to expand the number and range of   small
              molecule libraries using the `libraries from libraries` concept.    For
              example, polyamine libraries generated by the exhaustive reduction of   peptide
              libraries can be readily converted to libraries of   hydroxylamines,
              nitrosamines, peptide ureas, and/or heterocyclic   imidazolidones.  These, in
              turn can be used to generate other libraries.    An ever-expanding combination
              of such different chemical alterations   permits the generation of a `toolbox`
              of chemical transformations capable   of producing immense diversities of
              compounds. With this award, the   Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the
              research of Dr. Richard A.   Houghten of the Torrey Pines Institute for
              Molecular Studies.   Dr.   Houghten will focus his work on increasing the range
              and repertoire of   soluble peptide, peptidomimetic and organic synthetic
              combinatorial   libraries and to improve the methodologies used for their
              synthesis.    Combinatorial libraries have broad utility for the de novo
              identification   of potent analgesics, novel and highly active antimicrobials,
              enzyme   inhibitors and highly specific antigenic determinants.
