Abstract    :
              Maddison & Burt  IBN 9520666                                Abstract    An
              important evolutionary issue is understanding the reasons  underlying the
              existence of altruistic behavior.  A variety of  approaches have been used to
              address this important problem.  These different approaches, or levels of
              analysis, have led to  four different, albeit complementary, explanations for
              its  existence.  The four categories are:  (1) functional consequences  or
              selective advantages, (2) proximate mechanisms or  physiological requirements,
              (3) ontogeny of parental care  behaviors, or (4) phylogenetic origin and
              historical patterns.  Dr. Maddison and his graduate student, Mr. Burt will
              examine the  relative roles of phylogenetic and contemporary ecological 
              factors on the evolution of cooperative behavior by studying  several different
              species within the same family of birds.  These  birds are an excellent choice
              for an historical analysis given  the availability of a group of 26 different
              species and the  diversity of their social systems.  To accomplish their goals,
               they will first collect behavioral data from a field site in  Kenya and then
              carry out a molecular analyses of the DNA.  These  results will be used for the
              phylogenetic reconstruction  algorithms to estimate the evolutionary
              relationships among the  species.  This multi-faceted project bridges the
              disciplines of  morphological and molecular systematics, evolutionary ecology, 
              and ethology. The outcome of the studies will provide the  framework for
              deciphering the existence of altruistic social  systems.
