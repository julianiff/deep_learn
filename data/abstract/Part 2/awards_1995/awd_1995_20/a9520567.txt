Abstract    :
              DEB-9520567  POWERS   The synthesis of proteins through gene expression is
              regulated by the interaction between factors that transcribe the genes and
              other genes that regulate the expression of the genes to be transcribed.  We
              propose to identify the mechanisms that regulate gene expression in populations
              of the teleost fish, Fundulus heteroclitus.  Specifically, we will investigate
              the structure and function of the region that regulates the transcription of a
              critical enzyme in intermediate metabolism, the heart-type lactate
              dehydrogenase (Ldh-B).  We will use modern molecular  techniques, such as: 
              gene cloning, DNA sequencing, DNA footprinting, cell cuture methods, and
              recombinant DNA technology.   With this research, we expect to develop new
              technologies that will allow us to better assess the genetic architecture of
              natural populations.  These new technologies will enhance our ability to manage
              commerical fisheries, improve strains of fish for aquaculture, and enhance the
              conservation of endangered and threatened species.
