Abstract    :
              9520964  Schutt-Aine  The electrical performance of high-speed integrated
              circuit and digital networks strongly depends on the electromagnetic
              performance of interconnects between components of a system.  In recent years,
              packaging  has become a critical area in the design of high-speed
              communications systems and fast computers.  The purpose of this research is to
              provide the technology necessary to design aggressive packaging schemes in the
              areas of design, modeling, testing, measurement and circuit simulation.  This
              objective will be achieved using electromagnetic theory as an analysis tool to
              yield a better understanding of interconnect problems.  The implementation of
              computer-aided design tools for this simulation of packages and interconnects
              will be achieved.  New design ideas will be studied and evaluated and solutions
              will be proposed for current system level integration  problems.  The complete
              effort is aimed at facilitating the task of circuit designers and reducing cost
              and time associated with the testing and evaluation of a given interconnect
              scheme.  ***
