Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Sangtae Kim    An industry-university collaborative project will be
              undertaken to improve basic understanding and develop numerical techniques for
              anew manufacturing method (fluidic self assembly) in microelectronics using
              slurry flow,  The Beckman Display (company for large panel displays) and the
              University of Wisconsin at Madison will jointly contribute to this
              interdisciplinary project requiring expertise ion two-phase flow, computer
              intensive algorithms, and construction of microelectronic devices.  An advanced
              Monte-Carlo approach using significantly reduced computational resources will
              developed for the three-dimensional viscous flow simulation of  moving of a
              large number of devices such as electronics chips over a target substrate.  The
              target substrate has a negative shape to the flowing devices to be mounted on
              it.  The project will include a six month visit of    Dr. S. Kim to the
              industrial partner, followed by fundamental research at the university.   
              Fluidic self assembly aims to be used for manufacturing of microscopic
              assemblies, with extended technical capabilities and reduced cost as compared
              to one of a time approach in robotic assembly.  Example of  potential
              application include integration of gallium arsenide onto silicon in
              communication lasers and silicon onto plastic for active matrix flat panel
              liquid crystal displays.  ***
