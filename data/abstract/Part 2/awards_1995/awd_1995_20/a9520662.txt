Abstract    :
              9520662  CLAY   Parasites may be important evolutionary agents for the
              maintenance of genetic diversity and reproduction in many species.  Plants can
              either self-fertilize or outcross with another plant.  The latter produces
              greater genetic variability than self-fertilization.  Although many plants can
              use both mechanisms, the conditions in which mixed systems are advantageous are
              not well understood.  Danthonia spicata is a grass that can reproduce through
              outcrossing and selfing flowers.  When infected with the fungus Atkinsonella
              hypoxylon, the development of outcrossing flowers is prevented and a fungal
              structure that bears infective spores develops in its place.  The fungus can
              also spread by infecting the seeds produced through selfing.  This parasite
              strategy of preventing outcrossing has been observed in other systems and might
              be advantageous for the parasite to reduce genetic variability of host plants
              or because more plant resources are available for fungal reproduction.   This
              project will investigate whether the fungus A. hypoxylon acts to maintain the
              mixed reproductive system in the host D. spicata, and how the host's
              reproductive system affects the success of the parasite.  The advantage of each
              fungal transmission mode (contagious spread or infection of host seeds) is of
              interest because each mode is associated with different levels of parasite
              effect on the host and can lead to different disease spread patterns. 
              Comparison of the host success through selfing and outcrossing  in the presence
              of pathogens will shed light on  the importance of maintaining genetic
              diversity in plants.  This information is important for constructing
              conservation policies for minimizing disease damage in endangered species.  It
              will also be of potential value for developing better agricultural practices to
              alleviate pathogen damage to crops.
