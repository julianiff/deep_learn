Abstract    :
                9520694  Arnold    Research will focus on how an individual's growth rate
              affects its age of maturation, its longevity and its offspring's survival.  The
              investigators will                                                             
                               also examine the costs to growth, costs associated with an
              individual's lifespan, the health of its offspring, and the environmental and
              genetic influences on variation among and within populations of Thamonophis
              elegans.   Three approaches will be used:  experiments in nature, experiments
              in the laboratory, and mathematical modeling.     Ultimately, the answers to
              these research questions will contribute to an understanding of how the
              environment combines with an individual's genetic makeup to shape its growth,
              maturation, ald survival.
