Abstract    :
              NCR-9520963  Kenneth Young    Bellcore, Tektronix, the Joint Interoperability
              Test Command  (JITC), and the University of Pennsylvania will implement an ATM 
              Interoperability Testbed to develop tools, procedures, and  standards that
              promote interoperability among ATM products.  The  project will include three
              key areas of ATM technology for the  development of interoperability testing
              systems.  These areas are  1) ATM signaling Interoperability, 2) ATM traffic
              management  interoperability, and 3) higher-layer protocol interoperability. 
              These areas are chosen because standards for signaling, traffic  management and
              higher layer protocols (e.g. Internet Protocol- IP)  as they related to ATM are
              maturing rapidly and will be implemented  in products in a time frame that is
              consistent with this project's  research and development.
