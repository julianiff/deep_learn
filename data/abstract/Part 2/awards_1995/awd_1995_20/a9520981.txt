              Subject: Heegard Abstract    ABSTRACT    NCR-9520981  Cornell University 
              Information Coding Technology for Multimedia and the Information Superhighwa= 
              y  Chris Heegard    This research deals with three topic areas: trellis coding
              and symbolic  systems, algebraic and algebraic geometry coding and Gr=F6bner
              bases, and  data compression theory and applications.  In the first area the
              research  will treat the symmetries of trellis codes, rotationally invariant
              trellis  codes, punctured trellis codes, and broadcast trellis coding.  In the 
              second, the work explores the algebraic structure of codes, decoding via  the
              key equation,  and systematic encoding of algebraic geometry codes.  The last
              area focuses on audio data compression, fractional octave filters,  and
              variable length/rate compression; the overall goal of the third area is  high
              fidelity perceptual (transform or sub-band) coding at lower bit rates.
