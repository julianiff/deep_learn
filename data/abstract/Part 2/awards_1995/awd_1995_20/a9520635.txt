Abstract    :
              9520635  Chung  Development of crystalline carbon nitride coatings will be 
              attempted by seeding and epitaxial growth of alternating  nano-scale layers of
              nitride-based seeding materials and  carbon nitride.  The processing conditions
              will be optimized  and the coatings will be characterized in terms of 
              composition,structure, surface morphology, chemical bonding,  and
              nano-indentation hardness.  Finally, the tribological  properties of the
              coatings will be determined.  ***
