Abstract    :
              9520109  Georgakakos  The California flash floods of winter 1995 will be studied
               by surveying the affected areas, collecting flood data from  Federal and State
              agencies and by using historical,  topographical, hydrometeorological and other
              database  information to develop flash flood potential maps for  critical areas
              in the state of California.  Data of this  event will be used to validate the
              estimates and, if  necessary, to modify the design of the flash flood potential
               algorithm.  Once validated, the mathematical model will be  used in a series
              of sensitivity experiments to provide,  quantitative answers to questions such
              as the effect of land  use changes on the magnitude and recurrence interval of
              the  flash flood potential index and the role of antecedent soil  moisture of
              mountainou terrain.  The resultant prototype  flash flood potential maps will
              be of value in activities  such as in the design of the safety criteria of
              small dams,  in the assessment of the flash flood risk, and in early  warning
              when combined with radar rainfall data.  ***
