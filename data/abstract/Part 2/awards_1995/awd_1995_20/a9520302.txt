Abstract    :
              9520302  Pratt    A numerical and analytical study will be undertaken of
              wind-driven  circulation around islands, including evaluation of the validity
              of  the 'Island Rule'.   Classical ocean circulation theory based on 
              homogeneous models has provided insight into certain striking  features of
              wind-driven currents such as westward intensification.  When the calculations
              are done in a domain closed to the north,  such as in models of the North
              Atlantic or North Pacific, the  interior circulation is joined to a western
              boundary layer whose  transport is determined by the condition of zero net
              meridional  transport across the entire basin.  When a large island is present,
               it may also create a western boundary layer (along its eastern  coastline).   
               The main goals of the this research is to systematically determine  the
              qualitative, wind-driven circulation schemes near islands, to  diagnose the
              associated dynamics, to assess the general  applicability of the Island Rule,
              and to perform a limited number  of qualitative case studies.  It is
              anticipated that the Island  Rule will provide a good approximation to the true
              transport under  a wide variety of conditions.
