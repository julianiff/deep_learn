Abstract    :
              This program on ionospheric density irregularities will focus on  the
              fundamental quantitative understanding of the characteristics  of plasma
              turbulence in the E and F regions of the Earth's  ionosphere.  The main
              objective will be to develop a self-  consistent theory of plasma turbulence
              driven by the Farley-Buneman  instability, which occurs when the cross-field
              drift velocity of  the electrons exceeds the sound velocity.  In addition to
              the main  objective, the PIs will investigate the intermittent acceleration  of
              electrons in current sheets that develop because of  magnetohydrodynamic
              activity in the medium.***
