              SGER:  A Domain-Model Approach to Reconstruction of 3D Environments  for
              Virtual Reality    This award is in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research
              mode.   Reconstruction of 3D environments from sensed data is a computer 
              vision problem with important application to the area of virtual  reality and
              other visual information systems. The relatively new  research area of virtual
              reality requires 3D models of entire  environments,  and  presents several
              significant new challenges for  computer vision, including the ability to deal
              with multiple moving  objects in the scene, integration of information about
              color and  textures, and the need for close attention to domain constraints, 
              to improve the reconstruction of a 3-D model of the environment.   The new
              approach in this research is to use  domain knowledge to  simplify and improve
              the 3D environment-acquisition process. This  approach is knowledge-driven and
              attempts to understand  the  physical structure of the environment and of the
              individual objects  in the environment.  This award supports preliminary
              research to  explore the feasibility of development of physical domain models 
              that define the physical constraints of a particular domain. Such  models might
              include information about possible 3D surface classes,  possible materials,
              surface relationships, common 3D primitive  solids, functional relationships
              among the 3D primitives, and fixed  or constrained lighting.
