Abstract    :
                  9520457  HICKMAN  This award will contribute support to the doctoral
              dissertation research of a student at the University of California, Berkeley. 
              The award will provide minor funding for supplies and will enable the student
              to visit and study major collections of fossil mollusk material in the United
              States as well as the Natural History Museum in Basel, Switzerland where
              important paleontological holdings are found.  This is an important study
              because the student will be attempting to assess sampling strategies and
              compare methods for estimating biodiversity for extinct faunas of gastropods. 
              Establishing reliability of such methods is very important for addressing
              faunal change through geological time and especially for investigating Neogene
              mass extinctions in the western Atlantic.  %%%  This award will contribute to
              the research training of a young paleontologist.  More importantly, the work of
              this particular student could be very important for other more senior
              researchers in establishing methods for estimating biodiversity in fossil
              communities.  ***
