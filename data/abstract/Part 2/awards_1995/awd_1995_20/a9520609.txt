Abstract    :
              9520609  BRYANT     The proposed research centers on the effects of (1)
              adaptation to the captive environment, (2) population size, and (3) founder
              size on population fitness, genetic variation, and evolutionary flexibility. By
              combining life history, quantitative genetic, and allozyme assays, evidence
              will be gathered on the correlation between different types of genetic
              variation and population fitness. Preliminary data on adaptation to the captive
              environment has shown highly significant changes in a whole suite of life
              history traits and a significant loss of fitness. The loss of fitness may be
              due to an increase in the frequency of detrimental recessive alleles.    The
              hypothesis that the level of genetic variation in populations of endangered
              species correlates strongly with that population's fitness and evolutionary
              potential is widely accepted but has yet to be tested empirically. The proposed
              research will provide empirical evidence with application to (1) predicting
              minimum viable population sizes of animals needed for reserves and zoological
              parks, (2) recommending breeding strategies for captive species of animals, and
              (3) assessing the likelihood of successful reintroduction of captive bred
              animals to the wild.
