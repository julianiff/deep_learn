Abstract    :
              9520528  Brown      Research in the Paleomagnetic Laboratory at the University
              of  Massachusetts has been underway for the last twenty years, with  emphasis
              on studies of the paleosecular variation of the Earth's  magnetic field and on
              the solution of geologic problems using  paleo-magnetism. Current and past
              research have been done using  measurements from a spinner magnetometer.  With
              the increasing  numbers of samples needed for both paleosecular variation and 
              tectonic studies, and the detailed demagnetization steps required  with current
              standards, measurements such as these are a lengthy  process.  This grant
              provide funds for the acquisition of a  cryogenic magnetometer that will allow
              for the accurate  processing of weakly magnetized sediment samples, as well as 
              radically decrease measurement times.  The active Quaternary  research group at
              the University of Massachusetts will now have a  paleomagnetic laboratory that
              is capable of competitive research  into paleosecular variation studies on
              recent sediments and  paleoclimatic studies of weakly magnetized materials. 
              The new  instrument will also benefit a larger, five-college Quaternary 
              Research Group composed of faculty from Amherst, Hampshire, Mount  Holyoke and
              Smith as well as the host institution.    ***
