Abstract    :
              9520883  Luecke   This research will examine the effect of upper food web
              configuration on pelagic ecosystem structure, carbon flow, and productivity in
              Castle Lake, California. This research builds on a whole lake food web
              manipulation, and augments the value and importance of a well-developed long
              term data set emphasizing biological and climatic determinants of primary
              productivity. In this project, food web configuration in Castle Lake will be
              manipulated by varying the stocking rates of rainbow trout. The manipulation
              will reduce rainbow trout, thus increasing the abundance of golden shiners,
              copepods, and micrograzers of bacteria. By measuring rates of microbial and
              primary production and assessing population and growth dynamics of metazoans
              and fish, this research will estimate patterns of production and carbon flow
              through the food web under different food web configurations. The response of
              the Castle Lake food web to trophic structure manipulation will be compared to
              concurrent dynamics in an unperturbed reference site, Cliff Lake. In addition
              to the whole lake manipulation, a series of meso- and microcosm experiments to
              address mechanisms determining food web structure will be conducted. This
              research will be summarized and synthesized within a quantitative simulation
              model. This quantitative framework will allow integration from investigations
              spanning a variety of spatial and temporal scales, and will allow
              interpretation of microbial and classic-based food web dynamics within the
              context of the long-term data record for the Castle Lake ecosystem.
