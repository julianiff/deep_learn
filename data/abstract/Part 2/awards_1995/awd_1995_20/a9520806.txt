Abstract    :
              This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry
              Program, addresses the question of the mechanism of  oxidative coupling of
              methane over oxide catalyst surfaces.  The  use of in situ Raman spectroscopy
              to identify potentially active  forms of oxygen such as peroxide, superoxide,
              and oxo species is a  principal focus of this work.  Isotope labeling
              experiments will be  used to help to identify intermediates, as well as to
              ascertain  rate determining steps in the oxidative and non-oxidative coupling 
              reactions of methane over oxide and zeolitic catalyst materials.   Coupling of
              methane to form aromatic products is also being  examined in this research. 
              The conversion of methane, an abundant hydrocarbon resource, into  more useful
              chemicals and fuels is an important goal of  heterogeneous catalysis science. 
              The thrust of this research  project is directed toward developing an
              understanding of the  detailed mechanism of methane conversion on oxide
              catalysts,  primarily via oxidative coupling reactions.  Raman spectroscopic 
              probes will be developed and used to provide this understanding.   The outcome
              of this research project could have significant impact  on this technologically
              and environmentally important process.
