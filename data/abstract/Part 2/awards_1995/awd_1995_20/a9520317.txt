Abstract    :
                This dissertation research project involves the research of an anthropology
              student from the University of California-Davis.  The project involves studying
              the dispersal of individuals and families from a location in 18th and early
              19th century Massachusetts.  The student will trace individuals who migrated
              and those who did not, and test theories derived from evolutionary ecology. 
              The data will be used to develop a model of dispersal measuring costs and
              benefits under a range of constraints.  Specific hypotheses to be tested are
              that males will migrate less than females, but when they do leave they travel
              further than females; that dispersal is a higher risk strategy than not
              migrating, therefore the variance in reproductive and economic success will be
              greater for dispersers than non-dispersers; and that birth order effects will
              correlate with specific inheritance patterns.  This research is important
              because migration is an enduring pattern of human life.  Advances in our
              understanding of the causes and effects of human dispersal from this one
              particular site will help us understand the general consequences of
              displacement for persons and populations.
