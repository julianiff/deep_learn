              Abstract  ATM-9520807  Andrews, John T.  University of Colorado  Title:
              Decadal-Scale Proxy Records of the Last 3,000 Years from the          Eastern
              Canadian Arctic and Iceland Based on Lake Sediment          and Palynology   
              This PALE/ARCSS award supports a study of decadal-scale variability  in the
              paleoclimate of Iceland over the last 3,000 years.  It is  specifically
              intended to unite projects of Baffin Island and  Iceland by creating lake
              sediment and pollen records for Iceland  that can be compared to similar
              high-resolution records from sites  on Baffin Island, N.W.T., Canada.  This
              effort will help to  integrate paleoclimate records from Greenland, Iceland and
              the  Eastern Canadian Arctic and will provide information useful in  piecing
              together the synoptic climatology of the northern Atlantic  region.
