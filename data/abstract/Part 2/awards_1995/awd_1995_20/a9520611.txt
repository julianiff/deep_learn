Abstract    :
              9520611  Mazer      The focus of the proposed research is to better understand
              competition for reproduction among plants.  Plants that produce flowers will
              compete because ultimately there are many more pollen grains produced than
              there are flowers to be fertilized.  The experiments proposed will focus on the
              competition that occurs after pollination.  One consequence of competition
              during this phase is that some individuals may father more seeds in the next
              generation than other individuals.  Are there differences among plants in this
              ability?  What influences how well a plant's pollen performs during this phase?
                The investigators will examine elements of the environment and of the plant
              itself to determine: 1) how these factors influence a plant's success during
              the post-pollination phase; 2) the number of seeds fathered following
              competition; 3) pollen performance on burned and unburned habitats;  and 4)
              success by plants competing for flowers with varying morphologies.   Flowering
              plants may have invaded so many niches in the world because of their ability to
              remove inferior genes through the type of competition described above. Thus
              this research may have important implications for all flowering plants. 
              Moreover, the research may yield information useful in applied fields, as
              understanding of pollen competition could be applied to improvements in crop
              species.
