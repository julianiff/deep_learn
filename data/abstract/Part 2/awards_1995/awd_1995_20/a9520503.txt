              Wilson PRIVATE    This proposal is for a Career Advancement Award to extend the
              PIs sabbatical leave from Siena College for one semester; to provide release
              time from teaching for an additional semester upon return to her home
              institution; and to provide summer salary support. She wishes to continue a
              promising line of research  initiated during a sabbatical in Dr. David Shub's
              laboratory at the State University of New York at Albany. During the proposed
              period of support she also plans to write and submit a research grant on this
              project to the NSF Research in Undergraduate Institutions program so that she
              can continue the investigations in  with undergraduates. A systematic search
              for introns will be undertaken to explore the evolutionary relationships
              between Group I introns in prokaryotic genes. A recently discovered self
              splicing intron within the thymidylate synthase (TS) gene of B. subtilis
              bacteriophage ,B22 (thy) shares a number of properties with the previously
              identified thymidylate synthase (td) Group I intron of bacteriophage T4, as
              well as with the other known T4 introns (nrdB  and sunY). A number of candidate
              phages of gram(+) bacteria, identical in structure to ~22, will be explored by
              PCR for introns within their TS genes. Each new intron discovered will be
              cloned into an in vitro transcription vector to analyze its ability to self
              splice from primary transcripts, and sequenced to deduce its folded structure,
              and ascertain its relatedness to the known Group I introns. %%% Although the
              vast majority of eukaryotic genes contain introns, none has been identified as
              residing in eubacteria or their viruses until the surprising discovery of a
              self splicing intron in the thymidylate synthase gene of bacteriophage T4. 
              Others in T4 were quickly discovered as well.  All of the intron containing
              genes in T4 encode proteins involved in the synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides
              in infected host cells.  In the Career Advancement Award, a systematic search
              for introns in prokaryotic genes will be undertaken.  each new intron
              identified will be analyzed for its ability to self-splice, and its structures
              and relatedness to other group I introns will be determined. ***
