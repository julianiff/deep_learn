Abstract    :
              9520803  Wagener    The viability of acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) 
              polymerization has been demonstrated during the most recent  funding period by
              identifying the functionalities which can  be tolerated during this
              condensation reaction.  This new  chemistry has led to telechelic hydrocarbon
              polymers  synthesized by depolymerization reactions, as well as to  many
              advanced polymer systems.  This grant addresses four  generally related
              research areas which expand upon what has  been done thus far with ADMET
              polymerization.  The chemistry  of conjugated dienes will be explored. 
              Hydrocarbon  conjugated dienes will be examined fipst followed by  expansion to
              aromatic conjugated dienes.  The mechanistic  enigma associated with terminal
              aliphatic dienes will be  elucidated.  Further, the catalyst base for ADMET
              chemistry  will be expanded to include considerably less expensive  systems,
              and speed of these reactions (the kinetics) will be  elucidated in such detail
              that the practical application of  these results will be well understood. 
              Thermoreversible  network polymers will be made with the goal of improving the 
              recyclability of waste plastics systems, and finally, chiral  polymers will be
              prepared to broaden the utility of this new  chemistry.  %%%  Interest in the
              commercial utility of ADMET chemistry is  high, as judged by the response from
              American industry  during the past three years of NSF support.  Particularly 
              significant are applications to the synthesis of specialty  polymers, the
              preparation (via depolymerization) of targeted  molecules of high commercial
              value, and the utility of ADMET  chemistry in the reuse of well known
              commercial polymers,  such as polybutadiene. This renewal builds upon all of
              these  opportunities. ***
