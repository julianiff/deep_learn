Abstract    :
              9520115  Herman   A workshop at the State University of New York at Stony Brook
              aimed at introducing thermal spray technology to the wide engineering community
              will be held in the summer of '95.  The workshop speakers will consist of
              engineers and managers from manufacturing industries which have successfully
              implemented thermal spray into their production processes.  In addition,
              selected scientists from academia and industry will discuss key aspects of the
              technology, from both the points of view of limitations and opportunities.  
              Bringing industrial end users and academic researchers in this focused workshop
              will enable commercial growth of this emerging technology.
