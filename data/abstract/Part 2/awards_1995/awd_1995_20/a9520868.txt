Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will aid in  purchasing a Reflectron Matrix-Assisted laser
              desorption/ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight  (TOF) mass spectrometer for the
              Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin-  Madison.  The research
              studies to be performed include the following:  (1) Protein Design and  Protein
              Refolding; (2) Analysis of Oligosaccharides and Glycopeptides with a MALDI-TOF 
              Mass Spectrometer; (3) Polymeric Carbohydrate Inhibitors; (4) Applications of
              MALDI-  TOF Mass Spectrometry in Gene Sequencing; (5) Analysis of Peptides with
              a Reflectron  MALDI-TOF  Mass Spectrometer; (6) Polymer Interfaces and
              Dynamics; and (7) Lateral  Diffusion of Vinyl Polymers at the A/W Interface and
              of Star Polymer at the  Toluene/Water Interface.    Mass Spectrometry (MS) is a
              technique used to probe intimate structural details and to obtain  the
              molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic and
              organometallic molecules.   The addition of the technique of electrospray
              extends the range of MS to protein and nucleic acid  molecular weights far
              beyond any other technique.  The use of electrospray ionization in  combination
              with high resolution provides the latest techniques available in mass
              spectrometry.   It affords the chemist one of the most powerful tools available
              for the characterization of  compounds.  The acquisition of this capability in
              mass spectrometry is essential for the  prosecution of frontier research in
              many fields of chemistry.
