Abstract    :
              9520335  Zimmerman    Many studies suggest that the two most important factors
              limiting the reproductive success of birds are nest predation and food supply. 
              It has recently been proposed that the combined effects of these two factors
              may act to limit nesting success through a conflict between the time parents
              allocate to foraging for nestlings and time needed to guard the nest from
              predators.  Birds nesting in territories with an increased food supply should
              be able to devote more time toward guarding the nestlings from predators and
              therefore experience reduced levels of nest predation.  In addition, birds
              nesting in areas with reduced predator abundance should be able to allocate
              more time toward foraging for nestlings and therefore increase reproductive
              success through greater fledgling mass and survivability.  This research will
              test these time allocation hypotheses in a population of brown thrashers by
              simultaneously manipulating food supply and predation risk.  Nesting success
              will be monitored and behavioral observations will be conducted to determine
              how parents allocate time to foraging and guarding behaviors when nesting in
              areas of increased food supply, reduced predation risk, or both.    This
              research will enhance our understanding of the factors that shape avian
              foraging strategies and determine nesting success.  Given the recent population
              decline in many bird species, the results may also contribute to attempts to
              conserve biodiversity.
