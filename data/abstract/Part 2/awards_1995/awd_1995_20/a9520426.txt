Abstract    :
              This research seeks to test a two-part hypothesis about the creation of
              electoral laws and their effects on a nation's political party system: 
              electoral procedures that improve the level of representativeness of a party
              system will only be implemented only when doing so improves the political
              position of the politicians involved in making the laws.    Using data on
              electoral reforms and the politicians who supported or opposed them, this study
              will discover whether politicians whose political survival is threatened will
              prefer rules that broaden participation in an effort to amass as much support
              as possible.  On the other hand, secure politicians will favor the electoral
              rules that brought them into power while opposing laws that allow new parties
              and participants.  The research targets Latin America where party systems with
              varying degrees of representativeness were replaced first by military regimes
              that have recently given way to democratically elected governments.
