Abstract    :
              9520443  Marcy    Our Solar System remains the lone planetary system that is
              known to  be around a normal star.  Current observational efforts have failed 
              to discover extrasolar planets at a threshold of the mass three  times that of
              Jupiter orbiting approximately 30 solar-type stars.   A search for extrasolar
              planets, by observing the reflex  acceleration of the hmst stars, measured by
              the Doppler effect,  will be carried out.  As our Sun executes a velocity
              amplitude  change of 13 m/sec (as observed from outside the solar system) due 
              primarily to Jupiter, it is planned to achieve a Doppler  measurement precision
              of 2 m/sec to ensure detection of giant  planets orbiting around other stars. 
              This unprecedented Doppler  measurement precision stems from novel developments
              in spec-  trometer design and spectral analysis.  In addition, a new Schmidt 
              camera has been specially engineered to produce a sharp, symmetric  Point
              Spread Function (PSF) over the full format of a fast echelle  spectrometer.  A
              2048x2048 CCD detector will be used to gather all  stellar Doppler information,
              within 1000 Angstroms wavelength,  spread over 30,000 CCD pixels.  The analysis
              of the Doppler shifts  in the spectra will consist of an entirely novel
              simultaneous  solution of all spectrometer parameters (wavelength scale and
              PSF)  and Doppler shift.    A  detailed error budget for the Doppler
              measurements yields a  bottom line accuracy of 2 m/sec.  This precision renders
              the  detection of Jupiter-like planets detectable at the 5 sigma level,  and
              Saturn-like planets will be marginally detectable.  Actual test  observations
              of the spectra of Solar-like stars enable one to  achieve a precision of 3.5
              m/sec.  This accuracy will be improved  with the next-generation Doppler
              analysis techniques.  Already,  however, by averaging sets of five exposures,
              the error in the mean  is less than 2 m/sec.   It is planned to monitor 15
              G-type and K-  type stars and make measurements of the Doppler wavelength
              shifts  to a precision of 2  m/sec.  Eighty five other stars will be  observed
              with an accuracy of 5 m/sec in the measurement of the  Doppler wavelength
              shifts (depending on the brightness of the  individual stars).  These new
              techniques will make it possible to  observe stars and measure velocity
              changes, indicative of giant  planets,  within 3 years.
