Abstract    :
                  9520835  FEENER   Biological invasions provide excellent opportunities to
              study the organization of natural communities.  This research uses Argentine
              ant invasions in northern California to test hypotheses concerning the causes
              of these invasions.  The first objective is to quantify how different biotic
              and abiotic factors control the rate of invasions by conducting a natural
              trajectory experiment at 20 independent invasion fronts.  These factors can be
              examined with unusual clarity because the invasion fronts of Argentine ants are
              well delineated and advance slowly.  Of particular importance is determining if
              features of native ant communities govern the rate of spread of Argentine ants.
               The second objective is to determine the competitive mechanisms whereby
              Argentine ants displace native ants.  Short-term introductions of Argentine
              ants at baits controlled by native ants will be used to examine mechanisms used
              by Argentine ants to supplant other species.  In addition, the repellency of
              chemical defenses of the Argentine ants will be tested in laboratory
              experiments.   Biological invasions are a common feature of most ecological
              communities.  This study of invasion by Argentine ants should reveal
              competitive mechanisms that are common to other successful invaders, as well as
              some of the features governing invasion success in other natural communities.
