Abstract    :
              CTS-9520897  Ritter  U of South Carolina      Magnetic adsorbent materials will
              be evaluated for selective separation  of metals from aqueous solutions by
              applying a magnetic field.  The proposed concept of Magnetic Swing Adsorption
              (MSA) is unique because the highly porous adsorbent materials not only provides
              a magnetic matrix but also an adsorptive components to the systems.  An
              exploratory study of a bench scale two-bed MSA process will be conducted.  The
              experimental setup will allow for the measurement of the applied magnetic field
              strength as well as feed, product and exhaust compositions and flow rates.  A
              detailed parametric study will be performed for the removal of chromium.  The
              efficiency of metal removal and the overall performance of MSA technique will
              be evaluated.  Successful implementation of the concept will lead to a new
              field-enhanced process for the separation of soluble metal species from aqueous
              solutions.  The research is relevant to a variety of chemical, manufacturing
              and environmental technologies.
