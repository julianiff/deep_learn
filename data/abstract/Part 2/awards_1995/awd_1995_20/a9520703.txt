Abstract    :
                The proposed research is suitable for an SGER, due to its  interdisciplinary
              nature, involving applications of geometric  modeling and  scientific
              visualization to provide improved  representation and display  techniques for
              the cornea.  The  application has the potential of  revolutionizing the field
              of  optometry.  Instead of the current trial-and-error  method of  fitting
              contact lenses a much faster and precise procedure can be  developed. 
              Furthermore, it will enable fitting contact lenses to  people whose  corneas
              have complex and/or irregular shapes,  something which is impossible  with the
              current state of the art.  A successful completion of the project may  induce
              the  manufacturers of contact lenses to embark on a development  effort,  but
              at present they don't have the financial incentive to  take the risk.  Thus 
              the small investment in this project can  have significant impact.  The PI is 
              highly qualified and is  strongly motivated, due to a personal vision problem. 
              I  recommend funding.
