Abstract    :
              CTS-9520328  Ralph T. Yang  University of Michigan      ABSTRACT      The
              research project seeks to develop two new sorbents for olefin-paraffin
              separation and to obtain a basic understanding of the pie-complexation
              mechanism for adsorption.  Novel sorbents have been synthesized by dispersion
              of Ag(I) and Cu(I) cations on substrates that  do not adsorb paraffins
              strongly.  Preliminary experiments show enhanced olefin selectivity, capacity
              and rate of separation.  Other adsorbents will be prepared using monolayer
              dispersion of Ag(I) and Cu(I) salts on various substrates. The later sorbents
              will be examined for acetylene separation.  The study will include the effects
              of different anions, cations and substrates on the adsorption and separation
              behavior.  Theoretical studies based on molecular orbital calculations will
              focus on the hydrocarbon-sorbent interactions.  The effectiveness of the new
              sorbents for olefin-paraffin separations will be assessed by model simulation
              for pressure (or vacuum) swing adsorption.  The results will have an impact on
              the development of energy efficient separation techniques for the chemical and
              petrochemical industries.
