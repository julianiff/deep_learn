Abstract    :
              9520587  Tomozawa    Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute will host the University 
              Conference on Glass Science on August 9-11, 1995.  The theme  of this meeting
              will be Optical and Electrical Properties of  Glasses a topic of both
              scientific and technological  importance in the area ranging from optical
              communications  to electric batteries.  Outstanding scientists in the field 
              will deliver the invited talks. The topics included are;  ionic conduction and
              transport, dielectric properties,  optical and nonlinear optical phenomenon and
              wide coverage  on the synthesis of glasses by various methods.        %%%      
               This conference provides a forum for participants to assess  critical
              scientific issues and plan future research  directions in glass science and
              technology in materials of  importance to optical science and engineering. 
              Furthermore,  it presents an excellent opportunity for students to enhance 
              their knowledge of the field, and meet international experts  in this high
              technology area.        ***
