Abstract    :
              9520553  Gerhardt    Monocarpy, in which plants grow for several years then
              undergo one, fatal bout of reproduction, should be favored when a plant
              experiences a disproportionately large gain in fitness by investing all the
              resources it has available for reproduction at once.  Previous research in
              plants has focused on how monocarpy might benefit the adult plant during its
              own lifetime through enhanced mating success.  The proposed research will test
              whether monocarpy also confers fitness benefits by allowing plants to provide
              maternal care or nurse effects that directly increase offspring survival during
              seedling establishment.    This research will enhance basic understanding of
              how selection on maternal care shapes the life-history attributes of plants. 
              It will be among the first studies to incorporate consideration of parental
              care into explanations of plant reproductive strategies.
