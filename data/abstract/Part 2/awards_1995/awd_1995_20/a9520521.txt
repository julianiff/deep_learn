Abstract    :
              9520521  Christie    This project is joint effort by scientists from the
              Institute da  physique du Globe in Strasbourg, France and Oregon State 
              University.  The field program to the Galapagoes Islands and Costa  Rica rift
              zone will be done using the French research vessel  Atlanta in
              December1996/January 1997.  The primary goal of the  study is to relate the
              volcanic history (very stable) of the Ocean  Drilling Program deep site (504B)
              in the Galapagoes region to an  apparent diverse volcanic history (variable) of
              younger surface  weeks in the region. The results will improve the
              understanding of  crustal formation processes in oceanic seafloor spreading
              systems.
