Abstract    :
                9520713  Mori    This research involves molecular analysis of DNA sequence
              data to establish evolutionary relationships among members of the tropical
              plant family Vochysiaceae.  Phylogenetic relationships will be reconstructed
              using chloroplast rbcL and ndhL sequences and scanning electron microscopy will
              be used to examine the developmental evolution of certain characters (for
              example, stamens).  This plant family is worthy of study because of its topical
              and disjunct distribution.  The significance of the research is one of
              elucidating the developmental evolution of floral patterns, pollination biology
              and the biogeographic distribution of members of this family.
