Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Scott   Anderson
              of the University of Utah will study the reaction dynamics of   simple
              polyatomic ions using reactant vibrational mode selection and high   resolution
              ion beam techniques.  Systems which will be investigated   include the
              reactions of water ions with hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and   water molecules,
              and the reaction of nitrous oxide ions with carbon   monoxide molecules.  These
              studies will include the development of pulsed   field ionization techniques to
              produce vibrational state selectivity in   the reactant ions.  This work will
              advance the understanding of the   vibrational mode dependence of reaction
              mechanisms, and the manner in   which reactant energy is partitioned into
              product states.  This work is   expected to provide benchmarks for further
              theoretical work on these   systems.  The amount and nature of vibrational
              energy in a reactant molecule can   cause dramatic changes in the relative
              amounts of different products of    chemical reactions.  Professor Anderson's
              work will determine how this   vibrational energy will affect the products of
              several ion molecule   reactions.  The results of this work will provide
              information on methods   of controlling chemical reactions to produce a single
              product to the   exclusion of other unwanted products.
