Abstract    :
              9520968  Luyanda  The NASTO `995 Conference of the Northeast Association of
              State  Transportation Officials will be held in Puerto Rico on July 1995  with
              the participation of ministers and secretaries of  transportation of the
              Americas.  The conference will present a  research-oriented conference-workshop
              within the context of NASTO  `95.  The invited speakers will discuss current
              research  projects, discuss the state-of-practice in their respective 
              countries and institutions, and share knowledge about the impact  that
              transportation issues have had in their particular setting.  The interaction
              amongst the researcher, and between them and the  policy makers and their
              technical staff, all from different  countries and backgrounds but facing
              similar problems, will allow  useful exchanges of information, help to set
              meaningful research  priorities, and stimulate collaborative projects.    The
              papers presented, the formal and informal discussions, and  the resulting
              proceedings will provide an excellent technology  transfer mechanism.  The
              event will provide a valuable  opportunity to strengthen ties and establish new
              connections  between participants from North and South America.  The 
              conference will also directly benefit students from the  University of Puerto
              Rico, who will have an opportunity to learn  from the presentations and
              interact with the participants.  ***
