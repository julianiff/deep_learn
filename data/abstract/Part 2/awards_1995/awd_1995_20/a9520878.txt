Abstract    :
              MICHENER    Extensive flooding resulting from tropical storm Alberto moved into
              southwestern Georgia and maintained a relatively stationary position producing
              extreme precipitation and extensive flooding. Over 53 cm of rain were recorded
              in portions of the Flint River drainage basin, and flooding has been
              characterized as a 500-year event for this catchment. The large-scale and
              high-intensity floods have provided an opportunity to initiate a number of
              studies on the effects of flooding on longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) and
              wiregrass (Aristida stricta) ecosystems. Research is to be carried out on tree
              mortality and regeneration, stream geomorphology within riparian zones,
              mortality and recruitment of wiregrass, landscape-scale geomorphic responses,
              and patch structure relative to landscape position. Remote sensing techniques
              and ground-based surveys will be used to assess the impacts of disturbance on
              these ecosystems and to initiate studies addressing recovery in these disturbed
              environments.    This research is important because of the severity and rarity
              of the event, and the information base to which this occurrence can be
              compared. These ecosystems have generally been viewed as susceptible to
              disturbance by fire, but the roles of flooding and extreme precipitation have
              not been researched. This project begins a timely study of flood and
              precipitation disturbance in these economically important ecosystems.     ??
