Abstract    :
              9520771  Understanding  the  mechanisms  that  lead  to   differences  between 
              individuals  of  related  species  is  one  key  to  understanding   the 
              pattern  and  process   of   biological  diversification.   Such mechanisms can
               include  changes  in  gene  sequences,  changes  in the expression  of 
              particular  genes   during  growth  and  development  and  environmental 
              influences.   This  research is aimed at characterizing  the  development  of 
              pigment patterns  in  a  group  of  closely  related  species.  Collaboration
              with scientists in Thailand  will provide essential data and enhance research
              efforts  in  both  countries.  Analysis of growth rates  and  changes  in 
              patterns  during development will be used to test models  of  pattern
              formation.  The distribution of color patterns  will  be   compared  with 
              phylogenetic  relatedness  and  habitat  choice,  to determine the evolutionary
              sequences of  pattern  changes  and  the  importance of  adaptation  to 
              particular  ecological  circumstances in controlling pattern  formation.  The 
              results of this research program will shed light on the  developmental
              mechanisms that result in changes  in  pattern  formation,  and on their
              ecological significance.   It  will  aid  in  understanding the origin and
              persistence of between  species biological diversity.
