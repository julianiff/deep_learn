Abstract    :
              The interaction of theory and practice is of critical importance for
              understanding the relationship of science to society.  Ms. Sarah Lowengard,
              under the direction of Dr. Garber, is undertaking doctoral dissertation
              research that examines the relationship between color production techniques and
              ideas about the nature of color in chemistry and physics.  Their relationship
              becomes obvious when color-making practices (dyestuff- pigment- and
              glaze-making) are examined together with theoretical explanations for color. 
              Transfer of information about practices and about theories was constant and
              multi-directional, reflecting typical styles of social and intellectual
              exchange.  To understand these connections, Ms. Lowengard is uniting the
              disparate groups of theorists, practitioners and entrepreneurs in, what she
              calls for her research purposes, the "color industry."  She is especially
              examining the search for new colors and new techniques to produce colors.  This
              dissertation aims to show the way information transfer in the color industry
              enhanced its crafts and altered its theories.  It will provide a model to
              understand these and similar intellectual and practical interactions.
