Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry  
              Program provides continued support to Dr. Gregory H. Robinson of the  
              Chemistry Department, University of Georgia, for investigation of the  
              coordination chemistry of aluminum compounds containing Al-Al bonds.  The  
              synthetic approach to the target molecules--novel organometallic   alanes--will
              require preparation of anionic aluminum dimers containing a   hydride bridge
              and bulky aryl ligands by alkali metal reduction of diaryl   aluminum hydrides.
               Preparation of the diaryl aluminum hydrides will be   based on the synthetic
              route to analogous gallium compounds.  In   addition, attempts will be made to
              achieve the desired products using a   template based on
              bis(aluminumdichloride).  Organometallic compounds of aluminum have been
              prepared only recently,   and unlike other members of the Group III family,
              boron and gallium, few   molecules containing a multiple aluminum atoms are
              known.  Preparation of   compounds of this type presents a synthetic challenge,
              but also may lead   to compounds with novel properties since other members of
              this family   have become important in the manufacture of electronic materials
