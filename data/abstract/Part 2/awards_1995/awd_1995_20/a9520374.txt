Abstract    :
              9520374  Shepson     This project aims at improving our understanding of the
              impact of organic nitrates on the production and distribution of tropospheric
              ozone. Organic nitrates are produced in the reaction between organic peroxy
              radicals with nitric oxide, usually as a minor product. The importance of this
              reaction channel increases with the size of the organic precursor. Removal of
              nitric oxide through this reaction could constitute an important NOx sink, thus
              reducing the ozone formation rate. In order to accurately model the ozone
              budget, the yields of organic nitrates in the oxidation pathways of natural
              hydrocarbons are needed. In this project, the yield of nitrate formation from
              isoprene, terpenes, and aromatic hydrocarbons will be measured using a large
              photochemical reaction chamber equipped with sampling and detection devices
              capable of distinguishing individual nitrate species.   In addition, ambient
              measurements of organic nitrates will be conducted at a forested site at the
              northwestern tip of the Michigan southern Peninsula, using a unique combination
              of adsorbent concentration and chemiluminescent detection that will enable the
              investigators to measure the total concentration of both gas- and
              particulate-phase organic nitrates with very low limits of detection. These
              data will be useful for modeling studies of tropospheric ozone, and will
              provide new insights into the problem of the speciation of atmospheric total
              reactive nitrogen (NOy), and the importance of organic nitrates as a sink
              and/or vehicle for the transport of atmospheric NOx.
