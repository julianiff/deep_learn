Abstract    :
              9520295  Wright  This research project will  investigate the seismic response of
               exterior frame connections in  composite (steel-concrete)  structures.  The
              connections will  consist of  a steel-reinforced  concrete (SRC) column and a 
              composite beam (steel beam and  concrete slab).  Transverse steel  beams, steel
              decking and a floor  slab will all be part of the test  subassemblies to more
              closely  simulate composite connections as  they would be constructed in the 
              field.  The primary experimental  variables will be the moment  strength ratio
              between the SRC  column and the composite beam, and  the type of confinement 
              reinforcement used in the SRC  column in the joint region of the  connection
              subassembly.  Within the  joint perimeter hoop reinforcement  will need to be
              composed of as many  as four pieces that are lap spliced  as they pass through
              the steel beam  webs.  For some of the specimens a  fiber reinforced concrete
              (FRC)  will be used in the connection  region to enhance the bond along  the
              splice lengths.  The FRC will  add some internal confinement to  the concrete
              in the connection and  should slow the deterioration of  the concrete shear
              mechanisms in  the connection.    Post test analytical studies will  be used to
              simulate the measured  connection behavior and to help  develop an analytical
              model that  could be  used for further  parametric studies.  The analytical 
              modeling will be coordinated with  prior and current U.S. research  projects
              concerned with modeling  the dynamic response of  composite  frame structures. 
                This is a project supported under  the year 1 program of the Civil 
              Infrastructure Systems (CIS),  solicitation NSF 94-154.  ***
