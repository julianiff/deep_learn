Abstract    :
              9520888  Venable  There are many questions in both pure and applied ecology for
              which an understanding of seed bank dynamics and seed age structure is
              critical.  These include an understanding of succession, extinction and
              colonization dynamics, revegetation policies, and weed management.
              Traditionally, the only way to determine seed bank age structure has been to
              follow seed cohorts for many years. This project will use new techniques
              involving Tandem Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (TAMS) to date modern seed banks
              with 14C. This technology, in conjunction with the variable levels of
              atmospheric 14C as a result of nuclear bomb testing which peaked in 1963,
              should permit accurate estimates of the ages of seeds produced over the last 30
              years. This procedure will be tested with seeds of a Sonoran Desert annual
              plant. The dating procedure will be calibrated with seed of known age and then
              utilized to age a carefully sampled seed bank of this desert annual. It is
              widely believed that long-lived seed banks play an important role in the
              ecology of desert annuals and desert annuals have played an important role as
              model organisms in the development of our understanding of adaptation to
              environmental variability and community dynamics in variable environments.
              Long-term demographic data are available for desert annuals at the study site.
              The long-term data will aid in the interpretation of the 14C dates, because
              differences in production of seeds over the last 14 years can be compared to
              their incorporation into the seed bank. Likewise, the 14C dates will aid in the
              interpretation of the long-term data by permitting estimation of the role of
              seed retention in population dynamics.    The research in this Small Grant for
              Exploratory Research proposal will lead to important breakthroughs in the
              development of technology that will permit in-depth understanding of long-term
              community dynamics and diversity. Seed bank age structure is critical in many
              habitats for many ecological questions, and TAMS 14C aging  of seeds for up to
              30 years of age would constitute a major methodological breakthrough.
