Abstract    :
                  9520821  MABRY  This award will contribute support to the doctoral
              dissertation research of a student at the University of Texas, Austin.  The
              award will provide funds for laboratory supplies for molecular sequencing and
              for travel to collect plants within the United States.  The study will
              investigate the origins of red-violet pigment types (anthocyanins and
              betalains) in the plant order Caryophyllales by superimposing this information
              for different families onto a cladogram or diagram of relationships of 
              families in this order of plants.  This cladogram will be derived from
              molecular sequence data for two regions of the chloroplast genome (rbcL and
              ndhF) and will allow testing of hypotheses about origins of the relatively
              unique plant pigment class of betalains.  %%%  This award will contribute to
              the research training of a young plant systematist in modern molecular
              systematic methods.  The study should contribute knowledge about relationships
              in the diverse plant order Caryophyllales and provide information about the
              origins of betalain pigments.  These floral pigments may constitute important
              signaling systems to attract pollinators and knowledge about their origins may
              prove important to studies of pollination biology.  ***
