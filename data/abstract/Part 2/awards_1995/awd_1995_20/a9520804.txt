Abstract    :
              9520804  Cheng  This project deals with a fundamental  problem which often
              arises in  intelligent engineering aimed at optimum  design of buildings and
              civil  infrastructure systems where multiple  variables and loading conditions
              are  involved. Optimum design means, among  other things, to maximize service
              life,  safety and functionality while  minimizing material use, labor, 
              maintenance,etc.    A critical step and requirement in the  process of
              multi-objective optimal  design is a computational algorithm  which could give
              consistent, stable  solutions to the complex optimization  formulation. In this
              project, an  innovative optimization technique,  namely, a genetic algorithm
              will be  developed for civil structural  applications under seismic condition. 
              This algorithm is based on the Darwinian  survival-of-the-fittest strategy by 
              eliminating unfit characteristics and  using random exchange through 
              reproduction, recombination (cross  over), and mutation.  Emphasis is placed 
              on formulation of n-parent uniform cross-  over operator and parallelization to
               achieve an emerging computing technique  for both global and robust optimum 
              solutions.  Other research efforts also  undertaken as a part of this research 
              include structural modeling of building  systems with mixed construction 
              materials, formulation of multi-  objective functions and constraints for 
              building structures, development od  optimum based design criteria for static 
              and earthquake load with/without control  systems, and assessment and
              improvement  of current optimum design algorithms.  ***
