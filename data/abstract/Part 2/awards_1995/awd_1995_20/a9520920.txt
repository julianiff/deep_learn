Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9520920    The objective of this effort is to synthesize
              site-localized organic molecules  such as conjugated aldehydes and ketones,
              imines, acetals, cyanohydrins, and chloroketones, at the acid sites in
              zeolites.  Aldehydes and ketones are adsorbed and exposed to reactive vapors. 
              Surface species are analyzed with carbon-13 magic-angle nuclear magnetic
              resonance and infrared spectroscopy.  Zeolite catalysts are synthesized and
              characterized with silicon-29 and aluminum-27 nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray
              diffraction, and sorption uptake measurements.    The compounds formed in this
              study are typical chemical intermediates that are presently produced using
              liquid acid catalysts.  Environmental considerations are forcing producers to
              shift to solid acid catalysts, such as those used in this study.  ***
