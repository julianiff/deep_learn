Abstract    :
              9520679  The  blue  oak  is  a keystone species in a  water  limiting 
              environment, and over much of its range in California,  this  tree  is  not 
              regenerating.   This  research  is  aimed  at  understanding  the  role  that 
              water  relations   play   in  determining  the  success of this tree.  The 
              research  will  compare vulnerability to drought-induced cavitation in  oaks 
              of  different ages.  It will determine the amount of genetic  variation  that
              exists in this trait, by comparing responses  of  seedlings produced by
              different parent trees.   Finally,  it will ascertain the importance of
              phenotypic plasticity in  modifying  response to different levels of moisture 
              stress.  The  research will increase understanding of the  mechanisms  and
              variability of response to drought induced cavitation in  woody plants. 
              Understanding of the phenotypic expression of  water-use traits, and knowledge
              of variation on temporal and  spatial scales should be of considerable value in
              developing  management  plans  for the conservation of  an  ecologically 
              important species.
