Abstract    :
                The objective of this project is to  study theoretical and practical issues in
               the  evaluation of general globel predicates and functions of  distributed
              software.  As an application of the techniques  of the research, the project
              will focus on  distributed  monitoring systems for fault tolerance. An example
              of  detecting a  global predicate arises in implementing the most  basic
              command of a monitoring  system: `stop the program when  the predicate is
              true`. To stop the program it  is necessary  to detect the predicate q, which
              is not a trivial task if q  requires access to the global state.    There are
              three components to the  project: theory,  algorithms and implementation. There
              are two questions that  will be investigated in terms of theory. First, the
              class of  global predicates  that are efficient to detect will be  classified.
              This will also entail studying  the limits of  efficient detection of global
              predicates. Second, a  predicate  logic which is suitable for efficient
              detection of  global predicates will be  developed.  After developing the 
              logic, efficient decentralized algorithms for  detecting  occurrence of logic
              formulas will be designed. This work  will be  based on the use of a
              centralized checker process  developed by the PI.  Finally, the decentralized
              algorithm  will be used to design an experimental  distributed  monitoring
              system.
