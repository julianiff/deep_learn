Abstract    :
              9520504  Frey    The Neutron Activation Laboratory in the Department of  Earth,
              Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS) at MIT is a  facility dedicated to
              the analysis of natural materials,  principally terrestrial rocks and minerals.
              The  instrumentation of this facility has been incrementally  updated, most
              recently in 1990, with the financial support  of NSF and MIT. This facility is
              used for the NSF-sponsored  geochemical research of Frey and colleagues and by
              a diverse  group of other U.S. scientists, including faculty and  students from
              other universities in the northeast and is  highly regarded by peers. This
              grant provides $29,730 as  partial support of the costs of replacing two
              semi-conductor  detectors which were purchased in 1979 and are at the end of 
              their useful life.  These detectors along with ancillary  electronics including
              high voltage supplies, amplifiers and  analog to digital converters (ADC's)
              will aid in improved  precision as well as guaranteeing the continuance of this
               facility's successful operation and service to the  geochemical community.
