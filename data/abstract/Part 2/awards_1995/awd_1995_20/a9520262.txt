Abstract    :
              9520262  Warlick    The University of Texas at Austin proposes to hold a
              "Workshop for Broadening Participation in Regional Affiliates Program," and is
              aimed directly at links to the NSF Supercomputer Centers and the MetaCenter
              Regional Alliances, two major programs of ASC.  In this regard, Austin is the
              logical representative of CASC, the Coalition of Academic  Supercomputer
              Centers, which has more than 20 members of state and regional academic
              supercomputer centers.  CASC has invited more than 75 like minded
              organizations, including NSF Engineering Research Centers and Science and
              Technology Centers, to work in shared areas forging stronger links to the major
              supercomputer centers, to strengthen the national information infrastructure.
