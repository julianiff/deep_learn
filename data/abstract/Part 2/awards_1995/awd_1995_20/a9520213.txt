Abstract    :
              In this project which is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and  
              Organometallic Chemistry Program, Dr. Joseph O'Connor of the University   of
              California, San Diego will pursue an investigation of the synthesis,  
              structural elucidation, and mechanistic aspects of formation and reaction   of
              metallacyclobutene complexes.  Dr. O'Connor has already discovered one   method
              that should produce a range of metallacyclobutenes of late   transition metals
              where there is a paucity of examples and even fewer   studies of reactivity. 
              Reactions to be studied include conversion of the  metallacyclobutenes to
              cyclopentadienes and other five-membered rings,   which are useful
              intermediates for organic synthesis, by reactions with   alkynes and olefins. 
              A novel photochromic effect that was observed in   the substitution reaction of
              phosphorus donors in one cobaltacyclobutene   complex will be examined by
              time-resolved spectroscopic methods.   This project involves fundamental
              investigations of the synthesis and   reactivity of a new class of
              organometallic compound known as   metallacyclobutenes.  The examples of
              interest for these studies contain   late transition elements.  The major
              objective is the development of new   synthetic methods that may be used in
              total synthesis of natural products   and their homologs.  Some of these may
              ultimately find application as new   pharmaceuticals.
