Abstract    :
              The PIs will continue comprehensive studies of mesosphere and lower 
              thermosphere aeronomy.  This program will utilize Incoherent  Scatter Radar
              (ISR) data and optical facilities of Arecibo  Observatory, a sodium/iron
              resonance lidar at Arecibo on a campaign  basis, and data analysis coupled with
              modeling/theoretical studies  conducted at Penn State.  The renewal grant will
              cover:  (1)  continued ISR/lidar observational and modeling investigations of 
              the relationship (or "coupling") between small-scale neutral  atmosphere
              structure, acoustic-gravity waves, tides and the  presence of sporadic metal
              and ion layers; (2) temperature  dependent chemistry; (3) the origin of the
              6-hour tide; (4) the  complex of newly observed short-period waves and ion
              layers in the  100-250km region; (5) the origin of the (sometimes complex) ion 
              layer structures in the 90-100km region and their relationship to  sporadic
              metal layers; and (6) apparent "convective" processes as  observed in the
              sodium and ion layers as well as in the  "background" ionosphere.***
