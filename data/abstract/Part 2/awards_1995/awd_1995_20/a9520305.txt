Abstract    :
              This award is made in the Environmentally Benign Chemical Synthesis and  
              Processing program and is funded by the Division of Chemistry and the   Office
              of Pollution Prevention and Toxics of the Environmental Protection   Agency.  
              In addition, the project includes collaboration with research   scientists at
              the Ridgefield, Connecticut, laboratories of Boehringer   Ingelheim Corporation
              and Los Alamos National Laboratories.  Mark J. Burk   of the Chemistry
              Department, Duke University, will develop chemical   synthesis and processing
              technologies using carbon-dioxide based solvent   systems for asymmetric
              catalytic reactions.  Asymmetric hydrogenations,   hydrogen transfer
              reductions, and aldol condensations will be   investigated.    Chemical
              industry uses large volumes of organic and chlorinated solvents   which present
              serious disposal or recycling problems.  The utility of   carbon dioxide as a
              replacement solvent for the manufacture of fine   chemicals will be examined in
              this project.  Asymmetric catalysis is a   method that offers energy-efficient
              access to enantiometrically pure   intermediates for the synthesis of chiral
              drugs and agrochemicals.    Performing asymmetric catalysis in supercritical
              carbon dioxide   effectively combines the advantages of both to reduce chemical
              release in   manufacturing.
