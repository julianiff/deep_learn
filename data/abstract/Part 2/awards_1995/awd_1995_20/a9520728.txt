Abstract    :
              9520728  Martin    Associations between fungal endophytes and grasses range from
              parasitic to mutualistic, and are ideal for studying the conditionality of
              interactions.  Frequencies of infected plants in populations can increase over
              time; this is often cited as evidence that the interaction with seed-borne
              endophytes is a mutualism.  The assumption is that relative fitnesses of
              infected and non-infected plants are constant.  If relative fitnesses vary, the
              interaction between grasses and fungal endophytes may be delicately balanced,
              and shift from mutualism to parasitism depending upon environmental factors
              affecting costs and benefits.  This project will test several factors that are
              hypothesized to affect the relative fitness of infected and non-infected
              plants.  These include the roles of associated herbivore abundance, plant
              resources, and fungal endophyte strain in determining the balance of costs and
              benefits to the plant.    Little is currently known about the extent of
              conditional outcomes in mutualisms, the mechanisms that determine outcomes, or
              the consequences of variation in outcome.  Without this information it will be
              difficult to address important questions about the ecology of mutualisms. 
              Since many plant species, including important agricultural crops, have
              associated fungal endophytes, understanding the mechanisms behind these
              mutualistic interactions also has considerable applied value.
