Abstract    :
              9520990  Ioannou  This project is concerned with the understanding of Hot
              Carrier Injection (HCI) in the next generation of scaled devices - the
              so-called silicon-on-insulator (SOI) devices.  These devices have become
              increasingly important for low-power integrated circuits and it is important to
              understand the basic reliability physics associated with HCI.  HCI is examined
              for SOI devices with a unique device structure which decouples the electron and
              hole contributions to device degradation. A new memory cell is proposed based
              upon opposite channel injection to provide the erase operation in SOI Flash
              Memory Cell.  ***
