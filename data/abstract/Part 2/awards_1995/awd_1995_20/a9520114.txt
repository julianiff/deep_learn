Abstract    :
                Description:   This project supports the participation of a delegation of
              eminent US scientists and engineers from academic institutes in a `Symposium on
              Science and Engineering Education in the 21st Century` organized by the
              American University in Cairo.  The meeting scheduled for April 9-12, 1995, has
              the following objectives: examining present and future trends in the use of
              high technology computer and multimedia applications in basic sciences and
              engineering education; identifying curricular changes to meet challenges of
              development; examining the state of-the-art and future trends in the theory and
              practice in basic science and engineering education; and discussing needs for
              life-long learning for continuous human development.  Seven US academics who
              have long experiences in S&E education and development are invited to
              participate to cover the areas of computer science, physics, mathematics,
              mechanical engineering, aerospace engineering, biology, and chemistry.  Several
              plenary lectures will be presented by these scientists and others from Europe
              and the Middle East.   A number of workshops are planned to demonstrate the
              latest software packages in the various scientific disciplines, with emphasis
              on interactive dynamic simulation techniques that link and integrate knowledge
              across disciplines.  The proceeding of the Symposium will be published, and
              will include the plenary lectures as well as selected presentations from
              participants.    Total participants are expected to number 400 to 500 and will
              include scientists from Egypt and from other Middle East countries in a wide
              range of science and engineering disciplines, and will also include
              representative from the industrial and business sectors as well as prospective
              employers of scientists and engineers.  A selected number of graduate and
              undergraduate students. will also be invited.
