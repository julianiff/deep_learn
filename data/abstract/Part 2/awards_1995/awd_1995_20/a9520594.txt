Abstract    :
              9520594  OSWOOD  The boreal forests of interior Alaska are an important global
              carbon sink, a significant forest and land resource, and are threaded by a
              large network of streams and rivers.  Permafrost has a profound influence on
              the ecology and hydrology of these forests and streams.  The PI's propose to
              study the influence of permafrost on exports of carbon, nitrogen, and
              phosphorus in soil and stream water in a boreal forest watershed.  Samples
              collected over a two year period will be analyzed for both organic and
              inorganic components.  These data will be combined with permafrost
              distribution, temperature and precipitation data to predict nutrient exports. 
              The development of this model will increase our understanding of the influence
              of discontinuous permafrost on carbon and nutrient flows between upland,
              wetland, and aquatic ecosystems in boreal forests.
