Abstract    :
              9520248  Betenbaugh  This proposal is on research to develop a better
              understanding of  programmed cell death (apoptosis) in order to use this 
              information for constructing more productive expression systems.   This
              involves research to: (1) determine the genes which suppress  the induction of
              apoptosis for several cell lines, and (2) clone  the genes and assess cell
              death in response to viral infection or  other environmental insults such as
              nutrient limitations and  exposure to toxic levels of by-products.  ***
