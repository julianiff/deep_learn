Abstract    :
              9520430  Ma  The proposal concentrates on the synthesis, characterization and
              application of the Jet-Vapor Deposited (JVD) silicon nitride film for an
              advanced gate dielectric in scale MOS transistors for future generations of
              integrated circuits.  The current  dielectric, SiO2, has served the
              semiconductor device community well in scaling channel lengths; however, as
              feature sizes move to submicron and nanometric dimensions there is a genuine
              concern about the need to address reliability issues associated with dielectric
              films.  A JVD process which uses a supersonic jet of helium carrier gas to
              transport vapor from the source to the substrate and because of the very short
              transit times there is little opportunity of gas-phase nucleation to take place
              in the deposition process.  These films show merit for advanced gate
              dielectrics for scaled MOS devices, storage capacitors for high-density DRAMS,
              and interpoly dielectrics for EEPROMs.  ***
