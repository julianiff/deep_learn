Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT    AST-9520463  Salzberg, S. L.    Astronomical image processing
              methods have been developed in the past several decades to a point of great
              sophistication, including facilities for image reconstruction and restoration
              (both for radio interferometry and the aberrated Hubble Space Telescope), image
              filtering, and object detection and classification.  This project is aimed at
              determining the feasibility of applying astronomical image processing
              techniques to low contrast digital images from other fields.  Digitized
              mammograms are similar in many ways to images of diffuse astronomical objects. 
              The challenge in analyzing mammograms is to identify clusters of faint,
              point-like objects called microcalcifications; the astronomical analog would be
              faint stars, or perhaps cosmic ray hits on a CCD detector, in a region of
              extended nebulosity.  Some initial experiments on mammograms are encouraging
              and this project will conduct a more systematic feasibility study.  ***
