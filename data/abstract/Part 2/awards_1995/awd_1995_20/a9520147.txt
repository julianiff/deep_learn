Abstract    :
              Abstract  9520147  S.L. Girshick, U. of  Minnesota    A new method for creating
              nanostructured coatings or bulk materials by using a hypersonic plasma particle
              deposition will be investigated.  The objectives of the research are to develop
              a plasma expansion process for high-rate synthesis of nanoparticles of hard
              non-oxide ceramics with minimum in-flight agglomeration, investigate the
              hypersonic impaction process for powder collection and in-situ compaction, and
              characterize the particles and corresponding deposits.   Models will be
              developed for particle nucleation and growth, in-flight agglomeration and
              hypersonic deposition, and then applied to the experimental conditions in the
              laboratory.      The project is technologically relevant to manufacturing
              nanoparticles and advanced ceramics coatings.  ***
