Abstract    :
              9520256  Dagenais    This award establishes a joint Industry/University
              Cooperative  Research Center for Optoelectronic Devices, Interconnects, and 
              Packaging between the University of Arizona and the University of  Maryland. 
              The Center will focus its activities in the areas of  optoelectronic devices,
              interconnects, and packaging.  Both  universities will join as equal partners. 
              The University of  Arizona will contribute its pioneering experimental an
              theoretical  activities in nonlinear photonics, optical switching devices, 
              semiconductor laser research, and interconnects.  The University of  Maryland
              will contribute its strength in the areas of  optoelectronic device processing,
              semiconductor lasers and  semiconductor laser amplifiers, optical
              interconnects, silicon  bench technology, lasers and semiconductor laser
              amplifiers,  optical interconnects, silicon bench technology, characterization,
               and packaging.  The merging of the two groups will lead to a new  found
              synergism as the interaction between Center participants is  built up and as
              the research goals converge.  The participation of  faculty members from each
              institution in each Centers' projects  will strongly be encouraged.    Fourteen
              companies and Government Agencies are becoming members of  this joint
              university Center.    The initial research agenda at the two research sites
              will address:    1) Optic Interconnect Development for Advanced Processing and 
              Network Systems; 2) Holographic Interconnects for Optical Neural  Networks and
              Other  Applications; 3) Theory of Semiconductor  Nonlinearities; 4)
              Semiconductor Lasers and All-Optical Switches;  5) Near to Mid-Infrared Optical
              Parametric Oscillators; 6) Novel  Optoelectronic Devices; 7) Waveguide
              Waferboard Project; 8)  Semiconductor Laser Amplifiers:  Packaging and
              Applications; 9)  Characterization and Modeling of Acousto-Optic Correlators;
              10)  Process and Device Characterization.    An undergraduate student will be
              supported for one year with funds  provided by the Women, M inorities, and
              Disabled Engineering  Research Assistants Program.  The student will be
              involved in  measurements of solid state dye lasers for preparing compact, low-
               cost lasers for different regions of the spectra.
