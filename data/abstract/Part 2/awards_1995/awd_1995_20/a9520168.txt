Abstract    :
              Abstract - Barkey - SGER    There are a number of technological applications of
              intrinsically conductive polymers.  The unique advantages of electrochemical
              fabrication of intrinsically conductive polymers include the ability to
              reproduce surface structure with high fidelity.    Electrochemically fabricated
              conductive-polymer microfilaments will be evaluated for potential application
              as sensors.  The principle of the application is the dependence of polymer
              conductivity on oxidation state and the doping effect of absorbed compounds. 
              The evaluation will focus on the differential response of polymer conductivity
              to complete and incomplete combustion gases, where the latter act as reducing
              agents which should lower the conductivity of the filaments.  Filaments of poly
              (3-methyl thiophene) of diameters less than 100 nanometers have been fabricated
              by the PI by electrooxidative polymerization across a highly ordered poly(tetra
              fluoroethylene) thin-layer.  The polymer grows in the form of filaments which
              follow the microstructure of the PTFE layer, producing a regular array or
              grating.  The small size of the filaments allows very rapid diffusive response
              of the material.  This exploratory project will determine if the principle of
              operation can be applied to detection of incomplete combustion products in flue
              gases, and lay a foundation for further development and application of this new
              structure.
