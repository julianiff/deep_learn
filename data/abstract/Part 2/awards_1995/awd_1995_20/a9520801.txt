Abstract    :
              Sherman  9520801                              Abstract    Evolutionary theory
              suggests that behavior should be  adjusted to maximize an individual s fitness.
               Species in  which individuals switch between distinct behavior patterns  offer
              an opportunity to test this hypothesis.  This  dissertation improvement
              research will contrast the  alternative behaviors of territoriality and
              wandering in  male water striders. This is a powerful model system because  it
              is possible to watch single individuals over the course  of repeated behavioral
              decisions. The research will  determine why alternative behaviors are
              maintained in the  population, and identify the factors that cue switches 
              between behaviors.  Behavioral observations of mating  success and
              electrophoretic analyses of paternity will show  how territoriality and
              wandering affect number of offspring.  Experimental manipulation of social,
              individual, and  environmental variables will be combined with behavioral 
              observations to determine what causes behavioral switches.  The research will
              increase understanding of the bases of  behavioral decisions and the evolution
              of alternative  behaviors.
