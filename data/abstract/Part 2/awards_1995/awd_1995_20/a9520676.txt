Abstract    :
              POWER  9520676   The proposed research will link patterns of genetic variability
              in barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) with ecological interactions between the 
              BYDV, and the virus' grass hosts and aphid vectors.  We will measure genetic
              variability using serological and sequencing surveys of natural virus
              populations.  Ecological interactions will be assessed with greenhouse
              experiments designed to distinguish between two ecological hypotheses
              explaining genetic structure in populations of the virus:  genetic subdivision
              occurs as a result of different colonization opportunities for the virus or
              genetic subdivision reflects variability in the probability of a colonization
              resulting in a new infection.  This research will improve our understanding of
              ecological factors affecting the evolution and epidemiology of barley yellow
              dwarf, a major disease of crop plants, and contribute to our understanding of
              the ecology of plant pathogens in natural communities.  It will aid in
              management of this disease by providing information about the relative
              importance of different wild host species as sources of virus inoculum for crop
              plants.
