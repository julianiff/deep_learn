Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Alvin Weiss    This is collaboration with Professor A. M. Pak of the I
              nstitute of  Organic Catalysis and Electrochemistry of the Academy of Sciences
              of the Republic of Kazakhstan.    The goal of this work is to control the
              stereospecifity of olefin isomers produced by the hydrogenation of long-chain
              acetylenes.  Copper and copper-palladium impregnated on alumina, magnesia, or
              silica are studied and stereoselectivity is correlated with dispersion and
              surface acidity.  Metal-exchange zeolites are also used as catalysts.  Quantum
              chemical (CNDO/2) calculations are used to guide selection of conditions and
              catalysts that might show the desired selectivity.    Stereoselective reduction
              of acetylenes (alkynes) is valuable for a number of systems including
              production of monomer and a wide variety of biologically active molecules from
              flavor ehancers to antibiotics.  In the present study, the precursors of
              pheromones useful for insect control are prepared.
