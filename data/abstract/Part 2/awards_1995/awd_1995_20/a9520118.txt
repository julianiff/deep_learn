Abstract    :
              Over the past two decades, the look of state legislatures has changed
              dramatically.  Between 1975 and 1991 the number of women state legislatures
              more than doubled.  The number of African American state legislators increased
              by an even greater proportion.    This dissertation research seeks to examine
              the effects of the introduction of new groups on legislative behavior and
              outcomes. The general question to be addressed by this work:  What evidence is
              there that new groups change not only the way a state legislature looks but
              also the way a legislature acts?  Specifically, it focuses on the impact of
              black and women state legislators on legislative activities and products.  A 6
              state database will be created and will contain information on the legislator,
              on bill content and disposition, and on legislative districts.  Specific
              research questions include:  Do females and racial minorities focus on
              different policy areas than do white male legislators?  Are they more
              supportive of certain policies than their counterparts?  Are they as successful
              in getting their bills passed?  Do blacks and women engage in coalition
              building to a greater or lesser extent?  Are particular stages of the
              legislative process a focus of activity by these newcomers?  What is the impact
              of constituency on the behavior of these legislators?
