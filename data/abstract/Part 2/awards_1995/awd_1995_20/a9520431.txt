Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the use of chiral alkylation strategy using  
              2-trifyloxy esters for the synthesis of amino acid derivatives and   peptide
              isosteres.  A second area of pursuit will be the use of the   concept of
              differential reactivity to prepare densely functionalized   molecules without
              the use of extensive protection-deprotection schemes.    Third, 
              2-nosyloxy-3-keto esters   will be used to develop methodology for the
              preparation of spiroketal   lactones.  The thrust of the total project is to
              afford efficient methods   for the synthesis of molecules having interesting
              biological properties.   With this renewal awrad. the Synthetic Organic Program
              is supporting the   research of Dr. Robert V. Hoffman of the department of
              Chemistry at New   Mexico State University.  Professor Hoffman will focus his
              work on   developing methods for the enantioselective synthesis of amino acid  
              derivatives, peptides, peptide isosteres and densely functionalized  
              compounds.   Finding improved methods for the preparation of these   classes of
              materials is desireable due to the potential for discovering   interesting
              bioactivity.
