Abstract    :
              9520409  Sen       This project will involve petrographic, electron probe, and 
              ion probe work an a suite of spinal Iherzolite and plagioclase  Iherzolite
              xenoliths from the Pali vent on Oahu, Hawaii.  These  rocks represent a wider
              depth range of the lithosphere that lost  its mid-ocean ridge basalt melts some
              90 million years ago.  Thus  a 90 million year old residual melting column will
              be  reconstructed.  The goals of this research are to (a) decipher  vertical
              elemental variations in the oceanic lighosphere beneath  Oahu, (b) compare this
              information with those obtained from  abyssal peridotites, (c) test existing
              melting models of  lithosphere information and (d) obtain new insights on
              mid-ocean  ridge basalt melting.  ***
