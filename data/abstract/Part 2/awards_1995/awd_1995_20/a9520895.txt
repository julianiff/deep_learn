Abstract    :
              The long lifetime of Xe polarization and its strong  solubility in blood combine
              to allow the use of polarized Xe  for diagnostic imaging of parts of the human
              body.  In  conventional biological MRI, magnetic resonance signals are 
              produced by weakly polarized proton spins found in  biological tissues.  Proton
              spins are weakly polarized by  large magnetic fields.  What is needed for
              higher contrast  and better specificity in biological MRI and spectroscopy is 
              a benign substance that can quickly enter tissues of  interest, provide
              magnetic resonance signals that are  sensitive to the local physical and
              chemical environment,  and then leave the body.  This proposals is for work on 
              investigations of MRI enhanced by the use of optically  polarized 129Xe or 3He
              to follow on promising suggestions  that laser polarized Xe will provide just
              such a substance.  The proposal is an SGER request for the production of 
              polarized atoms followed by the study of invitro tissue  samples and small
              mammal models.  The study will be extended  to humans after the SGER grant is
              ended.
