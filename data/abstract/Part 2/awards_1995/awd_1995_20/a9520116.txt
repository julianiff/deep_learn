Abstract    :
              9520116  balantekin  This grant provides 5,060 to the Gordon Research Conference
              on  Nuclear Physics, to be held at the Tilton School, Tilton, New  Hampshire,
              July 23-28, 1995.  The requested funds will be used to  provide support for 11
              young scientist to attend the conference  whose theme will be "QCD in Nuclear
              Physics and Astrophysics", an  extension of the concept that was extremely
              successful in 1991  and 1993.  The program will emcompass a broad array of
              topics in  nuclear physics in which fundamental theory of the strong 
              interaction, QCD, plays a significant role.  New experimental  results on the
              spin structure functions of the neutron, lattice  QCD, relativistic heavy ion
              reactions, neutrino physics, the role  of nuclear physics cosmology, and other
              topics will be available  for discussion.  ***
