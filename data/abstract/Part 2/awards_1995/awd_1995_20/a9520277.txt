Abstract    :
              9520277  Lee  To reduce the damages to reinforced  concrete columns and to
              prevent  their collapse due to strong  multidirectional ground motions,  the
              use of concrete filled tubular  (CFT) columns is an attractive  option.  In
              1992, an NSF Workshop  for U.S. Japan Cooperative Research  on Composite and
              Hybrid Structures  recommended that the CFT column  system be one of the four
              research  areas to be emphasized in  earthquake engineering research.  In
              recent years a large number of  cyclic loading tests on CFT  specimens of the
              circular type has  been conducted.  These tests were  primarily subjected to
              combined  compression and torsion.  Results  showed that CFT members can
              deliver  high ultimate strength with large  ductility.  This project will 
              develop appropriate mathematical  models through both analytical and 
              experimental investigations to  quantify the composite actions of  CFT columns
              under cyclic and  earthquake loading considerations.  In the experimental
              program, the  scale or volumetric effects and the  loading rate effects will
              both be  considered, shaking table tests of  three-dimensional CFT columns 
              system will be carried out during  the second half of this three-year  study.  
               This is a project supported under  the year 1 program of the Civil 
              Infrastructure Systems (CIS)  solicitation, NSF 94-154.  ***
