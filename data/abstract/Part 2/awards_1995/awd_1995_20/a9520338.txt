Abstract    :
              SBR-9520338  Kate A. Berry, Principal Investigator (PI)  University of Nevada,
              Reno       Native Cultures and Water Distribution: A Comparative Analysis of
              California, Ecuador and New Mexico    This Research Planning Grant for new
              women researchers will examine the historic evolution of government policies
              and practices that influence the distribution of water to American Indians and
              will trace the spatial patterns of water distribution for American Indians from
              the onset of Spanish colonization to the present for three regions: coastal
              California, sierran Ecuador, and northern New Mexico.  The research uses a
              comparative analysis to contribute to knowledge of the geographic differences
              in actual water distribution practices over a four century period as well as
              expand understanding of natural resource use and distribution relations between
              native cultures and European migrants.
