Abstract    :
              9520797  Womack    It has been hypothesized that short-period comets and giant
              comets  (like Chiron and SW1) share a common origin in the Kuiper Disk located 
              10-100 Astronomical Units (AU) from the Sun.  Interestingly, recent 
              observations indicate that these two populations of Kuiper disk comets  may
              exhibit very different physical and chemical behavior. For example, 
              short-period comets are small in size ranging from 1-10 km in diameter,  and
              are predominantly water ice and so sublimate mostly within 1-2 AU  from the
              Sun; while the giant comets are > 10 times larger than  short-period comets,
              sublimate at larger distances from the Sun (r > 5  AU) and hence are thought to
              be comprised of some other highly volatile  ice (quch as methane, carbon
              monoxide or Nitrogen).  Current models of  the protosolar nebula indicate that
              the chemical behavior of the  dominant carbon-bearing molecules carbon
              monoxide, formaldehyde,  methanol, and hydrogen cyanide are very sensitive to
              the physical and  chemical processes that occurred during solar system
              formation.   Therefore, the relative abundances of these species in primitive
              icy  bodies, such as comets, are expected to place powerful constraints on 
              comet-formation models.  Comparison of these molecular abundances in  the two
              populations of comets are, therefore, vital in testing models  of the Kuiper
              disk region of the solar nebula.  Observations of the  rotational spectra of
              emissions from carbon monoxide, formaldehyde,  methanol and hydrogen cyanide
              will be obtained of comets using  millimeter and submillimeter wavelength
              telescopes.  Complementary  observations will be obtained and optical imaging
              techniques will be  used in interpreting the spectra.  A fundamental goal of
              this research  is to make an exploratory comparison of carbon chemistry in
              several  short-period comets with that in two large, distant comets.  This work
               will search for chemical differences between these two groups to  examine
              whether or not they are really two distinct divisions , or  instead are better
              described by a continuous distribution of different  chemical compositions. 
              The work will help establish the feasibility of  the proposed observations,
              determine which molecules are the best for  testing models, and determine how
              often the large continuously active  comets need to be observed in order to
              significantly constrain models  of solar system formation.
