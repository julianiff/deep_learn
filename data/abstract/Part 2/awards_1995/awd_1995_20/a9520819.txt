Abstract    :
              9520819  ANDERSON  Groundwater enriched in nitrate may be a significant
              non-point nutrient source to near-shore ecosystems.  The importance of this
              nitrogen source will depend upon the site of discharge and biological
              transformations that occur during transit of groundwater from uplands across
              the coastal margin.  Intertidal wetlands are conspicuous occupants of
              intertidal areas throughout the eastern coast of North American.  As
              groundwater contacts anaerobic marsh sediments, the nitrate present may undergo
              denitrification to nitrogen or dissimilation to ammonium.  Depending upon which
              process occurs, nitrogen will either be conserved within or exported out of the
              system.  There is no method currently available to simultaneously quantify and
              differentiate between dissimilation and denitrification.  This work proposes
              using stable isotope technology along with conservative tracers to determine
              rates of dissimilation and denitrification and relate measurements to seasonal
              organic carbon fluctuations and net marsh community production.
