Abstract    :
              9520575  Brown    Nest predation has long been recognized as the cause of the
              majority of failed avian nesting attempts.  Because of its impact on
              reproductive success, nest predation has been hypothesized to structure avian
              communities and contribute to suspected population declines of many species. 
              This research uses and extends the methodology of foraging theory and the
              framework of predator-prey interactions to investigate the foraging ecology of
              a dominant mammalian nest predator, the raccoon.  The research links the
              foraging behavior of raccoons to the direct impact of nest predation, and
              indirect interactions among nesting birds.  Specific objectives include:
              1)quantifying the impact of nest predation on three woodland bird species, 2)
              determining the indirect interactions mediated by shared predation, and 3)
              investigating the habitat associated risks of foraging in raccoons and the
              consequence for nesting birds.    This research will enhance our basic
              understanding of the direct and indirect impact of nest predation on bird
              populations, as well as the role of nest predation in structuring avian
              communities.  Results will also be applicable  to issues related to ecosystem
              management and conservation of biodiversity.  These may be especially important
              given the recent decline in the population sizes of many bird species.
