Abstract    :
              9520361  Ward     The peace dividend is an attractive, yet, elusive subject. 
              The  search for security benefits led Israel and Egypt to sign the  Camp David
              peace agreements in 1979.  In addition to immediate  benefits accruing from the
              recognition of borders and its right  to exist, Israel should receive
              longer-term benefits from  decreases in defense spending; as money better
              invested in other  parts of the economy pays off.  As well, in addition to
              benefits  accruing from Israel's final withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula, 
              Egypt may receive similar longer-term benefits, now that it has  agreed on
              peace with a former enemy.  In the years since the Camp  David agreements,
              peace, however lukewarm, has been achieved,  major security concerns have been
              addressed, and Egypt has been  accepted back into the Arab fold, perhaps
              leading to additional  bilateral peace treaties with Israel.  When do the
              longer-term  welfare benefits, the peace dividends, become obvious.    Whether
              one looks at the global, developing countries, or  regional samples, Israel and
              Egypt have witnessed better than  average growth rates and bigger cuts in
              defense spending.  Should  these trends have arrived so quickly, or are they
              part of a  larger time frame which includes earlier years?  There are  clearly
              connections between peace and economic prosperity in  Israel and Egypt.  This
              research will uncover and describe these  links, show how they have been
              achieved, project what the future  holds, and suggest how lessons learned in
              Israel and Egypt might  be applied in warring dyads elsewhere.  ***
