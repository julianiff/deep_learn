Abstract    :
              9520978  Sokal       Quantum field theory is the central tool employed to study 
              problems, elementary particle and nuclear physics as well as many  problems in
              astrophysics and condensed matter physics.       With the advent of high speed
              computers, many problems in  quantum field theory can be modeled and examined
              by computer  simulations.  This research proposes to study such problems as 
              well as to develop techniques for more efficient computer  simulations.  ***
