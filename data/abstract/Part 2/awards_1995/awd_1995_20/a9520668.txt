Abstract    :
              9520668  MADDISON   The forces that have lead to the great diversity of life on
              earth are poorly understood. This study will compare the genetics of two
              species of jumping spiders in an attempt to understand the processes driving
              speciation. These two species, isolated on the mountain ranges in southeast
              Arizona, appear to be evolving at a very rapid rate.  Their habitat was
              continuous between the mountain ranges as recently as 10,000 to 14,000 years
              ago. In this short period, males of one species have diverged considerably. 
              Another closely related species also shows some divergence, but not nearly to
              such a striking degree.  Mitochondrial and nuclear genes will be examined in
              order to reconstruct the genetic forces that have promoted morphological
              divergence.   The genetic data will be used to test new theories developed in
              the past ten years. one of these, coalescent theory, attempts to reconstruct
              the past genetic structure of a species by examining a gene genealogy of that
              species. The genealogy of mitochondrial DNA has been used in attempts to infer
              the history of humans, but we know little about how mitochondria evolve in
              general. This study will add to our knowledge of how mitochondria evolve, which
              may influence how we interpret future genetic data with this molecule.   This
              study allows a unique opportunity to examine speciation while it is still
              occurring. The mountain ranges in southeast Arizona are habitats that have
              become fragmented from each other due to climatic changes. They may provide a
              model that will lead to better understanding of how populations have responded
              to range fragmentation in the past. Such understanding will be useful in
              developing conservation strategies to deal with widespread habitat
              fragmentation due to human disturbance.
