Abstract    :
                    With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. DiMare of the
              University of California, Santa Barbara, will elaborate the reaction dynamics
              and parameters for the enantioselective-titanium catalyzed Diels-Alder
              reaction.  If successful, the results of the investigation will provide future
              investigators with a rational basis for catalyst design and improvement.  This
              proposal is in an area which is both fundamental and significant for chiral
              chemistry objectives.    The ability to catalyze a chemical reaction is
              important since it reduces raw material usage and waste products.  To catalyze
              an enantioselective process is more significant because the appropriate
              three-dimensional molecule can be generated.  This is useful for academic
              knowledge as well as for industry and the fields of medicine and
              pharmaceuticals chemistry.
