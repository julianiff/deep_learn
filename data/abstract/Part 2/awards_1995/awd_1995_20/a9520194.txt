Abstract    :
              This dissertation research will examine a novel legislative strategy for
              environmental policy.  In the wake of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, federal
              legislation mandated two Citizen Advisory Councils (CACs) to help prevent
              accidental releases of oil into Alaskan waters by providing a citizen oversight
              and advisory function.  Soon thereafter state legislation in Maine and
              California mandated two more advisory councils with similar functions.  These
              four CACs are a novel collaborative effort between citizens, government, and
              industry to help prevent coastal oil spills and pollution.  The objective of
              the proposed research is to evaluate the effectiveness of the advisory councils
              in achieving these preventive goals and to identify the factors which
              contribute to their successful operation.  The research methods consist of
              structured interviews with selected CAC participants (citizen members, industry
              representatives, and public officials), a mail survey administered to all the
              CAC participants, and analysis of relevant documents.  This research project is
              intended to provide a much-needed empirical contribution to the study of CACs
              that work with government and industry in the area of environmental risk
              management.
