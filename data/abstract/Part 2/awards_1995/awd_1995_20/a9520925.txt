Abstract    :
              This dissertation research will examine advanced medical technology as a
              cultural practice through an analysis of intensive care for newborns in
              contemporary American society.  In neonatal intensive care, sophisticated
              technological attempts to minimize infant mortality confront medical ethics'
              critical attempts to rehumanize high-tech medical practice.  The project
              focuses on paradoxes arising in this context:  saving lives at the cost of high
              degrees of morbidity and handicap, caregivers' feeling that they have little
              control over their medical practice but pressing for aggressive medical
              treatment, the participation of medical ethics in the same dehumanizing
              relations of abstraction that it claims to oppose, and of medical practice in
              questioning the implications of the technologies on which it depends.  Through
              examining historical and current  neonatal practices in France, where the field
              has its roots, and their adoption and modification in the United States, the
              study will identify and analyze the appearance of a technological imperative
              central to understanding neonatology and neonatal medical ethics in current
              social processes, as participants in a reinvention of human reproduction in a
              form that grants autonomy to machines, hides the social production of
              prematurity, and affirms the ritual value of human life.  This grant supports
              travel, material and equipment needed to undertake archival, documentary and
              ethnographic field research in France and the United States.
