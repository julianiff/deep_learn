Abstract    :
              9520108  Moehle  On the morning of 17 January 1995,  a strong earthquake shook
              the  central portion of Japan.  At this  time, the details of the effects of 
              the earthquake are unclear.  However, the death toll has risen  above 5000, and
              there is evidence  of widespread disruption of the  civil  infrastructure,
              including  damage and collapse of thousands of  engineered structures.  Both 
              geotechnical and structural issues  appear to have contributed to the  observed
              damage. While there are  many differences between the  conditions in Japan and
              those in  the United States, it is clear that  this tragic event holds many 
              lessons for U.S. construction  practices.  Many of the lessons  will be lost
              unless efforts are  made as soon as possible to gather  perishable data.   
              This project provides support  through NSF's SGER award mechanism  to assemble
              a team of researchers  from the  United States to travel  to the epicentral
              region, gather  data, prepare a written report, and  coordinate with other
              groups from  the United States having similar  missions.    The team focus on
              the following two  specific areas:         (a)  Building Structures, and      
              (b)  Bridge Structures    A technical report on the  reconnaissance team's
              findings will  be prepared and distributed.
