Abstract    :
              9520218  Yura  Design guidelines will be developed  for connections between
              concrete  filled steel tubular columns and  steel beams in large structural 
              systems suitable for seismic  applications.  The main variables  included in
              the research are square  and round tubes and various degrees  of strengthening
              beyond the plain  filled tube detail.  The  strengthening will concentrate on 
              utilizing the strength of concrete  within the panel zone.    At least 8
              reasonably full size  test specimens will be designed and  tested, first
              monotonically, then  cyclically.  The object will be to  develop practical
              connections for  seismic area that minimize welding  and stiffener details. 
              Since there  are currently no design guidelines  for such connections, the
              research  is vital to the development of  hybrid and composite civil 
              infrastructure systems.    This is a project supported under  CIS solicitation
              "Research on  aomposite NSF - 94-154.  ***
