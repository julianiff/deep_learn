Abstract    :
              Antonovics  9520793   To evaluate the appropriateness of using a kin
              selectionist framework to explain worker behavior, the origin(s) of sex ratio
              differences between colonies of the ant, Leptothorax curvispinosus, will be
              elucidated.  Oviposition sex ratios will be determined by flow cytometry (a
              novel application of this technology) and compared with the following year's
              adult sex ratios.  A marked disparity between oviposition and adult sex ratios
              would suggest that workers may indeed manipulate brood sex ratios to their
              inclusive fitness benefit; possible mechanisms will be investigated
              experimentally.   The possible role of historical distorter invasion will be
              explored through computer simulation and genetic models.  Initial simulations
              of this "distorter invasion hypothesis" suggest an interpretation of
              eusociality that differs significantly from the kin selectionist explanation,
              in essence arguing that invasion creates predictable, oscillating mate
              limitations, and that worker behavior is an adaptive response under such
              circumstances.
