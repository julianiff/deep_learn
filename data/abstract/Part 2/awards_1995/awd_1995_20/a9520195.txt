Abstract    :
               This project involves the dissertation research of a student from Emory
              University.  The study involves the tension between ideology and behavioral
              practices in a community of religious practitioners in a city of south India. 
              Practitioners of this sect sacrifice their male reproductive organs to their
              religion, cross-dressing and conducting religious rites to confer fertility
              upon their patrons who hire them to conduct religious rituals.  The efficacy of
              the rituals is spiritually connected to the practitioner's renunciation of
              their own sexuality   Preliminary research has shown that a portion of the
              religious practitioners act as commercial sex workers  Using a combination of
              surveys and intensive interviews as well as ethnographic observation, the
              student will examine the tension between the sexual renunciation and the
              income-producing practices of individual members of the community as these
              affect their social status.     This project is important because it increases
              knowledge about this important region of the world, as well as advances our
              understanding of basic processes relating community social status, personal
              income and ritual purity in this non-Western setting.
