Abstract    :
              As the most species-rich communities on earth, tropical rain forests are a
              particular challenge to theories of species coexistence. Although many
              hypotheses have been advanced, the mechanisms responsible for coexistence in
              diverse forests have not yet been clarified. The over- arching goal of this
              research is to evaluate evidence for mechanisms of coexistence in rain forest
              trees, with focus on the adult and seedling stages. The seedling stage may be
              critical in the maintenance of diversity, and direct evidence of dynamic
              processes, including density dependence, can be gathered relatively quickly at
              the seedling stage, even for long-lived trees. Major fruit-masting events occur
              in Bornean rain forests only once every 6-7 years, on average. A major mast is
              about to occur, as evidenced by mass flowering of many tree taxa at the study
              site over the last few months. Thus, the specific objectives of this research
              are to (1) establish the recruitment, survival and growth rates of seedlings
              resulting from the mast, and test for the effects of adult conspecific density
              on seedling recruitment a nd growth, and (2) test for density dependence among
              seedlings in growth and mortality, using observational and experimental studies
              on a range of spatial scales.  This research will provide a vital understanding
              of dynamics in tropical rain forests, with the added benefit of capturing data
              during a year with unusually abundant seed production. In addition, this 
              research will expand our global understand of factors that maintain high
              species richness in tropical  forests.
