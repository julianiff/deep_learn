Abstract    :
              9520501  Anderson  Research will be conducted to develop critical enabling 
              technologies and systems for precise, minimally invasive  delivery of localized
              treatment for tumors and other soft  tissue lesions.  The goal to register 3-D
              rendered CT images  with real-time fluoroscopy to identify and locate tumors in
               the liver and to use this information to direct a remote  center-of-motion
              robotic manipulator for fast and accurate  targeting of the lesion and to
              deliver a preplanned pattern  of localized therapy using percutaneous
              approaches.  Success  with this research would replace more costly surgery or 
              provide a therapeutic alternative to individuals in whom  surgery would be
              contraindicated.    This technology has a significant potential to reduce
              health  care costs and to improve the quality of life for a very  large number
              of patients.  3D image-guided surgery and  therapy is a challenging and
              important new field of medicine  that holds enormous promise to benefit the
              patient while  simultaneously reducing the cost of doing the procedure.  ***
