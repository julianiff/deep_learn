Abstract    :
              9520800  Terborgh  Interspecific competition plays an important role in
              structuring many communities, but similar patterns may also be produced by
              specialization. In avian communities many species nest in tree cavities, a
              chronically limiting substrate. Some tropical forest birds may avoid
              competition for tree cavities by nesting in the termitaria in active colonies
              of arboreal termites. This dissertation research will test two alternative
              hypotheses: (1) termitarium nesting birds specialize on termitaria and prefer
              to use them independent of the availability of tree cavities, and (2)
              termitaria currently provide a refuge from competition for limited tree
              cavities. These hypotheses will be addressed by using nest box experiments and
              determining the natural occupancy rates of termitaria and tree cavities.
              Behavioral data will be used to determine if birds receive advantages by
              nesting in termitaria instead of tree cavities.    This research will provide
              insight into how the presence of a substrate used for a single, specialized
              life history stage (nesting) influences community structure and provides a
              framework for understanding how termitaria affect avian structure and species
              coexistence.
