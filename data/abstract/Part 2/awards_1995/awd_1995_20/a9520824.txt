Abstract    :
                  9520824  PIERCE  This Dissertation Improvement Award will provide materials
              and supplies for a student's doctoral dissertation research.  The student's
              project involves systematics of the metalmark butterflies (Insecta:
              Lepidoptera: Riodinidae) whose larvae have fascinating developmental biologies
              in association with ants that tend them.  A phylogenetic analysis will attempt
              to establish higher level relationships for this family.  That analysis will be
              based on molecular sequence data and contrasted with results of a recent
              (Harvey, 1987) PhD thesis phylogenetic investigation that utilized
              morphological character systems.  A robust phylogeny presenting relationships
              among major lineages of Riodinidae will allow testing of hypotheses relating to
              the biology of this group such as origins of mimicry and number of times that
              association with ants has developed in the Riodinidae.  %%%  This award will
              enhance the training of a graduate student in modern molecular systematic
              methods.  The project will contribute to knowledge of the biodiversity of a
              group of insects that exhibit very interesting biologies and behaviors in
              mutualistic associations with ants.  ***
