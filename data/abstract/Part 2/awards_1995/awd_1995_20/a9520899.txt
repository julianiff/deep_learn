Abstract    :
              9520899  Fitzgibbon    This award will provide partial support for the
              Conference on High Speed   Flow Fields to be held at the University of Houston
              in November 1995.  The   conference will bring together applied mathematicians,
              fluid dynamicists,   aerospace engineers, and others to address a blend of
              issues, including   partial differential equations of fluid flow,
              aero-thermodynamics, modeling,   computation, simulation, and experimentation.
              Major topics will include   mathematical modeling of flow models, recent
              developments in   computational fluid dynamics, data obtained from various
              space missions,   and air breathing propulsion technology.  Contributed paper
              sessions and   poster sessions will be included and a proceedings will be
              published.  The   conference will include leading researchers in this field
              from the   international community and participants will include both junior  
              researchers and senior experts.
