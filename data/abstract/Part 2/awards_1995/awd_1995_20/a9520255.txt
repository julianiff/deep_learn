Abstract    :
              9520255  Dagenais    This five-year continuing award provides funding to
              establish an  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
              Optoelectronic  Devices, Interconnects, and Packaging at the University of 
              Arizona/University of Maryland.    Fourteen companies and Government Agencies
              are becoming members of  this joint university Center.    The initial research
              agenda at the two research sites will address:   1) Optic Interconnect
              Development for Advanced Processing and  Network Systems; 2) Holographic
              Interconnects for Optical Neural  Networks and Other  Applications; 3) Theory
              of Semiconductor  Nonlinearities; 4) Semiconductor Lasers and All-Optical
              Switches;  5) Near to Mid-Infrared Optical Parametric Oscillators; 6) Novel 
              Optoelectronic Devices; 7) Waveguide Waferboard Project; 8)  Semiconductor
              Laser Amplifiers:  Packaging and Applications; 9)  Characterization and
              Modeling of Acousto-Optic Correlators; 10)  Process and Device
              Characterization.    The Co-Directors and their colleagues are well known
              researchers  and are qualified to run this Center.    This project has been
              coordinated with Dr. Deborah Crawford,  Division of Electrical and
              Communications Systems.    The Program Manager recommends the University of
              Maryland be  awarded $50,000 for the first year of a five-year continuing
              award.   All subsequent years will be funded at the $50,000 per year level.    
              Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager and/or  the Division
              Director of the of the Engineering Education and  Centers Division will review
              the progress of the Center on a number  of renewal criteria, including the
              following:  1) the extent to  which the industry/university interaction is
              developing; 2) the  extent to which the support base is developing; and 3) the
              extent  to which a robust research program is developing.  If the review is 
              satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommends support for the  next period
              of this continuing award.
