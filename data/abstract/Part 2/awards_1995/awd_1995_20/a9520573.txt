Abstract    :
              9520573  Magee    This award is a collaborative three-year project to be studied
               jointly at both the New Jersey Institute of Technology's  Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center for Hazardous Waste  Management and the Queen's
              University Environmental Science and  Technology Center (QUESTOR) at Belfast,
              Northern Ireland, UK.  The  study is designed to improve the effectiveness and
              efficiency of  water processing facilities that use flocculation for
              purification.    The QUESTOR researchers have been funded by a consortium of
              local  industries to design, build and operate a pilot water treatment  plant
              to devise new approaches to the use of flocculation additives  to extend the
              range and efficiency of flocculative cleaning.    The I/UCRC studies will focus
              on some fundamental aspects of the  fluid dynamics of flocculators.  By
              determining the spacial  distribution of local velocity gradients in a number
              of  flocculation vessal configurations, the velocity gradient time  integral
              for a generic floc particle moving in the flocculator can  be determined.  This
              can be used to accurately quantify the value  of this key parameter for a
              number of flocculation configurations  to determine floc aggregation and
              breakage.  The study should  elucidate the fundamental fluid dynamic aspects of
              flocculation for  process improvement in water purification.
