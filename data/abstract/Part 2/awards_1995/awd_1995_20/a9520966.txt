Abstract    :
              Francis Diebold  University of Pennsylvania  SBR-9520966     The proposal
              consists of two projects. The first project proposes the development of methods
              for estimating and evaluating forecasting models when the loss function is
              asymmetrical. Most estimation methods in current use are optimal for a
              quadratic loss function, but not for others. In particular, asymmetric loss
              functions will generally call for the use of biased estimators. The second
              project extends frequency domain methods to the estimation of parametric
              models. The P.I. proposes using bootstrap procedures to find confidence tunnels
              for estimated spectra.
