Abstract    :
                This two year fellowship for postdoctoral study will allow Dr. Huntley-Fenner
              to obtain training in cognitive psychology at the University of Illinois at
              Champaign-Urbana.  A central problem in cognitive science is to discover the
              nature of our capacity to organize perceptual input such that it may be stored
              and recruited to guide action.  There is considerable evidence that infants
              have a sophisticated understanding of the physical world.  Such capacities
              implicate the existence of well-developed physical models.  Dr.
              Huntley-Fenner's research is directed at the question of whether the physical
              models infants construct are based on the properties of objects or whether they
              are more general.  These are other issues in visual cognition will be addressed
              during his postdoctoral tenure.  The physical distinction between objects and
              non-solid substances reflects a deep conceptual distinction between kinds that
              are quantified as individuals (anything that can be counted) and those that are
              not.  Mastery of this distinction is crucial to our knowledge of language and
              our capacity to count.
