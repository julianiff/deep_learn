Abstract    :
              This is a collaborative proposal with Drazen Prelec of the Massachusetts
              Institute of   Technology (SBR-9511131).  The PIs propose to investigate the
              lack of personal   consistency in patience across choice situations.  The
              authors hypothesize that traditional   economic discounting models are
              inadequate to explain such inconsistency.  Instead the   PIs propose that
              temporarily high discount rates are promoted by situations in which   transient
              factors influence the desirability of choice alternatives.  Such factors
              include   drive states and emotions, for example. The following four hypotheses
              encompass their   theory.  First, changes in immediate transient factors have a
              greater impact on behavior   than changes in delayed transient factors. 
              Second, our actual response to a transient   factor is greater than
              anticipated.  Third, we underestimate the impact of future transient   factors
              on our future behavior.  Fourth, people underestimate the impact of transient  
              factors on the behavior of other persons.  The authors propose to do four
              studies, each of   which will manipulate a transient factor.  The basic
              paradigm is to offer participants a   choice of an inferior option now or a
              superior one later.  The PIs will observe how the   choice behavior is
              influenced by varying the transient motivation for the options.
