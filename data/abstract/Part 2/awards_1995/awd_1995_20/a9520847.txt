Abstract    :
              9520847  McKenna  This research involves determination of the evolutionary
              relationships among fossil and recent hedghogs.  Morphological, dental
              morphometrics and biogeographical evidence will be evaluated.  The proposed
              research will yield significant new phylogenetic information regarding the
              interrelationships of members of this mammalian family.  In addition the study
              will provide an evaluation of different methods for recovery of the best
              estimate of phylogemy (taxon congruence vs. total evidence approach) and
              consideration of the dispersal corridor for hedgehogs from the Old World to
              North America.  A final consideration will be the power of a phylogemy to
              predict climate change.
