Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  OPP-9520948      This proposal will facilitate participation by Alaska
              Natives in a workshop entitled "Indigenous Peoples and Arctic Social Sciences:
              Building on the Alaskan Experience" to be held in conjunction with the Second
              Congress of Arctic Social Sciences (ICASS II) in Rovaniemi, Finland, 28 May -
              June 4, 1995. The workshop will focus on ethical issues in social science
              research, intellectual property rights, repatriation, cultural revitalization,
              indigenous knowledge systems and education. A major long-term goal is to
              promote meaningful research and education partnerships between indigenous
              peoples and Western science and education communities in the Arctic and
              internationally.     ***   ??
