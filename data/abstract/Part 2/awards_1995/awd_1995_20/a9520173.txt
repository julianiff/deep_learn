Abstract    :
              9520173  Hellawell    This research effort is directed towards improved
              capability  for  predicting  the  properties  of  manufactured  items   from  
              the  microstructure of the base material and the processing path  that  was 
              used  in production.  To accomplish this it is necessary  to  describe  the 
              microstructure in quantitative terms; accordingly,  image   analysis  systems 
              and  the  interpretation  of  acquired  microstructural information are
              examined to numerically  describe  microstructural   assemblies.   A   majority
                of   metal   alloy  microstructures,  such as those derived from 
              solidification  and  casting, are not easily described in terms of Euclidean
              geometry.  For  these  cases  fractal  analysis  can  be  employed  to  make 
              numerical statements about the microstructure, however chaotic it  may  be.  
              The  feasibility of this approach has been  shown  for  distributions  of 
              graphite in graphitic cast  irons  and  should  apply to many other complex
              microstructures which presently  defy  quantitative  numerical assessment.  The
              research involves  model  alloy systems and actual industrial products,
              starting with  cast  irons and aluminum-based engine castings.  Ford Motor
              Company and  General  Motors Corporation  view this research as  an  important 
              area  of pre-competitive technology and are providing significant 
              contributions to the program.  %%%  While   this   program  is  academically 
              stimulating,   it   has  considerable  industrial potential for predictive 
              automation  of  manufacturing processes.  ***
