Abstract    :
              The theory of measurement, which provides rigorous methods for assigning numbers
              to and developing various numerically based mathematical structures for
              empirical phenomenon, has generated in the last twenty years many new
              fundamental ideas that are applicable to science -- particularly experimental
              sciences that use sophisticated mathematical models.  This research exploits
              and extends these recent developments by (1) directly applying them to areas of
              behavioral science that employ formal models of human judgment and decision,
              and (2) by developing new methods of measurement and new mathematical models
              that take into account empirical facts that contradict important, widely
              applied models of judgment and decision.  Because of the wide use by the
              military, the government, and business of complicated decision strategies that
              have human judgments and the results of human decisions as inputs, the results
              of this research are expected to provide a basis for improving such decision
              strategies.
