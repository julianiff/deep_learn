Abstract    :
              9520832  NEI   DNA sequences are molecular fossils from which one can learn  the
              history of genes and organisms as well as the mechanism of  evolution.  For
              this reason, a large number of investigators are  generating DNA sequences for
              many genes from various organisms  from bacteria to humans.  However, as the
              amount of DNA  sequence data increases, it becomes difficult to extract the 
              evolutionary significance from these data without use of proper  statistical
              and computational methods.  Current statistical and  computational methods are
              inadequate to handle large-scale  data and to solve newly arising evolutionary
              questions.  It is also  important to study patterns of nucleotide substitution
              and other  types of DNA changes to provide a solid biological basis for any 
              statistical and computational method.  Furthermore, evolution of  some genetic
              systems such as reproductive isolation between species  still remains
              mysterious, and it is important to study these  problems at the DNA level.    
              The first project refines statistical methods for estimating the number of
              nucleotide or amino acid substitutions (evolutionary distance) between
              different sequences.  These statistical methods are important not only for
              estimating evolutionary times of different organisms but also for constructing
              phylogenetic trees.  The second project is concerned with the understanding of
              the mechanism of positive Darwinian selection observed in a number of
              gamete-recognition genes in mammals, abalone, and sea urchin and their possible
              roles in the evolution of reproductive isolation between different species. 
              This study will contribute to the understanding of speciation mechanisms at the
              DNA level.
