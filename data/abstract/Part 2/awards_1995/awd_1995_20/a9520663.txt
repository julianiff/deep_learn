Abstract    :
              9520663  LODGE  This proposal will test the hypothesis that the relative
              importance of benthic and pelagic primary production in lake food webs is
              dependent on lake trophic status and is regulated by fish.  Previous results
              indicate that benthic and pelagic organisms are strongly linked through trophic
              relationships and form important conduits for carbon and nitrogen flow.  Fish
              structure benthic and pelagic communities and are important vectors of organic
              material and nutrients between benthic and pelagic habitats.  A stable isotope
              method will be used to integrate this research into a comprehensive
              understanding of benthic-pelagic trophic links.  The stable isotopes will be
              used to determine the trophic links between pelagic food webs, benthic
              macroinvertebrate communities, and benthic algae.
