Abstract    :
              9520246 Ossiander  Abstract      This proposal is directed towards reaching a
              further understanding of the probabilistic structure of the
              Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass model.  Two complementary approaches are
              indicated.  The first approach involves the use of results about the
              fluctuation of Gaussian processes to explain the variability of the partition
              function and the convergence of the free energy of the S-K spin glass. 
              Preliminary results suggest that this approach is quite useful.  The second
              approach involves investigating the weak convergence of weighted sums of
              dependent random variables.  This will have immediate consequences for the
              understanding of the S-K spin glass model, as its partition function can be
              represented as the moment generating function of a weighted sum of dependent
              random variables.    The work of the investigator on this proposal is directed
              toward finding relatively simple mathematical models which provide an accurate
              description of the complicated probabilistic behavior of so-called "spin glass"
              models.  Spin glass models provide a theoretical description of those magnetic
              systems for which the interaction strengths (coupling constants) are random. 
              These systems are found in structurally disordered materials with behavior
              depending on a threshold transition temperature.  The randomness of the
              interaction strengths arises because of impurities within the materials.  The
              theoretical work proposed here promises to provide a better understanding of
              the variability in the behavior of these materials when they are synthesized
              under different temperature regimes.  This research draws on recent advances in
              the study of random processes.
