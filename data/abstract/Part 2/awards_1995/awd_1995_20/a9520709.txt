Abstract    :
              SBR-9520709    Doctoral Dissertation Research: "Bacteriology and the Medical
              Inspection of  Immigrants."      This project examines the impact of
              bacteriology on immigration policy in the U.S.  More particularly, it looks at
              the intersection of bacteriology, immigration, and nationality through the
              historical examination of medical inspection at American borders, the points at
              which the nation defended and defined itself.  Bacteriology provided a modern
              medical language of contagion and personal pathology that was used to define
              disease in terms of national safety.  The pathological characteristics ascribed
              in particular immigrant groups were used in a subtle and complex calculus for
              defining not simply which diseases or conditions should be excluded, but which
              peoples should be excluded from the "national body."    This project will trace
              the thesis that bacteriology was essential to the construction of disease,
              immigrant, and nation through three overlapping components.  First, this
              project will document differences in medical inspection and exclusion by
              statistical analysis of annual immigration data for all U.S. ports,
              supplemented by case studies of selected ports along the East, West, and Gulf
              Coasts.  Second, the project describes bacteriology's role in shaping
              scientific and social understandings of disease and its carriers through an
              analysis of the disease categories used for the medical diagnosis and exclusion
              of immigrants.  Finally, the project places bacteriology in an international
              context by exploring its comparative significance in controlling immigration to
              Canada and Mexico and its role in international negotiations regarding these
              respective borders.
