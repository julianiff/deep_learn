Abstract    :
              9520860  Holloway      A new multianvil press frame will be installed in the
              high-  pressure laboratory at Arizona State University (ASU).  This  is a joint
              use facility for studies in mineral physics,  geochemistry and experimental
              petrology, and studies in  materials synthesis and properties.  The major
              purpose of  this acquisition will be to augment the existing multianvil 
              facilities to include the force range between 300 and 1000  tons, enabling
              higher pressure experiments to be performed,  and allowing larger samples to be
              obtained.  Specifically,  the 1000 ton capability of the frame will be used
              both to  extend the available pressure range at ASU to approximately  27 GPa at
              temperatures up to 2800 C, and to increase the  sample size in experiments at
              lower pressures.  The extended  range of synthesis pressures will be important
              in  preparation of both known and novel high pressure phases,  such as garnets,
              perovskites and ultra-high pressure  glasses, and in pressureinduced
              amorphization studies in  materials synthesis and mineral physics.  The larger
              sample  size will be utilized for materials characterization and  properties
              measurements, and for design of multienclosure  capsule environments, which are
              important in design of  controlled redox state petrology and in materials
              synthesis  experiments.  For Earth sciences, the new press will allow 
              ultra-high pressure geological studies to the P-T range of  the transition-zone
              and lower mantle, with improved control  of the run environment to reproduce
              chemical conditions  within the Earth.  The principal focus will be on 
              controlling oxygen fugacity and H2O content in mantle  systems. Fabrication and
              installation of the press is  projected at 6 months. Scientific projects will
              proceed for  the remainder of the time, and the press will then be  operated as
              a permanent piece of equipment in the ASU high-  pressure facility.      ***
