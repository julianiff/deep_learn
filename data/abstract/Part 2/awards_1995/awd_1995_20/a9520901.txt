Abstract    :
              This professional development fellowship will allow the recipient to study and
              conduct research in science and technology studies (STS) and science policy at
              the Center for the Study of Science in Society at Virginia Polytechnic
              University.  The primary research project during the fellowship is the
              development of a policy history of the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC). 
              The demise of the SSC project is potent indication that the days of science as
              an `endless frontier,` with an indulgent government patron, are over. 
              Furthermore, the demise highlights many divergent values and attitudes which
              separate the physics and policy communities.  This research project has begun
              with an examination of government documents and the published literature on the
              SSC.  The fellow will use the fellowship support and travel funds from the
              Center for the History of Physics of the American Institute of Physics to work
              with several historians and philosophers of science who are studying the
              history of the SSC and to conduct oral history interviews of senior physicists
              who were involved with the project.  The oral histories will enrich the SSC
              narrative already described in the literature and permit analysis of the
              different values and attitudes which led to its demise.  Undertaking this
              research will allow the fellow to develop expertise in STS research and policy
              analysis.  An intensive program of graduate courses at the University will
              allow him to survey the basic themes in STS, including the historical and
              social science research methods which are a critical part of the SSC research
              project.
