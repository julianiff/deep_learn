Abstract    :
              9520636  Bickers  Computational research will be conducted on the properties  of
              correlated electrons in solids within the framework of  self-consistent field
              approximations.  Such approximations  constitute the natural generalization of
              Hartree-Fock  theories to systems with strong interactions and large 
              electronic fluctuations, including the cuprate high-  temperature
              superconductors.  The self-consistent field  approach provides a
              semi-analytical alternative to numerical  techniques like exact diagonalization
              or simulation.  The  research proposed concentrates on the extension of the
              self-  consistent field approach to (a) lattice models with  nontrivial
              unit-cell structure, including multi-orbital  models describing the cuprate
              superconductors; and (b)  lattice models with infinite-range Coulomb
              interactions.  In  addition, a program of study is proposed to improve the 
              treatment of nonlocal vertices in general two-particle  correlation functions. 
              %%%  New computational techniques will be investigated to deal  with systems of
              electrons which interact strongly and for  which existing methods are not
              applicable.  Of particular  interest, these new techniques will be applied to
              the  problem of understanding high-temperature superconductors.  ***
