Abstract    :
              9520971  Stucky    The key structure-property relationships of technologically 
              useful materials have their origins first at the nucleation  stage in the
              embryonic collective assembly of atoms or  molecules, and secondly in the
              organization of distinct  organic/inorganic nanophases to form sometimes 
              architecturally elaborate composite configurations. This  research is directed
              towards these two fundamental  processes: kinetic controlled atomic and
              molecular assembly  and the use of interface dynamics to control structure, 
              electro-optic properties, thermal transport, and stability  in composite
              structures. The synthesis, modification,  structural characterization, and
              study of structure-property  relationships will be specifically investigated
              for three  types of materials: (1) nanophase electrooptic and magnetic 
              materials with tunable nanostructure dimensions and physical  properties; (2)
              meso (15-200 0A)-structured biphase  composites and porous materials; and (3)
              active framework  porous phases. A continuing goal is to develop the 
              methodology for constructing molecular sievelike or  mesoporous phases with
              nonlinear active or conducting  frameworks that might reversibly interface with
              molecular  adsorbates.  %%%  The primary significance of this research is in
              the  development of a basic understanding of the nanostructural  design of
              3-dimensional composite and porous phases. The  potential technological
              applications of these materials  include air separation, catalysis, composite
              materials with  high mechanical strength, flexibility, and
