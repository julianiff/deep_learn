Abstract    :
              The project is to host a conference to provide a forum on user centered
              evaluation for people involved in  the creation or management of digital
              libraries of all kinds.  The impetus for the conference arose  from the desire
              of sponsors and awardees associated with the six NSF/ARPA/NASA Digital Library 
              Initiative (DLI) projects to improve the effectiveness of the evaluation
              programs associated with the  projects.  At the first joint meeting of project
              participants, the Evaluation Working Group  recommended organizing a conference
              such as that described here. Upon further discussion, that  recommendation
              gained the support of DLI participants and sponsors, and led to this proposal.
              There is  the need for a methodological plenary of those involved in digital
              library projects.  It is beneficial  to find out how others are collecting and
              analyzing data, framing problems, what is working and what  has proved to be a
              dead end.  It is important to gather together people for such a conference just
              as  major digital library initiatives are getting underway; because of the
              interdisciplinary nature of the  work no regula rly scheduled scholarly
              conference specifically focusses on usage in this way.
