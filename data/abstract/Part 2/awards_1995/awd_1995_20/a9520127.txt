Abstract    :
              This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
              Washington University-St. Louis on the effects of women's land tenure security
              on agricultural productivity in Kenya.  The student, a native speaker of the
              local language, will conduct a survey of agricultural practices and output on a
              randomly selected set of 120 households after participant observation and
              in-depth ethnographic fieldwork to learn the important variables and issues
              which affect farm productivity.  The hypotheses to be tested involve the
              assumption that the greater the degree of women's security about land the more
              productive their farming will be.  This research is important because aside
              from training students in economic anthropology the knowledge to be gained will
              advance our understanding of causes of variations of productivity in African
              agriculture.  This information will be useful to local and international
              planners as they develop programs to solve the problem of food production in
              Africa.
