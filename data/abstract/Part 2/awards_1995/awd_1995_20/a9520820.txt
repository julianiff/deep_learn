Abstract    :
              9520820  HASTINGS   Population biologists have developed models of population
              growth that are designed to predict the fate of fragmented populations, but
              these models have not been tested.  Such tests require data on the original
              conditions and the ultimate fates of real fragmented populations. If a set of
              populations that were fragmented in the past can be identified, and we can use
              models to predict whether each should be persisting today, a comparison of
              observed and predicted persistence can determine model reliability.   According
              to fossil evidence, a set of at least 14 populations of pika (a small mammal)
              was isolated on mountaintops in the Great Basin at the end of the last ice age
              (about 7500 years ago). Since then, some of these populations have gone
              extinct.  Pika live in a habitat created by freeze-thaw processes. With the
              retreat of the glaciers and the rising snowline, pika habitat within each
              mountain range was fragmented. Many aspects of this animal's ecology allow
              reasonable estimates of the condition of these populations when they were
              originally fragmented. Thus, models to predict the persistence of these
              populations can be developed.   The proposed research will gather the data
              necessary to develop these models.  The spatial distribution of pika habitat
              fragments on each mountain range and the movement of individuals between
              habitat fragments will be calculated.  These data will be applied to models
              similar to those used in current conservation.  Natural landscapes are being
              fragmented by development, often adversely affecting native populations. In
              order to plan development that it is compatible with the persistence of natural
              populations, we must be able to reliably predict population persistence under
              various patterns of habitat fragmentation.
