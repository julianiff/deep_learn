Abstract    :
              9520469  Gilliam    Human activities have greatly fragmented the landscape, and
              as a result, critical habitats are often isolated.  While it is generally
              considered desirable to reconnect such isolated habitats by means of corridors,
              little is known about the movement of animals through corridors.  The goal of
              this study is to investigate the properties of a river corridor that may
              facilitate or retard the movement of a fish between tributaries.  In the study
              system a predatory fish divided the watershed into two zones: a lower zone in
              which the predator is common in the river but not adjoining tributaries, and an
              upper zone in which the predator is absent.  The research will test three
              hypotheses about how the predator, physical structure of the river, and
              seasonal floods can interact to promote or retard movement of the prey fish
              along the river corridor connecting tributaries.  The hypotheses will be tested
              by: (1) a large marking experiment with fish in the upper and lower zones of
              the watershed, in which movement will be followed through wet and dry seasons,
              (2) a study in an experimental stream facility, on-site, in which predators and
              physical structure can be manipulated, and (3) a comparative genetic analysis
              of the populations in the tributaries in the upper and lower zones of the
              watershed.    By focusing on how physical and biological properties of
              corridors can work to facilitate or retard movement of an organism through a
              corridor, this project will contribute to our future ability to design
              realistic corridors reconnecting habitat fragments.  Therefore, the research is
              applicable to conservation of species and management of biodiversity.
