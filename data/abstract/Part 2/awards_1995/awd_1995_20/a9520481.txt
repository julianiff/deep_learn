Abstract    :
              The Cleveland Collaborative for Mathematics Education has developed a three-year
              program to  support four integrated education and research postdoctoral
              fellowships in mathematics.  This  initiative brings young research
              mathematicians into direct contact with elementary and secondary  mathematics
              teachers, students and parents of the Cleveland Public Schools.  The
              postdoctoral  fellows do research under the auspices of one of the following
              institutions of higher education  participating in the Collaborative:  Case
              Western Reserve University, Cleveland State University,  John Carroll
              University; they work under supervision of the Collaborative on education
              projects  in the Cleveland City Schools.
