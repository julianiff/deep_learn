Abstract    :
              This RPG in the Organic Dynamics Program to Professor Brazdil of John   Carroll
              University will address the dynamics of aromatic iodination   reactions. This
              is a new variation on the traditional methodology which   is both more
              efficient and more environmentally friendly in that it   generates less toxic
              waste. The mechanism for this new process is unknown   and the PI plans to
              bring as many modern techniques as possible to bear   on the problem of
              understanding the pathway. If successful, the   methdology that the PI
              establishes may well be applicable to other   electrophilic reactions. 
              Electophilic substitution of iodine for hydrogen on an aromatic nucleus   is an
              important step in the synthesis of organic compounds which are of   interest
              and use in the medical field. Iodination is the preferred   pathway as
              chlorination and bromination are more harsh which results in   degradation of
              substrate. This study will help understand the reaction   parameters which
              govern the efficiency of the process. Thus, this   investigation should provide
              scientists with the knowledge to use the   procedure more efficiently and in
              doing so, reduce the amount of toxic   waste products.
