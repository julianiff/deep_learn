Abstract    :
              Spilhaus  9520236     This action provides partial support for operational
              expenses of the XXI General Assembly of the International Union of Geodesy and
              Geophysics (IUGG), July 2-14, 1995 at the University of Colorado in Boulder. 
              The Assembly will be hosted by the U.S. National Committee for IUGG on behalf
              of the U.S. geophysics community, and is being organized by the American
              Geophysical Union (AGU).  The IUGG General Assembly is held every four years;
              it was last held in the USA in 1963.   The General Assembly is a collaborative
              effort with the seven constituent associations of the IUGG:  International
              Association of Geodesy (IAG), International Association of Geomagnetism and
              Aeronomy (IAGA), International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS),
              International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences (IAMAS),
              International Association of the Physical Sciences of the Ocean (IAPSO),
              International Association of Seismology and Physics of the Earth's Interior
              (IASPEI), and International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the
              Earth's Interior (IAVCEI).   The Assembly will facilitate communication among
              scientists from many different countries and representing a variety of related
              disciplines.  It will also serve as a forum for planning new international
              programs, for informing scientists from developing countries about new findings
              and techniques, and for reporting and evaluating research accomplished since
              the last Assembly.
