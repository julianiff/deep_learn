Abstract    :
               Federal financed academic Science and engineering research and development
              expenditures at universities and colleges reached $11.1 billion in FY 1992
              (NSF, 1994).  Industry-sponsored R&D expenditures at universities and colleges
              reached $1.3 billion, and such support has been growing by over 20% per year
              throughout the 1990s (NSF, 1994).  Cohen, Florida, & Goer (1994) estimated that
              over 12,000 university faculty members and 23,000 doctoral level researchers
              were involved in university-industry research centers in 1990, for total
              funding of $4.12 billion in research and related activities.  Yet, despite the
              large university investment in such centers relatively little is known about
              their formation, management, involvement of faculty and students, effectiveness
              of operations, impediments to successful functioning, industry relations and
              characteristics associate with center performance.   It has been argued by
              Geiger (1990) that research centers and institutes have been the decisive
              factor in the postwar expansion of the university research system and have
              taken a leading role in developing big science research projects.  More
              recently, our own survey (Stahler & Tash, 1992; Tash & Stahler, 1992) of the
              fastest growing research universities in the 1980's suggests that centers are
              particularly important as a catalyst for major increases in research funding at
              universities since they help concentrate resources in targeted areas.   This
              study is a survey of a sample of 75 plus of the 150 largest research
              universities to clarify issues surrounding industry-based research centers. 
              The 150 universities will be stratified into three groups based on their total
              R&D expenditures for FY 1992: 1-50, 51-100, 101-150 to sample various sizes of
              research universities.  Within each stratum of fifty, a random sample of 25
              plus universities will be selected.  The study will explore a variety of issues
              associated with the formation, and effective functioning of centers within the
              university environment.  these will include such areas as the contribution to
              the educational mission of the university, discovery of useful knowledge for
              industry and other sponsors, conflict areas with academic departments and
              central administration, advantages to sponsors to sustain collaborative
              relationships with centers, the extent of real interdisciplinary collaboration
              evidenced, advantages and disadvantages for faculty both junior and tenured to
              participate with centers, incentives for research staff, and other benefits to
              the university, government, and industry by involvement with centers.   This
              study represents an extension of the study conducted by Cohen et al. (1994) and
              our prior survey (DuCette, Stahler, & Tash, 1993; Stahler & Tash, 1992; Tash &
              Stahler, 1992), and is guided by our conceptual work described in our paper in
              the Journal of Higher Education (Stahler & Tash, 1994).
