Abstract    :
              This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
              the University of Pittsburgh studying the effects of industrialization on
              households in a Malaysian village.  The student  will examine the impact of
              young women's factory employment on other household members, including the
              reorganization of households activities to compensate for losing women's labor,
              the potential contributions of cash and goods from the women's wages, the
              potential change in the household members' control over resources and abilities
              to call upon village social networks for resources.  Three groups of households
              will be studied: those with a currently factory-employed woman, those with
              factory-age women who never worked in factories, and those with former factory
              workers who returned to participate in the village economy.  This research is
              important because aside from improving the US' expertise about this important
              part of the world and advancing the social scientific capacity of our society,
              the knowledge to be gained will help policy makers design programs to
              ameliorate the harmful social effects of this sort of factory employment.  As
              the global market expands this type of employment will increase in the
              developing nations, and advances in our understanding of its social effects in
              the home-places of the factory laborers will be important in facilitating
              beneficial effects of such employment situations.
