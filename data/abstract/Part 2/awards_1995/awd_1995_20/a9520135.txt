Abstract    :
              This project will analyze 14C data to study long term changes in  solar
              activity, as it relates to terrestrial climate.  There are  two pertinent
              components of solap activity:  the solar wind and  irradiance.  The solar wind
              modulates the production of 14C and  irradiance forces the carbon cycle.  This
              project will investigate  both measurements and theory.  Measurement of decadal
              or bidecadal  samples prevents observation of high frequency changes in solar 
              activity such as the 11-year cycle or short-lived phenomena such as  14C
              production by solar flares.  Hence, it was decided to measure  the C isotopes
              in annual tree rings.  The project will measure 195  samples to complete work
              on the Oort and Wolf Solar Minima and the  intervening Medieval Solar Maximum. 
              Additional measurements would  be made to further resolve questions concerning
              the Schwabe cycle  during the Maunder Minimum.  Theoretical work would
              concentrate on  analysis of the new data and continued study of data from the 
              10,000 year data bank.  Efforts would be made to deconvolute the  solar wind
              and irradiance components of 14C variance in order to  achieve a better
              understanding of the Sun's role in modulating the  production of 14C and
              forcing of climate.  Plans include further  study of the 14C-climate
              correlation.***
