Abstract    :
              9520282  Spacone  The main objective of this  project is to develop a set of 
              realistic models for the  nonlinear static and dynamic  analysis of composite
              frames.  A full comprehension  of the  behavior of composite  structures is
              still to be  achieved.  The behavior of  composite members involves  complex
              phenomena such as the  partial bond transfer between  steel and concrete
              subjected  to cyclic loadings.   The  ability to understand and  model this
              behavior is  important for the evaluation  of existing civil  infrastructure
              systems as well  as for the design of new  structures.    A novel frame element
               formulation based on the  flexibility method of  structural analysis will be 
              made:  The new formulation is  effective in modeling the  nonlinear response of
               reinforced concrete frames  subjected to seismic inputs.  The new formulation
              offers  several advantages over  classical stiffness  formulations.  The new 
              formulation will be applied to  formulate new member models  for composite
              beams and SRC  columns.  These models will  include the effects of partial 
              bond between steel and  concrete under large element  deformations.  It will
              also  consider both nonlinear  material and geometric  effects.  A small series
              of  experimental tests on SRC  columns will be performed to  better understand
              the behavior  of  composite columns and to  calibrate the new analytical 
              models.  The proposed models  will be validated through a  set of correlation
              tests,  using  advanced identification-  optimization techniques.  Finally, a
              set of parametric  tests on small scale composite  frames under both
              quasi-static  cyclic loadings and input  ground motions will be  conducted.   
              The flexibility-based models  investigated here in this  project will lead to a
               reliable assessment of the  state-of-health and safety of  existing civil
              infrastructure  systems.  The new models can  be used as a research and 
              practical tool for attaining a  better understanding of the  complicated
              behavior of  composite frames, wh ich can  eventually lead to the  development
              of improved design  procedures.    This is a project supported  under the year
              1 program on  the Civil Infrastructure  Systems initiative NSF 94-145.  ***
