Abstract    :
              9520859  STRATTON   We are studying the variation in growth and the timing of
              reproduction in species of Potentilla in response to a gradient in the timing
              of snow melt in alpine environments.  We ask whether the observed variation
              results from phenotypic plasticity or genetic differentiation.  Experiments
              will manipulate the timing of snow melt which determines length of the growing
              season.  Reciprocal transplant experiments and plant density manipulations will
              determine whether adaptation to sites of one snow melting regime are
              ineffective in other types of regimes.  The responses of broad-ranging versus
              more restricted species will be compared to determine how variation in growth
              and reproduction restricts species boundaries.   Our results will increase our
              understanding of the importance of species-level variability in responding to
              environmental change.  More specifically we will determine how alteration of
              snow-melt regimes due to climate change could lead to sustained phenotypic
              responses, shifts in distribution limits, or local extinctions in alpine
              plants.
