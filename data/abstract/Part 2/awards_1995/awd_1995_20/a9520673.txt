Abstract    :
              9520673    Within  populations,  there is often  wide  variation  among 
              individuals.   This  variation may be adaptive,  because  it  allows  different
              individuals to use subsets of the  habitat  to  which  they are functionally
              best suited.  This research  addresses  two  questions  regarding  individual 
              variation.  First,  do locomotor performance and body shape covary,  and  do 
              individuals  that differ in shape select  parts  of  the  habitat  in  which
              their performance is best?  Second,  what  are  the  relative  roles  of
              genetics  and  environment  in  shaping  individual  morphology?   The  model 
              system  is  a  population  of  fence lizards that utilize multiple  habitat 
              types and show significant differences in morphology between  individuals.  The
              research questions are addressed through a  series  of  descriptive and
              experimental studies.  Locomotor  performance on a variety of substrates will
              be measured, and  covariance between performance and shape variables  will  be 
              determined using multivariate statistics. Siblings  will  be  raised  in
              structurally different habitats, and in different  food  level  and  thermal 
              regime combinations  to  separate  genetic  and  environmental influences on 
              body  form.   The  research  will reveal the adaptive significance of variation
               within  a  population, as well as the factors  that  produce  that variation.
