Abstract    :
              9520704  KERFOOT  Groundwater exchange across the bottom of lakes plays a
              crucial role in the structure of the benthic community at this interface. This
              project will utilize a novel in situ chamber designed to determine the
              importance of groundwater fluxes on benthic communities and processes. The
              chamber allows free exchange of water, or the chambers allow blockage of this
              exchange across this dynamic interface. Translocation experiments will be
              performed with these new chambers to determine how nutrients delivered by
              groundwater influence the biota at the benthic interface and how this process
              affects within-lake biodiversity.
