Abstract    :
              Professor Branka Ladanyi is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and  
              Computational Chemistry Program to continue her theoretical work in the   area
              of solvation and reaction dynamics in molecular liquids and   molecular
              clusters.  She will use a combination of formal theory and   computer
              simulations to study the factors which influence solvation.    Instantaneous
              normal mode analysis will be used as a means of describing   the molecular
              events contributing to the short time dynamics of   solvation.  This tool will
              be used to study the dependence of solvation   on the solute-solvent
              interactions resulting from solute electronic   transitions and from solvent
              and solute vibrational degrees of freedom.    Systems involving hydrogen
              bonding liquids, such as water and alcohols,   will be studied to investigate
              the role which solute-solvent hydrogen   bond formation plays in solvation
              dynamics.  The question of the influence of solvents on the dynamics and
              outcome of   chemical reactions is of central importance to chemistry, given
              that most   chemical reactions in nature and in chemical industry occur in the 
               presence of solvents.  Ladanyi's research will help to gain a better  
              understanding, on the molecular level, of the factors which determine the   way
              chemical reactions are influenced by the presence of solvent.
