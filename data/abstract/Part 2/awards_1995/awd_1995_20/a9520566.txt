                      Alarm calls are vocal signals given by animals when they  detect
              predators.  Alarm calls are potentially costly,  because they may attract
              predators.  The questions of how  such signals function, and how they evolve,
              are intriguing.  Alarm calls given by nonhuman primates are of particular 
              interest because they provide clear evidence of semantic  communication outside
              of human language.  This research has  three objectives.  The first is to
              examine the current  function of alarm calls, and to elucidate their evolution.
               The second is to examine the semantic content of alarm  calls, and the third
              is to determine what callers know about  the predator-prey relations that exist
              among sympatric  species.  Studies will focus on red colobus monkeys, whose 
              vocal and behavioral responses to tape playback of noises  from potential
              predators and other prey species will be  monitored in their natural
              environment.  The results will  increase our understanding of animal
              communication and  insight into the evolution of semantic communication.
