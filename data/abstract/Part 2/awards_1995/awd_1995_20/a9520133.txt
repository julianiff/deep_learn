Abstract    :
              9520133  Parris    With the transition from a command to a marketized economy in
               China, a growing class of private and individual business  operators has
              emerged in both the rural and urban areas.  This  Research Planning Grant study
              seeks to reconstruct the ways that  private business owners in china
              conceptualize citizenship and  their own roles and competencies as citizens
              through the use of  Q-methodology.  Citizenship is defined as the privileges
              and  duties attached to full membership in the community.  Private  business
              owner refers to those individuals whose income is  largely (though not wholly)
              dependent on self employment in  industrial or commercial spheres and who
              define themselves as  private or individual entrepreneurs.  Two stages of
              research will  be undertaken.  The first stage is an intensive ethnographic 
              examination of the current discourse on citizenship among private  and
              individual entrepreneurs.  This stage involves semi-  structured interviews and
              careful analysis of documentary  resources, including newspapers, journals,
              books and manuscripts.   This ethnographic research forms the basis for Q-sort
              method  which allows the researcher to model selected entrepreneurs  reactions
              to a set of statements about citizenship.  With this  methodology the
              researcher explores the subjective understanding  of selected individuals in a
              way that is constrained by  statistical results.  While the initial need is for
              description  and definition, the long term goal is an unfolding comparative 
              study on citizenship and business ownership that attempts to  establish the
              role of political culture in the process of  democratization.  ***
