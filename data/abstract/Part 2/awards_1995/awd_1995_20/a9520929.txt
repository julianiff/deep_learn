Abstract    :
               This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
              Program.  The research examines how artistic and literary excellence are
              defined and how the subsequent criteria are applied.  The research settings are
              two art museums and two university literature departments, selected to contrast
              cultural organizations where multiculturalism is the focus from those with more
              traditional orientations.  Theoretical concerns relate to the formation of
              cognitive systems and their relation to social action.  Data come from careful
              observations and from 90 interviews with museum curators and literature
              professors.  %%%   This research will contribute to the sociological
              understanding of cultural systems by examining the relation between aesthetic
              standards and standards used in other social situations.   In addition to the
              scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will materially
              assist a highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D.
              dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower of the
              nation and the thorough training of the next generation of social scientists.
