Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  ZHUANG  CTS-95-20165  Michigan State University    This work consists
              of an investigation of the scalar mixing field of mixing layers using direct
              numerical simulation (DNS).  The effects of 2- and 3- dimensional external
              perturbations on the scalar mixing field of two-stream mixing layers without
              chemical reactions will be studied.  The overall goal is to understand how to
              use fluid mechanics to enhance scalar mixing of mixing and layers and thereby
              aid in the development of more efficient reaction chambers and propulsion
              systems.  This research is funded through the Research Planning Grants for
              Women Scientists and Engineers Program.
