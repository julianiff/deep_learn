Abstract    :
               This dissertation project involves an anthropology student from Washington
              University-St. Louis.  The study will be conducted among rural African women
              involved in cooperative saving and loan associations in Hausa territory, Niger,
              West Africa.  Using a combination of ethnographic participant observation,
              open-ended interviews and formal questionnaires, the student will test several
              hypotheses about the conditions necessary for successful cooperation in these
              circumstances (of economic poverty and inadequate social and economic
              infrastructure).  The hypotheses involve the role of information, group size,
              excludability of non-contributors, and the presence of leadership on the
              success of cooperatives.   This project is important because it advances our
              understanding of the general principles explaining success or failure in
              collective action.  Increases in our theoretical sophistication in this area
              that will come from theoretically-informed intensive case studies such as this
              project will allow policy makers to facilitate more effective economic
              development.  In addition training new professional social scientists adds to
              the nation's store of expertise about this important area of the world.
