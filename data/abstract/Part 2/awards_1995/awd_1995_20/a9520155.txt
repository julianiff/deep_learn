Abstract    :
              Abstract  Sreenvasan  Yale  CTS-9520155    This proposal seeks to address a
              fundamental problem in fluid dynamics; turbulent drag reduction in water due to
              small amounts of polymer additives.  The PI seeks to resolve the mechanism for
              this phenomenon in light of recent theoretical work which suggests that elastic
              rather than viscous effects are essential.  The successful completion of this
              work would resolve this issue and would permit optimal use of polymers for drag
              reduction.
