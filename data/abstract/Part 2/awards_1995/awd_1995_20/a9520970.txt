Abstract    :
              9520970  Srdanov    The proposed research focuses on synthesis and physical 
              properties of a new class of materials that are created when  zeolites are
              doped with electron donors such as alkali  metals.  This proposal aims to open
              a new area in zeolite  research and explore whether zeilites densely populated
              with  electrons turn out to be a new class of interesting  electronic and
              magnetic materials.  On a more fundamental  level, the experimental results
              will provide presently  unavailable data that can be used for theoretical
              modeling  of the electron-framework and electron-electron interactions  in
              zeolites.  Detailed knowledge regarding electric fields  in zeolites, which can
              be deduced from these studies, is of  particular importance in their
              technological applications.  The structural and physical properties of the
              materials will  be investigated by various techniques including x-ray 
              diffraction, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, ESR, NMR and  magnetic
              susceptibility measurements.  %%%  The proposed research aims to open a new
