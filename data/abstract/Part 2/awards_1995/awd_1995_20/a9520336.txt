Abstract    :
              This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry
              Program, addresses the application of time-of-flight  (TOF) mass spectrometry
              (MS) to the analytical characterization of  polymers.  During the tenure of
              this thirty-three month continuing  grant, Professor Hercules and his students
              at Vanderbilt University  will seek to establish definitive correlations
              between TOF  secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) fragmentation patterns 
              and the molecular structures of well defined polymers and polymer  blends. 
              Additionally, they will apply matrix assisted laser  desorption/ionization TOF
              MS (MALDI-TOF) to the analytical  characterization of thick film (bulk) polymer
              analytes.  The analytical characterization of polymers is a technologically 
              important and challenging problem.  Mass spectrometric techniques  offer
              versatility and unparalleled sensitivity for a wide variety  of polymer
              analytes.  This research will enable TOF-SIMS and MALDI-  TOF MS to be reliably
              used as analytical tools for the  characterization of these ubiquitous
              materials.  This research also  has important implications for the broad field
              of materials  degradation and stabilization.
