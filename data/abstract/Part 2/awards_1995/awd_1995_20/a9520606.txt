Abstract    :
              9520606  Houghton        This research is aimed at developing capabilities of
              predicting precipitation  on the meso-  scale (20 to 200 kilometers) for the 24
              to 48 hour time period.  A  critical area to be addressed in this research is
              to determine the observational  requirements for initialization of prediction
              models.          The proposed research will result in a better understanding of
              determining  factors for accurate meso-  scale precipitation prediction. 
              Specifically, it is  necessary to assess the relative importance of meso- 
              initial conditions to internal  scale interactions and boundary conditions.  
              Previous work has suggested a  hypothesis for wintertime extratropical cyclones
              that meso-  structure not initially  resolved can be important for subsequent
              meso-  precipitation structure in the storm  system, particularly if the
              structure includes a potential vorticity anomaly.        The proposed
              investigation will explore this hypothesis using a sophisticated   mesoscale
              model that can explicitly resolve the meso-  scale. The research will  allow
              isolation of specific aspects of the initial condition structure impacts and 
              general assessments of impacts in the operational setting.  ***
