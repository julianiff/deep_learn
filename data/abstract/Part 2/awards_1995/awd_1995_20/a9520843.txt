Abstract    :
              9520843  PUTZ  The objective of this proposal is to test hypotheses that relate
              belowground plant traits to changes in soil fertility.  Soil coring, root
              decomposition bags, root observation windows and fertilization techniques will
              be used to investigate root mortality, production, and turnover rates.  The
              study will span a natural gradient of soil fertility where other confounding
              factors, such as temperature, rainfall, and elevation are held nearly constant.
               Results will augment available information about belowground processes for
              tropical forest stands, and will be applicable for incorporation into theories
              of forest dynamics as well as for the restoration and management of forests and
              plantations.
