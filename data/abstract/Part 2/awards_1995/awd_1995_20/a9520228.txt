Abstract    :
              The Project summary should include a statement of objectives, methods to be
              employed,  and the significance of the proposed activity to the advancement of
              knowledge or education.  Avoid use  of first person to complete this summary. 
              The purpose of this project is to contact the next  International Workshop on
              Computational Electronics to be held in Tempe, Arizona on October 30-  November
              2, 1995.  This workshop is the fourth in a series and is held under the
              auspices of the  National Center for Computational Electronics at the
              University of Illinois.  The workshop will cover  all aspects of advanced
              simulation and modeling of electronic transport in semiconductor and 
              semiconductor devices,  particularly those aspects that utilize intensive
              computational and/or  visualization resources.  This workshop is intended to be
              an international forum for the discussion of  the current trends and future
              directions of computational electronics.   The IWCE attempts to bring  together
              engineers, physicists,  computational scientists, and applied mathematicians in
              the area of  simulation and modeling.  The proceedings of the Fourth IWCE will
              be published as a regular issue  of VLSI Design.  The will be an issue of
              approximately 300 pages, as all manuscripts will be contained  in  a single
              issue.  Papers will be submitted at the beginning of the workshop with regular
              refereeing  occurring during the workshop.  Final revised (accepted)
              manuscripts will be due approximately three  weeks after the workshop.
