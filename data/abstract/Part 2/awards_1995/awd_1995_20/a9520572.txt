Abstract    :
                9520572  BRYANT            The normal male karyotype of the housefly, Musca
              domestica,  consists of five pairs of autosomes and a pair of dimorphic sex 
              chromosomes.  Some males however have two X chromosomes and a portion of  the Y
              chromosome containing the male determining factor attached to one of  the third
              autosomes.  This new male karyotype which was rare or absent  fifty years ago
              is now found around the world and has replaced the normal  male karyotype in
              many populations.  Surveys suggest that the third  chromosome containing the
              translocated male determining factor decreases  with latitude and overall
              frequencies continue to increase with time.  Since genetic recombination is
              normally absent in male houseflies, the  third autosome containing the
              translocated male determining factor is  prevented from exchanging genetic
              material via crossing over.  Theory  predicts that this should result in the
              accumulation of mutations on this  chromosome causing it to diverge from normal
              third chromosomes.  This study  is concerned with determining how much the new
              male determining chromosome  in the housefly has changed since the acquisition
              of the male determining  factor.          This study will survey the frequency
              of the new male determining  chromosome from several different populations from
              around the U.S.  Strains  containing the translocated male determining factor
              on the third autosome  will be studied and compared in terms of the
              accumulation of deleterious  mutations, gene inactivation and dosage
              compensation.  The accumulation of  sexually antagonistic alleles associated
              with the new male determining  chromosome will also be investigated.
