Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, David   Nesbitt
              of the University of Colorado will investigate the potential   energy surfaces
              of van der Waals molecules using laser based   spectroscopic methods.  These
              studies will concentrate on hydrogen bonded   species and multiple rare-gas
              cluster systems including HF, HCL, and   water.  Additional work will focus on
              the production and infrared   characterization of radical and radical complexes
              of important   atmospheric components such as the peroxyl radical, and the
              spectroscopy   and dynamics of prototypical heavy-light-heavy reactive systems
              such as   Cl-HCl and F-HF.  High resolution near infrared light will be used to
                state-select a cluster which will be subsequently  photolyzed in studies  
              involving reactive and inelastic scattering.  These systems include   DCl-HCl
              and XH-NNO (ONN), and provide control over cluster size, quantum   state, and
              reactant approach geometry.  The determination of potential energy surfaces
              provides the information   needed to understand and control the course of a
              chemical reaction.    Professor Nesbitt's studies will provide quantum state
              specificity and a   specific reactant approach geometry for an important class
              of chemical   reactions known as heavy-light-heavy reactions.  The information
              obtained   from this work will be an important step towards using lasers to
              control   of the outcome of chemical reactions.
