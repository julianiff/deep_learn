Abstract    :
              9520280  Azizinamini  Composite construction consisting of  concrete filled tube
              (CFT) columns with  relatively thin-walled steel tubes, has  been used in
              building construction in  U.S. and Far East.  In general, in this  type of
              construction, steel beams are  framed to these columns at each floor  level. 
              Detail and design criteria for  connecting steel beams to CFT columns  are
              almost non existent.    The overall objectives of this project  are to develop
              an economical connection  detail for connecting steel beams to CFT  columns and
              provide accompanying design  provisions.  The focus of this  investigation is
              to develop the Fully  Restrained (FR) type steel connection  detail for CFT
              columns for buildings  ranging from 10 to 20 stories high and  for seismic
              performance categories D and  E defined per "NEHRP Recommended  Provisions for
              the Development of  Seismic Regulations for New Buildings".    The connection
              detail to be selected and  design provisions to be developed will  give
              consideration to the following  issues: a) level of ductility, b)  economy and
              constructability, c)  avoiding over stressing the steel shell  portion of the
              CFI columns, d)  preventing damage to the joint region of  the column by moving
              the location of the  plastic hinge to some safe distance away  from the column
              face, e) taking  advantage of composite action between  the concrete slab and
              the steel beam.    At least two structural configurations  will be
              investigated.  static and  dynamic linear and inelastic analyses  considering
              different ground motions  will be conducted to establish a level  of ductility
              required for the  connection.  Both finite element  analysis and experimental
              study will be  carried out to develop the connection  detail and design
              provisions.  Results  of this research should fulfill this  technology gap and
              expedite acceptance  of composite structures in construction  industry.    This
              is a project supported under NSF 94-  154 a CIS Solicitation "Research on 
              Composite and Hybrid Structu res".
