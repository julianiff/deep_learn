              Integrated Approach      Biology majors are required to complete a course in
              the area of  molecular/cellular biology. The Cell Biology course meets these 
              requirements. Currently, the laboratory portion of this course is  taught in
              small groups in a research lab utilizing limited  equipment. A Cell Biology
              Teaching Lab has been identified; the  purpose of this proposal is to remedy
              the equipment limitations. A  thematic approach to studying cellular processes
              at the whole cell,  organelle, & molecular levels is proposed. At the whole
              cell level  students learn tissue culture techniques and localize organelles 
              and proteins in-situ. Studies at the organelle level include  isolation and
              identification of mitochondria. Isolation and  characterization of mt DNA and
              proteins demonstrates analysis at  the molecular level. Experiences in
              manipulating cellular responses  and computer-assisted learning are planned.
              The equipment requested  will allow 20-24 students to participate in these
              activities. This  theme based, integrated lab experience is a departure from
              the  traditional single-exercise approach. An added dimension is  allowing
              students to develop tissue culture techniques, an  increasingly important
              exposure in this age of animal rights  concerns. This integrated approach will
              be reported in the  literature as a major contribution to the field of cell
              biology  laboratory instruction.
