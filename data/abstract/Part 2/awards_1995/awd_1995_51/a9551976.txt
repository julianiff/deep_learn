Abstract    :
              A force concept approach to introductory physics laboratories  seeks to address
              the lack of conceptual understanding that  students retain as they exit from
              introductory courses.   The  project hopes to aid students in building
              operational definitions  for the concept of force and provide them with direct,
              personal  experience with the measurement of force.   The goal is that each 
              student (a) learn about physical phenomena in a hands-on way, (b)  overcome
              conceptual difficulties, (c) learn the procedures  involved in drawing
              scientific conclusions, (d) experience  working with laboratory equipment
              including computers, and (e)  use writing and critical thinking as tools to
              gain understanding.    They use computerized force sensors, motion sensors, and
              field  sensors to gain direct experience with forces and fields and the 
              resulting motions of objects subject to these.   The target  audience includes
              students from biology, prepharmacy,  premedicine, prephysical-therapy,
              architecture, preservice  teaching, sciences, math, and engineering, including
              students who  later major in physics.
