Abstract    :
              The university offers an advanced undergraduate laboratory course  entitled
              "Computer Interfacing and Instrumentation," which  explores the methodology for
              linking a digital computer to the  analog world of the laboratory.   Students
              learn about the  concepts, principles, and techniques for using interfaced 
              computers in making measurements, controlling experiments, and  processing
              stored data.   The course has an interdisciplinary  character, as it develops
              skills in electronics and computers, as  well as experimental methods for
              research in physics and related  fields.    This project provides funds for the
              modernization of  the laboratory, through the acquisition of state-of-the-art 
              instructional technology.   The scope and emphasis of the course  is being
              significantly extended, with the inclusion of a wide  range of new experiments
              and possibilities for individual student  projects.   Blind students and others
              with disabilities can be  accommodated.   The sections of the course dealing
              with noise,  signal averaging, and spectral analysis are being expanded, and a 
              set of experiments is being developed in video data acquisition  and analysis. 
               The new course prepares students for careers in  which they will be able to
              meet the challenges of laboratory  computerization.
