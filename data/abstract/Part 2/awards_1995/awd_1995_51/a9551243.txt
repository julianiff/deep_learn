              Chemistry       Title: Modular Chemistry Laboratory for Community College
              Students         An FT-IR, gas chromatograph, and supporting computers and 
              computer software are being used in a modular course in  instrumental analysis.
               The course is being offered in three  modules of 5-weeks each to non-science
              majors, electronic  engineering technology students, and internationally
              educated  students who have had little opportunity to use laboratory 
              equipment.  High school students as well as technicians working in  local
              industries have opportunities to learn to use the equipment  as well.  The
              project is having a significant impact on  undergraduate students by providing
              access to science within a  positive, non-intimidating environment.  The
              challenge is to  provide learning experiences and curricular content that are 
              relevant, learner-friendly, interesting, and exciting, and which  stimulate the
              interest of non-science students to enroll in  subsequent science courses.  A
              pre and post survey will be given to  assess the student interest/knowledge in
              science.  The impact of  the project will be disseminated to regional and
              national ACS and  science education conferences.
