Abstract    :
              This project upgrades the existing Computer Cartography/GIS  laboratory at the
              university.   The upgrade facilitates the  further integration of computer
              applications into the  Environmental Science, GIS, Cartography and Regional
              Planning  curriculum in the Department of Geography and Geology.   This 
              laboratory accommodates approximately 40 majors in the department  plus
              students from Environmental Science/Biology and the teacher  training programs
              who must complete coursework in Geography.    The project specifically funds
              Pentium computers, a flat-bed  scanner, and software.        The new Pentium
              computers and the  increased number of software licenses more than double the 
              capacity of the existing computer laboratory.   The increased  number of seats
              allows the department to introduce more computer  applications in the
              introductory courses, freeing time in the  upper-level courses for more
              advanced topics.   The processing  power of the Pentiums permits more demanding
              applications in the  courses.   This new curriculum better prepares our
              students for  graduate programs and for jobs in the planning agencies and GIS 
              concerns who look to the university to supply their personnel  needs.
