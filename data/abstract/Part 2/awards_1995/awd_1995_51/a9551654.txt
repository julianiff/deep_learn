Abstract    :
              This grant supports the purchase of 19 Pentium class, IBM  compatible computers
              with interface boards and associated network  hardware and software to improve
              laboratory instruction for  students in general chemistry, analytical
              chemistry, and physical  chemistry courses.   This equipment permits the
              establishment of  laboratory information management systems (LIMS) in the
              general  chemistry laboratory and in the physical/analytical chemistry 
              laboratory.   Computer-assisted experiments enable students in  the general
              chemistry laboratory to realize the full potential of  discovery-based
              experiments.   Computers so greatly facilitate  the collection and exchange of
              data between students that they  are able to use laboratory time to manipulate
              and analyze this  data.   The ease with which data and graphs can be
              manipulated  permits students to make further explorations, stimulate critical 
              thinking, and lead them to new discoveries.   Students in  advanced chemistry
              courses, in addition to using computers for  rapid data acquisition and
              analysis, employ these computers in  more sophisticated applications, such as
              designing their own  laboratory information management systems.
