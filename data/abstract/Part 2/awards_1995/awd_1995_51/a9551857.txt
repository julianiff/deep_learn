Abstract    :
              This project improves two undergraduate laboratory courses,  Ecology and
              Molecular Biology, offered by the Department of  Biology.   Central to the
              proposal is the use of computers in  analyzing data obtained from field studies
              in the ecology lab   and from nucleic acid sequences in the molecular lab.  
              The  project provides students with a modern experimental approach to  the
              study of two very fundamental areas in biology.   Equipment  necessary to
              upgrade the molecular biology lab to include nucleic  acid experimental
              manipulation is also being obtained.
