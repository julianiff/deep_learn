Abstract    :
              A set of multimedia modules ia being developed and is designed  for use in core
              chemical engineering undergraduate courses (e.g.,  thermodynamics, fluid
              mechanics, process design and control).    Each module typically consists of
              digital video, sound,  animation, and text and stresses the connection between
              a  traditional mathematical representation (e.g., as seen in  textbooks) and a
              laboratory experience.   These modules are being  developed with Macromedia's
              "Director" package on PowerMacintosh  machines.   Each completed module can be
              placed on the World Wide  Web by way of the client Mosaic for easy access by
              other  educators.
