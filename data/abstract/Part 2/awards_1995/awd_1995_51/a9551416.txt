Abstract    :
              A laboratory, to support a three-course sequence in parallel and  distributed
              computing is being created.   The goals of the lab  are (1) to provide a
              rigorous grounding in the basics of these  fields, while exploring innovative
              educational ideas: the use of  a distributed spreadsheet to teach the basics of
              distributed  computing, and an active learning approach to teaching parallel 
              algorithm design; (2) to orient the courses toward the technical  issues
              students encounter in applying parallel and distributed  computing to
              Information Technology (IT) problems in the service  sector (e.g., air
              transportation, telecommunications, wholesale  and retail trade, health care,
              the financial services industry)  rather than problems in scientific computing.
                The course is  taught on workstation networks and gives equal attention to 
              database problems as well as to numerical computing.   The course  also
              introduces issues of security and reliability, which are  often more important
              than program performance.   The course  sequence culminates in a group project
              course in which students  carry out projects motivated by real problems from
              the IT sector.
