Abstract    :
              This project is bringing together, in a consortium, faculty from  computer
              science and math at the university and three private  liberal arts colleges
              with scientific support staff from the  university's Weeg Computing Center.  
              The goal is to provide the  capability and support for undergraduate computer
              science  education in parallel computing, using the Internet and the Iowa 
              Communications Network.    The university is purchasing a  scalable parallel
              computer, allowing prototype collaboration  through the networks via video
              software.   Student evaluations  and faculty workshops serve to evaluate and
              disseminate the  results of this project.   Course notes and other teaching 
              materials will be available from the World Wide Web site.
