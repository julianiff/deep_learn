Abstract    :
              This project funds the devlopment of an apparatus for the  Millikan oil drop
              experiment that will permit a student, working  without assistance, to complete
              all phases of the experiment  efficiently and accurately.   The apparatus takes
              advantage of  video recording to separate the functions of data acquisition and
               data analysis.   The oil drop experiment is pedagogically  attractive, but it
              is not popular with students and does not  fulfill its potential because the
              execution has been so  cumbersome.   With modern technology brought to bear on
              the  problem, it is hoped that the experiment can be raised to a  favored
              position in the laboratory repertoire.
