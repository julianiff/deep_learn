               Physics         Title: Integrating Multimedia-Based Activities into University
                   Physics Laboratories           This project will improve the laboratories
              which accompany the  calculus-based university physics courses.  The new
              laboratories  will use the power of multimedia tools to build student 
              understanding of specific physics concepts while developing  students'
              abilities to properly apply these tools.         The lessons developed will
              have the following structure:  hands-on exploration of concept,
              microcomputer-based laboratory  (MBL) and visual-based laboratory (VBL)
              applications, and  assessment of student understanding.  The MBL activities
              will use  various probeware interfaced with a computer to acquire and display 
              data in real time.  The VBL activities will use video sequences,  prepared
              digital images, and simulation software to allow careful  measurements of
              phenomena or systems that would otherwise be too  difficult or too expensive to
              reproduce in the classroom.  During  the application activities, students will
              have spreadsheet and  symbolic-algebra software packages as well as an
              electronic physics  data base at their disposal to aid in their analysis and
              scientific  development.  An assessment activity will be completed at the end 
              of each laboratory period to evaluate student understanding of the  covered
              topics.  In addition, computers will be made available in  the Physics Learning
              Center where laboratory-related questions will  be integrated into the lecture
              courses.           This project will be evaluated by assessing student 
              performance and enrollment.  Furthermore, the materials and results  of this
              project will be published and made available for   distribution through The
              Learning Team, a non-profit educational  corporation in Armonk, NY.
