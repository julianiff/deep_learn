Abstract    :
              This project funds a networked personal computer laboratory for  sociology.  
              This pedagogical approach premises that sociology is  becoming an applied
              information science.   The new Quantitative  Research Laboratory for sociology
              helps to define sociology as an  information-based laboratory science.   It
              serves as the hub of  the department, housing large quantities of data,
              integrating  several methodological as well as substantive courses, and 
              orienting students to the more scientific aspects of sociological  inquiry.  
              The technological hub integrates methodological  training by providing a common
              platform for all methods courses.    Several substantive courses, as well as
              the methods courses, are  further integrated by a community area study.   
              Treating  sociology as an applied information science with an emphasis on 
              laboratory-based training improves undergraduate education of  sociology majors
              in several ways:  (1) it improves the  statistical analysis skills of students;
              (2) it defines and  portrays an undergraduate curriculum that more closely
              resembles  the training and orientation of graduate studies and the work 
              performed by professional sociologists; (3) it trains  undergraduate students
              on the types of equipment and software  applications they are likely to
              encounter in the workplace; and  (4) it creates a stronger position for
              sociology as an  undergraduate major in the postindustrial economy.
