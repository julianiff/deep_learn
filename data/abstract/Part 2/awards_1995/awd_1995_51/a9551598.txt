Abstract    :
              This project is creating a new laboratory that involves students  in all aspects
              of integrated circuit design and fabrication.    The university is implementing
              the laboratory in a "simulated  corporate environment" that emphasizes
              technical communication  skills and teamwork for engineering students.   In the
              laboratory  students (1) gain hands-on experience with computer-aided design 
              tools for designing integrated circuits; (2) fabricate designs  through
              NSF-sponsored facilities (MOSIS); (3) conduct  measurements on fabricated
              chips; (4) work in teams to achieve  overall success; and (5) develop written,
              verbal, and e-mail  communication skills.  In the laboratory, students
              participate as  "employees" of a VLSI design "company" working in different 
              divisions to solve a common problem.   The company framework is  being created
              through local area network (LAN) of 10 Pentium--  based computers.   This
              project is equipping the LAN with  additional software to allow for circuit
              simulation, physical  circuit layout, word processing, presentation, data
              analysis, and  electronic mail.   For the accurate measurement of fabricated 
              chips and comparison of designed values, two pieces of additional  test
              equipment are being added to pre-existing lab facilities.   The "simulated
              corporate environment" was designed to prepare  engineers for situations in the
              workplace, where they evaluate  problems, define potential solutions, form
              plans of action, and  communicate ideas to peers and superiors.   This
              laboratory will  be critically evaluated by students, faculty, and industry 
              contacts to confirm its value in engineering education.
