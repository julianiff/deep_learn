Abstract    :
              This project incorporates a multinuclear high-field NMR  instrument into the
              undergraduate chemistry curriculum.   An NMR  instrument is being used in the
              organic, inorganic, polymer,  biochemistry, and quantum chemistry courses, as
              well as in  student research.   In addition, a new course is being developed 
              to teach the theory and practice of NMR spectroscopy.    Experiments in these
              courses have been designed to enhance  student understanding of proton, carbon,
              and phosphorus NMR  spectra and to provide experience in analyzing  these data
              in the  elucidation of structure.   Furthermore, NMR is being used as a  tool
              in kinetic, mechanistic, and quantum mechanical studies.    In the 3-year
              period of this project, an estimated 400 chemistry  students can gain skills
              that will better prepare them to  characterize reaction products and study
              important reactions  being investigated in academia or industry.
