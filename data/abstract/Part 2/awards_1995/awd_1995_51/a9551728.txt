Abstract    :
              Through this grant, the Department of Computer Science and  Mathematics is
              developing a new laboratory facility, the Parallel  Processing Computation
              Server, for undergraduate experimentation on  fundamental concepts in various
              areas of computer science, which  will represent a variety of fields, all
              falling under the  principles of parallel processing.   Computer science majors
              are   the primary target audience, although students from other  disciplines
              such as physics and mathematics are frequently drawn.    Experimental topics
              include implementation of parallel algorithms,  message passing computational
              model, versus the shared-memory  model, and algorithm speedups.  The new
              laboratory uniquely  complements the university's traditional laboratories in
              computer  science.   Since a large percentage of graduates seek employment 
              within the computer science field in industry, the parallel  processing
              laboratory gives them the opportunity to work with real  parallel processing
              machines, which, with the rise of client/server  computing, is one of the
              foremost technologies in the computing  domain.
