Abstract    :
              The college is incorporating FT-NMR into its courses to  strengthen an already
              successful program.   To reach this goal,  the college is purchasing a Hitachi
              R-1500, a Fourier transform  spectrometer operating at 60 MHz for 1H, and a 486
              computer to  provide a necessary data station.   By incorporating FT-NMR into 
              the organic chemistry courses, the college provides students  concrete
              experience in FT-NMR spectroscopy and computer-operated  instrumentation.   
              NMR theory is taught early in lectures so  that laboratory experiments
              involving NMR are continuous  throughout the courses.   Lectures include the
              basic theory of  Fourier Transform NMR, emphasizing the effects of radio
              frequency  pulses and the benefits of signal averaging.   With the goal of 
              fully utilizing the capabilities of the FT-NMR instrument, the  college is
              enhancing pre-existing experiments and introducing new  experiments.
