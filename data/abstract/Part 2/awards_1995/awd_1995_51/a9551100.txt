Abstract    :
              This project updates laboratory instruction in geographic  techniques.   To that
              end, the geography curriculum has been  revised, strengthening requirements and
              providing more structure.   One of the goals of this project is to improve
              spatial analysis  skills of students through the use of a computer-based
              laboratory  sequence of techniques courses.   These courses provide the 
              students with the technical skills necessary to compete in the  work place or
              in the graduate school of their choice.  The new  equipment for this project
              includes five state-of-the-art  computers and appropriate peripherals and
              software.   This  project allows instruction in the basic areas of map 
              interpretation, remote sensing, cartography, and GIS to be taught  as
              geographers use these techniques in the real world.
