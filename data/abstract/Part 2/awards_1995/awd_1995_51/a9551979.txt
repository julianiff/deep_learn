Abstract    :
              Equipment to enhance an astronomy course for non-science- majors  is being
              purchased.   The equipment enables students to better  determine stellar
              spectral class and distance and to image very  faint objects.   These are
              fundamental concepts in the  university's efforts to teach non-science-majors
              how astronomers  can deduce properties of distant objects, including their 
              distance, from the tiny amount of light received.   For many   students, this
              course represents their most advanced instruction  in science and forms the
              basis for their view of science  throughout their lives.
