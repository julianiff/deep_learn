Abstract    :
                  A central goal of the Geography Department is to provide all  students with
              skills in collecting, analyzing, and presenting data.    Despite some success
              in achieving this goal, students receive  little training in geographic
              information systems (GIS).   This  concern is shared with the Geology and
              Biology Departments, who  also recognize the growing importance of GIS in their
              disciplines.    Our objective is to provide a wide cross-section of
              undergraduate  students with interdisciplinary exposure to GIS such that they
              can  use this technology after leaving the university and can engage in 
              independent research that involves GIS.   The plan to meet this  objective has
              three components and involves efforts by the  Geography, Geology, and Biology
              Departments.   First, a  cross-listed course is being developed specifically
              addressing the  theoretical and applied issues of GIS.   This course forms the
              core  of GIS education.   Second, independent student research that uses  GIS
              is being encouraged.   Such projects include community-based  outreach work
              with the Madison County, NY, Planning Agency and  environmental studies at the
              university.   Third, existing courses  are being modified to include lectures
              and exercises involving GIS.
