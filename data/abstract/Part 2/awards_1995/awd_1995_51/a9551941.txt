Abstract    :
              This project funds the purchase of equipment to support  improvements in two
              upper-level aquatic biology courses:  Limnology and Planktonology.   These two
              courses serve the  Environmental Studies and Marine Biology degree programs, 
              respectively.   The new items of equipment include (1) a  videomicroscope
              system, (2) a light/temperature controlled  incubator to culture isolated
              phytoplankton and for controlled  growth of phytoplankton in nutrient
              enrichment experiments, (3) a  shaker for use in the incubator, (4) two
              automated water samplers  to permit water sampling during tidal, diel, and
              storm event  periods, a multiparameter water quality monitor for measuring and 
              logging dissolved oxygen, pH, depth, conductivity, and turbidity,  (5) an
              underwater quantum sensor for measuring and logging light  flux and other
              custom inputs, (6) a spectrophotometer for  nutrient analyses, and (7) two
              laptop computers to interface with  primary data gathering instruments and
              perform data analysis and  graphics.    This new equipment introduces students
              to  state-of-the-art research equipment and techniques, fosters  investigative
              approaches to scientific problems by students  working in small groups, focuses
              on water quality problems  associated with urban stormwater detention ponds (a
              national  concern) and local tidal creeks, and provides experience vital  for
              students entering graduate programs or employment in aquatic  biology.
