Abstract    :
              Within the Biology curriculum a series of experimental laboratories  are using
              molecular approaches to the study of genetic variation  and evolution.  These
              laboratories give the students an opportunity  to perform experimental
              techniques and ask theoretical questions  about material they formerly learned
              mainly through lectures of  dry-labs.  The laboratories improve the teaching of
              evolutionary  concepts, broaden the exposure to molecular techniques of both 
              majors and non-majors and finally, prepare undergraduates for  research
              projects that use molecular approaches to understanding  evolutionary
              questions.  Targeted courses include the General  Biology Introductory course
              for majors, a non-majors Life Science  course, and the Evolution course. 
              Investigative topics include  evolution of genomes, DNA fingerprinting,
              Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium, phylogenetic analyses, advanced population
              genetics,  plastid DNA variation and divergence.  The non-majors Life Science 
              Course is crucial in the science training of elementary and middle  school
              education majors.  Improvements in this course correspond to  changes in the
              elementary and middle school teacher preparation  curriculum supported by a
              grant from the Commonwealth of  Massachusetts (Partnerships Advancing the
              Learning of Mathematics  and Science, (PALMS) to restructure the college's
              teacher  preparation program in mathematics, science and technology  education.
