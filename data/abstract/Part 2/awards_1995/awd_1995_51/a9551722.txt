Abstract    :
              This project is improving the effectiveness of undergraduate  instruction in the
              area of fluid power actuation and control by  upgrading the laboratory
              experience mechanical engineering  students receive in this area.   It has
              typically been the case  that the laboratory exposure students receive has not
              fully  illustrated concepts or components related to fluid power in  sufficient
              depth and in the context of applications of current  interest.  This project
              exposes students to a greater variety of  fluid power components and systems,
              and investigates their  behavior in greater depth so that students develop a
              better  appreciation for the capabilities and limitations of fluid power  in
              relation to other forms of actuation such as electromechanical  actuation. 
              Applications of current interest are also highlighted  to better motivate
              students to investigate fluid power in greater  detail in the context of design
              projects and elective courses.
