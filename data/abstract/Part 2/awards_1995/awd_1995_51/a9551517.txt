Abstract    :
              This project is establishing a pulsed dye laser laboratory in the  chemistry
              undergraduate teaching laboratory building.   One  Nd-YAG pump laser is being
              purchased to provide power sufficient  for three student dye laser stations and
              for optical mixing  experiments.   Several new experiments in 
              fluorescence/phosphorescence spectroscopy, kinetics, and  nonlinear
              spectroscopy are being developed for junior and senior  level courses.   Of
              special note, the new system makes possible  two-photon absorption processes
              and coherent Raman studies of  molecular vibrations and rotations.   The
              stations utilize  digital oscilloscopes interfaced to PC's for data collection
              and  analysis.   Undergraduates benefit from useful hands-on  experience in
              modern chemical applications of lasers and digital  instrumentation.
