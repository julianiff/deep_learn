Abstract    :
              This grant equips an activity room to provide improved physical  science
              instruction, primarily to elementary education majors.    The course expansion
              from one term to a year-long sequence offers  increased course content with a
              balanced mix of laboratory  experience, physical science concepts, and
              pedagogy.   The course  models approaches and methods of teaching science,
              based on the  belief that new teachers rarely try methods that they have not 
              directly experienced.   Consequently, the course upgrade centers  around an
              activity-based, guided-inquiry format that relies  heavily on teaching tools
              developed and tested by leading  researchers in physics teaching and on
              experience with the  Workshop Physics mode in algebra- and calculus-based
              courses.   Previous course requirements for the elementary education program 
              have been such that they can be satisfied by enrolling in  traditional large
              sections of biology and astronomy with little  or no laboratory component.  
              The department has offered an  activity-based physical science course since
              1990.   However, it  has been available to only 24 students, typically one
              quarter per  academic year, because of the lack of space and equipment.   
              Continued success with this limited physical science offering,  proven track
              record with other activity-based physics courses,  and in-service teachers
              workshops have led to a serious  discussion about the need for a year-long
              physical science  course.   A fully implemented course can lead to improved 
              physical science instruction for preservice elementary teachers  and serve as a
              model for other institutions.
