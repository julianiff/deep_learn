Abstract    :
              The development of an advanced instrumentation laboratory is the  natural step
              in the growth of the Department of Physics and  Astronomy.   The Advanced
              Laboratory course and Supervised  Individual Research have been available to
              introduce students to  principles of numerical modeling and computer
              programming.   This  project complements these skills with an introduction to 
              instrumentation and experimental design, achieved through the  objective of
              measuring cosmic ray muon properties.   The  experiment acquaints majors with a
              variety of practical  techniques, and in a context not usually experienced in
              an  undergraduate setting.
