Abstract    :
              More than half of the students concentrating in mathematics at  the college are
              in one of three teacher-preparation programs.    It is critical that the
              Mathematics Department curriculum prepare  these students for the classrooms
              they will enter, in terms of  both mathematics content and pedagogy.   There
              are many areas of  mathematics that are taught more effectively through 
              technology-assisted approaches.   Statistics especially is an  area in which
              computers, coupled with teaching strategies that  allow students to construct
              their own knowledge through hands-on,  exploratory activities, can greatly
              enhance student learning.    This project funds a 20-station computer
              laboratory that provides  at least eight faculty members with a means to use
              newly  developed laboratory experiences in introductory statistics  courses.  
              An estimated 400-450 undergraduate students can  benefit each year.   First and
              foremost, the new laboratory  provides a technology-rich environment in which
              faculty can teach  using a pedagogy that both enhances the learning of all
              students  and models instructional methods important to those students 
              preparing to be teachers.   It also provides an alternative 
              approach--individualized and interactive--which helps reduce  withdrawal and
              failure rates in the introductory statistics  course for the many full-time
              students majoring in social  sciences, home economics, or food and nutrition.  
              In addition,  it can be of benefit to other part-time students pursuing 
              undergraduate degree programs in the Continuing Education  Division, as well as
              to majors taking the mathematical statistics  sequence.   Finally, it can
              improve the preparation of all these  students for workplace applications.
