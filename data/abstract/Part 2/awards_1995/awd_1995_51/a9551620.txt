Abstract    :
              In this project, a multipurpose computer is being used to  complement
              traditional laboratory and field investigations.    Students carry out a
              variety of simulations, use self-guided  multimedia learning materials to learn
              laboratory- and field-  related concepts, and analyze data.   They also
              manipulate and  quantitatively analyze images captured with microscope
              equipment  and a new gel scanner.  The project allows faculty and students  to
              create multimedia teaching modules from original materials.    Photographs,
              video, and sounds are being digitized and edited.    With presentation
              software, they are incorporated into multimedia  modules.   These interactive
              modules are being made available in  the new laboratory, in existing
              laboratories, and over the  university network for students to study at their
              own pace.  The  new equipment includes the following: (1) a computer laboratory
               with five Macintosh computers, five PC-compatible computers, five  laserdisc
              players, presentation and simulation software, and  several laserdiscs; (2) a
              Macintosh graphics development station  with a capture board, video tape
              recorder, video camera and  software; and (3) a video scanner and light boxes
              for  electrophoresis and chromatography gels.  The new laboratory  directly
              affects at least 360 science majors in the College of  Science and Engineering,
              including all entering freshmen biology  majors, all sophomore biochemistry and
              chemistry majors, and 130  upper-division biology students.
