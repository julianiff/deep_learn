Abstract    :
              The traditional introductory algebra-based physics course at the  university
              suffers from two major weaknesses: lack of proper  connection between lecture
              and laboratory and the poor math  preparation of the students.   The first
              problem is being  attacked by combining lecture and lab into a single 2-hour 
              session, three times a week.   The second problem is aggravated  by the fact
              that the traditional course begins with mechanics,  for which the requisite
              math includes vectors, limits,  derivatives, and integrals.   This problem of
              math preparation is  being combatted by reordering the syllabus, putting optics
              and  waves before mechanics in the fall semester.   A number of our 
              traditional lab exercises are being updated, and new labs in  fiber-optic
              coupling, the optics of rainbows, and voice  transmission are being added in
              order to make this new beginning  much more exciting for the students.
