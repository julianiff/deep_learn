Abstract    :
              This project provides equipment for a computer facility for  teaching
              computational chemistry and molecular modeling.    Advances in computer
              technology and software in the last decade  have made molecular modeling an
              indispensable tool for the  chemist and have made it possible to introduce the
              subject into  the undergraduate curriculum.   The computer facility teaches 
              students molecular modeling techniques through a progression of  activities
              integrated into all major courses of the chemistry  curriculum.   These courses
              are General Chemistry, Organic  Chemistry, Biochemistry, Physical Chemistry,
              Polymer Chemistry,  Instrumental Analysis, and Computational Modeling.  
              Students  learn to (1) correlate molecular properties with electronic 
              structure, (2) visualize molecules in three dimensions, (3)  search databases,
              (4) simulate molecular movements, (5) compute  ground state geometries, (6)
              correlate computed and observed  properties, (7) discover structure-activity
              relationships, and  (8) compute electronic structures.  The computer facility
              is  equipped with 20 CAChe Modeling Systems and Power Mac 6100  computers.  
              Additional equipment includes two stereo viewing  monitors and a
              high-resolution color laser printer.
