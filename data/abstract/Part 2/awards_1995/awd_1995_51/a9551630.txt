Abstract    :
              The Physics Department's traditional advanced laboratory  experiment-based
              classes have been replaced with year-long  student capstone projects, with the
              goal of improving the  graduate school or employment readiness of the
              baccalaureate  students.   The subatomic physics component is meeting this 
              curricular change with the extension of its existing  projected-oriented
              program.   Nine new projects and subprojects  have been identified and studied
              for use in the new capstone  regime.     The capstone program in
              particle/nuclear physics  focuses on the study of the interaction of radiation
              with matter.    Each project in the program examines principles of particle 
              detection while providing experience in project management,  including proposal
              writing and results presentation.   The  projects are varied in their depth of
              challenge in order to  affect all senior physics students.   In completing
              their  projects, students are exposed to contemporary particle and  nuclear
              physics methods and instrumentation.   The new projects,  while self-complete,
              also contribute to a larger (undergraduate  research) project in which a new
              muon detector and flux monitor  is constructed and used for meaningful
              measurements.
