                 Chemistry       Title: A Versatile Laser-Based Experimental Setup for the   
                     Chemistry Curriculum           A versatile experimental setup is used to
              introduce modern  laser-based physical chemistry to the undergraduate
              curriculum.   Requiring minimum reconfiguration to switch between different 
              experiments, the system can be used to demonstrate a variety of  concepts, such
              as laser-induced fluorescence, atomic and molecular  spectroscopy, Doppler
              broadening, photodissociation, radiative  lifetime, Boltzmann distribution,
              resonance Raman spectroscopy, and  computerized data acquisition.  Six new
              experiments have been  designed around this setup for incorporation into
              upper-level  physical chemistry, biochemistry, analytical chemistry, and 
              instrumentation laboratories.  In addition, a program of original  research
              projects for majors has been developed based on the setup.  The project can
              serve as model for schools wishing to modernize  their curriculum in a broad,
              yet cost-effective way.  Laboratory  "handouts" and descriptions of experiments
              and student research  projects will be generated during the project and
              disseminated in  journals, meetings, and on the Internet.
