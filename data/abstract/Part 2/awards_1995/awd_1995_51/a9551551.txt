Abstract    :
              This project instructs senior-level Radiological Health  Engineers, Nuclear
              Engineers, Safety Engineers, and Industrial  Hygienists in the proper
              techniques and procedures for measuring  radioactivity levels in the
              environment.   This area has become a  major focus of the nuclear industry in
              the years following the  accidents at Chernobyl and Three-Mile Island.   The
              course  utilizes state-of-the-art technology in order to expose  undergraduates
              to new radiation detectors already in use in  modern environmental analysis
              laboratories.   In addition to the  laboratory aspect, three in-field exercises
              are used, including  an emergency response drill and field trips to local
              nuclear  reactor utilities.   The course contains sections on measuring 
              environmental radiation fields, environmental sample collection  and analysis,
              trace element analysis, radon assay analysis,  measurements of occupational
              radiation fields, and radiological  emergency response.   At this time, no
              other institution offers a  complete laboratory course on these topics.   The
              class  culminates in a radiological emergency response drill in which  students
              participate in the annual NRC required reactor accident  drill at one of the
              school's research reactors.   This phase  allows students to use portable
              radiation detectors to quantify  any contamination surrounding the facility
              using techniques  presented during the semester.
