Abstract    :
              Through this project a speech science laboratory for  undergraduate students is
              being developed.   Such a laboratory  encourages the development of scientific
              problem solving through  integration of hands-on experiences with basic
              undergraduate  coursework related to acoustic and physiologic aspects of
              speech.    Four computerized speech laboratories are being used by students  to
              examine acoustic characteristics of speech.   Three  computerized work stations
              supporting a number of different  pieces of equipment are being used to examine
              various physiologic  aspects of speech production.   Laboratory exercises are
              being  designed to provide students with the opportunity to learn about  the
              various processes of speech as well as the relationships  between different
              physiologic processes and the acoustic signal.    This type of hands-on
              experimentation serves the students well as  they move into graduate education
              and throughout their  professional careers.
