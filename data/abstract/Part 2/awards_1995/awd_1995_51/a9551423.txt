Abstract    :
              This project funds computer hardware and software for a  multidisciplinary
              Geographic Information Systems (GIS)  laboratory.   The lab consists of two
              UNIX workstations and six  PCs integrated by local area network to support
              ARC/INFO and a  number of other software packages that complement ARC/INFO.  
              The  lab fosters training and research in a number of programs,  primarily in
              geography and secondarily in biological sciences,  chemistry and physics,
              environmental studies, and engineering  studies.   It services several courses
              in these disciplines  including three newly developed ones: Geographic
              Information  Systems, Environmental Remote Sensing, and Environmental 
              Analysis.   While the lab is primarily intended for undergraduate  use, it can
              also serve the newly introduced Professional  Development Sequence in
              Geographic Techniques and the M.A.   program in Geography and Economic
              Development.
