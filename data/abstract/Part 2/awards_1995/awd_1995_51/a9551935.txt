               Physics         Title: Improving the Senior Research Experience in Physics at
              West  Virginia Wesleyan College:  Laser/Atomic   Spectroscopy         To
              support its senior research requirement for physics majors,  newly expanded
              from a one semester course to a full year, Wesleyan  will purchase
              research-grade equipment in laser/atomic  spectroscopy.  The college will
              purchase an external grating  tunable diode laser, a wavemeter, a lock-in
              amplifier, and an  optical chopper with controller.  This equipment will
              supplement  instrumentation which is of teaching but not research grade for 
              undergraduates.  Instruments were selected to provide flexibility  in the
              choice of research topics for seniors over the next five  years.  The
              instrumentation will permit senior students to do  experimental studies in
              Doppler-free saturated absorption  spectroscopy, optogalvanic spectroscopy,
              wave mixing, the Zeemann  Effect, and frequency doubling.  Students will be
              able to collect  accurate data with very high resolution, to do mathematical 
              calculations with the data, and to compare results with physical  models. 
              Project objectives are to teach students to use current  research equipment, to
              teach current methods of research, and to  teach proper methods of data
              analysis.  The project will  demonstrate a new research technique for advanced
              undergraduate  students: that the external grating tunable diode laser and 
              associated equipment enable research-grade studies in atomic  physics.
