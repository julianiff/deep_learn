Abstract    :
              Increased interest in undergraduate science research justifies  the acquisition
              of state-of-the-art facilities in order to  attract gifted students toward
              careers in neuroscience.   Through  this project, histological and neuroimaging
              equipment are funded  to enable students in the Psychology Department to
              continue to  investigate the influence of certain variables (e.g., stress, 
              fetal-alcohol exposure, and environmental enrichment) on the  nervous system.  
              The new equipment gives students an opportunity  to utilize the most current
              methodology in their pursuit of  gaining knowledge about the intricacies of the
              brain.   The  neuroimaging/histological equipment is being used in the 
              laboratory component of the Physiological Psychology course, a  new
              Introduction to Behavioral Neuroscience course (yet to be  approved), as well
              as other Psychology and Biology courses (e.g.,  Cell Biology).   The
              acquisition of the neuroimaging equipment  can introduce undergraduate
              psychology majors to the "wonder" of  the brain, enhance the chances of
              undergraduates getting accepted  into graduate neuroscience programs
              (especially women  undergraduates), and motivate precollege students to
              consider  studying neuroscience in their academic careers.
