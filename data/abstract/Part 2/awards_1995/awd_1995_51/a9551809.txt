Abstract    :
              Geographic Information Systems (GIS) training is increasingly  essential to any
              strong environmental/resource undergraduate  degree.   This project acquires
              the needed equipment to allow:  (1) adding ARC/INFO training to several
              existing classes; (2)  implementing new classes in spatial data; (3) having
              ARC/INFO  available to students doing the required undergraduate research 
              thesis; and (4) sharing experiences with the broader  undergraduate education
              community.   Six Pentium-based PCs and a  large-format plotter are being added
              to the existing workstation  and 6-seat license for ARC/INFO.   This program
              can serve as a  model for combining high-level GIS instruction and research
              with  the natural resource field at the undergraduate level, which is a 
              relatively new endeavor.
