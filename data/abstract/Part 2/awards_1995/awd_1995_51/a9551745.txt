Abstract    :
              Through self-assessment efforts, the Department of Psychology has  identified a
              major shortcoming of the undergraduate psychology  degree, namely, the
              inadequate coverage of statistics, research  design, and experimental
              psychology.   This project funds a  dedicated computer laboratory for the
              purposes of teaching these  necessary and requisite research and statistics
              skills.   With a  teaching laboratory with 16 student and 1 faculty computer 
              stations, a facility is available to allow the implementation of  an integrated
              research curriculum centered around computer  applications.   This teaching
              laboratory is utilized by three  required and two optional undergraduate
              courses that have been  coordinated to lead students through a cumulative,
              integrated  research course sequence in such a way that they move from lack  of
              knowledge to ability to conduct research and data analyses  with minimal
              faculty supervision.
