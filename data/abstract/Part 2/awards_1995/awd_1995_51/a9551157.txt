              Spectrometer           Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is serving as an integral 
              instructional tool in our undergraduate chemistry courses.  The  major use of
              the instrument is in the organic chemistry laboratory,  but students in the
              Special Problems and Research course are using  the IR for both instructional
              and research needs, while first year  students are gaining experience on the IR
              in the introductory  chemistry course.           Students are using the
              instrument to confirm the identity of  products and impurities, estimate the
              proportions in a  two-component mixture, identify functional groups in an
              unknown  substance, and reveal the typical complexity of many natural  mixtures
              such as citrus oils and gasoline.  As part of the  treatment of the
              electromagnetic spectrum, students match a small  set of compounds with their
              IR spectra.  Students store libraries  of spectra and search such libraries
              easily.  Manipulation of  stored spectra, such as the subtraction of solvent
              and impurities  spectra, is routine.
