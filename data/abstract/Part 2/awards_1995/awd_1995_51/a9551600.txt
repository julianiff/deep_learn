Abstract    :
              This proposal increases the conceptual understanding of students  in the
              introductory algebra-based physics course, the  introductory calculus-based
              physics course, and the survey of  physics course (for non-science-majors) and
              makes clearer at an  earlier stage the connection between the scientific method
              and  the physics lab.   This is accomplished by introduction of  Workshop
              Physics, Tools for Scientific Thinking, Real-Time  Physics, and
              Microcomputer-Based Laboratory curricula.   Twelve  Macintosh Quadras provide
              the heart of the new physics  laboratory, and a host of probes interfaced with
              the computers  enables the students to gather and reduce data for further 
              analysis.   Students in the algebra- and calculus-based physics  courses learn
              the greater percentage of their physics from these  labs, eliminating to a
              large extent the lecture portions of these  courses.   The curricular materials
              are being locally modified to  restructure the lecture and laboratory
              presentation in the survey  of physics course for non-science-majors.
