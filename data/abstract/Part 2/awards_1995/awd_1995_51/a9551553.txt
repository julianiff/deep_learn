Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics is developing a modern, shared  computer
              classroom.   Improvement in students' understanding of  mathematics, physics,
              and related engineering problems is sought  by taking advantage of the fabulous
              developments that have  occurred in computer technology.   The principal means
              of  achieving this purpose are (1) the employment of technology-  assisted
              learning throughout the calculus sequence, within  differential equations, and
              in selected upper-division courses,   (2) a fully integrated math/physics
              curriculum, coordinated with  the various engineering departments, and (3) an
              environment of  cooperative learning and, where courses are integrated, the use
               or team teaching.
