Abstract    :
              The Power systems course and the associated laboratory are  required courses for
              all electrical engineering students.   The  effectiveness of the course depends
              significantly on how the  laboratory program translates the theoretical
              principles of the  course work to practical experiences.   For the future of
              the  power systems curriculum, it is also important that both the  course and
              laboratory subject matters reflect technology trends.   The increasing
              dependence of power systems engineering on  computer systems, control systems,
              and power electronics has made  it more apparent that the classical power
              systems engineering  program is inadequate for future power systems engineering
              needs.    It has become necessary to emphasize these influencing areas in  the
              power systems curriculum.   This project blends computer,  control, and power
              electronics concepts and principles into the  power laboratory curriculum.
