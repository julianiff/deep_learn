Abstract    :
              The shortage of modern equipment at the college has prevented  biology majors
              from exploring a significant area of molecular  biology, DNA science in the
              laboratory.   Although a good portion  of the lecture is spent on cell
              molecular biology, many of these  topics remain abstract and esoteric since
              students have been  unable to perform experiments in the laboratory.  This
              project,  involving a 2-year community college, a 4-year university, and 
              private industry, establishes a biotechnology consortium to  prepare laboratory
              investigations that give students hands-on  experience with fundamental
              techniques used in biotechnology.    These experiments parallel topics
              discussed in lectures.   The  investigations involve: (1) an introduction to
              DNA science; (2)  DNA restriction analysis; and (3) recombinant DNA technology.
                Individuals primarily affected are biology majors, those  preparing for
              careers in medicine, biological research, and  teaching.   About 200 students
              per year will use the equipment  and protocols of this project.  The laboratory
              investigations are  initially being integrated into the major's biology course
              and  microbiology.    These experiments serve as a basis for expansion  into a
              separate, biotechnology course and provide the stimulus to  initiate a techprep
              program.   The new equipment is so  fundamental to performing biotechnology
              protocols that it can  provide the flexibility to allow expansion into these
              courses.
