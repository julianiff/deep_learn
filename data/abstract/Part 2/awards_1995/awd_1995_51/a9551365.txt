Abstract    :
                   Moravian College seeks to add laser fluorescence and laser  Raman
              spectroscopy experiments to all three science disciplines:  biology, chemistry,
              and physics.  Through this project science  majors will be introduced to the
              theory and practice of laser  fluorescence and laser Raman spectroscopy, and
              will perform  experiments in which these techniques are applied to problems 
              within their discipline.  Novel experiments are proposed in which  laser Raman
              spectroscopy is used to study liquid C02 and the  structure of the enzyme
              lysozyme.  Novel extensions to established  experiments are proposed in which
              laser fluorescence spectroscopy  is used to measure riboflavin in milk, and to
              study the  chemiluminescence of luminol.  In addition, a novel experiment 
              involving LED's as detectors of laser radiation is proposed for  Solid State
              Physics.  The equipment in this proposal will allow  Moravian College to
              assemble a laser spectroscopy system capable of  performing a wide variety of
              experiments in physical chemistry,  analytical chemistry, modern physics,
              physical optics,  biochemistry, and molecular biology.
