Abstract    :
              The college is purchasing a 20-inch telescope to use with a CCD  camera or a CCD
              spectrograph.   The new equipment expands the  observational component of a
              number of courses, increases the  effectiveness of the college's public
              outreach programs, and  expands the possibilities for student research,
              particularly in  the area of supernova monitoring.   This 20-inch teaching 
              telescope is part of a larger plan for a new college observatory.
