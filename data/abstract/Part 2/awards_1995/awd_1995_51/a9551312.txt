Abstract    :
              This project is using the computational and graphic power of  microcomputers and
              workstations to allow students in the  chemistry curriculum to investigate
              molecular structure and  dynamics.   This activity is part of laboratory
              courses, and  interactive software allows students to conduct their 
              investigations as experiments.   Beginning a coherent three-year  program, the
              first year stresses learning how to think at the  molecular level and becoming
              familiar with different  representations of molecules.   The second year,
              organic and  inorganic laboratories focus on the development of sound 
              knowledge of force-field models and energy minimization.    Molecular orbital
              models are being introduced and used to  investigate spectral properties.   The
              third-year physical  chemistry laboratory is introducing ab initio MO methods
              and  integrating and comparison of the different models available.    Learning
              about the limitations of the models and where and why  they fail helps students
              appreciate the approximate nature of  scientific models.
