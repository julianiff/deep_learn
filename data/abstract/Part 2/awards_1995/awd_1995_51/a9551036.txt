Abstract    :
              This project improves the cryogenic facilities of upper- division  teaching
              laboratories.   In these laboratories, students are  given the opportunity to
              work with research-class instruments  that they may encounter in their future
              careers in university,  industrial, or government research laboratories.  
              Cryogenics, an  important part of the physics curriculum, it is a source of new
               concepts such as the macroscopic quantum states encountered in 
              superconductivity and superfluidity.   It is a region where the  absence of
              thermal motion permits the clear recognition of many  physical properties.  
              Furthermore, it has important applications  such as those associated with
              high-temperature superconductivity,  Josephson junctions, etc.  The heart of
              our new research standard  cryogenic system is a RMC Cryosystems 4He insertable
              dewar.    This is a low-cost all-purpose cryostat that provides a  temperature
              range from 1.2-300K, and, with a 50 T superconducting  solenoid, it becomes a
              very versatile piece of equipment.   It  has low operating costs and the fast
              turnaround time that is  essential for the efficient running of a teaching
              laboratory  where the students are present for limited periods.
