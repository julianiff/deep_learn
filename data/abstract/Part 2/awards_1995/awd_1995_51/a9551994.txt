Abstract    :
              Through this project, the Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer
              Science provides a graphics-based, interactive applied mathematics laboratory
              to stimulate active, hands-on learning in two courses that together enroll 290
              students annually:  A first principles, mathematical modeling course,
              Computational Modeling; and a first course in differential equations,
              Differential Equations.  In these courses, the new equipment transforms a
              traditional passive, instructor-centered lecture into a classroom requiring an
              active role by students.  The laboratory is made up of 26 color X terminals,
              monochrome laser printer, computer server, and software for statistical/data
              analysis, symbolic manipulation, and documentation preparation.  During the
              project period, instructor-centered and student-centered sections of the
              Differential Equations course are being run in order to obtain data for project
              evaluation.  The active engagement of students in problem solving, where
              students initiate the investigation of the problem rather than passively
              waiting for directions, is a major pedagogical outcome of this project.  With
              the new computing hardware and software, students not only are able to examine
              more problems, they ar able to examine more realistic problems in far greater
              detail than paper and pencil methods.
