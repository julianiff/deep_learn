                Geosciences    Title: Instrumentation for an Undergraduate Spatial Data
              Analysis   Laboratory           The Geography Department at the University of
              New Mexico (UNM)  has a long tradition of teaching and research in the spatial 
              sciences.  Over the past decade, with the maturing of Geographic  Information
              Systems, Remote Sensing and Digital Image Processing,  and significant advances
              in computer modeling, the Department, and  the discipline in general, has seen
              a dramatic shift in teaching  requirements from traditional geography courses
              to those which in-  corporate these technological elements.  Geography is
              currently in  the process of restructuring its offerings in these areas.  UNM
              has  recognized the importance of these critical areas and has  designated
              Geography as the primary focal point for the development  and teaching of these
              technologies.         To achieve this restructuring the department is currently
              in  the process of upgrading and developing its existing laboratory 
              facilities.  The support requested in this proposal will form the  core of
              teaching in the refocused Department of Geography.  The  equipment will be used
              to improve         a.  Geography Instruction:  The SDAL would become the focal 
              point for 14 existing or proposed courses.  A conservative estimate  is that
              over 280 students would have instruction in the SDAL  annually.  UNM's Minority
              Institution designation insures that  protected groups would be served.        
              b.  Interdisciplinary Instruction:  Currently GIT is also  utilized in
              Anthropology, Biology, Geology and Planning at UNM  campus.  The SDAL would
              serve as a centralized instruction location  as well as providing the resources
              for inte rdisciplinary teaching  in the physical sciences.
