Abstract    :
              The revision of the chemistry curriculum centers around the  acquisition of an
              automated gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer  with volatile and semivolatile
              capability.   In addition to  gaining experience with complex multicomponent
              analyses and  automated systems with this equipment, students analyze more 
              unknowns during one laboratory exercise than they once completed  during their
              entire undergraduate career.  The objectives of the  project are:  (1)
              modifications of existing courses; (2)  development of new courses focused on
              environmental applications;  (3) development of an emphasis area in applied
              chemistry; and (4)  support for interdisciplinary undergraduate research.   
              University faculty, students, and the Spokane Intercollegiate  Research and
              Technology Institute are collaborating to  disseminate and evaluate the project
              from the perspective of  regional universities and employers.
