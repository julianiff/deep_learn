Abstract    :
              This project provides support facilities for an interdisciplinary 
              instrumentation and measurement course in a newly designed  Bachelor of Science
              in Electro Mechanical Engineering Technology  program.   Transducers and
              sensors that are highly  interdisciplinary will be introduced to the audiences.
                 Laboratory experiences of this nature greatly assist students in  becoming
              familiar with numerous types of transducer, data  acquisition, principles of
              data communication, as well as  advanced graphical engineering software.  
              Specifically this  project (1) introduces both digital and analog
              instrumentation  and measurement to the students; (2) allows students to
              acquire  data from transducers in an automated fashion; (3) allows  students to
              use their acquired data for further mathematical and  graphical analysis; and
              (4) introduces the principle of local  networking to the students and provides
              a vehicle for training  hands on.   The experiments in this laboratory are
              designed to be  flexible in order to permit modification and to allow the 
              students to experience interdisciplinary work exercises.   The  data
              acquisition, data communication, and post-data-acquisition  parts permit the
              students to become familiap with the theoretical  aspects of experiments.
