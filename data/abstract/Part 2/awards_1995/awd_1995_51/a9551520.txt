                             Engineering    Title: Development of an Interdisciplinary
              Curriculum in            Electronic Materials and Devices    An undergraduate
              engineer is expected to possess a wide variety of  skills and knowledge beyond
              the fundamental engineering content of  his or her course work.  The need for
              improvement of student skills  in communication, problem solving, integration
              of knowledge and  teamwork is commonly understood.  Some of this need can be
              met by  a change in the techniques used in the teaching of laboratory  courses.
               The traditional method of laboratory instruction  frequently degenerates into
              a "cookbook" method, a mode in which  students follow a "recipe" for
              experimentation from their lab book.   Such exercises do not teach students to
              conduct an independent  scientific experiment, or to record and communicate to
              others the  information obtained during the course of an experiment.  The 
              "cookbook" method also fails to teach students to derive  information
              explicitly from measured parameters or to properly  apply statistics.  In
              short, most laboratory instruction does not  contribute to the development of
              the student as a critical thinker.   One solution to this problem is to abandon
              the "cookbook" in favor  of a sequence of team-oriented, open-ended laboratory
              experiences.   In this mode of laboratory instruction, students are given a 
              problem, trained to use the experimental apparatus, and taught the  fundamental
              concepts necessary for understanding the problem.  They  are required to design
              the experiments and analyze the data without  recourse to recipes.  Since it is
              believed that these skills cannot  be taught in a single course of instruction,
              our obj ective is to  develop independent exercises for introducing
              experimental design  skills into two pre-requisite classes on semiconductor
              devices and  electronic properties (MatE 153 and EE 128), followed by an 
              interdisciplinary, team-oriented design course in semiconductor  process
              engineering (EE/MatE 129).  The latter course will simulate  the engineering
              roles of industry, where interdisciplinary teams  are the rule and open-ended
              experimentation is a fact of life.
