                          Mathematics    Title: Instrumental Project (ILI-IP): The Electronic
              Workbook             Increasing the mathematics computer laboratory facilities
              at  Florida Atlantic University enables the department to accommodate  an
              interactive approach to learning calculus using electronic  workbooks. Recently
              developed software--Scientific WorkPlace, from  TCI Software Research--makes it
              possible for students to produce  and modify high quality text, and to access
              powerful mathematical  tools, including graphing and Symbolic processing,
              within the same  environment.            The current calculus course is taught
              from texts developed by  the Harvard calculus project.  The faculty are
              developing  electronic material, in the form of Scientific WorkPlace documents,
               which are used in conjunction with these texts. Putting a  high-class word
              processor at the students' disposal is intended to  improve their expository
              skills. By providing a symbolic processor  that understands ordinary
              mathematical notation makes it easier for  students to relate textbook
              mathematics to computer mathematics.
