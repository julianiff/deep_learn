                    Laboratories    A cell and developmental biology laboratory unit is being
              developed  for two introductory courses in cell, developmental and molecular 
              biology. This laboratory unit includes a series of intellectually  cohesive
              exercises based on the biology of the developing sea  urchin embryo. Designing
              the unit this way enables the inclusion of  more sophisticated techniques and
              more in-depth data analysis than  is possible if the laboratory exercises are
              unrelated to each  other. Students perform experiments to determine the
              kinetics of  larval alkaline phosphatase, investigate the tissue distribution 
              and temporal restriction of ectodermal, mesodermal and endodermal  antigens,
              and determine if perturbing development affects  expression of these same
              antigens. The methods that students use to  answer these questions include
              protein isolation, a colorimetric  assay for enzyme activity, whole-mount
              immunocytochemistry,  fluorescence microscopy, blastomere separation and
              culture, and an  ELISA assay. Upon development and refinement of this
              laboratory  unit the two PIs will publish the laboratory manual for 
              distribution outside Princeton University.
