Abstract    :
                   This project improves methods for teaching and learning  calculus in a
              technology-rich classroom/laboratory setting,  characterized by the seamless
              integration of technology and  mathematics.  Students learn calculus in a way
              that easily  transfers to other courses, especially laboratory sciences.  This 
              project helps more students to successfully complete calculus  courses and
              provides a better understanding of how to change the  entire before-calculus
              curriculum.  Through this project,  students are prepared to address the
              quantitative problems they  will meet in their personal and professional lives.
