Abstract    :
              Through this project, laboratory experiences for rural college  students are
              expanded by integrating new problem-solving  experiments into the physics
              curriculum.   New and older  computers can be utilized through new interfacing
              techniques that  transform obsolete computers into versatile laboratory
              equipment.    The goals of the project are to increase student access to new 
              research methods by (1) updating the calculus-based sequences of  courses for
              engineering, physics, and mathematics majors with new  problem-solving
              experiments, using microcomputer-based equipment,  (2) providing more exciting
              and enlightening experiments for the  liberal arts students in Survey of
              Physics, using the MBL; and  (3) disseminating advances in computer-based
              experimental methods  to the science and math teachers in rural high schools
              throughout  the region.
