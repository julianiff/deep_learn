Abstract    :
              In order for mechanical engineering technologists to make  informed material
              selection decisions from the rapidly increasing  number of choices, they need a
              logical and systematic technique  by which the selection of material can be
              made.   The technique  must be based upon physical properties of materials and
              a  performance index, a ratio of properties raised to an appropriate  power,
              which characterizes the particular design.   For this  purpose, the
              university's engineering materials course and  laboratory have to be designed
              with a goal of presenting a  logical and systematic technique to choose the
              optimum material  for each design.   The focus is still on both micro and macro
               structure, but the Cambridge University materials selection  approach is being
              used to focus on critical property ratios that  are design dependent and to
              relate the laboratory experience to  support the lecture.   This project
              obtains the modern laboratory  equipment that will substantially enhance the
              undergraduate  laboratory experience.    The unique approach taken for the 
              laboratory is to select representative materials for each of the  basic classes
              of materials, and then concurrently characterize  these materials with a series
              of experiments.   By following the  same set of materials through the same
              sequence of experiments,  the students grasp and retain the concept of property
               measurements and the difference between and within material  groups.   The
              laboratory experience concludes with the students  conducting a case study.
