Abstract    :
              Through this project, a technique of using synthetic H20-KCl  fluid inclusions
              is developed to visually simulate magmatic  crystallization and melting
              behavior for students enrolled in an  upper-division petrology course.   The
              technique offers students  an interactive, visual learning experience of a
              geologic process  that can never be directly observed.   Using synthetic
              H2O-KCl  fluid inclusions of known composition and a heating and cooling 
              stage, students conduct an exercise in which they observe and  control: (1)
              eutectic melting (of ice and sylvite at -10.7 C),  (2) liquidus crystallization
              and melting of ice or sylvite, and  (3) final ice or sylvite melting
              temperatures.   Using these  data, students construct their own phase diagram
              of the  water-rich portion of the H2O-KCl system and will then explore 
              questions on the (1) the relationship between eutectic and  liquidus
              temperatures and bulk composition and (2) applications  of the phase rule at
              various temperatures.   The main advantage  of this technique is that all of
              the important phase changes  analogous to magmatic systems (i.e., eutectic and
              liquidus  behavior, crystallization and melting textures) can be visually 
              observed and controlled by the student.   Consequently, every  space, line and
              point on a phase diagram will have direct  relevance to the student and result
              in a more meaningful  interpretation of phase diagrams and their application to
              igneous  rocks.
