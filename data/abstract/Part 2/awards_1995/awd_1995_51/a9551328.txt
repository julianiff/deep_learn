Abstract    :
              This project is introducing undergraduate students to a broad  range of
              materials processing concepts through the development of  a laser materials
              processing laboratory.   A 700- watt CO2 laser  system was recently donated to
              the department.  However, in order  to effectively integrate the system into
              the undergraduate  laboratory curriculum, a workpiece motion system is
              required.    This project has added a computer numerical control (CNC) 
              workpiece motion system to this laser system.   With the CNC  enhancement to
              the laser system, materials processing topics such  as heat treating, laser
              joining, surface modification, and  alloying are being introduced.   The
              laboratory is primarily used  in welding metallurgy, manufacturing processes,
              and materials  science courses.   In addition, the laboratory is used 
              extensively in computer-aided manufacturing courses where  computer-machine
              interfacing topics are introduced, as well as  CNC programming concepts and
              CAD/CAM integration.
