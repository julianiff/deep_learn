Abstract    :
              Through this grant the university is developing a six- workstation  laboratory
              to provide enrichment in computer science courses at the  advanced
              undergraduate level.   The laboratory corrects a lack of  integrated
              instruction involving networking, client/server database  applications, OOP,
              and computer graphics by allowing students to  conduct projects directed by
              faculty members.   These projects are  significant in that they enhance the
              real-world skills of students  entering the workforce, increase the number and
              quality of student  project/presentations, and produce publications of
              particularly  successful laboratory projects.
