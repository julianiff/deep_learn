Abstract    :
              This project obtains a robotic sample changer controlled GC/MS  facility
              directed toward undergraduate education and student  research courses.   The
              robotic sample changer controlled GC/MS  enables unattended data collection on
              student samples overnight  and on weekends.   The GC/MS is being networked to a
              series of  existing data stations, allowing student data processing,  analysis,
              and use in lecture courqes.   The GC/MS results are  being integrated with the
              results from other spectroscopic  (especially multinuclear NMR) and
              crystallographic techniques.    Laboratory studies in the sophomore through
              senior years  emphasizes hands-on, research-based laboratory experiences.   
              Mass spectra and GC data is being made available to other users  via the
              Internet, in combination with NMR data for the same  compound.   Summer courses
              on advanced instrumentation operation  and data analysis techniques are being
              offered to college  faculty.
