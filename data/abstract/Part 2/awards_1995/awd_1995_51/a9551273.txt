                             Interdisciplinary    Title: Library for Interactive Study of
              Mathematics              This project addresses the problem of how to use the
              new  information technologies, and in particular, the World Wide Web on  the
              Internet, to make new tools available to teachers, to use those  tools to
              enrich the quality of mathematics instruction at the  undergraduate level, to
              more effectively reach larger sectors of  the student population, and to expand
              pedagogy with new technology-  supported styles of teaching and learning.  The
              project addresses  the need to make existing interactive materials easily
              available,  to extend them, and to create new materials focused on the level 
              and the abilities of the students users.           The Library for Interactive
              Studies in Mathematics and  Science, based at the Institute for Academic
              Technology of the  University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, is being built on
              the  World Wide Web over a two year period.  The library contains  interactive
              workbooks on topics commonly encountered in  undergraduate mathematics, from
              college algebra and pre-calculus  through multivariate calculus, differential
              equations, and  mathematical modeling.  The library makes available to
              instructors  all over the country a wide variety of interactive workbooks that 
              they may freely use and distribute to their students.  Workbooks,  together
              with the program necessary to read them, are provided over  the Internet
              instantly, and free of charge.  The initial library  holdings are 45 of the
              most effective experimental workbooks  created for the MAA-sponsored
              Interactive Mathematics Text Project  (funded by IBM and NSF, ILI-LLD grant
              USE-9150272).           All  needed information about the library is
              disseminated  electronically via e-mail and discussion lists, as well as
              through  presentations and workshops.  The goal is to show teachers what can 
              be done, to get them interested in experimenting, and to teach  interested
              faculty how to build their own interactive workbooks.   Faculty are invited to
              join an initial core group of 8  knowledgeable authors whose colleges are
              participating by piloting  and testing materials. Materials are provided and a
              workshop is  held to prepare 16 new teacher/authors.  An integral part of the 
              development process is feedback from an editorial board directed to  the
              authors.
