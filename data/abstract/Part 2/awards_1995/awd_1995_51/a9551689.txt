Abstract    :
              Understanding geographic information systems (GIS) and techniques  of
              environmental simulation is important to professional urban  planners,
              especially in settings where physical planning  projects, large and small, are
              an issue of public importance.    Planners are often expected by both public
              officials and  community groups to assess critically GIS analyses and 
              computer-generated simulations offered in support of and in  opposition to
              proposed projects.   Understanding how primary  spatial data are collected for
              proposals at all scale levels is  an increasingly important professional skill.
                Through this  project, the School of Planning purchases a differential global
               positioning system (DGPS) and digital electronic transit to  provide direct
              instruction to its undergraduate planning students  in primary spatial data
              collection in courses on planning design,  site planning, GIS, and
              environmental simulation.   The purpose  of this instruction is to prepare the
              school's graduates with a  technological skill that is important in both
              professional and  public policy terms.
