Abstract    :
              Undergraduate students studying basic mechanical principles are  able to observe
              the geometry of movements (kinematics) directly  however, the internal and
              external forces and moments (kinetics)  causing the motion are invisible.  
              Real-time display of the  kinematic and kinetic transducer data and muscle
              activation  patterns (EMG) would allow students to actively modify kinetic 
              inputs to the system and immediately visualize the complex  interaction of
              internal and external forces responsible for human  body motion.   This project
              implements a previously developed and  tested immediate kinetic feedback system
              (IKF) that provides  real-time overlay of transducer signals directly onto
              video  images.   Examination of selected transducer data simultaneously 
              sampled and recorded onto video tape enables students to  visualize mechanical
              relationships immediately during realistic  human interactions with the
              environment.   A centrally located  digitizing station enables students to
              acquire selected  quantitative data independently from the video images created
               during laboratory experimentation.   Supplemental information  from other
              video based sources may also be analyzed to provide a  basis of comparison.  
              So that the majority of the laboratory  time is devoted to discovery rather
              than data management,  digitizing, processing, and presentation of experimental
              data are  being streamlined using custom programs.   CD-ROMs, video tapes,  and
              lab manuals developed from this project enable students  studying mechanics in
              other institutions without the required  instrumentation, to observe
              cause-effect relationships governing  movement directly.
