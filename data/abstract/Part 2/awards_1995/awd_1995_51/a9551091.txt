Abstract    :
              The chemistry department is purchasing two relatively inexpensive  graphics
              workstations for use in its undergraduate curriculum.    Sophomore students in
              Organic Chemistry Laboratory are being  instructed in molecular modeling by the
              molecular mechanics  (force field) procedure.   Two new experiments, the 
              stereoselective reduction of 4-t-butylcyclohexanone by kinetic  and equilibrium
              methods, and the metathetical polymerization of  dicyclopentadiene, are being
              used to show students how these  calculations can help rationalize laboratory
              results.   Molecular  mechanics, semi-empirical and ab initio MO methods, and
              density  functional methods are being used in two different senior  Capstone
              Experiences which are part of the recently adopted plan  for liberal education
              reform.   One of these is a course in the  theory and practice of ab initio MO
              and density functional  methods.   The other course is an independent research
              Capstone  which involves modeling of enzyme-substrate interactions,  nitrenium
              ion reactions, or conformational preferences of  tetrahydropyran derivatives.
