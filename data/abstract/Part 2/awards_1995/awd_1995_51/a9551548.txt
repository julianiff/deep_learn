Abstract    :
              The two principal gate keeper courses, the first semesters of  general biology
              and human anatomy and physiology have an  attrition rate far above the average
              for the college.   Analysis  by the curriculum committee has indicated that
              students in these  courses find the cell biology component especially
              difficult.    Attempts to improve performance in this area by utilization of an
               after-class study center and additional cell biology laboratory  activities
              have proven to be inadequate.   Through this project,  a computer-assisted
              instruction (CAI) laboratory is being  developed.   The laboratory consists of
              24 networked stations  plus an instructor's station.   The prior five hands-on 
              laboratories are also being equipped with one computerized  station that
              permits integration of "wet" laboratory activities  with computer-assisted
              activities.   A series of interactive  software titles have been closed and
              cover all aspects of the  syllabus topics in cell biology.
