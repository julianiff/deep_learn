Abstract    :
              The department is providing undergraduate chemistry majors with a  Scanning
              Tunneling Microscope (STM).   Students are gaining  hands-on experience with a
              cutting-edge device capable of  picturing surfaces at the atomic level, yet in
              an inexpensive  package designed for convenience.   Senior level chemistry 
              students are experiencing tangible laboratory illustrations of  atomic
              surfaces, enforcing ideas of polymeric and metallic  bonding, quantum
              mechanical tunneling, unit cells and active  sites.   Such experience prepares
              students better for careers  requiring knowledge of modern surface science, an
              area that has  received an explosion of interest over the last ten years.   The
               STM also exposes students to modern computer-interfaced  instrumentation and
              image processing.
