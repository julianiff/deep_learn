Abstract    :
              This project helps fund the purchase of a transmission electron  microscope
              (TEM) and an image analysis unit.   This new scope  meets four needs: (1) to
              replace an old, outdated and no longer  manufactured TEM; (2) to develop a new,
              interdisciplinary  biology/chemistry/geology course for undergraduates; (3) to 
              enhance existing courses and student research projects by using  present-day
              TEM technology which includes routine image  processing operations; and (4) to
              explore program alternatives  for attracting majors into the sciences.  
              Students are learning  more than simple, morphological examinations; they have
              the  opportunity to learn, by hands-on experience, the use of the  modern
              analytical and image processing operations that current  TEM's routinely
              perform.
