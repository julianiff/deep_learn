Abstract    :
              Semiconductor device technology is going through rapid changes in  order to
              achieve ultra-large-scale integration.   The increasing  demand for more
              complex chip functionality and higher speed have  led to decreasing device
              feature size.   Development of new  concepts and theories of mechanical
              reliability of  microelectronic devices has been an emerging interdisciplinary 
              subject because of the continual downsizing of the  microelectronics devices.  
              This project funds equipment for a  laboratopy course on Mechanical Reliability
              of Microelectronics  to be offered to upper-division engineering undergraduate 
              students at Georgia Tech.   The objectives of offering such a  course to
              mechanical engineering students are (1) to introduce  them to the field of
              mechanical reliability of microelectronics,  (2) to make them aware that there
              is an urgent need in the  electronic industry for mechanical engineers in
              packaging, and  (3) to give them a head start in their engineering careers so 
              they can face technological challenges in the 21st century.   The  new
              equipment includes a microtester system and an optical  microscopy system.
