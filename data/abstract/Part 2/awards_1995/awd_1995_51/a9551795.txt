Abstract    :
              This grant is enabling the university to equip a modern computer  classroom/lab
              for the introductory computer science courses, CS1  and CS2.   The goals of the
              laboratory facility are to encourage  students to interact with faculty,
              promote the team approach to  problem solving, and provide an environment in
              which students  learn to tackle problems with confidence.   A group-oriented 
              Design-Implementation-Discover (DID) approach to laboratory  assignments is
              being used in the upper-division courses.   The  success of this approach
              relies heavily on a closed lab in which  students can work together with
              instructor supervision.   These  upper-division classes are held in a small
              lab.   The university  is extending the collaborative DID approach to
              introductory  courses.   The project provides all students, majors and 
              nonmajors, with the fundamental skills needed to use the computer  as a
              problem-solving tool.
