Abstract    :
              Through this project, the College of Human Biology at the  university is
              developing a progressive approach to teaching the  Human Anatomy component of
              the curriculum.   This approach  involves the use of contemporary multimedia
              technology with  traditional cadaver dissections.   The increase in the number
              of  students entering Allied Heath and Health Science professions has 
              increased the demand for these courses.   The advancements  provide students
              with hands-on training through cadaver  dissections complemented with
              state-of-the-art computer  simulations in the areas of gross and microscopic
              anatomy.   The  requested equipment allows for major improvements in those 
              courses where human anatomy is a significant portion of the  subject matter: 
              Kinesiology, Comparative Anatomy of Vertebrates,  Anatomy and Physiology, and
              Microscopic Anatomy (which is offered  as an Independent Study).   The
              requested equipment also allows  for the development of a new course, Advanced
              Human Anatomy.    These improvements enhance student learning by increasing 
              involvement, interaction, and interest with the material.    Students also
              benefit from the hands-on and technological  experiences that are critical for
              success in the Allied Health  and Health Science professions.
