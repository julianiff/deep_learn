                                          Life Sciences    Title: Intelligent Tutor for
              Concepts in Molecular Genetics      This project is developing a computer
              laboratory fop tutoring  undergraduate students in fundamental concepts of
              molecular  genetics. The topics covered include (a) DNA structure and 
              replication, (b) RNA transcription, translation, and splicing, (c)  genetic
              recombination, repair, and transposition, (d) genetic  engineering and
              recombinant DNA technology, and (e) modern genomic  analysis and societal
              implications. The major challenges in  teaching these fundamental genetic
              concepts to undergraduates are  (1) transmitting the visual imagery of dynamic
              molecular processes,  (2) providing a solid intellectual framework to explore 
              interrelationships between genetic processes, and (3) at more  advanced levels,
              conveying the experimental basis for evolution of  genetic principles.  The
              project exploits recent advances in  computer hardware (increased memory size
              and data storage) and  software (intelligent tutoring systems) to develop a
              multimedia  tutorial package which conveys the visual imagery, conceptual 
              relationships, and experimental basis of molecular genetics in a  deeper and
              more effective manner than currently possible through  lectures or textbooks.
              The electronic tutor, named "MOLGENT", is  being tested during its
              developmental phase, in a variety of  undergraduate classes, including
              introductory biology,  microbiology, and molecular and cellular biology
              courses, and an  innovative senior-level course entitled "Concepts in Molecular
               Genetics" at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. The  effectiveness of
              tutorials is being monitored and improved through  student discuss ion groups.
              Once developed, the prototype software  will be promoted via demonstrations at
              the educational section of  meetings of biological societies (e.g. American
              Society for  Microbiology, Genetics Society of America, and American Society
              for  Biochemistry and Molecular Biology) and distributed broadly via 
              publishers.
