Abstract    :
              This project enhances undergraduate education at the university  through the
              development of a laboratory course in techniques in  molecular cell biology and
              protein biochemistry, and obtains  chromatography and electrophoresis equipment
              to support this  course.   The course provides students with hands-on
              experience  in protein chromatography, electrophoresis, and analysis of the 
              physical and enzymatic properties of a protein by purifying and  analyzing the
              enzyme tyrosinase in a multiweek integrated  experiment and then writing up the
              data as a paper in the  standard journal format.   Students gain extensive
              experience in  the preparation and operation of chromatography columns, 
              electrophoretic analysis of proteins, spectrophotometry, enzyme  assays, and
              kinetic analysis and in the analytical methods and  decision-making process
              that are used in research laboratories.    This experience provides students
              with a strong background for  entering graduate studies in cell and molecular
              biology.   In  addition, the new equipment supports labs in existing courses in
               molecular biology, microbiology and immunology, and cell biology.    Finally,
              this chromatography equipment enables students to  develop and perform
              undergraduate research projects that could  not be considered without this
              equipment.
