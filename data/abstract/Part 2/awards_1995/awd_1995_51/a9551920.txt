Abstract    :
              The project proposal will enhance pre-engineering instruction in  the following
              ways: (1) By extending a learning method based upon  microcomputer interfaced
              lab experiences.   The method has  already proven itself successful in
              pre-engineering physics  courses and now is being extended to an even greater
              number of  students in statics, dynamics, circuits, and other  pre-engineering
              classes.  (2) By providing an enriched lab  experience in the second year of
              engineering instruction.   This  instruction is built around a nearly "standard
              experience" of  engineering training stations common to most engineering 
              programs.   It also aids students greatly in career selections.   (3) By
              augmenting an already operating interactive TV network.    The project extends
              the ITV system into the pre-engineering lab  so that lab equipment,
              experiences, and learning can be shared  among two remote sites.
