                       Engineering    Title: Computer-Aided Data Acquisition and Control for
              Photonics    Education    Within the last decade there has been a significant
              increase in the  role of computers in the photonics laboratory. The use of
              computers  to perform data acquisition and control of laboratory optical 
              instrumentation, optical image processing, modeling, simulations,  numerical
              analysis and presentation capability, is now standard  procedure within the
              photonics industry. The Laser Optical  Engineering Technology (LOET) program
              has been utilizing computers  to accomplish a very small subset of the above
              mentioned tasks in  a number of LOET laboratory classes and with senior
              projects with  only three (3) Macintosh computers for laboratory use by the
              entire  cadre of LOET students. Important experiments that are absolutely 
              essential to a well-rounded optics education simply cannot be  performed due to
              the lack of sufficient computers, data acquisition  hardware, and software.
              Currently, no capability exists to do any  optical image processing. The
              objective of this grant request is to  acquire additional computers, CCD
              cameras, and data acquisition  hardware and software that will allow the LOET
              program to expand  its capability to run meaningful lab experiments which
              routinely  use such equipment. In addition, this grant would also allow the 
              LOET students to be exposed to experiments and techniques in  optical image
              processing, an important topic in modem optical  engineering. The equipment
              requested by this grant would be  configured within the existing LOET
              laboratory computer network in  such a manner as to be portable from one LOET
              laboratory to the  next. This hardware/software  would be utilized in many of
              the  existing LOET laboratory courses, solely for the purposes of 
              undergraduate education in photonics. The results obtained from  student
              laboratory experiments using the above mentioned equipment  will be
              disseminated at both national and regional ASEE and SPIE  conferences, as well
              as in the ASEE Journal of Engineering  Technology.
