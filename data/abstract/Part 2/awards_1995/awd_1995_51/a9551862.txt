                       Life Sciences    Title: Computerizing a Human Anatomy and Physiology
              Laboratory      The objective of this project is to give students experience
              with  computer equipment and to increase their familiarity with  physiology.  A
              Human Anatomy and Physiology laboratory is being  equipped with
              computer-interfaced data acquisition stations to  collect data from traditional
              physiology experiments such as muscle  contractions, nerve action potentials
              and respiratory movements.   Using appropriate software, data can be stored,
              analyzed,  manipulated and retrieved.  Also, the simulation capabilities of 
              the computer are being used for those experiments not easily  completed in a
              three-hour laboratory.
