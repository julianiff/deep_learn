Abstract    :
              Through this grant, the university is integrating a benchtop Gas 
              Chromatography/Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) system into sophomore  organic lecture
              courses and laboratories, the junior level  organic laboratory sequence,
              analytical and inorganic  laboratories, and the advanced
              physical/instrumental/analytical  laboratory, aided by the existing campuswide
              Novell computer  network.   The project is introducing new experiments to the 
              curriculum and dramatically improving existing experiments.   In  these
              laboratories, GC/MS enables students to identify unknowns  from their molecular
              ions, distinguish isomers from fragmentation  patterns, conduct EPA-approved
              analyses, and identify and  quantify complex product mixtures.   The GC/MS
              system is also  used in undergraduate research projects, where it substantially
               increases the sophistication and the rate at which product  analysis is
              performed.   This broad exposure provides a seamless  transition between
              introductory skills and advanced research  training.   Approximately 300
              chemistry, biochemistry, and  biology students use the instrument per year.
