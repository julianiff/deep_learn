Abstract    :
              This project establishes a microcomputer lab that will be used  primarily for
              enhancing the understanding of calculus for  preservice secondary math teachers
              and math science majors.  The  lab, which is an integral component of the
              calculus segments,  will be used in Calculus I, II, III, IV, A, and, B with
              plans to  expand its use to both precalculus and in-service courses for 
              secondary math teachers to become familiar with the integration  of technology
              into the math classroom.   The lab will be equipped  with 21 IBM PC 486 DX/66
              mhz computers running Derive math  software and Gryographic graphing software
              packages and linked  with Daedalus.   The goal is to integrate computer
              technology  into the math curriculum and to allow prospective teachers to 
              develop skills in using and applying computer technology in a  math
              problem-solving environment.
