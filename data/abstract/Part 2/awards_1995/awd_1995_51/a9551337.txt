Abstract    :
              This project uses the computer as a learning tool during in-class  instruction
              on a continuous basis, beginning with the critical  "gateway" courses
              Intermediate Algebra, Statistics, Trigonometry  and Calculus/Analytic Geometry.
                Students will use computer  software to explore concepts as they occur during
              instruction, to  perform arduous computation, and to produce graphs and
              numerical  tables quickly.   They collaborate on real world problems and 
              create written and graphical presentations for understanding  mathematics.  
              Project students construct mathematical meaning,  learn to monitor and control
              their own learning, have the  benefits of social interactions, and move back
              and forth between  symbolic, graphical and numerical representations of
              mathematical  problems and concepts.  A dedicated technological mathematics 
              classroom will be created during the summer of 1995.   It will be  equipped
              with 20 powerful networked student workstations running  sophisticated
              software; an instructor's workstation; a capable  fileserver; an overhead
              projector and LCD display; and  Mathematica, Maple, Geometer's Sketchpad, and
              other useful math  software.    Team members will evaluate the project by
              analyzing  student performance data, surveying student attitudes, and  studying
              further math course-taking by these students.   They  will disseminate their
              findings through papers, presentations at  conferences, and hands-on workshops
              in the laboratory for high  school and community college colleagues in math and
              other  scientific and technical disciplines.
