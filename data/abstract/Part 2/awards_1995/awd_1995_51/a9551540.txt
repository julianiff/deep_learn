Abstract    :
              The university is developing a set of new laboratory exercises  for its basic
              astronomy courses, which introduce students to  modern telescope automation and
              data acquisition techniques, and  upgrading and modernizing its telescope.  
              Included in the up-  grade is a new mechanical guiding system and a Cassegrain 
              secondary.   The modernization involves automating the drive  system and
              introducing digital optics, such as a CCD and digital  spectrograph.   These
              improvements can increase the interest that  minority students have in
              astronomy and in science in general.
