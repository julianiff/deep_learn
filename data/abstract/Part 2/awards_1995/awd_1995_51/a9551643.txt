Abstract    :
              The chemistry department is purchasing a modem high-field nuclear  magnetic
              resonance (NMR) spectrometer to enable its students to  learn modern techniques
              in structure determination.   The  instrument is being used at all levels of
              the curriculum and  leads students to a more sophisticated understanding of the
              power  of NMR techniques to unlock chemical secrets.   Beginning with  organic
              chemistry, students learn to interpret coupling patterns  and chemical shifts
              in 1H and 13C spectra to identify molecular  structure.   At the next level, in
              Instrumental Methods, the  introduction to Fourier transform and quantitative
              measurements  provides a theoretical basis for better understanding FT-NMR.   
              In upper-level courseq students gain experience in a rich array  of techniques
              available to a multinuclear high-field NMR.   For  instance, biochemistry
              students study the stereochemistry of an  enzymatic reaction and observe
              structural variations in protein  structures, and in physical chemistry they
              determine the kinetics  of an exchange reaction and study the thermodynamics of
              an  equilibrium reaction.   The presence of the FT-NMR spectrometer  enhances
              the undergraduate research program and is used for  routine analysis of
              products prepared in inorganic synthesis.
