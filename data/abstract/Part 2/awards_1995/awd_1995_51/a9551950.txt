                   Life Sciences    Title: Promoting Investigative Learning in Biology
              Laboratories     Using Computer-Based Data Acquisition   Systems  Teaching labs
              should be the intellectual catalysts of a curriculum,  where students
              experience all aspects of the scientific endeavor,  where they are challenged
              to confront their misconceptions about  the natural world, and where they learn
              to construct explanations  and meaning rather than find the "right" answers. In
              many  undergraduate labs the equipment used to collect data acts as a  barrier
              to student learning and participation. Often laboratory  protocols force
              students to focus on the technical aspects of data  collection while
              de-emphasizes the underlying scientific principles  being presented. To be
              intellectually involved student must  participate in investigations, that is,
              they must be involved in  the design of experiments and the interpretation of
              results.    The equipment requested in this proposal will make it possible to 
              enhance student learning in biology teaching labs by replacing  current analog
              devices, such as oscilloscopes and chart recorders  with computer-based tools
              for data acquisition. The development of  customized user interfaces and
              curricular materials designed to  take advantage of the computer-based
              equipment will: emphasize the  use of critical thinking skills by giving
              students the tools to  quickly analyze their data; break down obstacles to
              learning by  allowing students to focus important scientific concepts rather 
              than instrumentation per se; and bridge the gap between teaching  lab
              experiences and independent research opportunities by  encouraging
              investigative lab activities.    Materials necessary to  equip two lab rooms
              (serving 48-60 students)  with systems for electronic data acquisition and
              analysis will be  purchased. The equipment will be general enough to be used in
              a  wide variety of courses serving both biology majors and non-majors.
