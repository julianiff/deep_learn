Abstract    :
              The college is establishing a series of science intensive  curricula aimed at
              students with average academic ability and an  interest in science or
              engineering.   The curricula are designed  to facilitate students entering the
              workforce as skilled  technicians after 2 years of postsecondary education and
              an  industrial internship.   Alternatively, students can continue on  to
              complete their baccalaureate degree.   This grant is aiding in  the
              implementation of a Chemical Technology curriculum, while  enriching chemistry
              laboratory courses for both vocational and  transfer students.   The college is
              acquiring an Atomic  Absorption Spectrophotometer to complete the inventory for
              the  Chemical Technology curriculum.   Chemical technicians graduating  from
              the college master the operation of the following  instruments:  FTIR
              spectrophotometer, gas chromatograph, atomic  absorption spectrophotometer,
              high performance liquid  chromatograph, uv/vis spectrophotometer,
              electrophoretic  apparatus, ISE meters and, general laboratory apparatus like 
              balances, ovens, and incubators.
