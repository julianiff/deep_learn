Abstract    :
              Through this grant, the university is purchasing a 300-MHz NMR  spectrometer for
              laboratory curriculum development the  undergraduate program.   Following
              recent converqion to  microscale, new experiments, which require the
              sensitivity and  resolution of this high-field Fourier transform instrument,
              are  being introduced into the sophomore organic chemistry  laboratories.   In
              physical chemistry, experiments involving  relaxation times, NOESY techniques,
              kinetics, and equilibrium  studies are being introduced.   The advanced
              chemistry laboratory  involves both organic and inorganic projects.   The
              organic  projects incorporate F-19 NMR spectroscopy, as well as advanced  NMR
              techniques such as COSY, APT, HETCOR, and INADEQUATE  spectroscopy for the
              assignment of 1H and 13C spectra.   The  inorganic projects utilize 1H and 13C
              spectroscopy for equilibrium  studies and for structure determination of
              inorganic complexes.    In the NMR laboratory, a wide range of NMR topics are
              covered,  including NOE difference; INEPT, DEPT, and HETCORR spectroscopy; 
              decoupling experiments; and 31P and 77Se NMR.   The projects range  from
              natural product structure elucidation to the synthesis and  NMR analysis of
              inorganic compounds.   This instrument is also  used extensively in the
              undergraduate research program.
