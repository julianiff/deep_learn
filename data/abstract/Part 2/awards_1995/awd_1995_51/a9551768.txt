Abstract    :
              The university is developing a set of microcomputer-based  laboratory modules
              and establishing an undergraduate laboratory for  teaching operating systems
              and data-communications concepts.    The  laboratory consists of 11
              IBM-compatible microcomputers that  provide rapidly reconfigurable platforms
              for experimental  topologies.    A collection of laboratory exercises gives
              students  hands-on experience with operating systems, data communications,  and
              networks.    In these exercises students develop a better  understanding of the
              hardware and software used in computer  systems.
