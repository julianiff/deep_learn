Abstract    :
              Some of the most important advances in aquatic ecology in the  past two decades
              include the realization that carbon dynamics,  particularly organic carbon, and
              microbial processes contribute  significantly to the production and overall
              functioning of many  lakes, streams, and wetlands.   Furthermore, on a global
              basis,  the carbon cycle is profoundly influenced by emissions from  aquatic
              systems.   This project modernizes and enhances under-  graduate education in
              aquatic ecology with the use of equipment  that emphasizes the roles that
              fixation of inorganic carbon  (photosynthesis), degradation of organic carbon
              (decomposition),  and microbial utilization of organic carbon play in
              freshwater  systems.   Beyond providing new laboratory experiences for stu- 
              dents, the project engages students in the "process of science,"  both within
              and outside the classroom.   Students can use the new  equipment to ask
              numerous questions about important processes  involving the function and
              regulation of entire aquatic systems  and various freshwater organisms.   As a
              model program, this  project can influence the direction of limnological
              education in  the U.S.
