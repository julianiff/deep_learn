Abstract    :
              This project provides for the purchase of 16 compound light  microscopes, 16
              stereo dissecting microscopes, 4  spectrophotometers, and 4 laptop computers to
              equip General  Biology and General Chemistry course laboratories.   The new 
              equipment is the key ingredient in an expansion of the biology  major to a
              second campus.   The biology major has been offered  only at the main campus,
              greatly reducing the number of potential  students able to enter the sciences. 
               The expansion of the  biology major can channel students into the sciences who
              may not  have previously considered or who were unable to enroll in the 
              biology major.
