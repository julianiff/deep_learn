              Laboratory at              Texas A&M University-Kingsville    Funds are being
              requested to add equipment to a Plant Physiology  laboratory at Texas A&M
              University-Kingsville that is integral to  high school biology teacher
              preparation.. The equipment requested;  a Wescore Osmometer, Oxygen electrodes,
              monitors and chart  recorders, and a Sorvall RC-5C Centrifuge with a rotor adds
              a new  and advanced element to an already existing upper-level Plant 
              Physiology lab. In depth studies in Transpiration and Water  Relations,
              Photosynthesis, Enzyme Kinetics and Protein Purification  are now possible
              using the equipment requested. South Texas plants  are emphasized so that the
              students in this course preparing for  careers as high school teachers may
              better relate to, and  understand, the environment around them. The equipment
              is also  being used in Introductory Botany laboratory exercises, Cell  Biology
              labs and extensively, by undergraduate students, doing  directed research in
              the PI's laboratory.
