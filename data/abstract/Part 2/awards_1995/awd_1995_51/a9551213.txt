Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to create a Computational Chemistry  lab and to
              introduce computational chemistry throughout the  curriculum, via lab
              experiments and problem-set assignments.    The college is the purchasing a
              Silicon Graphics workstation,  eight Macintosh computers, a printer, and
              molecular modeling and  computational software.   The lab experiments
              demonstrate  computational chemistry applications in general, organic, 
              biochemistry, and physical chemistry.   This curricular  innovation allows the
              college to expand the scope and depth of  its laboratory program, thus
              enhancing the level of preparation  for science students.   An essential aspect
              of the curriculum  revision includes the use of the equipment in courses for 
              non-science-majors and for lectures and demonstrations in local  primary and
              secondary schools.   Curricular developments will be  shared with other
              institutions through lab manual exchanges,  faculty interactions, publications,
              and presentations at  scientific meetings.
