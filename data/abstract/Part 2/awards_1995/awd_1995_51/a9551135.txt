Abstract    :
              This project incorporates the use of Gas Chromatography/Mass  Spectrometry
              (GC/MS) into the undergraduate teaching and research  laboratories at the
              university.   GC/MS has proven to be an  extremely powerful tool for the
              analysis of complex mixtures of  unknowns from environmental, biochemical, and
              synthetic sources.    With the commercialization of inexpensive bench-top GC/MS
               instruments, this technique is now fully established as a routine  method of
              analysis and is now used in almost all environmental  testing laboratories and
              most organic chemistry laboratories.    This project introduces this powerful
              method of analysis to the  university's students through hands-on laboratory
              exercises and  undergraduate research projects.
