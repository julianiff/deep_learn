                     Life Sciences    Title: Human Physiology Laboratory improved through
              cooperative  learning    Declining resources, outdated equipment, and under
              prepared  students are problems facing many institutions across the country, 
              including Cabrillo College.  These problems have contributed to  students in
              Human Physiology laboratories becoming observers,  rather than active
              participants in laboratory experiments.  The  goal of this project is to
              provide more investigative and  cooperative learning experiences for students
              by: 1) restructuring  the curriculum to foster inquiry and teamwork; and 2)
              equipping  them with computer controlled data acquisition technology.  
              Students are learning science and critical thinking by actively  participating
              in hands-on laboratory exercises, working in small  groups to gather data,
              using computers to analyze the data, and  discussing and presenting their
              findings.    Computer workstations with accompanying data acquisition hardware 
              and software, and a computer network are being employed to  accomplish these
              goals.  In restructuring the curriculum to include  the new equipment, care is
              being taken to design a user-friendly  environment that encourages teamwork and
              active learning,  especially for under prepared students lacking a
              technological  background.  A thorough critique of this project and the results
              of  its evaluation will be presented and published nationally.
