Abstract    :
              Capitalizing on the students' interest in computers and modern  scientific
              equipment can lead to exciting experiments for the  introductory laboratory.  
              Microprocessor-based laboratories have  the potential to treat complex and
              interesting physics problems  at the lower levels through enhanced data taking
              and analysis and  through computer-aided instruction.   This project introduces
               modern physics into the laboratory curriculum of the calculus-  based, the
              algebra-based, and the "physics for poets" levels.    Modern Physics and
              Quantum Mechanics are being taught at these  introductory levels through the
              use of energy level diagrams and  other conceptual devices.   Spectroscopy and
              laser physics offer  a way to bring these concepts into the laboratory.   Such 
              laboratories as lifetime measurements, optogalvanic effect, and  fluorescence
              studies are being modified for use at these levels.    Monochrometers with
              computer interfaces and dye lasers serve as  the basis for this request since
              the microprocessor- based  laboratories are already integrated into the
              curriculum.   This  project has the potential to affect more than 300 students
              per  year directly.
