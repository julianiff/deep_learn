Abstract    :
              This project improves the undergraduate education in Computer-  Aided Design
              (CAD) application in Digital System Development  Process (problem formulation,
              design, implementation, and  testing) in the Department of Electrical
              Engineering and Computer  Science.   The objectives of this project are being
              achieved  through a structured laboratory development plan with a  rotational
              experiment at the end of each category of experiments.   Three categories of
              laboratory projects consist of introductory,  medium, and advanced experiments.
                In a rotational experiment,  student teams rotate the project during system
              development  process.   During time T(i+l) team X that formulated and designed 
              the project during T(i), will implement the design of team X-l.   During time
              T(i+2) team X tests the design of team X-2, which was  implemented by team X-l.
                This development plan will be  implemented in two courses.   The application
              of CAD methods in  course project work and laboratory projects in the
              undergraduate  logic design of digital systems, integrated-circuit-based system
               design, application, and testing is being increased over what is  presently
              offered.   Major pieces of equipment and software being  purchased include six
              IBM PC 486 or compatible along with  operating system software, six Workview
              educational CAD systems  from Viewogic Inc., six Xilinx core CAD (XACT)
              systems, Xilinx to  Workview interface (DS391), six HP 1651B logic analyzers,
              two  Alpro logic programmers, and one Labview class package.   All the 
              software and equipment is being used in a laboratory setting.
