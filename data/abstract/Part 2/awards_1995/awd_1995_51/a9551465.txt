Abstract    :
              Computer-automated data acquisition and automated experimental  control have
              revolutionized physics and engineering laboratory  methods over the past two
              decades.    The widespread use of the  technology and the recent development of
              powerful, user-friendly  software packages justifies and enables the effective
              teaching of  these techniques at the sophomore/junior level.   This project 
              implements a curriculum that combines the teaching of simple  computer
              automation techniques with conventional intermediate  level courses in
              electronics and modern physics.   A sound  pedagogical marriage can be
              achieved, so that the students  gradually learn about the "tool" that the
              computer represents,  while making increasingly sophisticated use of that tool
              to learn  about experimental physics.   Students learn about the tool in a 
              structured and pedagogically sound manner that encourages  interactive learning
              and confronts the student with a series of  questions of increasing complexity.
                The gradually acquired  skills are used to increase the efficiency of data
              collection in  the modern physics and electronics laboratory, and this allows 
              the students to spend more time focused on the meaning of the  results.   The
              acquired skills help students to participate in  meaningful, career-building
              internships in the middle of their  undergraduate years and to become effective
              undergraduate  researchers as they near graduation.   The project is being 
              implemented primarily with LabVIEW software, and with electronic  meters and
              sources interfaced through IEEE-488 based hardware.
