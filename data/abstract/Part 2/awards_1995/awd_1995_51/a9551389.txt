Abstract    :
              This project is introducing principles of solution chemistry,  including
              acid/base equilibria, precipitation,  oxidation/reduction and complexation
              reactions, in the context of  solving real-world bioanalytical and
              environmental problems, and  by integrating instrumental methods of analysis
              into a new  course.   To implement the new course, the project is purchasing 
              two automated CZE systems and four membrane liquid chromatography  systems.  
              The new course is based on applications modules.   All  activities including
              lectures and quantitative problem-solving  sections focus initially on two
              laboratory-based modules.   One  requires students to develop and implement a
              strategy for  assessing water quality in a river near campus.  The other 
              requires students to develop and optimize a chromatographic  method to isolate
              horse cytochrome c from impurities, develop a  spectrophotometric method to
              assess the success of their  purification method, examine the electrochemical
              properties of  the purified protein, and separate a mixture of cytochrome c 
              obtained from different animals.    The experiments incorporate  two recently
              developed separations techniques: capillary zone  electrophoresis (CZE) and
              moderate-pressure, membrane-based  liquid chromatography.
