Abstract    :
              This project is improving and upgrading the Electronics  Engineering Technology
              laboratory in order to provide  undergraduate students with high quality
              laboratory experiments  and exercises in the area of Digital Design and
              Advanced  Microprocessors.   The ultimate aim is to improve student 
              understanding of basic and advanced digital/microprocessor  technology by
              providing quality education in this field.   To  meet the challenges of the
              digital industry and to better prepare  students for the "real world", it is
              essential that students  should be well-versed in the use of commercially
              available  digital CAD tools (including hardware description languages) and 
              modern workstations.   This affords students the opportunity to  see the
              conceived hardware as a working model.  The project is  replacing the old
              Digital Design course with two new courses,  Digital Design 1 and 2, and adding
              a third course in Advanced  Microprocessors.   The addition of these courses is
              significantly  strengthening and improving the entire curriculum in electronics
               engineering technology.   Other courses including Advanced  Electronics 1 and
              2, the Senior Capstone Technology Project, and  Automatic Controls &
              Instrumentation  also directly benefit from  this project.   The laboratory
              contains six modern workstations,  four PC 's, four logic analyzers, and four
              In-Circuit  Microprocessor Emulators.   This project has the potential to 
              advance scientific education beyond the local setting.
