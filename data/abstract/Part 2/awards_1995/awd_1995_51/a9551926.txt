                              An Integrated Sequence of Laboratory Modules           The aim
              of this project is to develop integrated experimental  sequences that will hold
              the interest of students across a number  of laboratory courses.  We are
              developing a series of laboratory  experiments, using materials chemistry as a
              central theme.  The  students are synthesizing and characterizing organic and
              inorganic  materials, the syntheses being carried out in the general chemistry 
              and organic chemistry laboratories and the characterization of  these materials
              are being performed in the upper division  analytical, physical, inorganic and
              polymer laboratories. The  ceramic material alumina is synthesized by sol-gel
              methods and  characterized by X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis.
                A conjugated polymer, capable of electro-luminescence is being  prepared by
              condensation polymerization in aqueous media and  characterized by viscometry,
              thermogravimetric analysis,  differential scanning calorimetry and luminescence
              spectroscopy.
