Abstract    :
              The college is purchasing a Fourier Transform Infrared  Spectrometer (FT-IR) for
              the improvement of undergraduate  chemistry laboratories.   The instrument is
              used at all levels of  instruction including Introduction to Chemistry, as well
              as  General, Organic, Analytical, and Physical Chemistry.   In  addition the
              FT-IR is available for use in the college's outreach  program, which involves
              1-day visits by high school chemistry  classes to use laboratory facilities. 
              In comparison with the  older, dispersive technology, the FT-IR rapid-scanning
              ability  and reduced sample preparation minimizes student waiting time,  making
              possible more extensive experimentation during a  laboratory period.   This is
              especially important for the larger  lab sections with 15-20 students.   In
              intermediate-level  courses, students learn to use the unique computer-enhanced
               capabilities of the instrument, including displaying, zooming,  scaling,
              transforming, assigning, storing, and printing data.    Essential parameters of
              FT-IR being examined in these courses  include signal averaging, repetitive
              scanning, resolution  comparisons, standards collections, and search-match
              comparisons  with a spectral database.   The enhanced wavelength range and 
              resolution of allows students to study chemical mixtures.   The  upper-level
              Physical Chemistry course uses the instrument to  obtain molecular parameters,
              such as bond strength from  vibrational spectra of simple molecules.
