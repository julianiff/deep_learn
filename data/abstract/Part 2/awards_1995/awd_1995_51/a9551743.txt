Abstract    :
              This project is funding the purchase of field and laboratory  equipment to
              support environmental education at the university.    The equipment forms the
              core of the Environmental Instrumentation  Lab (EIL) for use by undergraduates
              in integrated Environmental  Geology and Biology courses and for B.S.  Thesis
              research in both  departments.   The EIL provides hands-on experience with the 
              sophisticated analytical tools commonly used in environmental  investigations. 
               Undergraduate students learn both abiotic and  biotic analytical field and
              laboratory methods.   These tools are  used in the characterization,
              assessment, and  restoration/management aspects of particular sites.   Results 
              from these investigations are synthesized to provide the basis  for long-term
              monitoring of the sites studied, thus providing a  real-world approach to
              environmental investigations that require  ecosystem level analyses.
