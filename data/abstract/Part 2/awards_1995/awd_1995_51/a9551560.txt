Abstract    :
              The project is designed to increase the involvement of  undergraduate sociology
              students in research.   Using MicroCase  software on a portable microcomputer
              with high quality projection  equipment, instructors test student-generated
              hypotheses in 11  substantive and methodological sociology classes.   Students
              also  participate in research by doing assignments and writing term  papers
              that involve testing hypotheses using microcomputers  located in a Social
              Science Computer Cluster.   The faculty  coordinates in selecting software so
              that the same software is  used across several courses.   For the first year
              and in  lower-division courses, simple software, such as MicroCase, is  being
              used.   In upper-division courses, software such as  SPSS-Windows, PC Globe,
              and U.S.  Census software for the CD-ROM  is being used.   This project funds
              the purchase of the  computers, software, and projection equipment that is
              necessary.    Involving students in research across the entire curriculum is 
              important because (a) students retain more of the content of the  courses,
              since they are active learners; (b) students are  challenged to think
              critically, and (c) students gain experience  and training they can use in a
              variety of occupations as  professional sociologists.
