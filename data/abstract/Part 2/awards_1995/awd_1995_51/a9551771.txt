Abstract    :
              This project introduces ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) techniques and  associated
              surface physics tools into the laboratory program.    An existing UHV system is
              being equipped with a  3-micrometer-resolution electron gun (to produce 
              secondary-electron and x-ray emission and allow SEM imaging), an  Ar ion gun
              (for sample sputter cleaning), and electron and x-ray  detectors, together with
              electronic units necessary for control  and measurement.   The resulting
              multipurpose facility enables  students to carry out a variety of observations
              and measurements,  including sample surface imaging and the study of electrons
              and  x-rays emitted when a clean surface is struck by an electron or  photon
              beam.   Existing photoelectric effect and x-ray spectrum  experiments in the
              sophomore Atomic and Nuclear Physics course  are being improved, new
              experiments on Auger spectroscopy and  electron field emission are being
              developed for the junior  Contemporary Experimental Physics course, and a
              variety of  student research projects are now possible in the junior-senior 
              Special Project laboratory.   The facility represents a unique  effort to
              provide research-style tools and techniques to students  while keeping costs
              far below those of high-performance  commercial equipment.
