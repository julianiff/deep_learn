Abstract    :
              Student research projects are extended mathematical and  scientific projects
              involving a variety of skills, frequently  using computer capabilities, and
              requiring a final written  report.   They are effective means of integrating
              technology in  larger classes.   The Department of Mathematics and Statistics
              is  implementing student research projects in multivariate calculus  for
              undergraduates as the initial step of the reform of its  entire mathematics
              curriculum.   This implementation is an  expansion of previous experiments in
              selected sections of the  multivariate calculus course.   A classroom
              laboratory is being  constructed with networked workstations and audiovisual 
              capability, initially serving about 150 calculus students each  semester.   As
              the program expands, the laboratory can also serve  students in undergraduate
              courses in linear algebra, differential  equations, and mathematical modeling. 
               The laboratory is a  center of efforts at the university to influence the
              direction of  calculus reform through workshop programs for in-service 
              teachers, programs in mathematics education for preservice  teachers, and
              collaboration with other institutions in the U.S.   Military Academy
              Consortium.
