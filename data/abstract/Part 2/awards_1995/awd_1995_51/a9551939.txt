                    Psychology      Title: Undergraduate Laboratory for Experimental Methods
              and        Research in Psychology    A computer laboratory for Experimental
              Methods and Research is  being planned, which will (1) introduce students to
              the fact that  psychological research can be as precise and rigorous as other 
              natural sciences and (2) integrate the core areas in experimental  psychology. 
              Students will perform 3 student-authored exercises,  requiring them to apply
              research methodology to psychological  research in the areas of (1) sensation
              and perception, (2)  cognitive processes and (3) learning and memory.  They may
              share  their experiments with other undergraduate psychology laboratories 
              networked through the Internet (MacLaboratory for Psychology  Project).  The
              equipment will serve approximately 240 students  during the first full year of
              operation.  The laboratory will also  have a multiplier effect by facilitating
              students' rigorous  application of experimental research methods to issues
              discussed  and examined in advanced course work.  The lab will also be used by 
              students for independent studies research, honors theses and an  advanced
              undergraduate computer applications course work.  The  laboratory serves the
              important function of integrating aspects of  our curriculum that are currently
              segregated, e.g., statistical  concepts, experimental research methodology and
              specific content  areas in our core experimental curriculum.
