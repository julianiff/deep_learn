              Modules for Large       Biology Courses           This project provides a
              stimulating, rigorous, and hands-on  laboratory experience by constructing
              innovative and  multifunctional computer lab modules that students in 
              prepharmacy, agriculture, and nursing and allied health fields  who require a
              solid foundation in biological principals would use  for data acquisition and
              analysis, lab extensions, simulations,  and delivery of instruction.  These Bio
              LabStations have been  developed in the Computer Resource Center for courses
              taught to  biology majors.  With some modification of the experiments  carried
              out with them, they can be used for these courses, as  well.  These Bio
              LabStations replace several pieces of equipment:  physiographs, oscilloscopes,
              pH meters, and oxygen meters, and  their function far surpasses that of this
              conventional equipment.   Although data can be collected with the conventional
              equipment,  the Bio LabStations not only perform this function, but they also 
              permit analysis of data, elaborate upon and extend the data  collection
              process, simulate living systems and processes,  deliver instruction, and
              provide for review and some testing.   They have the further advantage of
              presenting to the students one  basic apparatus to be mastered, rather than
              several.  Not having  to adjust to entirely new equipment with each new
              experiment  should enable them to focus better on the point of each 
              experiment.
