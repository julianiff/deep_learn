Abstract    :
              This project funds a multidisciplinary, multimedia, computer  laboratory that is
              used for instruction by the Departments of  Chemistry and Biological Sciences
              and the Science Education  Program.   Many notions in these disciplines,
              including those  that involve the three-dimensional structure of molecules and 
              energy minimizations, do not lend themselves to traditional lab  approaches and
              are better investigated through the use of  computer graphics and modeling.  
              This project addresses 5 areas  of curricular development: (1) the introduction
              of computer  graphics and molecular modeling into the curricula, (2) the use 
              of commercial and instructor-designed software for teaching  difficult concepts
              and for performing computer-simulated  experiments, (3) the development and
              introduction of pre- and  post-laboratory critical thinking exercises, (4) the
              introduction  of information retrieval technology to majors and to preservice 
              and in-service science teachers, and (5) the introduction of  preservice and
              in-service science teachers to the use of  multimedia in the classroom.   The
              new computer facility also  provides faculty and student access to shareware
              graphics,  tutorials, and databases through the Internet.
