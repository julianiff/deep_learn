Abstract    :
              The university's Advanced Computing Laboratory (a) introduces  parallel
              processing (PP) and high performance computing (HPC) into  a spectrum of
              mathematics and computer science (Math/CS) courses;  (b) increases the breadth
              and depth of undergraduate  multidisciplinary student research; and (c) creates
              and widely  distributes PP and HPC user guides specifically tailored to 
              undergraduate needs.   The equipment purchased through this grant  enables new
              instruction, creating two new courses and enhancing  seven existing Math/CS
              courses.   Student research, utilizing the  new laboratory, is integrated
              within the curriculum at three  levels, including the required multi-year
              seminar courses.    Drawing on their course and research experiences, students
              develop  user-friendly guides for PP machines and HPC software.   In  addition
              to its primary audience of Math/CS majors (including  pre-engineering and
              teacher education students), the laboratory  serves Biology and Chemistry
              majors.   The Ohio State University  provides a software library to facilitate
              student work in graphics  related projects.   As a result of the new laboratory
              and software  (a) graduates are better prepared for professional careers; (b) 
              students are more motivated to pursue graduate school; (c) students  assist in
              advancing scientific education through dissemination of  user guides and
              presentation of research findings at conferences,  in journals and through
              various on-line methods; (d) partnerships  with local companies are
              strengthened through collaborative  research projects; and (e) the course model
              can be replicated at  other institutions.
