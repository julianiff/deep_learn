Abstract    :
              This project updates and improves the curriculum and  instrumentation in the
              biology teaching labs at the college.    Five years ago, a three-phase plan was
              initiated to accomplish  this goal.   Phase 1 provided a high-speed network in
              biology.    Phase 2 developed faculty resources and provided a pilot lab for 
              testing the feasibility of this project.   Phase 3 provides 50%  of the
              teaching labs with a minimum of one workstation per two  students.   The
              Biology Department has been successfully  implementing Phases 1 and 2.   This
              project provides resources  for Phase 3.   The hardware and software obtained
              by this project  enable students to engage in hands-on experiments, reduce the 
              amount of time spent on equipment setup, analyze data more  effectively, work
              collaboratively in pairs, and use modern three-  dimensional anatomical
              software to extend their knowledge of  human anatomy.   This project enables
              development a dual-purpose  computer dry lab/wet lab with computer workstations
              that are  networked by high-speed Ethernet.   All workstations use a  product,
              Timbuktu, that allows each workstation to observe the  instructor's workstation
              or other student's workstations; all AV  workstations share a common
              audio/visual feed allowing images  (microscope, VHS tape deck) to be broadcast
              to each workstation;  and workstations have a pedestal-based computer stand
              that allows  the computer lab to be used either as a wet or dry lab.
