Abstract    :
              High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has become the most  widely used
              analytical separation technique.   To respond to this  trend, the university is
              purchasing two HPLCs for use in  engineering and environmental chemistry
              courses, including  organic chemistry and environmental chemistry labs,
              materials  characterization and adhesives labs for engineers, and automotive 
              engineering labs.   Approximately 700 students utilize the  equipment in these
              courses and labs.   An autosampler enables  handling large numbers of samples
              on either it or the HPLC.   New  experiments include analysis of nitrophenols
              and polymer  additives; characterization of polymers; analysis of plasticizers 
              and surface contaminants; analysis of trivalent and hexavalent  chromium
              species and of mono- and divalent cations by ion  chromatography; determination
              of ammonia in workplace atmospheres  and of EPA Water Matrix anions; analyses
              of carbonyl compounds,  polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons and, herbicides; and
              analysis  of automotive exhausts for carbonyl compounds.
