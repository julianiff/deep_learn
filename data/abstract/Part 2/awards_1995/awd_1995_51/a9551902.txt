                              Chemistry       Title: Addition of Fluorescence Spectroscopy to
              an Upper Division   Unified Laboratory Sequence           As part of a recent
              curriculum revision, the St. Edward's  Chemistry Department has instituted a
              three semester sequence of  upper division unified laboratory courses.  In
              contrast to past  practice, these courses are not connected with a particular
              lecture  course.  The first semester course consists of an introduction to 
              chemical instrumentation. As the student progresses through the  three semester
              sequence, the experiments increase in complexity and  sophistication until in
              the third semester the experiments consist  of projects that typically take
              several weeks to complete.         The Chemistry Department has a variety of
              modern  instrumentation available for undergraduate instruction and  research. 
              However, there are some substantial gaps in the  instrument collection that
              limit the types of experiments that can  be undertaken.  The purpose of this
              project is to incorporate  Fluorescence Spectroscopy into the laboratory
              sequence.  This   technique will be used for quantitative analysis, for
              measurement  of basic physical properties, and for study of reaction
              mechanisms.   This wide variety of applications will result in a substantial 
              increase in educational quality.
