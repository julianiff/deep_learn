Abstract    :
              Through this project, the Biology Department is introducing  quantitative light
              microscopy into the undergraduate curriculum.     The department has developed
              a comprehensive plan to expose  students to modern microscopy techniques with
              the use of a light  microscopy workstation.   This workstation exposes large
              numbers  of students to modern fluorescence imaging techniques to study 
              principles of cell and tissue organization and differentiation.    The major
              equipment items are an Olympus IMT-2 inverted  fluorescence microscope and
              Universal Imaging image analysis  system.   The Olympus IMT-2 inverted
              fluorescence microscope  provides a highly versatile work platform.   There are
              three  major component parts to the image analysis system: (1) Metamorph 
              Imaging System software and Pentium-based Workstation, (2)  Princeton
              Instruments cooled camera with software, and (3)  Textronix digital printer.  
              The system software runs under  Microsoft Windows 3.1 or higher, making the
              system one of the  easiest to use, even for undergraduate students.  
              Metamorph's  built-in processing and analysis tools allow one to acquire an 
              image, then enhance its contrast, sharpen, deconvolute,  reconstruct, and
              measure and quantify.   Implementation of this  project involves introducing a
              number of new laboratories in five  different courses:  Cell Biology,
              Histology, Developmental  Biology, Endocrinology, and Introductory Biology.
