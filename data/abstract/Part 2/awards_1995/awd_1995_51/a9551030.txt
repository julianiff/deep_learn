Abstract    :
              Through this project, an Engineering Computer Laboratory is being  established
              and operated by the campus Information Services  Department.   Because of lab
              location and program proximity,  chemical engineering and industrial
              engineering students are  expected to form the bulk of the students using this
              facility.    During periods when no engineering classes are scheduled, the 
              laboratory is available for use as an open lab for any student.    All chemical
              and industrial engineering majors are required to  use computers to complete
              their coursework, so all Chemical and  Engineering students benefit from this
              project.   Current  emphasis on computational access is integrated throughout
              the  curriculum, from the introductory material through design and  engineering
              applications.   Significant course development in the  engineering programs is
              also occurring as integrated access to  computer technology is available.  
              This laboratory establishes a  platform for the delivery of engineering courses
              that utilize  computer applications and provide an integrated design experience
               for all engineering students.
