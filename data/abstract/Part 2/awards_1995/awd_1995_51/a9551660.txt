Abstract    :
              A 1994 study by the Engineering Deans Council and Corporate  Roundtable of the
              American Society for Engineering Education  concluded, "Today, engineering
              colleges must not only provide  their graduates with intellectual development
              and superb  technical capabilities, but following industry's lead, those 
              colleges must educate their students to work as part of teams,  communicate
              well, and understand the economic, social,  environmental and international
              context of their professional  activities."  This college, in partnership with
              major engineering  universities, is in a position to accomplish this goal.  
              The  college is adding FORTRAN and Engineering Graphics to offer an  emphasis
              in pre-engineering.   This project implements the two  new courses and improves
              existing courses by providing computer  hardware and software.   With a
              pre-engineering program at the  college, students are able to transfer to three
              universities  without loss of credit.
