Abstract    :
              Laboratories, where students work in small groups, are ideally  suited to
              enhancing students' analytical skills.   Therefore,  this project (1) improves
              the quality of data gathered by  students in physiology and animal behavior
              laboratories, (2)  increases computer competency, and (3) improves critical
              thinking  skills by placing students into small discussion groups to decide 
              experimental protocol for each laboratory exercise.   The  majority of students
              affected by this project are majors in  biology and applied science, an
              interdisciplinary program that  prepares students for graduate programs in
              allied health fields.    This project funds the purchase of eight notebook
              computers  together with inkjet printers and appropriate software so that 
              students can collect and analyze data on physiological phenomena  such as skin
              temperature, lung volumes, muscle contraction, heart  rate/pulse, and small
              animal metabolism.   In one senior-level  class, Animal Physiology, the
              computers and printers can be  checked out to the students for the semester to
              use in  individually designed research projects.   In animal behavior 
              laboratories, the portability of the notebook computers  facilitates data
              collection in the field.   Because notebook  computers are so easily
              transferred among laboratory rooms, it is  expected that up to 200 students in
              35 laboratories in 7  different courses may benefit from the equipment.
