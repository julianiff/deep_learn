Abstract    :
              The Stull Observatory is a unique facility for the teaching of  astronomy to
              undergraduate students.   Equipped with telescopes  ranging from 9 inches to 32
              inches in aperture as well as CCD's  and computers for image processing, the
              observatory is presently  providing an excellent exposure to astronomy for
              nonscientists  and beginning science students.   This program enhances the 
              equipment and course offerings for the more advanced students.    As part of
              these efforts, computer control is being added to the  32-inch telescope,
              improving the observing aspects of the  program.   This retrofit reduces the
              amount of time needed to  acquire astronomical objects, enables rapid changing
              between  fields, and facilitates assembling mosaics of larger regions of  the
              sky.   In turn, these abilities increase the number of  objects that can be
              observed on a given night, allow improved  photometry, and facilitate rapid
              response to unusual targets of  opportunity such as supernovae and events first
              detected outside  the visible wavelengths.   This new system benefits the
              advanced  students in the upper-level laboratory course, their research and 
              senior projects, and the research projects they share with  faculty.   In
              addition to the more advanced students, we  anticipate that the telescope
              automation can also benefit the  beginning lab, physically disabled students,
              and area high  schools.
