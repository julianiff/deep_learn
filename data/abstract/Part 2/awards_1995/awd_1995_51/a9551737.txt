Abstract    :
              The equipment obtained through this project assists students and  faculty in
              furthering research goals by establishing a laboratory  of molecular ecology.  
              The faculty have devised a curriculum  that both encourages and requires
              students to become actively  involved in research.   In addition to the
              training of biology  majors in a broad assemblage of current molecular
              techniques, the  project focuses on experimental design and data analysis and 
              emphasizes problems relating to population biology, ecological  and
              evolutionary genetics, and phylogeny reconstruction.    Consequently, a broad
              suite of course offerings is affected,  including Ecology, Evolution, Genetics,
              and Molecular Biology.
