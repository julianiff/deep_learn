Abstract    :
              Future investigators in basia cell biology and in the health  professions will
              require more extensive training in molecular  biology than they have received
              in the past.   Many Biology and  Microbiology graduates could benefit from
              training in  contemporary methodologies used in research or diagnostic 
              settings.   To satisfy this need, the Division of Biology has  developed three
              capstone laboratory courses in Virology,  Immunology, and Molecular Genetics
              and has established a modern,  core facility for instruction of advanced
              juniors and seniors in  these molecular disciplines.   The objectives of this
              program are  to expand the range of material covered in the laboratory 
              curriculum and to increase the capacity of the core facility.    Cell transfer
              hoods and inverted and fluorescence microscopes  enable Virology and Immunology
              students to perform new exercises  efficiently in these laboratory courses.   A
              scintillation  counter permits students in the laboratory to use radioisotopes 
              in a safe and efficient manner.   Finally, new computers enable  students in
              Molecular Genetics to perform analysis of DNA  sequences, taking this class
              beyond the confines of a techniques  course.
