Abstract    :
              Laboratory and design education in mechanical engineering  programs in the U.S. 
              mostly focuses on steady-state processes.   This project incorporates the study
              of dynamic response of  thermal engineering systems into the upper-division
              laboratory  and design courses in mechanical engineering.   The project 
              enables students to learn fundamental concepts and reasons  concerning flow
              unsteadiness; to develop a better understanding  of the physical principles
              governing transient engineering  phenomena; and to study the dynamic response
              of thermal systems.   The implementation of this project improves the
              laboratory and  design education in transient studies of thermal systems.   The
               project and its educational benefits are of interest to other  engineering
              schools.    The new equipment includes a  reciprocating compressor, linear and
              nonlinear flowmeters,  pressure transducers, digital oscilloscopes, a
              computer-based  spectrum analyzer, and a torquemeter.   These devices are being
               assembled into a test rig where time-dependent flows, pressures,  torque,
              speed, and power are generated and studied.   The  instructional equipment is
              versatile and can be assembled into  other test apparatus for future laboratory
              and design projects.
