Abstract    :
              This project is purchasing a 200-MHz Fourier Transform nuclear  magnetic
              resonance (NMR) spectrometer.   This equipment allows  for the implementation
              of more sophisticated experiments, through  the cumulative development of
              concepts during the laboratory  sequence.   This project is also developing new
              experiments for  organic, inorganic, and physical teaching laboratories.   
              This  equipment purchase addresses a number of problems related to the  use of
              NMR as a teaching tool.   NMR is often considered an  organic technique, and
              students are generally not exposed to its  utility in other areas of chemistry.
                In addition,  non-chemistry-majors often do not use the technique after a 
              general introductory structural determination experiment during  which, with
              few exceptions, advanced techniques are not  introduced.
