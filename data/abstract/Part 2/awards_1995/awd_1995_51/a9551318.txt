Abstract    :
              The university is developing a course on the principles and  technology of
              multimedia, intended for juniors and seniors in  Computer Science and Computer
              Engineering.   This course has a  significant lab component to demonstrate
              major ideas, generate  enthusiasm, and develop hands-on skills.   Major
              subjects include  signal processing, compression, scheduling, data retrieval, 
              interface design, device interfacing, networks, media (sound,  music, voice,
              images, graphics, video), and applications  programming.   Equipment for this
              lab consists of networked  personal computers, programming and applications
              software, and  I/O devices.  The course's progress is being measured with the 
              help of a group of outside experts.   The materials developed in  this lab
              include lab exercises, training materials,  recommendations on hardware and
              software, and software for  functions that are not commercially available.  
              These materials  will be made available electronically to other teachers.
