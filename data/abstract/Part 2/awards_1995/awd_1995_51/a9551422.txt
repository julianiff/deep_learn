Abstract    :
              Understanding the environment and the many factors that must, of  necessity,
              contribute to decisions regarding the management of  the environment, depend on
              one's ability to access stored data.   The most effective way to make sense of
              this type of data is with  the system called Geographic Information Systems
              (GIS).   GIS is  an essential tool in the management of spacially distributed 
              information.   The students of today are the managers of  tomorrow; they must,
              therefore, be familiar with GIS.   This  project funds the software and
              instrumentation necessary for  students to learn the GIS applications.   In
              order to learn how  to use a data management system, students need to connect
              the  learning with a real-life application.   This project introduces  students
              to the GIS system in three introductory geology courses.    The courses have a
              steady high enrollment, they are populated by  students within the geology
              major and well as from other majors,  and they are popular choices to fulfill
              the college's general  education science requirements.
