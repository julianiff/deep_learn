Abstract    :
              This project provides a variety of laboratory experiences using  luminescent
              techniques that represent current practice in both  biology and chemistry.  
              The project funds the purchase of a  versatile emission spectrophotometer with
              a number of attachments  to enhance its applications.   Existing experiments
              are being  upgraded in the Biochemistry and Physical Chemistry Laboratories.   
              New experiments are being added in Molecular Biology and Plant  Physiology in
              addition to Polymer Chemistry.   The instrument can  also have a major impact
              on the research efforts of the three  principal investigators.
