              (MIND)               A Computer Labortory for Developmental   Mathematics      
                The Mathematical Interactive Network Design (MIND) project is  a computer
              laboratory designed for intensely interactive, but  easily constructed,
              multi-media instruction in developmental  mathematics.  The laboratory will
              consist of 20 Hewlett Packard 486  computer work stations networked via Novell
              software through an  existing local file server.  Using Visual Basic multimedia
              software  and object oriented programs developed by supervising instructors,  a
              central user interface allows access to, and control of, the  various
              instructional media.  Functions and rules, designed to be  independent of
              subject mater, are implemented using a decision  table processor.  A
              combination of interactive digitized video and  audio is integrated with
              graphics and text presentations.  The  students are provided with lecture,
              drill, problem solving, open  ended questions, review, and testing as deemed
              beneficial or  necessary.  The computer guides each student through an 
              individualized tutorial session.  The route taken by the student is  based upon
              that particular student's activities.  Therefore, each  student participates in
              a unique tutorial session geared to his  specific requirements and cognitive
              style.  Students who have  already utilized two of the currently available MIND
              mathematics  sessions responded positively to correction of their errors in 
              judgment and reasoning.  The ability of MIND to provide  constructive,
              instructive feedback creates a mentoring atmosphere  dramatically different
              from other developmental mathematics  tutorial softw are.
