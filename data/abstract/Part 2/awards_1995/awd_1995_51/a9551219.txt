Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to initiate a series of  laser-based experiments
              that are integrated into the physics and  chemistry programs.   This is
              accomplished by setting up a joint  laser laboratory for physics and chemistry
              that is solely  dedicated to housing lasers and related instrumentation.   
              Through the integration of laser-based experiments into the  undergraduate
              physics and chemistry curricula, students learn how  (1) to operate and
              characterize pulsed, continuous-wave (cw),  fixed frequency, and tunable
              lasers; (2) to investigate atomic  and molecular species using state-of-the-art
              techniques in linear  and nonlinear laser spectroscopy; (3) to utilize advanced
               instrumentation and detectors such as digital storage  oscilloscopes, fiber
              optics, linear photodiode arrays, and  scanning monochromators; and (4) to use
              a computer-interfaced  data acquisition system to both control an experiment
              and to  collect and analyze data.   The new experiments are designed to  be
              well-suited for undergraduate instruction in that they teach  important skills
              in laser spectroscopy, require a level of  analysis that is amenable to
              students, and provide "hands-on"  experience with lasers, instrumentation, and
              computer-interfaced  data acquisition.
