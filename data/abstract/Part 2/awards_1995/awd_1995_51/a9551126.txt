Abstract    :
              These hands-on laboratory exercises focus on the hydrology of a  small local
              watershed.   The new laboratories provide an  integrated, interdisciplinary
              approach that emphasizes direct  student involvement in the collection and
              analysis of  hydrological data.   The use of data from a familiar and 
              accessible field site adds to the student's knowledge of  hydrological
              principles and methods while at the same time  synthesizes their understanding
              of ecosystem function and value.   The surface-water monitoring equipment and
              recording rain gauge  provided through this project are used to monitor all
              significant  surface-water inflows and outflows from the field site.   The 
              surface-water monitoring equipment includes upgrades for two  existing gauging
              stations and monitoring systems for three new  gauges.   The recording rain
              gauge provides important rainfall  intensity and duration data that will be
              used in conjunction with  the surface water data.   The equipment and the data
              generated  from it are used repeatedly throughout the semester to study 
              various components of the hydrological system and to develop  simple models of
              system function.  These revised laboratory  experiences can affect about 250
              students over the next 5 years.
