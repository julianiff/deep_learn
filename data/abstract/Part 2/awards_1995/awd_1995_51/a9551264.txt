Abstract    :
              Through this project, three portable seismometers and  seismographs are
              purchased to enhance the teaching program in  geology and geophysics.   The
              equipment is used in three  different undergraduate geophysics course:  Field
              Geophysics,  where emphasis is on planning and executing a seismic experiment; 
              Applied Geophysics, where emphasis is on geotechnical  applications of
              earthquake seismology; and Geophysics and  Tectonics, where the major
              application is seismotectonics.   This  project involves 50-100 students per
              year from a wide variety of  disciplines (geology, geophysics, environmental
              studies,  engineering, physics, archeology).   In addition, the equipment  is
              used in classroom demonstrations and discussions in the  beginning introductory
              classes in geoscience, which currently  enroll 3000 students per year.
