Abstract    :
              As parallel computing is becoming a cost effective way to achieve  large
              performance gains, these high performance computing systems  are changing the
              nature of research and development across all  areas of science and
              engineering.   However, skilled scientists  are needed to exploit the
              opportunities that parallelism  presents, which mandates that the university
              modify its cur-  riculum to teach computer science, engineering, and other
              science  students to use this new technology effectively.    This grant 
              enables the university to establish a parallel computing  laboratory in the
              Department of Computer and Information  Sciences.   The project focuses on
              building a farm and a  dedicated cluster of isolated workstation-class
              microprocessors,  which enable students to exploit various paradigms of
              parallel  computing and provide accurate performance feedback.   This 
              laboratory creates the necessary environment for a sophomore-  level
              foundations course in parallel computing.   It also allows  for the integration
              of parallelism into existing core, and  advanced, computer science courses, as
              well as other science and  engineering courses.
