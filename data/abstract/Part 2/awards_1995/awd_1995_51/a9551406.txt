Abstract    :
              The school is acquiring a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)  spectrometer to help
              in meeting the goal of providing students  with the practical NMR laboratory
              experience necessary to make  them well-rounded chemists.   The project details
              a set of  learning experiences which are being integrated into all required 
              chemistry courses in years 2-5 of the chemistry program.    Students are
              learning about the use of NMR for one-dimensional  and multi-dimensional
              spectral interpretation, and studying  molecular dynamics, thermodynamics, and
              nuclei other than H1  (eg., C13, N15, P31).
