Abstract    :
              The Mechanical Engineering Laboratory at the university has the  primary
              responsibility for introducing mechanical engineering  undergraduates (nearly
              55 percent all engineering majors) to the  measurement and analysis of physical
              properties.   This one  semester laboratory is a hands-on experience.   It
              offers each of  the undergraduates an extensive exposure to basic issues of 
              measurement and experiment in the areas of dynamics, fluid  mechanics, statics,
              and thermodynamics.   While it is imperative  that students continue to be
              directly familiar with the  fundamental aspects of mechanical measurements, it
              is believed  that more needs to be done to educate them for the current state 
              of experimentation in industry and academia.   This project  augments the
              Mechanical Engineering Laboratory structure with the  following equipment:
              motion sensors and signal conditioners,  power supplies, oscilloscopes, data
              acquisition boards,  IBM-compatible 486 personal computers, and data analysis 
              software.
