Abstract    :
              This new interdisciplinary computer classroom uses a network to  link 24 student
              PCs, an instructor PC, a printer, a CD tower, and  a file server.   Several
              Windows statistics packages and  databases are installed to support training
              and interactive  learning.   A separately cabled visual/audio communication
              system  (VACS) permits the instructor to manipulate any or all student PC 
              displays, anonymously share student displays, or share the  instructor's VGA
              display.   The VACS requires no software, is  compatible with a variety of
              hardware, allows virtually  instantaneous sharing of screens without resolution
              loss, and is  well-suited for multimedia.   The VACS allows real-time testing, 
              formation of teams, audio communications, and video-to-VGA  conversion.   The
              interdisciplinary lab is shared by 21 courses  in 5 departments to teach basic
              and advanced statistics classes,  reaching over 1200 students per year.  
              Innovative uses include  helping students from several disciplines do original
              analyses  using visualization and graphics; access large, meaningful 
              databases; work in teams and interactive groups; make live  computer
              presentations; and compare features of alternative  statistical packages.   The
              classroom enables faculty to conduct  experiments in active learning with
              immediate feedback - regarded  by educators as a key to improving understanding
              and retention.
