Abstract    :
              The Department of Physics has recently revised the requirements  for the BA
              degree in physics in order to improve the preparation  of students planning
              careers in biological physics,  bioengineering, radiology, health physics, or
              medicine.   A  reduced number of physics courses permits the student to prepare
               for the above disciplines by taking elective chemistry and  biology courses.  
              To strengthen their preparation, the  department has added a Physics of
              Medicine and Biology course.    This project funds supporting laboratory
              experiments at each  level of our curriculum.   In the General Physics
              Laboratory, an  experiment on the fundamentals of ultrasound detection is being
               added.   This experiment is followed in the Intermediate  Laboratory with
              experiments on ultrasonic imaging and  velocimetry.   In the Advanced
              Laboratory, experiments exploring  the fundamentals of pulsed NMR are being
              added.   After doing  these experiments, the students go to the Medical School
              for  demonstrations and some measurements with clinical ultrasonic and  MRI
              instrumentation.   The addition of these experiments, and the  changes in our
              curriculum, will better prepare students for  career opportunities in
              physics-related fields.
