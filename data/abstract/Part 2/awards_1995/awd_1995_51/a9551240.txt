               Mathematics    Title: Project PreEMPT Tech:  Preparing Effective Mathematics  
                  Preservice Teachers with Technology    Computer technology impacts upon
              both the discipline and teaching  of mathematics.  Technology's capacity for
              graphical, symbolic, and  numerical manipulations signals a change in what it
              means to do  mathematics.  Technology provides new resources for learning.   In
               a laboratory setting, technology can foster investigation and  exploration of
              students' ideas.  Future mathematics teachers must  be able to use technology
              as a tool for both doing and teaching  mathematics.  Project PreEMPT Tech
              provides a technology rich  learning environment to support the development of
              secondary  mathematics majors.  The project builds upon several initiatives 
              within the department - a new course for preservice teachers,  integration of
              reform calculus materials and teaching methods, a  new emphasis on data
              analysis in statistics-have laid the  foundation for comprehensive use of that
              environment.  Because ISU  prepares more secondary mathematics teachers than
              any other  institution in the state of Illinois, this unified effort in 
              curriculum and technology advancement promises to have great  impact.
