Abstract    :
              The Natural Science Department is modernizing and strengthening  the
              experimental biology curricula.   Recent developments include  the
              establishment of a new Comparative Physiology course as a  component of several
              experimental and medically oriented  undergraduate programs.   Fulfillment of
              the teaching and  research goals of the university through these programs
              depend on  significant expansion of existing facilities.   This project 
              provides instruments including osmometers, a benchtop pH meter  and
              microelectrode, a portable pH meter and dissolved oxygen/BOD  Probe, a 10- g
              digital microbalance, a digital  humidity/temperature meter, and a Ward's
              Physiogrip  Muscle  Physiology System and square-wave stimulator.   New
              analytical  techniques and experimental approaches are being incorporated  into
              several interacting courses within the biology programs and  developed through
              planned collaborations with faculty at other  institutions.
