Abstract    :
              The college is integrating cell culture techniques into  functional biology
              laboratory curricula by developing a tissue  culture facility.   The
              introduction of these techniques is vital  to improving student comprehension
              of lecture material through  hands-on laboratory experiences.   Course work
              affected includes  Immunology, Cell Biology, and Developmental Biology; in
              addition,  the equipment enables students to perform a wide variety of  senior
              research projects in these areas.   The college's goal is  to provide in vitro
              models designed to enhance biology students'  understanding of immunity, cell
              physiology/biology, and molecular  biology.   A thorough understanding of these
              areas is critical  for undergraduates pursuing medical and research careers.  
              The  major equipment obtained through this project includes a laminar  flow
              hood, a climate controlled (CO2) incubator, a refrigerated  table-top
              centrifuge, a microplate reader, and an inverted  microscope.
