Abstract    :
              This project establishes a state-of-the-art Molecular Biology  Laboratory.   The
              laboratory is not only providing Biology and  Chemistry majors in-depth
              exposure to the rapidly expanding field  of molecular biology, but also
              providing an introduction to  nonmajors enrolled in the General Education
              class, Biological  Concepts.     The laboratory consists of six workstations;
              each  includes the equipment necessary to perform the following  contemporary
              experiments: structure, function, and isolation of  DNA; electrophoretic
              separation of proteins and DNA; molecular  weight determination; restriction
              nuclease mapping of DNA;  analysis of a genome segment; and recombinant DNA
              experiments.    The data resulting from these experiments are correlated and 
              analyzed utilizing the latest software programs.   Limited  instruction on the
              use of internet, modems, and GCG programs for  gene sequence analysis is also
              provided, with an indication of  the role they play in molecular biology.   The
              laboratory is  linked to the university-wide Novelle network.   This gives 
              access to the internet and data banks around the world.   This  laboratory
              enables the university to enhance the education  provided for its students in
              molecular biology.   Additionally,  the project provides students with a
              positive experience, perhaps  motivating them toward a career in the sciences. 
               For the  nonscience student, this laboratory makes the often bewildering 
              world of biotechnology more understandable, a must for everyone  in the world
              of tomorrmw.
