Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a 60-MHz Hitachi Model  R-1500 FT-NMR
              to improve the undergraduate chemistry laboratory  program by incorporating new
              or enhanced nuclear magnetic  resonance laboratory experiences within the
              existing framework of  the laboratory courses.   The NMR spectrometer is
              suitable for  teaching, routine analysis, and senior research applications.   
              Increasingly complex laboratory utilization of the instrument is  planned as
              the students progress from introductory organic  chemistry to instrumental
              analysis and physical chemistry and  finally to senior research applications.  
              These laboratory  experiences complement and supplement the students' past 
              laboratory experiences.
