Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to introduce every student in  developmental
              courses, Prealgebra, Introductory Algebra, and  Intermediate Algebra, to
              technology-based problem-solving  techniques using graphics calculators and/or
              computers.   Its  objectives are to 1) create a classroom environment that
              fosters  mathematical thinking verbally and in writing, and 2) demonstrate  to
              students, through technology, the link between analytical,  numerical, and
              graphical interpretations of concepts.  The  mathematics department is 1)
              developing technology-based  activities for our developmental courses, 2)
              securing the  necessary equipment and make it available in the classroom to 
              every instructor, 3) training all instructors, both full-time and  part-time,
              on the use of the equipment and provide ideas and  guidelines on how to use the
              equipment effectively, and 4) making  sure students have access to the
              technology both in and out of  the classroom.  This grant is funding equipment
              for 7 classrooms  with a teacher's station comprised of an overhead projector
              and  screen, networked computer, projection panel, graphics calculator 
              overhead viewer, and Calculator-Based Laboratory system with  multiple probes. 
               These classrooms support approximately 2,400  students each year.
