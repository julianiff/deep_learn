Abstract    :
                   Mathematical and numerical models play a very important role  in our
              understanding of biophysical processes in the nervous  system.  With the advent
              of high-speed graphics workstations and  new mathematical and numerical methods
              for describing complex  dynamical systems, many difficult problems in
              neuroscience can now  be addressed.  Coupled with the explosion in experimental
               neurobiological data, these new developments have lead to the  emergence of
              the rapidly growing field of computational  neuroscience which represents a
              remarkable coalition of  interrelated disciplines:  neurobiology, computer
              science,  biochemistry, artificial intelligence, molecular biology, 
              mathematics, psychology, physics, and philosophy.         The project lays the
              foundation for a Laboratory for  Computational Neuroscience at Wesleyan
              University.  Because of the  new computer technologies and new theoretical and
              numerical methods  for describing complex systems, this exciting
              interdisciplinary  field should be both accessible and appealing to
              undergraduate  students.  The proposed facility will provide the foundation for
               both undergraduate courses and research opportunities in the  modelling of
              neurobiological processes from the  electrophysiological behavior of single
              neurons to the  spatio-temporal patterns of activity in neural networks.  In 
              addition, these facilities will also be available for the further  development
              of courses and research projects in other  interdisciplinary areas of
              computational science.
