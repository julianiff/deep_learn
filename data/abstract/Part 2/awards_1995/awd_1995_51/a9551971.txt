Abstract    :
              The university is enhancing its Artificial Intelligence in  Manufacturing (AIM)
              laboratory by developing an Intelligent  Factory--one of three components in
              the AIM laboratory.   The  other two components of the laboratory are the
              previously created  Artificial Intelligence (AI) Processing Center and an
              Intelligent  Manufacturing Cell.   Hardware acquisitions for the Intelligent 
              Factory include a PC-based computer with a network to serve as  factory
              controller, an automated storage/retrieval system, two  robotic manipulators,
              and two additional PC-based computers.    This equipment is being combined with
              hardware that includes five  robotic manipulators with PC-based controllers, a
              computer  controlled conveyor system, and a vision system.   The  Intelligent
              Factory supports two courses:  Flexible Manufacturing  Systems and Improving
              Manufacturing with Artificial Intelligence  Techniques.   Students use the
              Intelligent Factory as an  independent facility and in conjunction with the AI
              Processing  Center.   Through these applications, students study the  operation
              and control of a realistic Computer Integrated  Manufacturing environment.  
              All three components of the AIM  laboratory are connected via a computer
              network.
