Abstract    :
              This project is purchasing a network of six graphics workstations  that,
              together with existing Macintosh and DEC computers, serves  as the basis for
              new course developments in the area of  computational chemistry within the
              undergraduate curriculum in  the chemistry department and the Pharmacology
              Program of the  biological sciences department.   The new computers are being 
              used in courses in Freshman chemistry, organic and advanced  organic chemistry,
              biochemistry, polymer chemistry, computational  chemistry, and upper-division
              pharmacology courses and are being  used to support undergraduate research
              projects in the academic  year and the summers.   The capabilities of this new 
              instrumentation makes it possible to communicate to students the  reality and
              excitement of modern developments in chemistry and to  involve these students
              in exercises and projects that will give  them "hands-on" access to these
              computational techniques as an  integral part of our undergraduate curriculum. 
               Thus far,  experimental courses in this area have been very enthusiastically 
              accepted by students and give students a set of skills that serve  them in
              graduate and professional schools and careers in the bulk  chemical and
              pharmaceutical industries.
