                         Physics         Title: Integration of Physics Experiments into the
              Life-Sciences             The purpose of this laboratory development project is
              the  design and implementation of a new physics laboratory curriculum  for
              students of the life sciences.  The reason for such a new  laboratory is to
              transform the laboratory into one of a greater  creativity, student
              involvement, and relevance.  The course is a  one year non-calculus based
              physics course for students with  prehealth and life science majors at the
              University of Southern  California (USC).  This course has high attendance with
              an annual  enrollment greater than 330 students increasing at the rate of 10% 
              per year.  While this course attempts to present physics in an  interesting
              way, the experiments are classical and are not  particularly related to the
              primary interests of our students.   This lack of relevance impedes the
              learning process.  The new  laboratory program has three components: new
              mechanics experiments  with increased student participation and involvement,
              fluid  mechanics experiments due to their importance for life sciences,  and
              electrophysics measurements on living systems, primitive  animals and finally
              the students themselves.  The new laboratory,  which is highly relevant to the
              primary interest of the students,  will be designed to achieve high student
              participation and interest  in physics.  It will be instrumented with high
              accuracy sensors and  their accompanying electronics.  The training of the
              students in  the use of such devices will be beneficial to them in preparing
              for  their professional careers.
