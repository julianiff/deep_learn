Abstract    :
              The interdisciplinary study of energy production and use presents  important
              opportunities to combine technical and liberal arts  education in the
              undergraduate curriculum.   In particular, the  recognition of energy
              conservation as a policy option and the  rise of an associated engineering
              subfield has raised a new range  of locally relevant questions for scientific,
              engineering,  political, and humanistic study and has also generated technical 
              means for investigating them inexpensively in real-world  situations.    The
              faculty responsible for energy studies at the  college is acquiring the
              capability for monitoring thermal and  electric energy flows in typical
              commercial and institutional  rooms to support (1) undergraduate study of basic
              physics and  engineering related to energy production and use, (2) student 
              experience with design of field investigations and deployment of 
              instrumentation, and (3) energy-related field projects for  upper-level
              undergraduates.
