              This project is designed to develop an computer laboratory  where simulation
              models can be used to create an active learning  environment for economics
              students.  The principal investigator has  written five software programs for
              economics courses at Pomona  College and will continue refining these programs
              and writing other  simulation software.  However, there is currently no place
              at the  college where economics students can use these programs with each 
              other and with their professors.  This project will develop a  computer
              laboratory (consisting of 5 IBM computers, 10 Macintoshes,  and 1 printer) in
              the building that houses the economics  department, so that students will be
              able to work on projects and  assignments together--learning from each other
              and building a  shared sense of accomplishment.
