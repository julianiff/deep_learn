Abstract    :
              This project is integrating nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)  theory and
              practice into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum.    Initial experiments in
              organic chemistry laboratories focus on  the interpretation of H1, C13, and NOE
              (Nuclear Overhauser Effect)  spectra and how to elucidate structure using
              information obtained  from chemical shifts, splitting patterns, coupling
              constants, and  integration ratios.   In subsequent coursework and
              laboratories,  the nature of the FT-NMR experiment and instrument operating 
              variables is being examined and problems involving reaction  kinetics, magnetic
              moments of paramagnetic compounds,  intramolecular rearrangements, 2-D methods,
              and other  applications are being studied.  Instruction of inexperienced 
              undergraduates in the operation of the FT-NMR spectrometer is  being augmented
              by video tapes that describe safety around  magnets, sample preparation,
              instrument setup with step-by-step  computer commands for the various
              experiments, data acquisition  and processing, and the presentation of the
              spectra.   The  department additionally is conducting an outreach program
              whereby  students at nearby colleges are invited to our campus for NMR 
              workshops and summer research opportunities.
