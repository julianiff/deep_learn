Abstract    :
              The Undergraduate Graphics Laboratory supports the new course, The  Science of
              Imaging: Computer Graphics for Non-Programmers, which  serves as an
              introduction to science for non-science-majors.   The  course is a vehicle for
              instilling in students the excitement of  mathematics and science and the
              importance of studying such  subjects in the liberal arts tradition.   The
              Science of Imaging  interweaves the theory of rendering graphical images with 
              appropriate experimentation and projects, enabling students to see  how science
              is done and how its theories can be applied.   The  rendering of realistic
              images is used to introduce the science and  mathematics on which graphics are
              based.  The course is not  intended to replace the students' need to take
              complete courses in  mathematics and/or science, but to provide motivation for
              students  to take the courses.
