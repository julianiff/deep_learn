Abstract    :
                   The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science is  establishing an
              Advanced Mathematics Computer Laboratory to  improve the instruction of the
              department's advanced mathematics  courses.  Through the use of software
              capable of performing  sophisticated numerical and symbolic computation, as
              well as  exceptional graphics, the math program is geatly improved.  The 
              Advanced Mathematics Computer Laboratory allows students to work  with
              technology not only in formal laboratory sessions, but  outside the classroom
              setting as well.  It also allows for and  promotes the continued development of
              innovative approaches to  mathematics education (instigated by the NSF-funded
              Computer  Calculus Project) through the use of technology at the  university.  
                  The Advanced Mathematics Computer Laboratory encourages and  supports the
              use of technology in mathematics.  In addition to  providing an environment for
              overcoming computational  difficulties and improving the visualization of
              solutions, the  laboratory enables students to gain a greater appreciation of 
              technology through the investigation of realistic applications in  such fields
              as medicine, sports science, economics, and biology.
