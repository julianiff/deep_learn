Abstract    :
              This project to combine Technology, Economics, Active learning,  and Mathematics
              (TEAM) integrates introductory economics with the  mathematics needed for
              economics.   The focus is on an active,  cooperative learning approach in which
              instruction in basic  economics is fully integrated with those mathematical
              topics  needed for understanding of economic concepts.   Twenty selected 
              College of Business freshmen explore, in a computer laboratory  setting and
              under the direction of the principal investigators,  major concepts of
              economics and apply suitable mathematical  tools.   They strengthen their
              understanding of the role of  mathematics in business and industry and broaden
              their  understanding of basic economics, and they present their findings  in a
              series of research reports.   TEAM meets daily in laboratory  and group
              problem-solving sessions to investigate a series of  economics questions and to
              learn to employ the mathematical and  computer methods required for their
              solution.   TEAM covers the  material normally presented in two semesters of
              introductory  economics as well as two required mathematics courses involving 
              fundamentals of calculus, the mathematics of finance, and  introductory
              statistics.
