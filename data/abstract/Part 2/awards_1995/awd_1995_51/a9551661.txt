Abstract    :
                   The university is creating two Mathematica Laboratories:  a  Calculus
              Laboratory to support its continued involvement in  testing materials for the
              Duke University/Bowdoin College Project  CALC program and an Applied
              Mathematics Laboratory to expand the  use of laboratory materials to
              mathematics majors.  The goals of  the project are as follows:  (1)
              Construction of an optimum  hardware/software teaching environment for a
              Mathematica Calculus  Lab where materials can be tested and modified and where 
              supplemental teaching materials can be developed.  (2)  Construction of an
              optimum independent study, Mathematica Applied  Mathematics Lab for use by
              mathematics majors, in which new  materials can be tested.  This lab is also
              used by science and  mathematics students already trained in the use of
              Mathematica.   (3) Dissemination of information, regarding issues of teaching 
              and learning mathematics in a laboratory environment, to  colleagues at the
              collegiate and pre-collegiate level.  (4)  Strengthening partnerships with two
              area high schools (one that  enrolls 90 percent minority students and one
              all-women  institution) to encourage the development and implementation of 
              mathematics reform curricula at the pre-collegiate level.   Evaluation will
              occur by continuing Student Attitude Surveys and  by the university
              participating in the Duke University evaluation  process:  "A Comparison of
              Reformed and Traditional Calculus."   Dissemination plans, beyond those
              associated with the  university's role as a test-site for Project CALC, include
              summer  workshops, presentations, and publications.
