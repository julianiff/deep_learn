Abstract    :
              This project funds improvements in the anthropology curriculum by  adding a
              methodological component to the curriculum through a new  class on field
              methods.   Although the new class can be directed  toward field methods of any
              of the four subdisciplines of  anthropology, here an archaeological perspective
              is used.   This  course increases the methodological content of the
              anthropology  program and offers the students an opportunity to develop the 
              skills necessary for doing fieldwork.   The course helps students  combine
              their knowledge of theoretical issues learned in the  classrooms with the
              realities of fieldwork.   The project funds  high technological equipment such
              as surveying equipment,  computers, a printer, and software packages.   The
              main aim of  the research is to study the development of social complexity and 
              its effect on prehistoric households in the archaeological site  of Tibes,
              Puerto Rico.   The research strategy has been designed  in stages starting with
              a pilot stage where the site is probed  and mapped.   The results of this
              initial stage are used to  refine the methodology, to decide the location of
              future  excavations, and to make the adjustments necessary to improve the 
              format of the course.   The second stage consists of more  extensive
              excavations in the areas selected the previous year.
