Abstract    :
              The university is creating a modern parallel computing laboratory  and a course
              on computational science.   The course introduces  undergraduates to the use of
              a high-speed parallel computer for  solving computationally intensive
              scientific problems and  introduces computer science students to scientific
              applications of  computing.   This new system enables the university to
              introduce  parallel computing into several other courses in the computer 
              science curriculum, e.g., graphics, algorithms, programming  languages, and
              operating systems.   The project director is  developing teaching materials,
              which will be disseminated to other  colleges and universities.  The laboratory
              consists of a 12-node  distributed memory parallel computer with a workstation
              as a host  machine.   Each node includes a powerful compute processor and is 
              combined with a T805 transputer as a communications processor.    The computer
              is accessible from the university's network of  workstations, for simultaneous
              use.
