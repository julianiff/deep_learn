Abstract    :
              The introduction of environmental trace analysis into the  curriculum of
              undergraduate biology and chemistry courses has  been made possible with the
              addition of a Gas Chromatograph/Mass  Spectrometer system (GC/MS).   The
              biology and chemistry  curriculums place a heavy emphasis on environmental and
              aquatic  analysis as a result of the location of the campus.   A GC/MS is 
              increasingly important for analysis of organics and, in  particular, trace
              organics in environmental samples.   The  fundamentals of GS/MS are introduced,
              followed by hands-on use of  the instrument in projects in Environmental
              Analysis, Organic  Chemistry, Marine Ecology, Freshwater Ecology and
              Instrumental  Analysis.   A total of seven courses are affected by this 
              project.   In addition, the GC/MS can be extensively used in  ongoing
              undergraduate research projects and a long-term project  to monitor the
              sediments and aquatic environment of Mt.  Hope  Bay.
