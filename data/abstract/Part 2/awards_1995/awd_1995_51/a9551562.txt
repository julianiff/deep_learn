              Development        Project at Queensborough Community   College         This
              project will facilitate and extend the implementation of  mathematics
              curriculum reform.  The immediate goals are to provide  the technological
              support required by our calculus curriculum  reforms and to make available
              computer assisted instruction (CAI)  as one of the alternative modes of
              instruction for our remedial  programs.  Pilot projects in calculus using such
              computer algebra  systems as Derive and Converge have been and are being
              conducted by  the faculty.  The expected outcome of this research will be the 
              addition of a computer laboratory component to all of the  pre-calculus and
              calculus courses.         Students in the pilot projects have been actively
              exploring  mathematical concepts analytically, graphically and numerically 
              through computer assignments and projects developed by our  instructors.  To a
              greater degree than ever before, they have been  able to delve sooner and more
              deeply into the how and why of  mathematical theory.  Our aim is to extend the
              benefits of such  instruction to all our students.         The goals of our
              reforms will be accomplished through the  establishment of a computer classroom
              as part of the ongoing  development of our Mathematics Learning Center.  The
              classroom will  have sufficient hardware and software to extend the innovative 
              modes of instruction.  from our pilot projects to all our calculus  courses and
              eventually to all our other course sequences.
