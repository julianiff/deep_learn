Abstract    :
              This project is purchasing laboratory equipment (HPLC, GC-MS) and  four 486 PC
              computers for the first course of a new integrated  laboratory sequence.  
              Laboratory experiments are organized  around themes that relate mathematical
              concepts to chemistry  through data analysis and focus on the analysis of
              natural  products with modern separation and spectroscopic methods.    MathCad
              is used extensively in the course, as is the Vemier Lab  Interface, a
              user-friendly computer interface for collecting and  displaying data in real
              time.   The laboratory experiments are  conducted in a "workshop" environment,
              where students take a more  active part in experimental design and data
              analysis.   The  experiments that utilize the new equipment take place in a
              five-  week integrated laboratory project at the end of the course.    The
              project involves the separation, purification, and analysis  by HPLC and GC-MS
              of some of the active components of the ginger  root.
