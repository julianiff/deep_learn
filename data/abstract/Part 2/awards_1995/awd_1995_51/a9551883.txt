               Physics         Title: Computer-Assisted Data Acquisition in  Introductory
              Physics  Laboratories at the University of Kansas and   Haskell Indian Nations
              University    The University of Kansas Department of Physics and Astronomy and 
              the Haskell Indian Nations University will collaborate on the  development of
              several computer-aided experiments for their  introductory physics
              laboratories.  These experiments will bolster  the instruction of concepts in
              mechanics, electrostatics, and  thermodynamics by allowing students to relate
              classroom formalism  directly to laboratory observations.  In developing the 
              experiments, which will be done by students enrolled in an advanced  design
              laboratory at the University of Kansas, an emphasis will be  placed on the
              pedagogy offered by the measurements.  The unique  situation, which has the
              nation's foremost Native American college  located next to a major research
              university, will be utilized by  initially introducing the experiments that are
              developed at Kansas  in the Haskell setting, where the class sizes are small
              and  individualized instruction is possible.  After the experimental 
              procedures are optimized at Haskell, the experiments will then be  incorporated
              into the Kansas sequence.  In addition to  strengthening the courses at both
              institutions, this partnership  should help Haskell students who wish to
              transfer to other  institutions through a better coordination of their syllabus
              with  that at Kansas.  At present, Haskell is unable to offer a  baccalaureate
              degree in the sciences.  Greater cultural diversity  in the sciences will be
              achieved at Kansas by attracting interested  students from the Haskell program.
