Abstract    :
              This project strives to improve the teaching of statistics  courses by allowing
              students to complete lab experiments and  projects, which will (1) emphasize
              working with real data, (2)  encourage exploration, conjectures, and discovery,
              and (3)  emphasize statistical concepts.   The funding is establishing a 
              30-station Macintosh Statistics Laboratory with CD-ROM capability  and the
              software needed to improve the statistics curriculum.
