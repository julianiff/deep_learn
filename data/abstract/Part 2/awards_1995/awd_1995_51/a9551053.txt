Abstract    :
              This project is developing a laboratory to house the  junior/senior level
              physical chemistry, instrumental analysis,  and polymer science labs.   These
              labs are being developed in  concert with other aspects of curriculum revision.
                The concept  for these labs is unique.   Laboratory experiments are being 
              grouped into clusters, with each cluster stressing a particular  chemical theme
              and individual experiments stressing a fundamental  principle.   Students are
              learning basic chemistry, and yet their  experiments will build on each other
              from one week to the next,  and even from one lab course to the next.   The
              flexibility to  continuously introduce or phase out experiments and
              experimental  clusters is built into the program.
