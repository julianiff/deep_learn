Abstract    :
              An integrated set of basic analytical and research tools is  necessary to
              improve laboratory education in the Environmental  Science Department.   This
              project introduces students to  techniques used in modern environmental
              analyses and provides  them with experience in multidisciplinary environmental 
              problem-solving -- essential elements of environmental science  education.   
              This project focuses on equipment needed for  standard environmental
              measurements on water and sediment as well  as ancillary equipment that enable
              students to have full use of a  recently acquired atomic absorption
              spectrometer.   Specifically,  this new equipment enables the department to (1)
              offer a new,  midlevel laboratory course on environmental methods and analysis,
               called "Environmental Measurements"; (2) establish facilities for  student
              research leading to the senior thesis and other projects;  and (3) enhance the
              laboratory accompanying the "Introduction to  Environmental Science" course
              that the department currently  offers.   Laboratory study focuses on local
              environments  including the Hudson River, the North River Sewage Treatment 
              Plant, and Black Rock Forest.
