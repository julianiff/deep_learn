Abstract    :
              About 1000 students enroll in Introductory Biology Laboratory II  every year.  
              For most of them, this is the last formal  scientific instruction they will
              have and the last chance  scientists have to produce scientifically literate
              citizens.    This project can improve students' understanding of, and attitude 
              toward, science by allowing them to do science; specifically, by  developing
              two process-driven introductory biology laboratory  exercises that emphasize
              experimentation.   The new exercises  replace traditional content-driven
              dissection exercises.  The  project also can increase students' appreciation of
              other  organisms, thus promoting responsible stewardship, by using a  variety
              of live fishes in one exercise and a variety of bird and  frog calls in the
              other exercise.  The two new laboratories  incorporate physics, mathematics,
              and computer technology into  the course.   New computer data acquisition
              systems detect and  measure electrical emissions of fish with an active
              electric  sense and detect and analyze frog and bird calls.
