Abstract    :
              This project develops robotic vision and thermal spray industrial  systems at
              the university's Robotics and Automation Laboratory.    This enhances both the
              teaching and training activity level to  incorporate actual industrial
              applications.    In order to  manufacture products competitively, engineering
              and engineering  technology students must have the technical skills and 
              appropriate methodology in order to design products and  applications in the
              modern automated industrial environment.    The new equipment directly affects
              robotics and automation,  computer-integrated manufacturing, system
              integration, control  systems, senior projects and thermal spray
              interdisciplinary  courses offered on these three campuses.   In addition, this
               equipment is part of the university's center for technical  education and
              distant learning to disseminate interactive  educational robotics courses to
              local universities, community  colleges, and nationwide audiences.
