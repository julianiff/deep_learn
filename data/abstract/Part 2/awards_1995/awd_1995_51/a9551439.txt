Abstract    :
              The proliferation of computing systems in nontechnical domains  has created a
              critical need for understanding principles of  software system design that
              incorporate human factors.   The  increasing demand for good software
              designers, coupled with the  lack of formalized knowledge about what
              constitutes good software  design principles, demands apprenticeship-like
              training methods  in which students engage in active learning by designing
              systems  and receiving feedback on those designs.   The Computer Science  and
              Engineering Department has offered courses in Human-Computer  Interaction,
              Software Engineering, and a Senior Project program  that prepare students for
              the growing demand for software  designers with knowledge of human factors.  
              This grant is  funding an innovative laboratory program to establish a 
              Multimedia Software Design Studio in which students learn by  actively
              designing and observing the designs of others.   The  studio uses multimedia
              technology to demonstrate design  principles.   The laboratory program gives
              students the  opportunity to design and evaluate their own work, as well as the
               work of others.   In order to provide a quality Software Design  Studio that
              supports active learning through design projects and  multimedia technology,
              the university is purchasing 14 computer  systems with multimedia capabilities
              and supporting software and  hardware.   Plans have been made to disseminate
              this work to the  computer science community.
