Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to establish a Real-Time Software  Development
              Laboratory (RTSDL) to provide undergraduate computer  science students with
              hands-on experience in computer interfacing,  hardware links, and the
              utilization of operating system resources  in time-critical application
              software development.  Progress in  computer applications has widened the gap
              between real-world  software development needs and most computer science
              programs, with  an emphasis on theoretical foundations and programming skills. 
                Industrial applications require knowledge of the software  development
              lifecycle for time-critical and reactive applications  and the ability to
              utilize operating system resources, including  interrupts, concurrence and
              scheduling, memory management,  non-standard input and output devices,
              interfacing different  systems, and programming platforms.
