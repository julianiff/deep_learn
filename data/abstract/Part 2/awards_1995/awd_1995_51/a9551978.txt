Abstract    :
                   The objective of the proposed project is to introduce the use  of molecular
              fluorescence technique into all levels of the  chemistry program at Regis
              College.  The solicited fluorescence  spectrometer will strengthen the
              laboratory courses in Analytical,  Physical and Biochemistry.  It will also
              contribute to our plans to  integrate Physical Chemistry with Instrumental
              Analysis.  The  proposed system will be primarily used for identification, 
              analysis, study of molecular dynamics and conformation of  biomolecules.  In
              Addition, it will advance several ongoing  biochemical research projects in
              which undergraduate students are  active participants.  Several new experiments
              have been proposed as  independent projects.  The requested instrument will
              enhance  student experience in consumer and environmental chemistry courses 
              generally taken by non-science majors.  Given our small class size  at Regis,
              each student in every advanced chemistry course will  benefit from hands-on
              experience with the fluorescence  spectrometer.
