Abstract    :
              Analytical aspects of undergraduate courses in environmental  studies, geology,
              chemistry, and biology can be substantially  strengthened with contemporary
              instrumentation for atomic  absorption spectrophotometry and ion
              chromatography.   These  instruments are being used in several courses,
              providing the  basis for field and laboratory activities in the 
              interdisciplinary course, Environmental Biogeochemistry.    Student-conducted
              class projects involve application of assays  using the new instruments to
              answer questions about constituency  of rainfall, stem flow, surface runoff,
              reservoir loading and  discharge, ground waters, soils, sediments, etc.   The 
              instruments are also being used in a large and expanding  undergraduate
              scientific research program in which many students'  projects rely on
              environmental analyses to answer both basic and  applied questions.
