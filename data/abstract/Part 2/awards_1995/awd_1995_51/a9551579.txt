Abstract    :
              The principal goal of this project is to develop a novel and  unique
              undergraduate laboratory in control system.   The  laboratory provides hands-on
              experience in the various steps of  control systems design, aids students in
              visualizing the abstract  concepts covered in a control system course,
              introduces students  to the practical aspects of design, and provides an avenue
              to  synthesize theoretical materials developed in a lecture.  This  project is
              setting up a computer-controlled control system design  laboratory to support
              undergraduate courses and design efforts.    The laboratory includes four novel
              design experiments,  specifically designed to stimulate the students and to 
              demonstrate the practical and analytical issues in control system  design and
              development.  The project is using this "hands-on"  integrated capability to
              provide a complete design and analysis  experience.   This includes model
              development and verification,  model simulation, control design, system
              implementation, and  verification of performance objectives.   Modifications to
               original designs can be included and parameters can be fine  tuned.   Students
              are confronted with design and analysis  activities similar to those faced by
              engineers in industry.
