Abstract    :
              The advances in optical materials and technology play an  important role in the
              future of undergraduate science and  engineering programs.   The Department of
              Physics and Applied  Optics offers three courses in the area of optical
              materials and  applications.   Hands-on experience with modern optics and its 
              related technology is essential in the motivation and training of  students in
              applied optics program.    Through this project, new  experiments enable
              students to grow and to examine electro-optic  and nonlinear crystals and
              organic polymer thin films.   These  laboratory experiments investigate three
              important aspects of  optical materials:  (1)  crystal fabrication, (2) optical
               properties, and (3) applications.   Some of these labs are  structured while
              some are open-ended labs to allow for the  students creativity.   The major
              instruments provided through  this project are (1) Neslab bath circulator and
              Diamond saw for  crystal fabrication, (2) polarization microscope, scanning 
              monochrometer, storage oscilloscope, and data acquisition system  for
              characterization of materials, and (3) laser diode system,  imaging system,
              high-speed detection system, and a HeNe laser for  the proposed applied
              experiments.   This equipment acquisition  provides undergraduates skills and
              experience in crystal growth,  concepts, and techniques that are utilized by
              researchers and  industries.
