Abstract    :
              This project builds a regional, multidisciplinary database on  local watersheds
              using the Geographic Information Systems (GIS)  platform.   The database
              supports three curricular innovations by  allowing the university to (1)
              introduce GIS as a novel  multidisciplinary tool to teach lower-division
              nonmajors about  science, (2) incorporate a variety of GIS applications by
              adding  Global Positioning Systems (GPS) technology to enhance upper- 
              division, field-based courses in the sciences, and (3) expand our  present GIS
              capability to support multidisciplinary and  collaborative undergraduate
              research.    Faculty and students  from four disciplines (Biology, Geography,
              Geology, Environmental  Health), with a combined population of over 700 majors,
               participate in this project.   The new equipment enables the  university to
              integrate GIS capabilities across multiple  disciplines, to provide reasonable
              access to the regional GIS  database by students and by faculty who will be
              involved in  curriculum development, and to provide the new technology to 
              gather primary site data in field-based courses and in student  research.
