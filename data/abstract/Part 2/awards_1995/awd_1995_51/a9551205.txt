Abstract    :
              This project has three specific goals that help the university  attract and
              retain chemistry/ biochemistry majors.   The hands-on  access to an FT-NMR is
              making laboratory experiences in organic  chemistry more representative of
              modern laboratory practices and  allowing greater innovation in the types of
              experience students  have.   Secondly, the FT-NMR can be used in subsequent 
              laboratories in analytical, biochemical, and physical chemistry.    Thus
              approximately 135 students can benefit from this instrument  every year.  
              Finally, the FT-NMR provides another tool in the  development of a pilot
              project of the vertically integrated  laboratory.   A vertically integrated
              laboratory is defined as  having three different class levels working together
              on a single  research project with assigned tasks determined by the student's 
              skill level.   Hence sophomore, junior, and senior students work  together as a
              team.   This project initially involves 16  students.   It is believed that the
              vertically integrated  laboratory creates a community of scholars that enhances
              critical  thinking skills through peer teaching and improves both  recruitment
              and retention of minority students.
