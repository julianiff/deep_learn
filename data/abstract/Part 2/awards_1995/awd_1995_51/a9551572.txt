Abstract    :
              As a result of the project, microcalorimetry is being integrated  into chemistry
              major laboratories.   Calorimetry is among the  most fundamental of physical
              measurements with extensive  applications to biological and materials
              chemistry.    Technological advances have so increased the sensitivity of 
              calorimetric measurements to the point where convenient studies  of the energy
              changes associated with living systems are possible  for such phenomena as
              membrane formation and phase  segregation/aggregation even with very small
              sample sizes.   The  initial experiments of the project allow students to grasp
              the  nature and importance of energy changes in biological systems by 
              determining enthalpies of micelle formation and the binding  constants of
              proteins and suitable ligands.   Moreover, we  students measure the heat
              capacity of the novel memory metal  alloy NiTi.   The improved instrumentation
              also enhances carbon  compounds and junior year laboratory programs through the
               introduction of purity determination using differential scanning  calorimetry
              as well as the range of independent research projects  for senior students.
