              This proposal will establish a Statistics Lab at Penn State  Eric.         The
              Behrend College, consisting of 15 PC's and several  peripherals, all networked
              together.  The lab will be used to  effectively teach advanced undergraduate
              statistics course make  full use of modern teaching tools for students in our
              newly created  statistics minor program.  When not scheduled for classes, the 
              facility will be used for undergraduate statistics research  projects and
              independent studies.  The Lab will mostly use the  free, public domain
              software, Lisp-Stat, augmented with  indigenously developed software to provide
              a complete  point-and-click interface.  The lab will directly affect courses in
               basic probability, regression, analysis of variance, multivariate  analysis
              and statistical simulation.  The materials developed under  this project are
              also expected to have an impact in larger basic  introductory statistics
              classes.  Dissemination plans include the  use of statlib and the
              World-Wide-Web for archiving newly developed  materials besides publications in
              journals and presentations at  professional meetings.
