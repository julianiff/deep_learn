Abstract    :
              This project funds a high-performance liquid chromatography  (HPLC) apparatus
              and a capillary electrophoresis (CE) system.    These bioanalytical separation
              instruments are being used in the  following undergraduate laboratories: 
              Biochemical and  Environmental Analysis, Instrumental Techniques, Biochemistry
              Lab  and Independent Study.  Initially students are exposed to these 
              instruments in the Biochemical and Environmental Analysis Lab,  where they
              carry out HPLC analysis of metabolically important  compounds in the urine or
              artificial sweeteners and additives in  beverages.   Students provide their own
              samples for the analysis.    A simple experiment on CE is being introduced to
              demonstrate the  power of protein separation using a coated capillary.   A
              protein  mixture consisting of lysozyme, ribonuclease A, cytochrome C, and 
              myoglobin may be readily separated using free-zone capillary  electrophoresis. 
               In Instrumental Techniques, the students learn  to optimize parameters and
              conditions to achieve high resolution  for separations on these instruments.  
              In Biochemistry Lab,  students are introduced to the field of experimental
              biochemistry  through a project study of a protein.   The availability of HPLC 
              and CE greatly affects the methods available for the preparation  of the
              protein and the analysis of the purity of the isolated  protein.   As time
              becomes available outside of the formal  courses, the instrument can also be
              used by students doing  various independent research projects which are
              required of  chemistry majors.
