Abstract    :
              Over 10 years ago, the development of the biology curriculum  began with the
              establishment of a new course, Methods in  Biological Research, and the
              institution of a research  curriculum.   Our investigative approach emphasizes
              creativity,  critical reasoning and problem solving, integration of writing, 
              mathematical and processing skills, and self-reliance.   However,  this program
              is at a very critical stage:  outfitting the  physiology laboratory with
              up-to-date, reliable, and computerized  equipment.   This project funds the
              purchase six computerized  physiology workstations.   Students are being
              provided with  quality and reliable equipment and moving forward with the 
              research curriculum.   The laboratory experience is taught from  an
              investigative perspective that utilizes exercise as a stress  to extend and
              integrate basic physiology.   The foundations of  physiological control
              mechanisms are provided during the lecture  course, while the lab experience
              emphasizes understanding the  effects of acute and chronic exercise on several
              body systems.    Student-driven experiments test the effects of exercise on 
              several systems.   During the final weeks of the course, students  plan and
              conduct research experiments, analyze data, and present  their findings at the
              Annual Physiology Poster Session.   This  project enables the university to
              incorporate computerized data  acquisition techniques and to develop
              scientifically and  computer-literate citizens of tomorrow.
