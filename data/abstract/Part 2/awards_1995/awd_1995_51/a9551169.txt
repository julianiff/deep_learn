Abstract    :
              Today, asphalt is no longer a simple mix of coarse and fine  aggregate and
              asphaltic cement.   Recyclables such as glass,  rubber tires, and reclaimed
              asphalt pavements (RAP) are being  added to the asphalt mixes.   In addition,
              different asphalt  binders, other than asphaltic cement, are being used to 
              accommodate these new recyclable materials while, at the same  time, adhering
              to specified criteria.   These performance-based  specifications will radically
              change how asphalt and asphalt  aggregate mixes are tested in the laboratory.  
              Existing asphalt  testing laboratories will need to retrofit, at substantial
              cost,  to meet the projected testing needs specified by SHRP.   In order  to
              prepare the undergraduate civil engineering student adequately  for these
              crucial technological changes in asphalt testing, the  university requires
              state-of-the-art equipment.
