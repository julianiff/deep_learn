Abstract    :
              Over the past 20 years, student interest in science, math, and  engineering
              (SME) education has dropped precipitously.    Additionally, retention is a
              continuing problem for SME majors; the  problem, according to research is not
              primarily the ability of  "switchers" but instead is the lack of a cooperative
              environment  and appropriate support.   This project uses an Honors program, 
              which has well prepared students and a demonstrated record of  retention, to
              assist in increasing SME interest and retention.    The project builds an
              Honors Communications and Simulation  Laboratory to house a revised Honors
              curriculum which immerses  freshman students in lab-based courses.   The
              primary course fall  term is a communications and simulation course in which
              students  actively learn communications and the pleasures of simulating 
              natural and imaginary phenomena.   The rest of the revised  curriculum uses the
              Lab as the primary classroom for the Program.   If an Honors program can be
              effectively used this way, it can have  national implications for how SME
              enrollments can be increased.
