Abstract    :
                   "Retooling Mathematics" addresses the modernization of the  undergraduate
              mathematics curriculum in a complex educational  system involving several
              hundred secondary schools, seven 2-year  colleges, and a large university.  The
              basic approach of this  project is the incremental implementation of
              precalculus and  calculus reform curricula at the University of Reform
              Movement,  with frequent assessments and dissemination of information,  coupled
              with continuing education courses to train secondary  school and 2-year college
              teachers.  Women and minorities are a  special focus of "Retooling
              Mathematics."  The project tracks how  these groups respond, both materially
              and by attitude, to the  reform curriculum relative to other students. 
              Finally, the  facility is used to enhance the undergraduate research program, 
              particularly the summer research programs for minorities and the  less
              privileged.
