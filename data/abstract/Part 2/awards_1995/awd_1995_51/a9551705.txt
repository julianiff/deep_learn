Abstract    :
                   The Mathematics Department at Western Piedmont Community  College requires
              extensive use of calculators in all transfer  mathematics courses.  College
              algebra students and calculus  students are required to have graphing
              calculators while other  students are required to have scientific calculators
              with linear  regression capability.  The integration of computer usage into the
               mathematics curriculum is the next logical step in the evolution of  the
              College's mathematics program.  To achieve this goal, the  Western Piedmont
              Community College Computer Enhanced Mathematics  Instruction Project (CEMIP)
              will enable the department to equip a  multipurpose instructional computer
              laboratory by providing  matching funds for the purchase of 21 microcomputers,
              four  printers, a VGA liquid display panel with-an overhead projector,  and
              site licenses for three commercial software packages DERIVE,  MAPLE, and
              MINITAB.  The lab will be used as a teaching classroom,  an assigned computer
              usage lab, and limited-access lab open for  selected mathematics students. 
              Initially, the project will  concentrate on incorporating computer usage into
              calculus and  statistics instruction, with the ultimate goal of having computer
               usage integrated into the entire mathematics curriculum.
