Abstract    :
              Through this project, the Computer Technology Department is  establishing a
              Novell network system, which is currently the  industry standard.   The
              newtwork resembles a real-world local area  network, consisting of 18 IBM PCs
              and 3 Power MAC workstations, as  well as several printers.   The laboratory
              supports four core  courses in a new 1-year certificate program:  Introduction
              to  Networks, Network Administration, Advanced Network Administration,  and
              Fundamentals of Internet Work.   The college also offers a  62-credit associate
              degree program in Computer Networks.   Eligible  students include:  currently
              employed computer operators requiring  training for career advancement, high
              school graduates, and clients  under the Job Training Partnership Act.  
              Information about the  project and its outcomes will be widely shared through
              the American  Association of Community Colleges, the New England Board of
              Higher  Education, Internet, and a summer Tech Prep institute for high  school
              teachers.
