Abstract    :
              This project adds equipment to support a restructured General  Biology course
              for science majors.   Over the past two years, the  Biology Department has
              successfully revised the two-semester  General Biology course to focus around
              themes, to be less lecture  intensive, and to emphasize student-directed
              research projects.    Enrollment has increased from an average of 54 students
              per  semester to 80, and the retention rate of biology majors has  increased.  
              While development of an experiential, investigative,  hands-on approach to
              science has been successful, labs had  insufficient equipment to support the
              semester-long research  projects that had been integrated into the course
              structure.    This project creates six workstations for use by each of the lab 
              sections of 20 students.   Each workstation is used by teams of  three to four
              students.   Each team is provided with a Ph meter,  a spectrophotometer, stereo
              microscopes with dual illumination, a  top loader balance, and a Macintosh
              Power PC.   In addition, a  new incubator and two growth chambers are available
              to all  project teams and, when not in use, to other biology majors  conducting
              research projects.
