Abstract    :
              The university is purchasing a laser setup and computerized  detector system to
              allow the introduction of representative  examples of modern laser spectroscopy
              into the undergraduate  program.   Components that accommodate a wide range of
              projects  have been selected and help demonstrate concepts that are unique  to
              laser spectroscopy.   These experiments use a pulsed  nitrogen-tunable dye
              laser module to generate excited state  molecules.   A computer-interfaced
              oscilloscope and  photomultiplier monitor the decay in emission following a
              laser  pulse.   In other experiments, a laboratory computer controls  either
              the laser frequency or an emission monochromator and  processes signals from a
              gated detector to obtain excitation,  fluorescence emission, or Raman spectra. 
               Students use a visual  programming language (Labview) to design software for
              computer  control and integration of the modular components, data  acquisition,
              and signal processing.   These projects have been  selected to reinforce
              quantum mechanical concepts developed in  Physical Chemistry II and to provide
              undergraduate students  experience and research opportunities with modern
              physical  chemistry tools.
