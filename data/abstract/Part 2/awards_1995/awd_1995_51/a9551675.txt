                        Life Sciences    Title: Incorporating Modern Molecular Biology Lab
              Activities into   the Undergraduate Curriculum    The singular purpose of the
              project is to enhance the undergraduate  students' understanding and
              experiences in biology through the  incorporation of modern molecular biology
              experiments and  activities into courses in their programs. The few current lab
               experiences in this area point to an evident curricular need for  updating the
              program. Modification of an existing course together  with the development and
              implementation of two new courses enables  the students to have meaningful
              hands-on experiences with molecular  biology equipment and techniques.
              Depending on the course level,  students will understand and do some or all of
              the following  procedures: isolate and visualize DNA through agarose 
              electrophoresis, isolate plasmids and cut with restriction enzymes,  transform
              bacteria, clone and subclone genes, amplify DNA, utilize  computer analysis.
              The molecular biology equipment associated with  this project (micropipetters,
              microcentrifuges, electrophoresis  apparati, UV transilluminators, PCR
              equipment, a computer station,  and other supporting equipment) is essential
              for students to  acquire the desired hands-on familiarity with modern molecular
               technologies as they develop the conceptual framework of this  discipline.The
              course ehhancements are targeted to a large number  of future teachers, health
              care workers and future research  scientists.
