Abstract    :
              This project is developing a program to incorporate modern  applications of
              separation science in the undergraduate  curriculum.   This includes the
              acquisition of new capillary  electrophoresis (CE) instrumentation and new
              liquid  chromatography (HPLC) capabilities, to continue the upgrade of 
              analytical instrumentation in the teaching program.   New  experiments are
              being developed, along the following lines, for  students at the junior and
              senior levels:  (a) CE separation and  quantitation of biologically significant
              molecules of high  molecular weight (the instrumentation also provides students
              with  their first exposure to analysis with nanogram sample  quantities); (b)
              separation and quantitation of pharmaceutical  compounds by liquid
              chromatography (photodiode array detection  allows students to carry out peak
              purity analysis); and (c)  optimization of solvent composition and flow rate in
              LC to  determine the C60/C70 ratio in locally produced fullerene samples.   
              This program allows for the continued development of new  experiments, designed
              to target the fastest growing segment of  our student population   the life
              sciences oriented students.
