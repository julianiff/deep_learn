                            Geography    Title: A Digital Terain Analysis Component for
              Extending and        Integrating a Geography Curriculum           This project
              expands and further integrates the  undergraduate curriculum in geography
              through the addition of a  digital terrain analysis initiative.  The expansion,
              made  possible through a redesign of the curriculum, occurs through 
              demonstrations and carefully structured laboratory exercises in  introductory
              and intermediate courses in physical geography and  geographical methods and
              through a new course, Digital Terrain  Analysis, which will integrate these two
              areas at the advanced  level.  The course provides experimentation and project
              work  using the new capabilities afforded by the new equipment and  software. 
              By addressing the curriculum at all levels and in two  emphasis areas, the
              project will provide for a coherent and  integrated understanding of new
              material on the part of the  students.  Additionally, the project will enhance
              the experience  and knowledge of students who are training to be teachers and 
              should give them the background they need to take thee condepts  of diigital
              terrain analysis into schools.  The project involves  the purchase of a
              Unix-based server and four Unix-based  workstations, with software from ERDAS,
              Inc., and Environmental  Systems Research Institute (ESRI), for the efficient
              provision of  advanced capabilities in terrain data interpretation, collection,
               management, and visualization.  An additional PC-based  workstation will be
              set up to demonstrate lower cost software  (from R-WEL, Inc., Golden Software,
              and the Idrisi Project) to  teachers-in-training so that they might be
              encouraged to use the  software in their own classrooms.  The effectiveness of
              the  project in expanding the  knowledge and skills of the students  will be
              evaluated through supplemental course evaluations and  focus groups, the
              results of which will be presented to  colleagues in professional
              organizations.
