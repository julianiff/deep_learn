Abstract    :
              The Biology Department is obtaining equipment to establish a Cell  Culture
              Laboratory for advanced, undergraduate biology courses in  Cell Biology,
              Immunology and Hematology, and Investigations  courses (1) to enable current
              work to be done much more as  investigatory research and (2) to enable
              additional types of cell  culture work to be undertaken.   These courses
              emphasize an  investigative, hands-on pedagogical strategy in which students 
              are introduced to basic cell culture techniques, then required to  design and
              conduct subsequent experiments, analyze data, and  communicate their results.  
              In Cell Biology, students are able  to propagate their cell lines for
              investigations into cellular  responses to varied stimuli producing dynamic
              changes and  adaptations in (1) cell morphology, (2) growth, (3) plating and 
              transfection efficiencies, and (4) comparisons of serum protein  synthesis by
              primary hepatocyte cultures with hepatoma lines.    In Immunology and
              Hematology, students are able to address  questions of immune cell (1)
              activation, (2) surface receptor  activation and signal transduction, and (3)
              cellular cooperation.    A 1200-1400-ft2 Cell Culture Laboratory is being
              equipped with  four Class II biological safety cabinets, six CO2 incubators, 
              inverted phase microscopes, centrifuges, and related equipment to  provide a
              dedicated laboratory for  16-student-capacity  laboratories.   This laboratory
              provides opportunities for  approximately 50 upper-level biology students per
              year to develop  detailed investigations into human and animal cell biology by 
              greatly expanding the range of techniques currently possible.
