              Mathematics  Classes    The mathematics faculty of the University of Redlands
              is converting  its Pre-Calculus, Probability Theory, Mathematical Statistics, 
              Numerical Analysis, College Geometry, and Number Theory courses  from lecture
              courses to laboratory courses featuring  discovery-based learning.  A new
              course, Introduction to  Mathematical Modeling, also uses a discovery-based
              approach.  The  primary discovery tool for each of these courses is the
              computer.   This projects equips each of the classrooms in which these courses 
              are taught with one PowerMacintosh 7100/66AV computer for each two  students.  
                 The Redlands project reflects its faculty's belief, shared by  mathematics
              educators nationwide, that students learn best by  actively discovering and
              exploring mathematical concepts.  The  computer allows students to visualize
              and explore complex models  and data sets not tractable using more traditional
              algebraic or  analytic approaches.
