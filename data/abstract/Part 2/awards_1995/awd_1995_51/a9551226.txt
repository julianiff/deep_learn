Abstract    :
              The university has identified the need to provide real-life field  experiences
              using modern data gathering equipment for the Biology  and Environmental
              Physical Science classes.   This project adds a  global positioning system
              (GPS) component to the laboratory  sections of seven classes that have a field
              component.   The  classes team Plant Taxonomy/Agrostology students with Ecology
               students for vegetation identification and mapping exercises.    Environmental
              Geology, Environmental Geochemistry, and  Hydrogeology students compile
              geologic and hydrologic data to map  potential land use and to determine
              sources and movements of  pollutants.   Students present their results at joint
              poster  sessions at the conclusion of the semester.   Selected students 
              present their results at regional meetings or at the Council on  Undergraduate
              Research meeting.     Field sites are being chosen  in conjunction with the
              U.S.   Forest Service; the South Dakota  Game, Fish, and Parks Department; and
              The Nature Conservancy.    Field data generated by the classes are being shared
              with these  and any other interested institutions.
