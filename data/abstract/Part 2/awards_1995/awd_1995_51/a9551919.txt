              Laboratories, each equipped with high end PCs, are being  established for use
              by students pursuing an exploration-based  mathematics minor.  The laboratories
              are being used primarily for  two first year mathematics courses, Geometry and
              Number Theory, and  a sophomore level course, Laboratory in Mathematical 
              Experimentation.  The laboratories allow for the enhancement of  exploratory
              components of the first year courses and provides  platforms for
              computationally intensive projects in the Laboratory  course.  These three
              courses form the heart of alternative  mathematics minor which stresses
              exploration, conjecture and  argument/proof and which does not require passage
              through the  traditional three semester calculus sequence.
