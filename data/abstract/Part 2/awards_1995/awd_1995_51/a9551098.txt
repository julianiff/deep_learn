Abstract    :
              Through this grant, the development of a Multimedia-Based Computer-  Assisted
              Learning Laboratory (MCALL) is used as a pilot project to  improve the
              educational quality of undergraduates in science  programs.   The new lab can
              achieve the following educational  objectives:  (1) improve instruction and
              learning in biology,  chemistry, physics, and computer science, (2) develop
              advanced  skilled students in the area of multimedia, networking, and 
              Graphical User Interface (GUI), and (3) train faculty to do  computer-assisted
              teaching.  The lab, MCALL, is being equipped with  networked multimedia
              computer systems loaded with computer-assisted  learning software.  It serves a
              selective group of undergraduate  students in biology, chemistry, physics, and
              computer science.
