Abstract    :
              Improvement in the quality of education in geophysical  exploration of the
              shallow subsurface is realized through the  acquisition of up-to-date
              remote-sensing geophysical  instrumentation.   This equipment is used initially
              in the  development of an environmental geophysical field site and 
              subsequently is integrated into the geologic field courses.    This new site
              provides an area where students can be taught  geophysical and hydrological
              techniques within a controlled  environment.   The geology department teaches
              inquiry-based  science courses with the main objective of problem solving.  
              The  new instrumentation enables the faculty to upgrade geophysical 
              instruction in the introductory and upper-division courses as  well as student
              research programs.   The new equipment includes   (1) a proton precession
              magnetometer with a gradiometer, (2) a  12-channel hammer seismic unit, (3) an
              electrical resistivity  unit, (4) a ground penetrating radar system with
              antennae, (5)  water wells for monitoring purposes, (6) a portable generator, 
              and (7) a computer system with plotter.   With this new  equipment, the
              department is able to instruct students in modern  remote-sensing techniques
              including computer-assisted data  interpretation and analysis.   Additionally,
              students can,  through courses and research, obtain the technological skills 
              needed to address current human impact on the environment.
