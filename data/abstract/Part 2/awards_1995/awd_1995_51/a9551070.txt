Abstract    :
              Through this project, four Lafayette Instrument Minigraph  computer interfaces
              and four P-60 Pentium IBM-compatible computer  systems linked by a Pentium/66
              network server are purchased in  order to enhance the laboratory component of
              the curriculum of  the Psychology Department.   The most important improvements
              are  for the laboratory course, Physiological Psychology, in which the 
              equipment can be used regularly during weekly laboratory sessions  that are
              limited to 12 students per session.   These computers  permit hands-on
              experience with state-of-the-art technology for  laboratory exercises and
              provide students with expertise in  computer-based research technology in
              psychophysiology.   The  computers also enhance utilization of existing
              polygraphic  equipment by permitting real-time analysis and automated data 
              processing of physiological measures recorded in laboratory  exercises.   In
              addition, sophisticated data collection and  analysis by senior students
              completing independent study projects  is made possible.   These improvements
              in the education of  psychology majors better prepare them for research in
              graduate  school.
