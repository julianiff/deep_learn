              the             Undergraduate Chemistry Curriculum           The equipment
              purchase will allow us to introduce laser  technologies into our chemistry
              curriculum.  Hamline University  will acquire lasers, light detecting
              components, a monochromator,  signal processing equipment, and data acquisition
              equipment.   Laboratory experiments will be introduced for the study of 
              laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy using single photon  absorption and two
              photon absorption.  Experiments involving  excited states of Ru(II)
              coordination complexes will be introduced  to demonstrate methods for handling
              and evaluating kinetic events  in the nano to millisecond time range.  All
              experiments have an  open-ended quality to them which allows students to
              explore other  aspects of laser spectroscopy.  Students in our general
              chemistry  course will also be exposed to this technology through 
              demonstrations/seminars presented by their upper-division peers.   These
              seminars will enable a safe interesting preview of some  exciting concepts in
              chemistry.  The requested equipment will also  be used in undergraduate
              research projects such as in a comparison  of the electron transfer ability of
              Os(II) complexes to that of the  analogous Ru(II) complexes.
