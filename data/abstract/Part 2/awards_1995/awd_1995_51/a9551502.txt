Abstract    :
              This project dramatically changes the way students learn and use  electronic
              circuits by creating a hands-on, integrated electronic  circuit prototyping
              facility.   The facility resonates with  important industrial and commercial
              themes in manufacturing  techniques, concurrent engineering, and
              competitiveness.   The  key ability of this facility is that it allows students
              the means  of easily designing a circuit board using high-functionality 
              devices, simulating the behavior and response to external  stimuli, and quickly
              producing a prototype etched/drilled circuit  board.   The cycle times and cost
              associated with producing a  high-quality prototype are greatly reduced and,
              for the first  time, are appropriate for undergraduate instructional purposes. 
               This project brings an existing, rudimentary facility to its full  potential
              and demonstrate to the educational community the merits  of giving students a
              new means of expressing their electronics  skills.   Included in this project
              are four design workstations  with appropriate software, an upgrade for an
              existing mill/drill  machine, and various industry-standard tools.  The upgrade
              of  this facility enables a higher student throughput and brings a  new level
              of electronic-related instruction to eight core  curriculum courses in this
              division with over 200  electrical-specialty students.   These students are
              gaining the  ability to construct a far higher level of real-world circuits, 
              opening up new possibilities in solving system level problems.
