              integrated Using the  Xenopus Oocyte Expression System    Portions of the
              Development and Neurobiology courses are being  integrated with collaborative
              laboratory exercises.  The laboratory  exercises involve the use of the Xenopus
              oocyte expression system  to study the function of specific membrane receptors
              and  voltage-activated channels.  Poly(A)+mRNA for brain proteins are  injected
              into Xenopus oocytes, and the oocytes are assayed for  expression of brain
              proteins.  Patch clamping is used to determine  whether the expressed proteins
              are functional in the oocyte system.    The proposed project is innovative in
              its interdisciplinary and  collaborative approach to undergraduate teaching,
              and in its use of  highly sophisticated molecular biological and biophysical 
              techniques in the undergraduate teaching laboratory.  Students  learn first
              hand how these techniques have been used to achieve a  new level of
              understanding of both development and neurobiology.  The laboratories are
              investigative, in that students must design  experiments based on their
              knowledge of receptors and channels and  then carry out those experiments using
              the oocyte expression  system.
