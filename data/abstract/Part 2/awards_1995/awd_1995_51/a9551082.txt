Abstract    :
              This project increases the exposure of biology majors to modern  biological
              techniques and the research process.   Through this  grant, two new educational
              experiences are being added to the  biology curriculum.   The first is an upper
              division course in  molecular biology, which engages students in a thematic
              series of  laboratory experiences based on a specific research problem.    The
              second is a program of supervised undergraduate research,  which provides
              students with the opportunity to apply the tools  of recombinant DNA technology
              to their own investigations.    Specific hands-on applications that are being
              incorporated into  these two new educational opportunities include CDNA library
               screening, nucleotide sequencing and computerized analysis,  reporter assays
              for the analysis of gene promoter function, and  the use of the Internet in
              scientific communication.   Given  these new opportunities, many biology majors
              may discover a  previously unrecognized interest in basic science and view 
              careers in academic and industrial science as less mysterious.
