Abstract    :
              The college has recently upgraded its science, engineering, and  technology
              courses to offer students comprehensive Associate  Degree and certificate
              programs in advanced machine tool and  manufacturing technologies.   Because
              defense industry downsizing  is forcing manufacturing and machine tool firms
              into new markets  (e.g., biomed, biotech, electronics), CNC operators and
              CAD/CAM  technologists are needed who can use advanced technology to  design
              and produce small, complex parts.   To supply graduates  for these jobs, the
              college is developing its undergraduate  Machine Technology program into an
              Advanced CAD/CAM & CNC  Technology curriculum.   The college and an industry
              partner are  funding new CAD/CAM software delivering advanced surface modeling 
              capability to DOS and NT platforms; this project purchases  machine tool
              components needed to add 4th and 5th axis movement  to the College's 3-axis
              vertical machining center (VMC).    Corresponding improvement of
              Introductory/Advanced CAD/CAM  courses let students use the CAD/CAM software to
              model and verify  advanced CNC surface programs; in improved
              Introductory/Advanced  CNC Vertical Machining & EDM courses, they learn to set
              up and  operate the 5-axis VMC needed to machine their programs.   In a  new
              200 series, Advanced VMC, students use the software and  5-axis VMC to design
              and execute sophisticated surface models for  applied research and industry
              applications.
