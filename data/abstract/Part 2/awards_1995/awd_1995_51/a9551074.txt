Abstract    :
              This project, the Multimedia Technology Laboratory (MTL), gives  students
              hands-on experience building Multimedia tools such as  authorware, animation
              and sound editors, and videoconferencing  programs.   The MTL is equipped with
              workstations designed to  display, transmit, and store high-resolution
              graphics, video  sequences, and sound clips.   In conjunction with the
              laboratory,  a new course--CSC 485 Multimedia--is being introduced into the 
              graphics curriculum.   The MTL is also being used for  demonstrations in other
              computer graphics courses and required  senior projects.
