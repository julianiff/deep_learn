                              Engineering    Title: An Advanced Undergraduate Laboratory for
              Microfabrication      This project is for the development of a laboratory-based
               undergraduate course in general microfabrication techniques and  processes.
              Microfabrication was originally developed by the  microelectronics industry to
              batch-fabricate miniature integrated  circuits. Only recently has it been
              applied to other fields and  disciplines. The slow infiltration of
              microfabrication technology  into the non-electronic disciplines is due to the
              fact that  microelectronic fabrication techniques have traditionally only been 
              taught to graduate electrical engineering students or undergraduate  students
              specifically studying microelectronic devices.     In order for non-electronic
              interdisciplinary applications of  microfabrication to be developed, an
              appropriate transfer of this  technology to the interested audience needs to
              take place. The  laboratory course being developed serves as that missing link
              by  introducing this versatile and powerful technology to a broader  audience
              base. Microfabrication can do for the mechanical and  physical world what
              microelectronic fabrication did for the  electronic world.  The world of
              microfabrication has tremendous  potential, and numerous applications to a wide
              spectrum of  disciplines are possible. However, the majority of those 
              applications will never be realized unless microfabrication is  exposed to a
              broader audience and introduced earlier into the  academic curriculum.
