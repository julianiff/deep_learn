                    Engineering    Title: A Power Technology Laboratory      This project
              will develop and equipt an advanced laboratory for  instruction and research in
              the field of Powder Technology.   Several experiments will be developed with
              the new and upgraded  instrumentation and will be integrated into the new
              Chemical  Engineering elective option of Powder Technology, specifically into 
              the "Unit Operations II" laboratory. The new and the upgraded  instrumentation
              will be state of the art equipment and will be used  for undergraduate and
              graduate instruction.    Additionally, a piece of industrial equipment will be
              used as a  demonstration unit in Freshman Engineering classes for all 
              engineering students to show them the very different and peculiar  behavior of
              powders as compared to gases and liquids. It is  expected that the
              demonstration unit will convince and encourage  students to pursue the powder
              technology option (elective) in  Chemical Engineering and to enter this new and
              promising field of  engineering.
