Abstract    :
              The project is incorporating 12 Calculator-Based Laboratory (CBL)  units and 3
              MacIntosh computers into the General, Introductory,  and Organic Chemistry
              Laboratory curricula.   The CBL is an  automatic data collection device from
              Texas Instruments.   The  device allows automated collection and storage of
              data in a  laboratory setting.  Automated data collection and computer-aided 
              report preparation facilitate the mental connection between  graphed data and
              physical activity, allowing students to focus on  the trends and implications
              of data, rather than its collection,  and acquainting the students uith
              technology currently used in  working laboratories.    The successes of the
              project will be  shared with the Science Education community through workshops,
               presentations at professional meetings, and journal publications.
