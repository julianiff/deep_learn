Abstract    :
              Through this project, the computers necessary to build a combined 
              laboratory-classroom dedicated to an integrated style of learning  in calculus
              and precalculus are supplied.  The purpose of this  laboratory-classroom, with
              its accompanying change in pedagogy  and textbook, is to enhance students'
              understanding of the basic  concepts and appropriate applications of calculus. 
              This will  come about through a change in the style of instruction to one  that
              requires fluidity of activity during the class period.  This  computer
              laboratory integrates computer use completely into the  classroom activities. 
              The facility reflects multi-use need, with  large tables enabling groups of 2
              or 3 students to work together,  blackboards around the room so the entire
              class can be in groups  at the board at the same time, and space for faculty to
              circulate  among students to offer advice.  The room is designed to allow 
              frequent switching from one type of activity to another with  minimal
              disruption.
