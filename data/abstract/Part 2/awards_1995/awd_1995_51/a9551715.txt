Abstract    :
              This project establishes a Micropropagation Laboratory for  training future
              horticulture technicians.   As micropropagation  is an asexual method of
              producing large quantities of genetically  identical plants, the lab is a
              practical application of the  concept of Toti potency (i.e., each somatic plant
              cell contains  all necessary information to create an entire new plant).   It
              is  technologically intensive, and until recently was not practical  on a
              large/commercial scale.   Current advances are allowing the  process to see
              ever-greater use in the horticulture industry.    Yet the supply of technicians
              trained in this technique is not  adequate for the industry's demand.   A
              curriculum providing  systematic training in techniques currently used by
              industry is  being developed to help introduce new innovations from research 
              institutions.   Providing such a curriculum is an innovation for  the industry.
                Micropropagation requires a sterile and carefully  controlled environment.  
              Students must learn the more rigorous  demands of working with plants in such
              an environment.   This  project provides the equipment needed to train
              horticulture  students in the micropropagation of a selected assortment of 
              herbaceous and woody plants.   The requested laboratory equipment  also serves
              as the foundation of an expanded horticulture  curriculum, offering an option
              concentrating on micropropagation  techniques.
