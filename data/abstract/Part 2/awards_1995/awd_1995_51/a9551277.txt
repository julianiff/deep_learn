Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Department is purchasing a Varian 300-MHz Gemini  2000 FT-NMR
              spectrometer to incorporate modern NMR techniques  into all laboratories in its
              curriculum.  Students are introduced  to NMR spectroscopy in the first year and
              use increasingly  advanced techniques as they progress through the lab
              curriculum.    First-year students record 13C NMR spectra to help identify 
              unknown organic liquids.   Organic Chemistry students record and  learn to
              interpret 1H and 13C NMR spectra of products they  generate in the lab.  
              Physical Chemistry students use FT-NMR to  measure reaction kinetics and to
              calculate equilibrium constants  and other thermodynamic parameters.   In other
              upper-level  courses, students learn more advanced FT-NMR techniques, 
              including NMR of other nuclei, and two-dimensional methods such  as COSY and
              HETCOR.   Students use variable temperature FT-NMR to  study conformationally
              mobile molecules, determine activation  barriers to molecular rotations, and
              probe and elucidate the  chemical structures of molecules they generate in
              organic and  inorganic synthesis projects.
