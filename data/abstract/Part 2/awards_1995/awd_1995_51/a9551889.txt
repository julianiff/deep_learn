Abstract    :
              This grant is funding the purchase of one Silicon Graphics  Indigo2 and four
              Indys plus complementary software for the  improvement of the chemistry
              undergraduate curriculum to include  course and laboratory work in
              computational chemistry and  molecular graphics.   The courses that are
              affected most directly  are the biochemistry laboratory courses and NMR
              Methods.    Biochemistry is being expanded to include areas of structural 
              biology, enabling students to analyze protein and nucleic acid  structures and
              perform energy calculations.   In NMR Methods,  students learn modern
              techniques for problem-solving and  structure elucidation.   New experiments
              are being added to the  physical, organic, and inorganic chemistry courses.  
              The  graphics display is being used as a lecture aid in the lower-  division
              classes.   The SGI workstations offer outstanding 3D  graphical and
              calculational capabilities and are ubiquitous in  teaching and research.
