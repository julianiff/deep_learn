Abstract    :
              This project centers on the introduction of modern infrared  spectroscopy into
              the chemistry curriculum, beginning in the  general chemistry laboratory and
              proceeding to the organic  laboratory.   General chemistry students are using
              FT-IR  spectroscopy in both the first and second semesters of the  laboratory,
              in the context of group-based open-ended research  projects.   The
              sophistication of their observations and uses of  the spectra will progress as
              students increase their chemical  knowledge.   Even those students who do not
              go on to take any  more chemistry (the majority) will have had quite extensive 
              exposure to modern instrumentation by the end of two semesters of  chemistry.  
              FT-IR is also being used in the organic laboratories  in a newly developed
              curriculum that extends the developments  made in the general chemistry labs.
