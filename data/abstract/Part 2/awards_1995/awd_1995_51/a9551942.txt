               Psychology      Title: Mobile Psychology Lab for Mercy College's Bronx Majors
              in    Psychology, Sociology, and Behavioral   Science         ILI funds are
              needed for a computerized, Mobile Psychology  Laboratory at Mercy's Bronx
              Campus to serve Psychology Majors (29%  of all majors at this campus) as well
              as Sociology Majors and  Behavioral Science Majors (respectively, 1% and 13%). 
              The Bronx  location is Mercy's largest and fastest growing branch campus.  It 
              serves primarily minority (72%) and female (70%) undergraduates,  who must
              typically balance schoolwork with part-time (37%) or  full-time jobs (37%) and
              their family responsibilities.  The  proposed instructional lab will help
              provide more coherent and  better integrated teaching and learning experiences
              than is  currently available for these targeted majors during their required 
              introductory statistics course and their required course in  scientific
              methods.  The computer-based instruction provided by the  proposed Mobile
              Psychology Laboratory will include a modified  Electronic Instructional Theater
              component as well as a modified  Distance Learning component.  The latter will
              permit students to  engage in computer conferencing outside of class using
              Mercy's  dial-up Bulletin Board System, which is accessible around the  clock. 
              The proposed hardware and software will also facilitate  teaching and learning
              of the major stages of the research process  (hypothesis formation, scientific
              testing, statistical analyses,  tentative conclusions).  The proposed computer
              technology will be  used to enhance their communication skills, e.g., when
              students  write up their research reports and make oral presentations of  their
              findin gs.  Wide dissemination of project results is planned.
