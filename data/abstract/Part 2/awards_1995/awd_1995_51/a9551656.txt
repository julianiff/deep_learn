Abstract    :
              Two fundamental tasks of laboratory education are (1) to engage  students in the
              processes of science and (2) to communicate  scientific information
              effectively.   To accomplish these tasks,  educators must keep pace with
              current trends in science  education.   Computer-assisted instruction (CAI) is
              such a trend.    Computers are laboratory tools important in data acquisition
              and  analysis.   They are communication tools in the rapidly growing  field of
              information technology.    The objective of this project  is to improve
              laboratory science education with the installation  of a networked multimedia
              laboratory.   Students acquire skills  with modern information technologies by
              using them to learn  science.   These technologies are being implemented in a 
              prototype program (Human Anatomy/Physiology Learning Program or  HALP), using
              innovative teaching approaches documented in the  literature.   Laboratory
              instruction incorporates interactive  multimedia, computer-assisted data
              analysis, and on-line  information retrieval.   This project improves and
              updates  undergraduate laboratory science education at college.   It  produces
              better-educated science students; that is, students who  are capable of using
              information technologies, who are excited  about science, and who have
              succeeded in learning science.
