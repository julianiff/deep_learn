Abstract    :
              Research has shown that the traditional dichotomy of a (passive)  lecture
              coupled with a separate (and often seemingly unrelated)  laboratory does not
              provide students with the means to learn and  conceptualize physics.   The
              objective in this project is to  break from tradition and unify conceptual,
              analytical, and  hands-on experimental investigations in a single environment. 
                The learning in this facility is student-centered and  student-driven without
              traditional lectures.   The role of the  instructor is shifted from the
              traditional provider of lectures  to facilitator of student learning.     Our
              unified environment  is a multimedia laboratory running the Comprehensive
              Unified  Physics Learning Environment (CUPLE) software, with student  stations
              equipped with a Universal Laboratory Interface (ULI) and  various experimental
              probes.   This allows hands-on investigation  to be incorporated directly with
              conceptual and analytical  investigations.   Additionally, the use of laserdisc
              players and  videocamera, together with video capture cards for digitizing 
              video, allows students to "perform" experiments that are not  within the means
              of many colleges and universities.
