Abstract    :
              This project is purchasing three Silicon Graphics Indigo  workstations and
              molecular modeling software for use in years  two, three, and four of the
              undergraduate program.   The hardware  is located in a newly remodeled computer
              facility and accessed  using X-Windows emulator software from existing
              department PC and  Mac clusters, and a new computer classroom.   In the
              sophomore  organic course, molecular mechanics methods are being applied to 
              modeling the products of an enzymatic hydration and calculating  key features
              of their 1H nmr spectra.   Semi-empirical MO methods  help students predict the
              regioselectivity of cycloaddition  reactions.   In the junior physical
              chemistry laboratory,  students are being introduced to molecular dynamics
              methods of  simulation, allowing the computation of thermodynamic properties 
              of solutions.   At the senior level, students are making an  extended synthetic
              molecular mechanics, and MO investigation of  rotational barrier in
              iron-cyclopentadienyl complexes.   Modeling  methods are also being
              incorporated into senior research  projects.
