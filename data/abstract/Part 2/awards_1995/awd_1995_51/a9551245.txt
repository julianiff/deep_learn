Abstract    :
              This project is improving the quality of instruction in computer  science by
              providing students with a powerful environment in which  to learn the basic
              principles of human-computer interaction (HCI)  when developing software.   It
              also allows them to experiment with  new techniques in developing the HCI
              component of a software  project.   With this lab, students are able to
              concentrate on the  user interface aspects of a project.   They gain experience
              with  modern user-interface software development tools as well as with a  wide
              variety of hardware input and output devices.   One additional  important
              component of this lab is the development of systems for  special populations,
              such as the physically handicapped.   This  laboratory project exposes students
              who wish to pursue careers in  industry to the skills that are in high demand. 
               In addition, it  prepares students who wish to go on to graduate school to
              engage in  advanced research projects.
