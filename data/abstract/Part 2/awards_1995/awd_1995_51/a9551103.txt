Abstract    :
              Since the introduction of computer science and engineering  courses in
              electrical engineering curriculum in the 60's, the RF  and microwave
              engineering courses have gradually been omitted  from most of the EE programs. 
               Recently with the development of  cellular telephone, cable TV, satellite
              communication, mobile  radio and TV, personal communication systems,
              interactive video,  distant learning, and other wireless communication systems,
               several universities have reintroduced new RF and microwave  engineering
              courses in their electrical engineering programs.    It requires a special
              effort and some innovation to offer RF and  microwave engineering courses at
              the undergraduate level with  extensive hands-on laboratory experiments.  
              Through this  project, a modern laboratory for the computer-aided design, 
              fabrication, and testing of RF and microwave circuits is being  established.
