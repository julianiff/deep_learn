Abstract    :
              9308379  Wolpin  The goals of this research project are: (1) to formulate and 
              estimate a behavioral model of school attainment and job search  within a
              sequential decision-making framework, (2) to estimate  the monetary return to
              education, and (3) to use the estimates of  the decision model to simulate the
              impact of policy  interventions, such as minimum wages and legal restrictions
              on  school-leaving age, on school attainment and the school-to-job  transition.
               The research will employ recent methods of  estimating dynamic stochastic
              discrete choice models.  The models  will be estimated with a unique data set,
              the National  Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experience 1979 youth 
              cohort, which not only contains longitudinal information on  school enrollment
              and employment for the cohort, but also has  collected high school transcripts.
               This project is important  because it will advance our understanding of the
              schooling  decision and the transition process from school to work, and it 
              will enhance our understanding for the impact of public policy on  the demand
              for schooling and on the impact of schooling on future  wages.  ***
