Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is an investigation of the synchronization of movements              
              between individuals engaged in face-to-face interaction.  The                  
              situational and personality antecedents of synchrony as well as                
              its interpersonal consequences will be examined.  Specifically,                
              the importance of inter-individual synchrony in the establishment              
              and maintenance of rapport will be determined.
