Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this project is to integrate models of various                
              aspects of the legal system with oligopoly models in order to                  
              obtain a more complete description of how various features of the              
              firms' economic and legal environment influence their decision-                
              making with respect to product quality, safety and environmental               
              quality.  In particular, four features of the economic and legal               
              environment will be examined:  (1) market structure in the product             
              market; (2) who benefits and who is potentially harmed by the                  
              production and use of the product; (3) legal rules which influence             
              the outcome of settlement negotiations and/or trial in the event of            
              harm; and (4) the impact of asymmetric information among                       
              participants in the product's development, testing, sale and use,              
              and among potential litigants in the event that the product causes             
              harm.                                                                          
                                                                                             
              The methods to be used include applied game theory and information             
              economics.  Intended applications include products such as                     
              therapeutic drugs with potential side effects and by-product                   
              problems such as chemical "runoff" (e.g., herbicides/pesticides,               
              acid rain and ozone depletion) with the potential for generalized              
              toxic effects on the environment and on third parties.
