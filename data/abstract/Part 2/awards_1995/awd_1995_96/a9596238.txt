Abstract    :
              9402476  Ghanem  It is proposed to conduct a research program featuring a  novel
              concept for treating environmental engineering  problems involving media with
              uncertain (random) properties.  The proposed concept hinges upon the
              approximate  representation of random processes describing the medium 
              properties using a finite number of random variables. This  will be
              accomplished via the classical concepts of the  Karhunen-Loeve and Polynomials
              Chaos expansions, well known  n applied mathematics. I this study these
              expansions will be  incorporated into spatial discretizations of various medium
               properties in accordance with standard finite element  procedures. The
              proposed formulation will permit an optimal  representation of the random
              process involved using a  minimum number of random variables. Preliminary
              results  obtained by proposed formalism to problems of engineering  mechanics
              show good agreement with Monte Carlo simulation  results. The proposed research
              will extend the existing  formulation for the analysis of problems in ground
              water  flow.  ***
