              advance the state of the art for the efficient modeling and simulation of the
              dynamic behavior of complex multibody systems.  This will be accomplished
              through a formulation of the equations of motion which is highly coupled with
              the node topology/internode communication architecture of the parallel computer
              system on which it will be run.  This work will be initially directed towards
              systems which allow for the use of explicit temporal numerical integration
              schemes.  Once accomplished, attention will be turned towards applying
              beneficial computational aspects of this work to applications which result in
              stiff systems of equations, and thus are confined to the use of implicit
              temporal integration procedures.   The effort will be to take advantage of
              aspects of O(N) and other low  order dynamic equations formulation procedures
              (e.g. use of recursive relationships to reduce operations), as well as
              descriptor formulations which are highly parallelizable. The intended result is
              the development of a multibody procedure/code which automatically produces
              equations of motion and associated simulation code for a specific complex
              multibody system which is the optimal ( in the sense of maximizing throughput)
              combination of low operations count and concurrent equations form for
              implementation on prescribed parallel computing system.  This will result in
              the maximum possible aggregate thoughput, and consequently, maximum overall
              speed for the simulation of the system on the available concurrent processing
              system. ***  u to advance the state of the art for the efficient modeling and
              simulation of the dynamic behavior of complex multibody systems.  This will be
              accomplished through a formulation o f the equations of           9   <
