Abstract    :
              9313271  Lee  The mechanisms of scuffing will be studied.  Two possible 
              competing mechanisms are the critical temperature-pressure  mechanism of
              desorption of a lubricant film, aided by frictional  heating and abetted by
              hydrostatic pressure in the contact; and  the thermomechanical wear mechanism,
              in which thermal heating  causes plastic flow of the contacting asperity.  A
              set of  experiments will be performed to determine the relative roles of  these
              mechanisms and the conditions under which they operate.  ***
