Abstract    :
              9411642  Corotis  Support is provided to continue research on extreme value 
              estimation procedures for the prediction of design wind  speeds.  During the
              first phase several available techniques  were tested and compared with some
              methods performing better  than others, e.g., for data from Gumbel and reverse
              Weibull  distributions the threshold approach performed better than  the
              epochal approach but the reverse was true for data from  a normal distribution.
               During the second phase of the  research statistical analyses of data taken
              from maximum  daily fastest mile speeds and Monte Carlo simulations based  on
              the probabilistic models derived from these analyses will  be used.  The
              objectives of the work are: 1) to rank the  performances of the Cumulative Mean
              Excedance and the de  Haan-Dekkers-Einmahl estimation methods; 2) to account
              for  the seasonality effects; 3) to verify whether more extreme  speed data
              sets are in fact better fitted by reverse Weibull  than by Gumbel
              distributions; and 4) to estimate confidence  levels for "peaks over threshold"
              estimates of extreme winds  based on short records.  Long term wind speed data
              from  United States weather stations will be used to compare  epochal and
              threshold methods and to refine procedures for  determining design wind speeds.
               The results from this work  will improve the survivability of structures built
              in  extreme wind areas and thus the safety of local population.  ***
