Abstract    :
              Dr. Mark A. Berg is supported by a Presidential Young                          
              Investigator award from the Experimental Physical Chemistry                    
              Program to study ultra-fast processes in disordered condensed                  
              matter. These measurements provide valuable insight into                       
              chemical energy flow and re-distribution as well as insight                    
              into the time scale of various chemical reactions.                             
                                                                                             
              The influence of the solvent on the product energy distribution                
              following a chemical reaction will be accomplished through the                 
              use of femtosecond infrared spectroscopy to monitor the                        
              vibrational and orientational states of product fragments                      
              following small molecule dissociations. Comparisons with the                   
              detailed information available for gas-phase reactions will                    
              directly reveal the role of the solvent in the final-state                     
              interactions of the reaction.
