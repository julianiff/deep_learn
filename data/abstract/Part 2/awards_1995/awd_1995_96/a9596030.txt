Abstract    :
                   The governing position of microorganisms in biogeochemical                
              cycles has long been appreciated, yet the ecology of the                       
              contributing natural microbial populations remains poorly                      
              resolved.                                                                      
              This is principally a consequence of the technical and historical              
                                                                                             
              limitations of pure culture isolation and phenotypic                           
              classification.  However, the advent of molecular systematics and              
                                                                                             
              newer techniques of molecular biology and recombinant DNA have                 
              markedly changed the repertoire of tools available to the                      
              microbial

              the level of populations and even single cells.  The proposed                  
              research will use and, to a more limited extent, develop                       
              phylogenetically-based molecular techniques to study the                       
              population                                                                     
              structure of complex anaerobic communities.  These studies will                
              emphasize the characterization of methanogenic and sulfate-                    
              reducing bacterial populations.                                                
                   Sulfate-reducing and mentanogenic bacteria comprise
