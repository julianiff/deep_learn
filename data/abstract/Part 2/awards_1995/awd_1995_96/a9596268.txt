Abstract    :
              9453473  Lehman  This is a Presidential Faculty Fellow (PFF) Award. Research 
              during the award period includes a study of the theory and  applications  of
              vibrational control and robust periodic feedback  control as applied to finite
              and infinite dimensional systems  such as jet engines and chemical processes. A
              primary emphasis is  placed on the development of open-loop vibration control
              and  results are compared to those obtained via classical feedback  control
              techniques. In addition, multi-media interactive  instructional material is
              developed in the area of automatic  control systems. This material is placed on
              a world-wide web (W3)  which is a global hypertext-based system for accessing 
              information on the Internet. As such, students throughout the  world are able
              to have access to this material using the  hyperlink capabilities of Xmosiac, a
              multi-media W3 browser.  ***
