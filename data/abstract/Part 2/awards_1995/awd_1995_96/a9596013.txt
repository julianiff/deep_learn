Abstract    :
              This is a SBIR II project.  The objective of the project is to                 
              provide the community of macromolecular crystallographers with a               
              detector-independent software package for collecting and processing            
              diffraction data obtained with a variety of electronic area                    
              detectors.  Under the Phase I project, a prototype software package            
              called POLYDET has been developed.  The Phase II project will                  
              further develop and modify POLYDET by testing it on data from the              
              Argonne CCD (charged coupled device) detector and other commercial             
              and non-commercial area detectors on conventional and storage ringe            
              sources.
