Abstract    :
              ALBRECHT/ABSTRACT           The objective of this research is the observed
              structure and  evolution of continental stratocunulus clouds near Penn State 
              University.  The observations will include liquid water, cloud base  and
              height, microphysical structure and composition and will be  obtained using a
              microwave radeoriter, a laser ceilometer, and a 94  GHz rador, radiosoules, and
              a research aircraft capable of  measuring the same or related quantities. The
              aggragate  observations should help to formulate a physical useful description 
               of countineutal stratocunulus clouds which, unlike its maritime  couterpart,
              have remained relatively unexamined.
