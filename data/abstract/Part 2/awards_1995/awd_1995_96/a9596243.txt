Abstract    :
                     9318952  Stone     This project supports the historical ecological
              research of  several anthropologists studying how two peasant farming 
              populations exploited a previously unsettled land area of  Nigeria. Using
              images from remote satellites to document changes  in land use, maps, censuses,
              and detailed ethnographic studies of  labor inputs to farming by peasant
              households, the project will  compare the different historical effects of
              culturally  distinctive patterns of land exploitation by two groups.  Specific
              questions to be asked include analyzing the differences  between the two groups
              in their propensity to intensify  production and to abandon through land
              exhaustion different  areas.   This research is important because land
              degradation is a critical  problem in many areas of the world, and the
              solutions to the  problems are not simply technological.  We must understand
              local  models of how people use land in order to understand why some  groups
              maintain and conserve land resources and others exhaust  them.  This sort of
              intensive comparison will provide new ideas  on how traditional peoples exploit
              their agricultural land.  ***
