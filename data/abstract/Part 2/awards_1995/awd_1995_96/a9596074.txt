              Total Award $68,519)      RIA: "Inverse Interactive Computer Graphics
              Techniques for Acoustic  Visualization"           This is the first year of a
              three-year continuing RIA Award to  investigate acoustic simulation techniques
              to improve accuracy of  acoustic space evaluation, utilizing theoretical and
              interactive  techniques to indicate specific acoustical effects in a three 
              dimensional computer model.  By creating and altering these  effects, the
              surfaces, sound emitters, and geometry will be  indirectly modified.  The
              purpose is to have the system cary the  burden of searching the design space,
              allowing the user to focus on  the goals of the acoustical design rather than
              on the details of  the model specification.  The project benefits from
              analogous work  done in lighting simulation and interactive graphics
              techniques.
