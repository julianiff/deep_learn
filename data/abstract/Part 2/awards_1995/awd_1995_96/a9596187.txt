Abstract    :
              9321558  Sowers  This award is for support for a study to construct a 200,000
              year record of the concentration of nitrous oxide (N2O) in the atmosphere from
              the occluded air parcels in the Greenland Ice Sheet Project Two (GISP2) ice
              core.  This record will provide information on nitrogen biogeochemical cycles
              over glacial/interglacial time periods.  The concentration of nitrous oxide in
              air is determined by the sources and sinks of this gas on a global scale. 
              Estimates of the sources (terrestrial and marine biospheres) and sinks
              (photodissociation in the stratosphere) are not presently well constrained but
              the terrestrial biosphere is thought to contribute about 80 % of the global
              nitrous oxide emissions with the other 20 % being made up from an oceanic
              contribution.  Comparing an atmospheric nitrous oxide record with other
              bioactive gases such as carbon dioxide and methane will help in understanding
              the nature of changes in global carbon cycling throughout the past 200,000
              years and will be a useful stratigraphic tool for correlating Greenland and
              Antarcitc ice cores.   ***
