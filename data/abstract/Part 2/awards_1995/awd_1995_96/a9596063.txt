Abstract    :
              9312231  McClure  The focus of this research is the development of pentavalent
              organophospholene chemistry as  a new synthetic method for the production of
              phosphonate-containing compounds.  The  oxophospholenes will be condensed with
              a variety of electrophiles to give highly substituted  phosphonates.  The
              phosphonates, in turn, will provide intermediates for the production of 
              inositol phosphates, sphingomyelins, carbohydrates and C-nucleoside analogs. 
              %%%  With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research
              of Dr. Cynthia K.  McClure of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
              Delaware.  Professor McClure  will focus her work on the synthesis of simple
              phosphonate analogs of biologically active  phosphates.  The target compounds
              are of potential interest as antimetabolites and enzyme active-  site probes.
