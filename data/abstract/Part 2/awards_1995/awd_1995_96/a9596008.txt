Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a project to study nearshore                      
              environmental records from emerged fossil shells along the Victoria            
              Land coast.  Shell growth, x-ray diffraction, elemental and oxygen             
              isotope analyses will be made on bulk shell samples of circumpolar             
              bivalve molluscs.  Combined with their beach elevations and                    
              radiocarbon ages, these fossil shell datasets will provide                     
              information that can be used to interpret the rates and mechanisms             
              associated with the Holocene retreat of the West Antarctic ice                 
              sheet.
