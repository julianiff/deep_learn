Abstract    :
              9353068  Baggett    This project investigates the use of calculators in teaching
               mathematics in grades kindergarten through five.  From the  beginning children
              are exposed to real numbers (not just positive  integers), and they learn to
              perform arithmetic operations mentally  on simple numbers and with a calculator
              otherwise.  Drill is  replaced by project-like lessons in which children are
              active  participants.  Children use real objects, make measurements, and 
              engage in interdisciplinary activities as essential parts of the  lessons.  The
              Jackson Intermediate School District, Michigan, the  University of Michigan,
              and the University of Colorado, are  collaborating in the project.  Teachers
              have been using many lesson  units for several years in a number of
              participating schools.  The  planned outcome is to have a complete
              classroom-tested set of K-5  educational materials, three videotapes of
              classroom calculator  activities   ***
