Abstract    :
              9219371  Rabinow  We are studying the structure and function of the Darkener of 
              apricot locus of Drosophila, and two tightly linked functionally  related and
              interacting loci, Rem and Msu.  These loci were  identified in mutagenic
              screens for dosage-sensitive modifiers of  gene expression.  Doa mutants
              display a maternal effect, are  recessive lethal, increase transcription of the
              copia  retrotransposon and alter the expression of a number of host genes,  as
              based upon genetic and morphological criteria.  Many of these  properties are
              shared by Rem and Msu, which interact with Doa  allele specifically.  By
              sequencing cDNA clones, we found that Doa  encodes the Drosophila homologue of
              murine and human cdc2-like  protein kinase (clk).  Clk kinase is unusual in
              that it is  structurally related to serine/threonine protein kinases, but auto-
               phosphorylates on tyrosine residues as well as serines and  threonines.  We
              will: 1) Examine the structure/function  relationship among Doa, Rem and Msu,
              whether they are in fact  separable genetic loci, and their functional
              relationship to cdc2  like kinase.  2) Generate antibodies to Doa protein as
              reagents to  determine its intracellular localization and expression during 
              embryonic and imaginal development outside of the eye and eye-  antennal
              imaginal disc.  We will also examine Doa mutant embryos to  determine the
              effects of mutations in the kinase on early  Drosophila development.  3)
              Characterize the specificity and  substrates of Doa kinase in vitro and in
              vivo.  4) Determine  whether Doa mutations affect mitosis.  %%%  Our long range
              goals are to understand the significance and  function of dosage-sensitive
              transcriptional regulators, as one  aspect of the regulation of gene expression
              yielding normal  development.  Our system provides a unique example for the
              study of  the functions of a dual-specificity kinase in the context of an 
              organism amenable to genetic analysis and which undergoes complex  development.
