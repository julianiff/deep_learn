Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              One of the central goals of biological oceanography is to determine            
              the nature and consequences of physical forcing in marine                      
              ecosystems.  While major advances have been made in pelagic and                
              soft-bottom benthic ecosystems, little is known about the coupling             
              of physical and biological processes in rocky subtidal ecosystems.             
              Previous NSF sponsored research has shown that the rapid, vertical             
              displacement of warm phytoplankton-rich water by internal waves is             
              one of the most striking aspects of rocky subtidal ecosystems in               
              the central Gulf of Maine.  This research will conduct an                      
              integrated set of measurements and field experiments proposed to               
              test the general working hypothesis that patterns of vertical                  
              distribution and secondary productivity of suspension feeders on               
              rocky ledges and pinnacles in the central Gulf of Maine are                    
              determined by the mechanics of internal waves and their effects on             
              food and larval supply.//
