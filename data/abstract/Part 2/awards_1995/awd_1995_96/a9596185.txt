Abstract    :
              The objective of this award is to develop an efficient transposon              
              tagging system for Arabidopsis thaliana, using the maize Ac                    
              transposable element.  Dr. Fedoroff and her colleague will optimize            
              the ability to detect insertion mutations in gene whose sequence is            
              unknown by creating transposon-containing T-DNA vectors that make              
              it possible to (1) select plants in which the tagging transposon               
              has excised, (2) select plants in which the transposon has                     
              reinserted, and (3) screen plants for tissue-specific activation of            
              a transposon-borne marker gene.  They will also develop methods for            
              using transposons to identify and create mutations in genes whose              
              sequence is known.  Mutations made with transposons provide a rapid            
              means for cloning a gene, using the element as a probe, even when              
              nothing is known about the gene's sequence.  The types of mutations            
              that will arise by insertion of the transposon tags should                     
              facilitate analysis of genes regulation by creating promoter-                  
              reporter gene fusions in vivo.  The result of this award should                
              facilitate rapid progress of the coordinated Arabidopsis genome                
              research project.
