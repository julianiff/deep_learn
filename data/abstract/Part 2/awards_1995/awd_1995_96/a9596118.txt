Abstract    :
              The primary objective of the proposed catalog is to provide a                  
              convenient reference for biologists, especially taxonomists, with              
              a need to access the most important literature on the stinkbug                 
              family Pentatomidae.  Of course, the catalog will be synoptical,               
              listing under each valid name any synonyms that may have been used.            
              Besides references to nomenclatural matters, references to                     
              distribution and basic biology will also be included.  The latter              
              references concern such subjects as immature stages, hosts,                    
              karotypes, genetics, morphology, parasites, predators and vectors.             
              The catalog will also serve as an inventory of the stinkbug species            
              of the world.                                                                  
              The stinkbugs are the largest family of true bugs without a recent             
              world catalog.  It is probably no coincidence that classification              
              studies on this group have fallen behind the needs of other                    
              workers.  The compilers of the catalog believe that the catalog                
              will be an important stimulus to classificatory work on the family.
