Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Funds are provided for a 5-year Young Investigator award to               
              SARAH KRUSE, a geophysicists whose central interest is in the                  
              mechanical properties of the Earth's crust. Her present and future             
              work concentrates upon fracture zones, the large faults in the                 
              ocean's crust.  She has found that the occurrence of high heat flow            
              from volcanism is associated with weakening of fracture zones and              
              is exploring data on the distribution of stress in order to                    
              determine whether the volcanism causes the weakening, or whether               
              pre-existing weak zones permit an increase in the volcanism. Other             
              work includes variations in morphology of some Pacific fracture                
              zones, modeling of continental deformation in the Colorado plateau,            
              and tectonics of the Adriatic Sea. In teaching she makes an active             
              effort to bring more understanding of physics to other sciences,               
              and plans to develop  two field courses in  geophysics. She also               
              plans to have all senior students participate in research  projects            
              as part of a required seminar course.
