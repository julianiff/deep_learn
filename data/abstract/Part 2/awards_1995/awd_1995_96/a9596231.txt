Abstract    :
                      9409878  Li  This Research Equipment Grant will make it possible for the
               Department of Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering in the  College of
              Engineering and Applied Sciences at Western Michigan  University to develop an
              in-plane strain measurement shear strain  and two normal strains over small
              gage lengths at stress  concentrations of the surfaces of notched specimens
              subjected to  both axial and torsional loadings.  This new strain measuring 
              system will extend current strain measurement techniques to allow  measurement
              of three stains at surfaces.  Such a system is highly  desirable in order to
              develop a valuable multi-purpose stain  measuring technique that will lead to
              improved mechanical testing  capabilities.  ***
