Abstract    :
              A novel table top, ultra wideband,                                             
              time domain scattering range will be                                           
              developed under this Research                                                  
              Initiation Award grant.  A                                                     
              picosecond laser will be used to                                               
              switch planar antennas                                                         
              photoconductively, generating and                                              
              detecting  picosecond bursts of                                                
              freely propagating electromagnetic                                             
              (EM) radiation.  The EM pulses will                                            
              have bandwidth extending over 10-80                                            
              GHz, and will allow one to obtain                                              
              ultra-wideband scattering data in a                                            
              single measurement.  In this work                                              
              new antennas that increase the                                                 
              radiated power and improve signal-                                             
              to-noise will be designed and                                                  
              fabricated.  These antennas will                                               
              make feasible the measurement of the                                           
              late-time response of low-Q targets.                                           
              Additionally, optical fiber will be                                            
              used to guide the optical pulses to                                            
              the antennas, yielding a system in                                             
              which the transmitter and receiver                                             
              can be moved about arbitrarily.                                                
              This new scattering range has
