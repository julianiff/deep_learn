Abstract    :
              9406415  Tassiulas       Research will be conducted on congestion control
              strategies  for providing network performance guarantees on end-to-end loss and
               delay.  The goal is the analysis of networks with general topology  and
              multiclass traffic, and the design of simple and effective  congestion control
              strategies.  The study will also consider  certain specialized topologies (ring
              with spatial reuse) as well.   The focus of the research will be particularly
              on the interaction  at the network level, of localized control schemes acting
              at the  link or single node level.  Both deterministic and stochastic  arrival
              models will be considered.  Rigorous analytical techniques  and simulations
              will be employed for the analysis and evaluation of  the congestion control
              algorithms.  Special attention will be given  to the inherent practical
              constraints of high speed networks and  the limitations they pose on possible
              congestion control  strategies.  The impact of the proposed research will be
              the  provision of new congestion control schemes, of guidelines for the  design
              and evaluation of congestion control strategies and of  enhanced knowledge, and
              understanding of the impact of distributed  control strategies on network level
              performance.  ***
