Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Sulfur gases are important components of the global cycle of S.                
              They contribute to the acidity of precipitation and they influence             
              global radiation balance and climate.  The role of terrestrial                 
              sources of biogenic S and their effect on atmospheric chemistry                
              remain as major unanswered questions in our understanding of the               
              natural S cycle.  Preliminary studies by these investigators                   
              suggest that vegetated areas of northern peatlands dominated by                
              Sphagnum mosses emit large quantities of dimethyl sulfide (DMS)                
              relative to other wetlands, and that changes in these wetlands                 
              during climatic changes could affect the high latitude atmospheric             
              S cycle.  This study will measure the rates of emission of DMS                 
              from wetlands to determine the importance of these habitats as                 
              sources of gaseous S, will address seasonal effects, the role of               
              hydrological changes in affecting DMS emissions, and the                       
              microbiological formation and consumption of DMS in wetlands.
