Abstract    :
              Abstract ESI 9353407    This 3 year project is designed to build upon and to 
              extend the reform of school science and mathematics  begun with Ohio's
              Statewide Systemic Initiative,  Project Discovery.  The project will :  *
              Increase the number of inquiry based middle school  science and mathematics
              teachers in the Western Region  from 180 to 600 in the period 1994 to 1996.  *
              Provide institute training to 54 mathematics and  science coordinators or
              administrators.  * Recruit and train 9 West Region college and/or  university
              faculty to be content experts in the summer  institutes  * Recruit 18
              additional middle school teachers to serve  as institute faculty.  Academic
              leadership teams to staff the summer  institutes for teacher enhancement
              consist of one  scientist, one mathematician and two master teachers.  Three
              teams will be trained for each region one in  mathematics and one each in
              physical and life sciences.  These teams will then offer intensive summer
              institutes  to groups of teachers and administrators from every  school in the
              West Region.  Each teacher will receive 144 contact hours in one  content area
              in a summer institute with 48 contact  hours in the academic year follow up. 
              In addition the training of a large group of regional  science and mathematics
              coordinators and administrators  in the same inquiry model, will provide a
              mechanism for  horizontal and vertical translation of the model in  every
              school district.  The Western Region of Ohio serves a large urban,  racially
              and ethnically mixed population as well as a  more homogeneous group scattered
              over a large rural  area.  Cost share is 120%.
