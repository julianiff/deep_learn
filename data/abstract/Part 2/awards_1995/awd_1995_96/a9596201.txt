Abstract    :
              9403640  Hoffman       The scope of research entails problems in the study of 
              embedded minimal surfaces and curvature properties. These will be  compared
              with classes of periodic minimal surfaces. The research  methods take advantage
              of computer simulation techniques and  architecture in the form of algorithmic
              development of the  necessary programs. The research has potential applications
              to  periodic microstructures in compound polymers.  ***
