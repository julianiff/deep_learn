Abstract    :
                   Life-cycle engineering design addresses not only the                      
              functional requirement of a product, but its life-cycle values such            
              as manufacturability, serviceability, reliability, and                         
              recyclability.  The goal is to establish a systematic methodology              
              to maximize the users' life-cycle values and minimize cost at the              
              early stages of design.                                                        
                   This research will allow a long range development of broad and            
              fundamental techniques and methods to support life-cycle design.               
              These methods and techniques will be developed/verified through                
              examples provided by industry projects.
