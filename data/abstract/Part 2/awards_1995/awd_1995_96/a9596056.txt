Abstract    :
              Since the concept of comprehensive                                             
              emergency management was first                                                 
              promoted a decade ago, consistent                                              
              complaints have been made that local                                           
              governments fail to give enough                                                
              attention to the mitigation and

              only in mitigation, but also in

              all phases of hazards management.
