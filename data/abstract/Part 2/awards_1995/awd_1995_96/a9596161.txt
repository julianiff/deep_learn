Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Traditional economic theory presumes that decision makers have no              
              limits on their ability to absorb and process information, to carry            
              out calculations, or to explore the implications of alternative                
              courses of action.  In reality, however, economic agents often face            
              problems that are too complex for any individual to treat in this              
              way.  Therefore, it is important to examine whether the results of             
              traditional models are robust when the assumption of unlimited                 
              informational capacity is relaxed.                                             
                                                                                             
              The focus of this project is to analyze a new way of describing                
              limits on this capacity.  Specifically, each decision maker is                 
              represented by a network of simple computers.  The aggregate                   
              computational power of a network often exceeds the sum of the                  
              capabilities of individual machines.  Small but well designed                  
              computer networks can store and process substantial amounts of                 
              information.  Notion of complexity will be formalized, and the                 
              implications of limited capacity to handle complexity will be                  
              investigated.  In addition, such networks will be used to study                
              adaptive learning processes.                                                   
                                                                                             
              Some of the initial results obtained in this framework are                     
              strikingly different from those found in the existing literature on            
              bounded rationality.  It is then essential to further this research            
              by critically reviewing the existing tools for modeling the limited            
              informational capability of economic agents.
