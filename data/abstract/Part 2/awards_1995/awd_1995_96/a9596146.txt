Abstract    :
              9317514  Parker     This project investigates the effect of stream disturbance
              on the length of aquatic food chains.  Ecological theory indicates that food
              chains should be shortened by disturbance, but preliminary observations suggest
              that periodic winter scouring in northern California rivers may actually
              lengthen food chains.  The interplay of disturbance and trophic dynamics is
              investigated by laboratory trials to establish susceptibility of key
              invertebrate taxa to predation, field experiments to assess the effect of
              disturbance on the strength of species interactions and of artificial scouring
              on the benthos and feeding rates of predatory fish, and field surveys comparing
              the trophic structure of regulated (low disturbance) and natural
              (high-disturbance) rivers.    %%%  This research is important for several
              reasons.  First, this is an ideal system for testing (and revising) fundamental
              theories on the stucture of food webs and the role of disturbance in community
              structure.  The results of this study have important implications for the
              effects of dam-release schedules and flood control projects on the biodiversity
              and community ecology of rivers.  Results from this research will provide
              important information for stream and river management and restoration.  ***
