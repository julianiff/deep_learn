Abstract    :
              This project will combine measurements on the thermodynamic                    
              properties of minerals with applications to important field                    
              localities.  These particular measurements will make possible                  
              estimates of the pressure at which the rocks formed and hence of               
              their depth in the earth's crust at the time of formation.
