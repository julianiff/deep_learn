Abstract    :
              9405486  Oldow       To fully characterize active tectonic systems such as the 
              Pacific-North American transform boundary, it is important to  examine the
              interactions at several spatial and temporal scales.   This project sets out to
              quantitatively assess the spatial  distribution of strain in the central Walker
              Lane Belt of the  western Great Basin, presently undergoing active transcurrent
              and  extensional faulting that results from the relative motion between  the
              Pacific and North American plates, complicated by interaction  between the
              Sierra Nevada and the Great Basin.  The work will focus  on three duration
              intervals from Mid Miocene to present-day  deformation rates.  Methods vary
              from mapping to GPS  measurement  of deforming Pleistocene lake terraces. 
              Results are expected to  provide a balanced view of the present strain regime
              of this area,  in a historical context, and fully integrated with known
              geological  data, that will be utilized in understanding how the basic plate 
              interaction are modified and applied to continental margins.
