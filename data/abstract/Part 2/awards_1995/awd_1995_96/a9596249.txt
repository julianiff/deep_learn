Abstract    :
              9311752  Telford         The objective of this research is the physics of marine
               stratus clouds which exist over large portions of the ocean  adjacent to the
              Americas.  The competing effects of radiative  exchange; vertical motion within
              the clouds and the heat exchange  at the sea surface need to be evaluated
              experimentally.  The  necessary measurements will be made using a research
              aircraft (C-  130) from NCAR.  In particular, a new (spectral) radiometer will
              be  used, which should help to determine the relative importance of  infrared
              cooling from the cloud tops.  ***
