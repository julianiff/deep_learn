Abstract    :
                     Edelman  9319905        This project involves a cultural anthropologist
              from Yale  University in a set of interviews with representatives of peasant 
              organizations from six central American countries: Panama, Costa  Rica,
              Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala.  By  getting information about
              the concerns and experiences of members  of these peasant groups, the
              investigator will evaluate three  theories of collective action: the
              historical-structural,  resource mobilization, and new social movement
              theories.  The  main hypothesis to be tested is that the peasant movements were
               influenced more by grass-roots concerns than by foreign donor  influences.    
                This research is important because emerging connections  between peasant
              groups, across international borders, makes a  regional perspective necessary
              in understanding political  developments in Central America.  This project will
              combine in-  depth anthropological knowledge to advance our understanding of 
              issues concerning peasant organizations with increased knowledge  of regional
              differences and similarities in this important area  of the hemisphere.  ***
