Abstract    :
              The proposed research has three primary goals:  (1) to investigate the
              relationship between objective measures of cognitive control, and self-report
              measures of awareness, (2) to contrast different assumptions concerning the
              relationship between automatic and controlled influences of perception and of
              memory, and (3) to explore a variety of manipulations that may selectively
              affect the two types of influence.  Research aimed at examining the relation
              between automatic and controlled processes has the additional goal of further
              examining the assumptions that underlie the process-dissociation procedure, a
              procedure developed to separate the contributions of automatic and controlled
              influences to overall task performance.  What is the relation between
              subjective experience and effects of perception and memory on task performance?
               Results of recent research provide striking examples of perceptual analysis in
              the absence of `seeing` and effects of the past in the absence of
              `remembering.`  For example, amnesics show effects of practicing a task in
              their later performance even though they are unable to remember having
              practiced.  Similar dissociations are shown by people with normally functioning
              memory.  The proposed research extends previous work done to develop a
              process-dissociation procedure that allows one to separate the contributions of
              controlled (conscious) and automatic (unconscious) components to performance of
              a task.  Among the topics investigated are unconscious perception and
              unconscious influences of memory.
