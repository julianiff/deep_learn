Abstract    :
                   This award will provide funds to partially cover the cost of              
              a technician for the solid-earth isotope geochemistry laboratory               
              at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. The                 
              laboratory consists of three solid-source mass spectrometers and               
              associated equipment and requires the services of a full-time                  
              technician for operations, maintenance and repairs. The laboratory             
              is currently engaged in a number of research projects involving the            
              use of rare isotopes to determine the geologic age and origin of               
              rocks from the Earth's mantle.
