Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with the structure of colloidal                     
              materials and 'complex' fluids at high concentrations.  It is                  
              planned to use and to extend the physically more consistent Rogers-            
              Young form of integral equations for the radial distribution                   
              function to develop information on the microstructure.  In the past            
              simple 'cell' models and perturbation approaches have been used to             
              map the phase structure as a function of a few practically                     
              meaningful physical parameters.  This approach is not easy to                  
              implement in the case of polydisperse systems, and preliminary                 
              calculations indicate that the recently developed Gibbs ensemble               
              Monte Carlo method might prove especially flexible and powerful.               
              A combination of these methods to develop phase diagrams for                   
              guiding the selection of processing criteria will be used.
