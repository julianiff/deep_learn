              Abstract - Rawlings - 9311420      Of the advanced process control methods,
              model-predictive control (MPC) is probably the most popular method in
              industrial use today.  Linear MPC refers to the class of control algorithms
              that compute a manipulated variable profile by utilizing a linear process model
              to optimize a linear or quadratic open-loop performance objective over a future
              horizon subject to linear inequality constraints on the state and manipulated
              variables.  The first move of this open-loop optimal manipulated variable
              profile is implemented.  This procedure is repeated at each time interval and
              the process measurements are used to update the optimization problem.  While
              the process model is linear, the controller is nonlinear because of the
              inequality constraints.    The objective of this research is to extend this
              theory to develop a more flexible and industrially relevant framework for
              process control applications.  The issue of how to extend existing theory to
              the case of incomplete state measurements from nonlinear, stochastic systems
              will be investigated.  This extension is important for industrial applications
              because the number and types of available sensors are limited and the sensors
              are subject to noise and occasional failure.  This combined constrained state
              estimation and state feedback control, subject to the process constraints,
              would allow greater flexibility in designing the controller for challenging
              process control applications.  The application of the method to nonlinear
              processes will also be explored, as  most chemical processes are inherently
              nonlinear.  This is an industry/university co operative research project;
              DuPont is cosponsoring the research.                          !  L !This
