Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The applicant's research program, in general, is concerned                     
              with the study of the behavior of polymers at the interfaces                   
              of colloid particles and applying these studies towards the                    
              engineering of high performance colloid based materials.                       
              Specifically his program involves developing coating materials                 
              to cross link colloid particles to improve material mechanical                 
              strength, theoretically modelling the behavior of polymers at                  
              interfaces, and adsorption and adhesion of molecules to                        
              surfaces.
