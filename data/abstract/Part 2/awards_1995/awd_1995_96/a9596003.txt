Abstract    :
              9354100  Miller  The Wisconsin Emerging Scholars (WES) program is a
              workshop-based  calculus program that will be offered at the University of 
              Wisconsin-Madison for the first time in the Fall, 1993.  The  program, designed
              to attract and serve predominantly ethnic  minority and rural students, is
              modeled after the procedures  developed by Uri Treisman at the University of
              California--Berkley  and more recently, at the University of Texas--Austin. 
              Evaluation  of performance by tow sections of a calculus course will be done in
               a formative fashion that should help to generate a model of the  Treisman
              process.  Dissemination of the results will be done by a  series of audio
              workshops that highlight the findings in an  interview format.***
