Abstract    :
                   Lin will work to obtain an extension of the Weyl-von Neumann              
              theorem which will be used to give a complete classification of C*-            
              algebra extensions of C(X), X a compact subset of the plane, by a              
              sigma unital simple C*-algebra.  He will also investigate whether              
              every C*-algebra of real rank zero has weak (FN), as has been shown            
              by Lin in many cases.  A final problem to be studied is that of                
              classifying certain equivalence classes of homomorphisms from one              
              C*-algebra to another.                                                         
                   The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis             
              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators               
              can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                    
              numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an              
              algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These abstract                 
              objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For example,               
              they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is  currently               
              being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of                      
              fundamental importance in non-commutative geometry, which is                   
              becoming increasingly important in physics.
