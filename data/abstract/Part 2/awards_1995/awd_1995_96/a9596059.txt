Abstract    :
              This Career Advancement Award for Women from the Organic Dynamics              
              and Special Projects Programs supports the work of Professor                   
              Cynthia J. Burrows at the State University of New York, Stony                  
              Brook. The work concerns an investigation into the                             
              oxidative reactions of simple cobalt compounds using DNA and RNA               
              targets as an extension of the investigator's DNA oxidation                    
              studies using nickel(II) complexes. In particular, DNA sequences               
              containing G-G mismatches, G bulges or hairpin loops will be                   
              studied in efforts to develop a probe for such structures.                     
              Studies on RNA will include examination of transfer RNA's and the              
              group I intron from Tetrahymena. The experimental methods of this              
              work will focus on DNA and RNA purification by high resolution                 
              gel electrophoresis.                                                           
              %%%                                                                            
              This Career Advancement Award to Professor Burrows will extend                 
              her work on nickel complexes and their interactions with DNA to use of         
              cobalt complexes and to RNA structure manipulations and catalysis.             
              The application of these nonporphyrin complexes to both DNA and                
              RNA is sought in DNA with double mismatches, transfer RNA, and                 
              group I intron from Tetrahymena. The work is expected to impact                
              on medical, coordination, and biochemistry.
