Abstract    :
              9414115  Lauffenburger  This project  is on research to better understand the
              dynamics of  growth factors and their receptors, focusing on the epidermal 
              growth factor system.  The object of the work  is to manipulate  growth  factor
              ligands as a means of altering trafficking.  There  are three specific aims for
              the period of study: (1) to   manipulate parameters in receptor/ligand and
              receptor/cell  interactions in order to test previously constructed models of 
              receptor dynamics; (2) to investigate ligand transport through  model tissues;
              and (3) to study model autocrine/paracrine  regulatory systems created by
              inserting engineered ligands and  regulatory elements into cell lines.  The
              understanding of growth  factor/receptor dynamics and trafficking could lead to
               improvements in wound healing, drug delivery, gene therapy, and  tissue
              regeneration.  ***
