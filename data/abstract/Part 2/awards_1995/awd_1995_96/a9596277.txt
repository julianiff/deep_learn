Abstract    :
                  9502304  Slaughter  The overall objective of the research is to construct a
              methodology  that allows rapid and accurate formulation of a design, 
              construction, operation, or decommissioning procedure so that most  of the
              effort can focus on exploring scenarios and outcomes rather  than on the
              mechanics.  The research takes two distinct approaches.   First, the research
              allows the explicit linking of the design  process to the fabrication and
              construction processes.  The second  approach is to allow an explicit
              consideration of the set of  functional systems (e.g. structural, enclosure,
              mechanical, finish)  within the facility as well as the coordination of the
              different  phases.
