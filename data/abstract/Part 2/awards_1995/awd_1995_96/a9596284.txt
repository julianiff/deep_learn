Abstract    :
              9417377  Gordon       This proposal is for continued analysis of aeromagnetics 
              data collected in the central Indian Ocean in 1990.  The  investigators will
              extend their analysis of magnetic anomalies 5  and 6 to additional anomalies. 
              New estimates of India-Africa  motion will be used to improve determinations of
              India-Eurasia  motion and the India-Eurasia collision.  ***
