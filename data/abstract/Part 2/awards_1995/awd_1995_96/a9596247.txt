Abstract    :
                9407862  Hoeschele  The overall objective of this award is to implement exact
              Marginal Likelihood based  estimation of covariance components for continuous
              and discontinuous variables  arising frequently in genetic and other studies,
              and to test and implement Bayesian  methodology for the statistical
              identification and mapping of quantitative trait loci  using molecular marker
              maps, with particular consideration given to the development  of efficient
              Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms.  The tests developed will be  applied to
              human and animal genetic data sets.  This award is being supported by the 
              Statistics and Probability Program and the Computational Biology Activity.
