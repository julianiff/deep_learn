Abstract    :
              New theoretical and computational methods for computer simulation              
              studies of biomolecular systems will be developed.  These methods              
              will be applied to help explain the activity of several systems                
              of chemical and biological interest.  More specifically,                       
              effective potential energy functions that are more accurate than               
              those in common use for molecular dynamics simulations will be                 
              created by explicit inclusion of electronic polarization.  Other               
              potential functions that are more approximate but that can be                  
              evaluated rapidly will be created by implicit treatment of                     
              solvent.  Applications will be made to molecular recognition in                
              host-receptor systems, to the dynamics of enzyme-substrate                     
              interactions, and to the kinetics of enzymatic reactions.                      
              %%%                                                                            
              The significance of the work lies in the provision of new tools                
              for designing drugs, enzymes, ion channels, and other molecules                
              for practical applications; in the deepening understanding of the              
              activity of biological molecules; and in the preparation of young              
              scientists for research careers in this emerging field.
