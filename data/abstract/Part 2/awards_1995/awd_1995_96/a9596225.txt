Abstract    :
              9355558  Koopman    The American Society for Clinical Investigation (ASCI) in
              1990  initiated a program to enhance U.S. high school science education, 
              establish new links between high schools and biomedical  investigators, and
              attract more students into scientific careers.   High school science teachers
              are provided a stipend to work in the  laboratory of an ASCI sponsor for 1-2
              summers, during which they  receive instruction in state-of-the-art techniques
              in the context  of hands-on participation in a research project.  Continued 
              interaction throughout the school year with ASCI sponsors,  accomplished
              physician-scientists who are excited about their work,  is a central feature of
              the program.  In addition, teachers will  attend workshops directed toward
              translating the summer research  experience into effective classroom activities
              and to train  teachers to become a training resource for their peers,
              especially  minority teachers working in schools with primarily 
              minority/disadvantaged/underrepresented students.  Applications are  judged
              upon the scientific merits of the proposal, the motivation,  leadership skills
              and qualifications of the teacher and ASCI  sponsor, support of the high school
              administration for the program,  and the impact that the teacher's
              participation is anticipated to  have upon science education at the local
              level.  Follow-up reports  are required from program participants, and an
              external evaluation  component has been established for ongoing evaluation of
              the  program.  The ASCI funded the program itself in 1991 and is  committed to
              providing ongoing support.  In addition to seeking NSF  funding, the ASCI has
              secured and continues to seek funding from  industry.
