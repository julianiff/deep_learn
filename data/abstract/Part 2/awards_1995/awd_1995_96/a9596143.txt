Abstract    :
              9401908  CAI         This project is aimed at developing a fast and stable pCO2 
              microelectrode based on a flat tip Iroxide pH microelectrode and  evaluating
              the accuracy and applicability of pH and pCO2 sensors  for measuring benthic
              carbon recycling rates and pore water CO2  chemistry.  The pCO2 microelectrode
              will be a marked improvement of  an earlier pCO2 sensor.  It is planned to
              enhance and optimize the  response rate, stability, and precision of the pCO2
              electrode.  The  accuracy of the pH and pCO2 microelectrode measurements will
              be  evaluated by profiling various laboratory incubated sediments and 
              comparing the results with TCO2 concentrations from whole core  squeezing
              samples.  In situ measurements and evaluation also will  be conducted in two
              coastal environments.  A goal in the future is  not only to collect high
              resolution and artifact-free in situ  profiles with microelectrodes, but also
              to over-determine the pore  water carbonate system by combining the in situ
              microelectrode  measurements (O2,pH, and pCO2) and the in situ sampling
              techniques  (TA, TCO2, and nutrients) in a single device.  The measurements 
              will define the O2/C/N ratios during organic carbon early  digenesis.  This
              strategy will also give the three state-of-the-art  approaches, microelectrode,
              whole core squeezing, and benthic  chamber incubation, a reliability and
              internal consistency check.   This combined approach is essential for
              determining benthic  response to the seasonal changes of C input and in
              delineating  controls over the pore water carbonate system and CaCO3 preser- 
              vation and dissolution.
