Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is the first year of a three-year continuing award.  The                  
              research uses the concept of the dual surface to investigate                   
              theoretical and experimental questions related to recognizing                  
              curved surfaces.  The project is investigating classes of surface              
              for which the outline yields the complete projective geometry of               
              the surface (including algebraic surfaces, and others if they can              
              be found to exist), and classes of surface for which the outline               
              yields some, but not all projective invariants.  The theoretical               
              investigation will be aided by algorithm implementation for                    
              recognition of a wide range of surfaces using projective invariants            
              measured from the outline.
