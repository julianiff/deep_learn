Abstract    :
              9322121  Chapman    Dr. Chapman and his colleagues will carry out an integrated 
              theoretical and observational research program to understand the  size
              distribution of the fragments of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9.  The  impacts of comet
              fragments onto Jupiter provide a unique  opportunity to search,
              observationally, for smaller fragments in  the size range tens to hundreds of
              meters.  These investigators  will use CCD photometry of reflected light from
              the bolide and  fireball phases as measured on the inner Galilean satellites. 
              They  expect to detect events due to impactors several hundred meters in 
              diameter, and perhaps down to several tens of meters.   Theoretically the group
              plans to study whether the visible size  distribution of fragments represents
              the primordial size  distribution of cometesimals, reflecting cosmogenic
              processes, or  instead reflects attributes of the tidal disruption process
              itself.
