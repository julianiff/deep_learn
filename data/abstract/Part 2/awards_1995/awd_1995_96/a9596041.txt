Abstract    :
              9400243  YANG      Three main projects are proposed. The first project is a
              study  of the cosmic string solutions of the coupled Einstein and 
              Yang--Mills--Higgs equations. Problems such as the structure of  coupling in
              view of physical constants and gauge groups,  existence and nonexistence of
              regular stationary solutions will  be investigated. Solutions of this type have
              applications in  early universe physics and the theory of galaxy formation. The
               second project is a study of a variational problem arising from a 
              field-theoretical framework of nuclear interactions. The main  problem is to
              minimize an energy functional among all  configuration maps in various homotopy
              classes. The homotopy  class plays the role of a topological constraint which
              takes an  integral form. Existence, regularity, and behavior of the  minimizers
              will be investigated. The third project is a study of  the energy gap equation
              in the Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer  microscopic theory of superconductivity.
              Problems such as the  determination of the critical transition temperature, the
               uniqueness of a full space solution, and numerical approximations  of
              superconducting states will be investigated.  The proposed  research considers
              nonlinear problems arising from several  important areas of theoretical
              physics, including  superconductivity, cosmology, and nuclear systems. The 
              mathematical analysis and solutions will help better understand  these
              problems, open new areas of mathematical research, and  enhance the
              interactions of modern mathematics with physics. The  methods developed will
              also be useful and stimulating to other  related fields of applied, numerical,
              and pure mathematics.
