Abstract    :
              9512662  Liu    This award is for a two year cooperative research project 
              between Dr. Sheng Liu, Florida Institute of Technology, and  Dr. Yang Wei,
              Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.  The  proposed work expands research
              funded under MSS 9310085 on  damage tolerance in microelectronic packaging to
              include  collaboration with Tsinghua University where Professor Yang  is
              engaged in research on micromechanics modeling, testing  and failure
              prediction.    Under this project researchers will conduct experimental and 
              analytical studies on material response and interfacial  strength followed by
              damage tolerance analysis. The work is  experimental and computational in
              nature, and addresses an  important technological problem in the
              microelectronics  industry.
