Abstract    :
              In an effort to develop an ACS-approved polymer emphasis as part  of the
              Chemistry Program, the university is creating a polymer  chemistry laboratory
              and incorporating several polymer- related  experiments throughout the
              curriculum.   The department is adding  to its inventory of instrumentation a
              differential scanning  calorimeter (DSC) and the accessories necessary to
              convert one  HPLC into a GPC for polymer analysis.   The DSC is being used for 
              three experiments in the polymer chemistry laboratory, one  experiment in the
              advanced laboratory for physical chemistry, and  one experiment in the second
              semester organic chemistry  laboratory.   The GPC is being used in two
              experiments in the  polymer chemistry laboratory, one experiment in the
              advanced  laboratory for physical chemistry, and one experiment in the 
              analytical laboratory.   The repeated use of these instrumental  methods is
              designed to maximize students' educational experience.
