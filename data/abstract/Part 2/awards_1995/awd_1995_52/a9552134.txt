Abstract    :
              In an effort to keep pace with theoretical and technical  developments in the
              life sciences, as well as with new ideas in  education, the college is revising
              laboratory experiences for  undergraduates in order to emphasize
              structure-function  relationships and the interdisciplinary nature of science. 
               This  program adds new laboratories that make use of microscope-based  methods
              that allow examination of dynamic phenomena in cells, for  instance
              immunocytochemical, autoradiographic, and in situ  hybridization methods.   The
              implementation of such new  techniques, as well as the addition of a microscopy
              component to  several existing labs, requires new and expanded microscopy 
              facilities.   In addition to scientific goals, these enhanced  laboratories
              satisfy several pedagogical goals: to demystify  science, to provide an
              opportunity for real discovery, and to  learn to communicate ideas and think
              critically.
