Abstract    :
              Through this project, methods of scientific investigation are  being taught in
              an investigatory laboratory setting.   Students,  working in teams, are
              designing methods for determining sources  of variability in data resulting
              from measurements using  balances, spectrophotometers, and dissolved oxygen
              probes.   Each  research team also identifies and delineates a specific problem
               whose investigation is tractable with available instruments and  consistent
              with students' skills.   The teams identify possible  solutions to the problem,
              select one or more solutions for  testing, devise an empirical test using
              available instruments, do  the experiments, analyze the data, and draw
              appropriate  conclusions.   The projects are being presented both in written 
              and oral formats to all members of the class.   The intended  outcomes from
              this laboratory are (1) improved skills in critical  thinking and problem
              solving, (2) better understanding and  appreciation of science, (3) improved
              communication and teamwork  skills, (4) understanding simple statistical
              methods, (5)  enhanced skill in obtaining electronically accessed data, and (6)
               enhanced attitude toward science.
