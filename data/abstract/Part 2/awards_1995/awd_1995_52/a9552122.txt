Abstract    :
              Over the past three years, the biology program has designed and  implemented an
              investigation-driven curriculum that emphasizes  learning through laboratory
              investigations.   This emphasis on  investigation as the mode of learning
              begins with the freshman  biology independent projects and culminates with the
              biology  senior thesis.   Specific courses throughout the curriculum have  been
              designated to focus on development of skills and attitudes  necessary for the
              successful practice of investigation.   Through  this project, a microplate
              reader/washer and an 02/CO2  respirometer are introduced to the students early
              in the  curriculum, providing familiarity with the theory and operation  of the
              instruments and the opportunity to design and undertake  investigations
              previously not possible.
