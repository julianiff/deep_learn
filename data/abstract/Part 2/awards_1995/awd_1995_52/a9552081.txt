Abstract    :
              The Mining Engineering Department serves the local gold mines in  the Black
              Hills and 14 large open pit coal mines in the Powder  River Basin of Wyoming
              and has very sophisticated computerized  mine planning capabilities.   The
              department offers a mine  surveying course for all geology, mining, and
              geological  engineering students.   The Civil and Environmental Engineering 
              Department serves a large area including the SD Transportation  Board and
              currently offers a two-semester sequence of surveying  courses, the second
              elective.   The main thrust of this project  is to obtain a one-person total
              surveying system for both  departments to use.   The one-person total station
              manufactured  by Geotronics is an entirely new surveying system.  Very accurate
               measurement is done from the reflector station with the surveying  instrument
              remaining unattended during the procedure and  controlled from the reflector
              station.   Data are acquired  electronically with easy transfer to any IBM
              computer for use in  maps, mine planning, and GIS.   The Geology/Geological 
              Engineering Department has recently acquired two GIS systems for  use in class
              and research.
