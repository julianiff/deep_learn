Abstract    :
              9552551  Fraknoi    The Astronomical Society of the Pacific requests $1,317,701
              over  three years to implement its California pilot project to six sites 
              around the country.  Each site will establish local, self-  sustaining
              coalitions linking science centers, astronomical  institutions, school
              districts, and community groups.  These  coalitions will, with training and
              support from the national  Project ASTRO staff, identify, link, and support the
               astronomer/teacher partners in their area to use the excitement of  astronomy
              to improve the teaching and learning of science in  elementary and middle
              school.  A second strand of the project will  use the Project ASTRO materials
              and techniques to train astronomers  and teachers at national meetings outside
              the six sites to set up  individual ASTRO partnerships on their own.   
              Materials to be produced include a: Project ASTRO Coalition Manual;  Training
              Manual; update to the Resource Notebook for the Teaching  of Astronomy.   
              Target audiences are students in grades 4-9.
