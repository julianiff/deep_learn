Abstract    :
              ***  9454357  Weissglass, Julian    Equity in Mathematics Education Leadership
              Institute    This is a four-year project to disseminate effective strategies to
              accelerate progress in achieving equity in mathematics education.  Two target
              audiences are a national cadre of 144 professional developers and a California
              cadre of teacher leaders.  Each group will be involved in 24 days of workshops
              over two years with expectations to use these strategies in their own settings
              between workshop sessions.  National participants will be recruited in teams
              from existing and forthcoming mathematics education projects.  The project will
              provide on-going support for professional developers through electronic
              communications and a newsletter.  The project request is $ 3,099,940 with
              cost-sharing as $ 809,212 or 26%.  ***
