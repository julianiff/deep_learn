Abstract    :
                   The Mathematics Department is standardizing its departmental  efforts
              around the computer algebra system MATHEMATICA and  extending use of its
              computer laboratory to courses in  differential equations, linear algebra,
              mathematical modeling,  and other appropriate offerings.  The objective of the
              project is  that mathematics majors be thoughtful and creative users of 
              MATHEMATICA both to enhance their course learning and to promote  effective
              application of technology throughout their scientific  careers.       To
              achieve this goal the univeristy plans to use, refine,  and test existing
              laboratory materials and to continue the  development of its own course module
              materials.  The university  anticipates that these materials will have wide
              national  circulation.  Equipment needs include (1) 15 Power Macintosh 
              computers for mathematics computer laboratories, (2) 3 Power  Macintosh
              computers for the Mathematics Resource Center, (3)  computing and display
              equipment in two classrooms for class  demonstrations, and (4) compatible
              computing equipment in three  faculty offices to facilitate one-on-one
              interaction between  faculty and students.  This equipment is networked to
              provide a  maximally supportive environment for development and use of 
              materials in appropriate mathematics courses.
