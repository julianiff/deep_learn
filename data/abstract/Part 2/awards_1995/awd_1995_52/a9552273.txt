Abstract    :
                   MP-IDEA focuses on precalculus classes and is supported by  industry
              partners and by an emerging network of regional  colleges. MP-IDEA has 4
              components: (1) design precalculus  courses that are relevant, that are
              realistic, and that give  students skills and concepts to succeed in future
              math courses  and in the workplace; (2) incorporate the intelligent use of 
              modern technology into the math classroom, specifically, graphing  calculators
              and computers; (3) incorporate alternative assessment  practices in the
              mathematics classroom, specifically, the  introduction of industry-based
              student research projects; (4)  incorporate cooperative learning techniques in
              the mathematics  classroom, thus improving student attitudes, achievement, and 
              interpersonal skills. This project improves mathematics  instruction,
              implements six recommendations of the SCANS report,  and serves as a regional
              model for improvement in postsecondary  mathematics instruction. An exceptional
              element of MP-IDEA is  educational partnerships with engineers and scientists
              at  regional industries.  These volunteers consult with MP-IDEA  faculty to
              write industry-based math projects specific to the  math that students in
              precalculus courses are learning.  The math  projects encourage cooperative
              learning, introduce students to  modern technology, and provide a relevant
              means of assessing  student learning.
