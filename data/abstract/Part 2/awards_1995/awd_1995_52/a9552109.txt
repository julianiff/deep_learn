Abstract    :
              A new scanning electron microscope is being incorporated into 10  existing
              courses in a diverse, interdisciplinary curriculum.   An  environmental SEM
              with an x-ray microprobe analyzer is being  added to enhance teaching and
              student research programs in  electron microscopy, cell structure and function,
              identification  and growth analysis of aquatic microorganisms, and the analysis
               of structures in chemistry and materials science.   An  environmental SEM
              permits easy sample preparation, thus  increasing the use of the instrument.  
              The addition of an x-ray  microprobe (EDS) creates a complete analytical tool
              for probing  chemical composition and distribution, a particularly important 
              tool for the synthesis and integration of chemistry and materials  science.  
              Small laboratory classes permit hands-on use of the  SEM by beginning science
              students and increase science awareness  and attractiveness to
              non-science-majors.   The microscope also  enhances an existing model program
              for cooperative  service-learning with a local high school for the addition of 
              advanced scientific methods.   The course use of the SEM-EDS is  expected to
              increase the use of electron optics in student  research, presentations, and
              publications.
