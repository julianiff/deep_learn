Abstract    :
              Through this project, an energy dispersive x-ray (EDX)  microanalytical system
              is added to the Biology Department's  existing scanning electron microscope
              (SEM) system.   This  enables students performing undergraduate research at all
              levels  of the curriculum in Chemistry and Physics to become much more 
              involved in the growth and characterization of materials using  techniques
              often developed for the rapidly emerging field of  Material Science.   Because
              of the relative ease of use of new  SEM and SEM/EDX systems, our students can
              perform spatially  resolved elemental analysis on films and bulk materials they
               prepare as part of our extensive laboratory research programs.    Students
              correlate these measurements with the wide variety of  other types of
              electronic and optical measurement already being  made.   High- resolution SEM
              and SEM/EDX maps are made available  to students photographically as well as
              remotely over the campus  ethernet.   This project promotes interdisciplinary
              scientific  research by undergraduates and helps augment an expensive 
              instrument (SEM) so that its acquisition and maintenance costs  can be
              amortized responsibly over a broader base of users.
