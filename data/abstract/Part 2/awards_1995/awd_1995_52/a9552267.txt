Abstract    :
              This project is establishing a new visual programming computer lab  to support
              the teaching of software engineering and user-interface  design.   The visual
              programming lab is equipped with five  multimedia microcomputers, a file and
              application server, a  printer, a scanner, and the visual programming language
              "Microsoft  Visual Basic."  The lab provides upper-division computer science 
              majors with hands-on experience designing, building, and evaluating 
              event-driven programs with graphical and multimedia user  interfaces.  
              Requirements analysis, rapid prototyping, user  testing, and design iteration
              are emphasized.   Two courses that  benefit directly from the lab are CS 480
              Software Engineering and  CS 481 Software Engineering Project.   A special
              topics course, CS  498 User-Interface Design, is offered as a test bed for the
              new  hardware, software, and teaching materials.   Students apply what  they
              learn in class to their programming projects in the visual  programming lab.
