                          Life Sciences    Title: Physiology and Biology Experiments in a
              Computerized  Laboratory    This project is allowing community college biology
              students to study  and analyze physiological functioning of the human body and
              other  biological phenomena with the use of computers. Commercially  obtained
              software programs is being used to study, record and  analyze
              electrocardiograms, lung function, somatic reflexes,  electroencephalograms,
              and simulated muscle physiology.  Students  are able to save data to disc and
              analyze their own readings and  class data as well.  They are gaining knowledge
              of basic physiology  and also becoming more computer literate at the same time.
               These  exercises are being incorporated into the laboratory schedule and 
              becoming a part of the standard curriculum for the Human Physiology,  General
              Biology and Anatomy/Physiology courses at Merritt College,  a two-year
              community college in Oakland, California.  Other colleges  in the Peralta
              Community College District, of which Merritt College  is a part, are being
              introduced to the software.  Laboratory  experiences with the computers and
              programs are being shared with  these colleges at joint staff development
              meetings.  Demonstration  sessions are also be held for Merritt College
              instructors so that  this equipment can be incorporated into most of the
              biology classes  offered at Merritt College.  As a result of this new
              technological  capability in our undergraduate laboratories, our students have
              a  better understanding of basic physiological and biological  principles, as
              well as an increased level of computer skill and  confidence.
