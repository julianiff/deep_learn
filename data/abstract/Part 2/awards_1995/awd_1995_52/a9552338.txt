                   Physics         Title: A Thin Film Materials Physics Course for Southwest
              Texas     State University           An upper-division Materials Physics
              Laboratory (MPL) course  will be established in the Department of Physics at
              Southwest Texas  State University (SWT) which will be the culmination of a
              newly  organized and focused "materials physics" curriculum track whose 
              on-going development was initiated by changes in the introductory  physics
              sequence four years ago.  The new "materials physics track"  is a coherent
              response to regional market-place pressure for thin  film science and
              technology education recognized by an independent  and broad Industry Advisory
              Panel.  This newly-organized and  focused curriculum track will culminate with
              the proposed MPL  course, and offer a curriculum option at SWT which addresses
              a  national need for changes in undergraduate physics education aimed  towards
              improving baccalaureate marketability for private sector  opportunities in
              marketable materials science-related areas.  In  addition, this proposal will
              also have a direct impact on the  existing Modem Physics II course (part of
              both the "traditional"  and new "materials physics" tracks).  The laboratory
              components for  both the MPL and Modern Physics II courses will familiarize 
              students with "hands-on" critical analysis skills utilizing new  instruments
              (atomic force microscopy, four-point probe apparatus)  and course-upgraded
              existing instruments (scanning electron  microscopy with energy dispersive
              spectroscopy, high vacuum  magnetron sputtering, x-ray analysis, and
              magnetometry) which are  commonly found in private sector thin film-related
              industries (i.e.  the semiconductor fabricatio n industry).  These skills will
              be  learned in a supervised mock research team environment focusing on 
              recently published research themes found in the professional  literature.  The
              proposed resources will be included in plans for  outreach programs involving
              minority physics majors, and high  school students (and their teachers). 
              Additional capital equipment  and undergraduate human resource enhancement
              tools (internships,  scholarships) will be sought in conjunction with SWT's
              Industry  Advisory Panel.
