Abstract    :
              This laboratory improvement project funds the acquisition of CNC  vertical
              machining center with tool changing capability and  metrology equipment to
              enhance the Computer Numerical Control  Laboratory to an Integrated Flexible
              Machining Cell and Metrology  Laboratory.   New CNC 3-D part programming
              projects and metrology  laboratory experiments are being developed to expose
              mechanical  engineering students and engineering management students taking 
              the course to advanced technologies, programming, operation,  simulation,
              accuracy assessment, and control of flexible  machining cell and the
              interrelation among them.   The new  equipment consists of a 3-axis CNC
              vertical machining center, a  pentium 60 computer and accessories, telescopic
              ball bar, and  metrology interferometer system for accuracy assessment of 
              machine tools, CMMs, and machined workpiece.
