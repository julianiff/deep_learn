Abstract    :
              9552892  Fuja    The University of Maryland will initiate a six-week, summer
              commuter, Young Scholars project in engineering at the University of Maryland
              Systems Research Center for 25 students entering grade 12.  By providing a
              balanced exposure to class, laboratory, and field activities, the goal is to
              introduce Young Scholars to a cross-disciplinary spectrum of engineering and
              scientific fields.  First-hand experiences in research will be provided to
              encourage and stimulate students to pursue advanced education and to discover
              the vast career opportunities in science and engineering.
