Abstract    :
              This project funds a computer-based laboratory for improving the  teaching of
              research design and analysis skills in the psychology  curriculum.   The
              general objective is to improve students'  competence, interest, and experience
              in conducting and analyzing  research with computer equipment.   This may serve
              as a model for  comprehensive regional universities in widening the pool of 
              future researchers.   Students in a two-semester Research Design  & Analysis
              sequence gain experience using a wide range of modern  research methods on the
              computers; these experiences are tied to  course objectives to improve
              understanding and skills in design  and analysis.   Students design, conduct,
              and analyze their own  original research using the laboratory and are better
              prepared to  enter graduate school and pursue careers in research.   The 
              laboratory is also used in other lower- and upper-level  psychology classes to
              provide firsthand experience with research  methods covered during class and is
              available to students working  on individual research projects.   Hardware and
              software is being  chosen to maximize flexibility and ease of learning, and use
              of  the equipment is being integrated into the Research Design &  Analysis
              curriculum.
