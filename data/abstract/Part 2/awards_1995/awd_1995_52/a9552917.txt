Abstract    :
              9552917  Robinson    Hampton University will initiate a 3-week, summer
              residential,  Young Scholars project in mathematics and physics, followed with 
              academic year follow-up activities.  The project will serve 24  high potential
              students who will be entering grade 7.  The program  will focus on student
              involvement in mathematic and physics  projects with Hampton University
              mathematics and physics  professors, scientists from a Department of Energy
              site, the  Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) and NASA 
              Project goals are to enhance mathematics and physics skills and to  stimulate
              their interest in science-related fields among young  scientists.
