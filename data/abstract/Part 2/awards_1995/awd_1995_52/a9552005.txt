Abstract    :
              This project establishes an undergraduate laboratory in which the  thermal
              behavior of electronics is used as a means of teaching  the fundamentals of
              heat transfer.   Essential heat transfer  principles are taught using
              apparatuses that model or simulate  actual thermal characteristics of
              electronic components and  systems.   This laboratory supports a heat transfer
              course  required of Mechanical Engineering Technology majors at the 
              university.   Ancillary uses of the laboratory in thermodynamics,  fluid
              mechanics, and electronics courses are also supported.  As  a result of the
              dramatic increase of electronic packaging  densities driven by requirements for
              more computing power and  real-time communications, thermal control of
              electronics has  become a critical technology.   The degree and specificity of 
              heat transfer education invoked by this technology pose unique  demands on
              today's technology graduates.   This project helps  satisfy those demands by
              introducing engineering technology  students to thermal control techniques for
              electronic equipment.    Because thermal engineering of electronics has been
              identified as  a critical technology for the economic competitiveness of the 
              United States, this project has the potential of having a  significant impact.
