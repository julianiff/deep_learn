                   Life Sciences    Title: New Visions: Advanced Optical Imaging for the
              Undergraduate    In an increasing effort to expand improvements in
              undergraduate  training, the Department of Biological Science at Notre Dame is 
              initiating a program to integrate advanced bioimaging into its core 
              curriculum. This decision is stimulated by a pressing need to  incorporate
              innovative methods for recording, quantifying, and  analyzing biological
              processes. In addition, new technological  advancements in applied optics,
              electronic imaging, and  computational-based image processing continue to drive
              the frontier  of biomolecular imaging into all elements of our lives from
              medical  diagnostics to science education and research. Clearly, if we plan  to
              stay at the frontier of this technology, we must provide  undergraduates with
              the opportunity to experiment, explore, and  discover the power of applied
              optical imaging. To integrate  bioimaging into undergraduate laboratories, we
              are carrying out a  variety of experiments that combine the use of important
              new  biosensors and molecular probes with state-of-the-art electronic 
              detectors, high-powered confocal optics, and sophisticated software  programs
              for the study of dynamic cell, developmental, and  physiological processes.
              These exercises are training students in  the nuts and bolts of electronic
              image acquisition, processing, and  analysis, while emphasizing the power of
              computer-based digital  optical instrumentation and its use as a quantitative
              tool for  biological investigation.
