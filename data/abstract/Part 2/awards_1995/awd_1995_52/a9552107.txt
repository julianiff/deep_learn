              Geophysics Lab      The Geology Department at Amherst college is adding to its
              course,  Physics and Chemistry of the Earth, a quantitative 13-part  laboratory
              analysis of a single objective (the local Deerfield  basin) conducted with
              technology appropriate to the problem address  and consistent with questions
              that modern scientists can raise and  expect to answer.  The laboratory engages
              students in an integrated  application of refraction seismology, gravity and
              magnetic anomaly  analysis, paleomagnetic study, major and trace element 
              geochemistry, and geochronology to determine the evolution and  present
              geometry of the Mesozoic rift basin in which the College is  located.  These
              "hands-on" laboratory investigations complement and  invigorate the lecture
              portion of the syllabus where the class  takes up the more generalized theory,
              implications, and  applications of these earth systems and disciplines.  The
              equipment  is being used to conduct the refraction seismology and gravity 
              survey portions of the integrated study.  All other facilities or  equipment
              required for this undertaking are available either at the  College or in the
              laboratories of the University of Massachusetts  nearby.  The equipment will
              also be effectively used in the  Department's Environmental Geology course and
              by majors undertaking  senior independent research.
