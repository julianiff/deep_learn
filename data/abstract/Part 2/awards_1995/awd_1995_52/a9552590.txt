Abstract    :
              9552590  Schultz    The Cotati-Rohnert Park Unified School District (CRPUSD), in
              partnership with the Autodesk Foundation, Hewlett Packard Corporation, Sonoma
              State University and Santa Rosa Junior College, is implementing project-based
              learning in elementary schools. Most of the student learning is to be done in
              project-based activities.  The design brief is used to engage students in
              applying their learning to real world situations of interest to them. 
              Portfolios are used to assess student learning, evaluate teacher professional
              development and to document the progress in the project.  Teacher professional
              development includes adapting existing materials to the deign brief format;
              implementing thematic projects, based on design, in the classroom; assessing
              student progress; and assisting other teachers in implementing project-based
              learning.
