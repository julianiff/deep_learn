Abstract    :
              9552929  Holbrook    Jackson State University will initiate a 3-week, summer 
              residential, Young Scholars project in mathematics with follow-up  activities
              during the academic year.  The project will consist of  38 students entering
              grades 7,8, and 9.  The program consists of a  series of "Mathematics for
              Everyone" workshops designed to interest  and encourage junior high school
              students to take mathematics  courses necessary for a possible career in
              mathematics or a  mathematics-related profession.  Learning experiences include
               hands-on laboratory activities, field trips, classroom lectures and 
              discussions, mathematics projects, and interaction with  mathematians and
              mathematics majors.
