Abstract    :
              9552942  Laurie    The University of Alabama will initiate a 4-week, residential
              Young Scholars project for 24 young women entering grades eight and nine.  The
              disciplinary focus is in statistics and probability with small group
              interactions emphasizing written and verbal communications utilized to explore
              and build skills.  Monthly follow-up occurs throughout the academic year with
              women scientists as mentors.  Parents, teachers and counselors are involved to
              support and extend the project's benefits.
