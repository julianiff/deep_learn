Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to improve educational experiences  for students
              enrolled in physical science, integrated science,  and calculus-based
              introductory physics.   The first objective of  this project is to equip an
              available room so that students in  the physical science laboratory course and
              students enrolled in  the integrated science sequence can benefit from a
              modified  version of the research-based lab activities (for example, Tools  for
              Scientific Thinking) that have been used with great success  in the
              introductory physics labs.    The second major goal of  this project is to
              enable the physics department to enhance  student learning in the
              calculus-based introductory physics  course by using the "Workshop Physics"
              format--a technique that  Priscilla Laws at Dickinson College has shown to be
              educationally  effective.    Ten audiovisual computers are provided through
              this  project.   Site licenses for software packages are also provided.   
              Version 1.1 of the "Scientific Reasoning Series," along with  SoftWindows,
              allow the department to upgrade and update this  software, which has been used
              on a limited scale with the  physical science labs.   "Interactive Physics"
              (version 2.5) is  being used in a pilot program for the physical science and 
              integrated science classes to determine if this program can be  used
              effectively with these students.
