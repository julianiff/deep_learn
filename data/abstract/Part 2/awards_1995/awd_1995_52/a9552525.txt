Abstract    :
              9552525  Grunewald    The National Easter Seal Society is engaged in a project
              to  introduce young people with disabilities and their families to  science, to
              provide them with access to science, and to familiarize  them with the wide
              range of career options which depend on science  and technology.  Easter Seal
              affiliates serve as project sites, and  a sub-contract with the American
              Association for the Advancement of  Science led to development of a
              family-centered activity-based  science program.    The three major project
              components are: Family Science events,  including hands-on activities, visits
              by "role models," take home  activities, and field trips; an Activity Manual
              containing twelve  themes to be used as the basis of Family Science workshops;
              Staff  Training for Easter Seal staff.    Target audiences are elementary and
              middle school age youth with  disabilities and their families.
