Abstract    :
              9552897  Opliger    The Ohio State University Agricultural Technical Institute
              will initiate a 4-week residential Young Scholars project in agricultural
              science for thirty-six students entering eighth and ninth grades during each of
              the summers of 1996 and 1997.  Project activities include enrichment activities
              focusing on the potential of agricultural careers; opportunities to participate
              in laboratory and field experiences with practicing scientists; a conference
              where students present their findings and discuss ethical implications of the
              project; career exploration activities, and a follow-up project involving the
              Young Scholar's sponsoring science teacher and class.
