              Sciences    Title: Enhancing Learning Using Computers To Improve Data Analysis 
              In The Biology Laboratory    Wayne County Community College (WCCC) is a large,
              urban,  predominantly minority, open door institution located in the most 
              populated county in Michigan, Wayne County.    Several goals of our core
              curriculum aim at educating WCCC students  to become computer literate, to
              develop critical thinking and  problem solving skills and to learn to work as a
              team. Through the  National Science Foundation (NSF~ grant, computer, printers,
               software, and other multimedia material can be purchased to equip  each
              Biology lab on each of the 4 academic campuses. Thus, our  students will be
              able to enhance their abilities and become  competent and confident with using
              a computer and other  instrumentation. In addition, the software will allow the
              students  and instructor to simulate real life problems i.e., B/P readings, 
              temperature, heart rate and plot graphs as well as many other lab  simulations.
