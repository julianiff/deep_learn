Abstract    :
              9552522  Pennypacker    Lawrence Berkeley Labs developed a CD containing
              educational  materials, staff training and the software necessary for informal 
              science education centers to offer to middle school students one-  hour
              sessions, multiple-day workshops, and ongoing participation in  a drop-in
              computer lab.  Hands-On Universe (HOU) is an active  science education program
              that provides participants access to  observing time on professional telescopes
              through the use of a  personal computer and the Internet.    The CD contains:
              exploration experiences and challenge games;  resource material including
              images from other national labs,  descriptions and animations of related
              topics, and astronomical  catalogs; image processing software; a
              telecommunications package  to interface with HOU telescopes and support
              network, the Internet,  and World Wide Web; staff training material.    The
              target audiences are youth in grades three through high school,  and adults.
