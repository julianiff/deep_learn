Abstract    :
              9552864  DeHaan    This Local Systemic Change project will enhance all fifteen
              hundred  and seventy nine, teachers from grades K-5, in the 78 elementary 
              schools in the Atlanta Public School district (APS).    Inservice professional
              development for teachers will consist of  four day-long, instructional sessions
              and a 50 hour summer  institute, focused on the PALS (Packaged Activities for
              Laboratory  Science) curricular materials.  The materials have been adapted 
              from notable kit based curricula such as FOSS, GEMS, Insights, and  Science and
              Technology for Children.    Summer Institutes will be held at Georgia State,
              Moorhouse and  Emory and will be open to 300 teachers (100 per campus).  The 
              preparation that teachers receive will enable them to apply guided  discovery
              instructional methods in teaching science and mathematics  in their classrooms.
                 To support the teachers the ESEP program will:         *    supply the PALS
              kit based materials to all the schools       *    assign undergraduate science
              majors, trained to help with            hands-on materials using inquiry based
              instructional            strategies, as partners.  These undergraduate students
                         will be selected from Emory University and five           
              collaborating colleges (Clark-Atlanta, Georgia State,            Morehouse,
              Morris-Brown and Spelman       *    assign each teacher-student partnership
              (TSP) a faculty-            science mentor       *    have resource teachers
              available to provide support to            teachers in the schools.    The
              request is for $5,699,850 for 5 years with cost sharing  estimated as
              $7,254,837.
