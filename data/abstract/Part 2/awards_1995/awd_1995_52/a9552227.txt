Abstract    :
              This project funds a multidisciplinary, applications-oriented  laboratory course
              providing hands-on experience in the  acquisition and analysis of dynamic data.
               Although the  Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Departments have been 
              providing courses in noise control, dynamic systems analysis,  vibrations,
              electronic signals and systems, and communications,  their laboratories are not
              sufficiently equipped to demonstrate  and reinforce the principles taught in
              these courses and students  have had little or no exposure to industrial
              applications of  dynamic data acquisition and analysis.   This new lab course 
              remedies these deficiencies, strengthens existing curricular  strands, and
              provides students with the training necessary to  pursue more sophisticated
              projects in their Capstone design  courses.  The new course initially is
              divided into five modules,  each centered around specific applications of
              signal analysis  such as speech encoding and enhancement, machinery sound
              power,  and machine condition monitoring/diagnostics.   The modules can  be
              modified and more modules added as technology and industrial  needs change.  
              Representatives from industry are being asked to  assess the contents and
              methods of the course.   The course  directly affects 70 - 100 engineering
              students a year.   A  laboratory manual with instructor's supplement is also
              being  developed.
