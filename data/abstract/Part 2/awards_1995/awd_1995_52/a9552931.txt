Abstract    :
              9552931  Schiller    Temple University will initiate a 4-week, commuter Young
              Scholars project to serve forty entering ninth graders of high potential from
              inner-city schools of Philadelphia during the summers of 1996 and 1997.  The
              disciplinary focus is mathematics with a particular emphasis on discrete
              mathematics, using computers and graphing calculators as tools in the analysis
              and solution of problems.  The activities planned will include individual and
              group work, group research projects, field trips, and interaction with student
              role models, mentors, and professionals in mathematics-related areas.  The
              participants will be involved in ten academic-year follow-up meetings during
              which they will present their research and explore other problems.
