              Laboratory and for       Student Research in Neurobiology    Data acquisition
              stations, consisting of a force transducer, a  computer-controlled preamplifier
              and transducer bridge, an  analog-to-digital converter, and a computer with
              acquisition,  spreadsheet, and graphical analysis software, are being used by 
              students in a vertebrate physiology laboratory course to improve  their
              competence in handling data, and engage them d) the  scientific process. In
              addition, this equipment is being used by  senior student researchers to
              investigate synaptic transmission in  the Xenopus lateral line.  These
              improvements in instrumentation  are not only enhancing the upper-divisional
              course work at Xavier,  but serving to strengthen the entire Biology program.
