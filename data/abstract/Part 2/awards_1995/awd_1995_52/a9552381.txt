              Sciences    Title: Establishing an Advanced Techniques Course in Biotechnology 
                Biotechnology is having an enormous impact in today's world and is  expected
              to grow. The continued success and responsible  implementation of this
              technology for our future requires a public  which is knowledgeable about the
              technology as well as a skilled  work force. Six years ago, the College of
              Agriculture at the  University of Kentucky initiated an undergraduate degree
              program to  serve these needs and as a means of attracting and retaining 
              students in an exciting science degree program. The purpose of the  B.S. degree
              In Agricultural Biotechnology is to train students in  modern areas of cellular
              and molecular biology and genetic  engineering, and to prepare them either for
              technical job  opportunities in the public or private sectors, or for advanced 
              degrees programs in graduate and professional schools. Advanced  laboratory
              techniques courses are essential for a program that  emphasizes technology and
              its application to scientific questions,  and is also an important means of
              exposing students to a greater  range of scientific endeavors and concepts. The
              current application  requests support for the acquisition of equipment for such
              an  advanced techniques course. This course Is designed around an 
              Interdisciplinary approach to a contemporary issue In biological  sciences and
              strives to stimulate interpretive thinking skills.
