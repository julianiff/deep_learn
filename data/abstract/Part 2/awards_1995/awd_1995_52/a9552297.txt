Abstract    :
              The Department of Anthropology's Visual Anthropology Lab (1)  enhances
              innovative instructional undergraduate training in  representing culture and
              behavior through visual media and (2)  supports student projects in visual
              anthropology and other  anthropology labs by providing upgraded facilities for 
              documenting archaeological sites, observing and recording primate  behavior,
              recording skeletal remains, and providing visual  materials for museum
              displays.   Specifically, this project funds  photographic, video, audio, and
              specialized computer equipment to  support a revised undergraduate Program in
              Visual Anthropology  that fosters student understanding of filmic and
              ethnographic  photography, ensures practical competency in film and/or 
              photographic production, and provides instrumentation for student  projects.  
              The department expects to renovate existing lab space  vacated by other science
              departments and establish an integrated  lab facility for all the field of
              anthropology including  osteology (forensic and primatological), archaeology, 
              ethnographic analysis, and visual anthropology.   The lab  facilities and
              equipment are envisioned as an integrated unit,  such that student projects in
              archaeology, primatology,  osteology, and cultural analysis have access to the
              Visual  Anthropology Lab facilities and vice versa.
