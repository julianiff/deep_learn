Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to incorporate gas chromatography  and gas
              chromatography-mass spectrometry in the first 2 years of  coursework.  
              Students are introduced to chromatography and mass  spectrometry through a
              series of three experiments in the first  semester general chemistry course.  
              The final experiment in this  set involves sample collection, extraction, and
              analysis of  herbicides from local lakes, streams, and rivers.   Students in a 
              new interdisciplinary Environmental Analysis course use gas  chromatography to
              measure methane production from different types  of soils and incorporate their
              results into a simple global  climate change model.   Organic Chemistry
              students make extensive  use of gas chromatography for assessing purity of
              reaction  products, and GC-MS to determine the identity of products and 
              by-products.   Analytical Chemistry students utilize deuterated  internal
              standards and selected ion monitoring to measure the  concentration of
              polyaromatic hydrocarbons in local lake  sediments.   Analytical students also
              utilize the GCs and GC-MS  in mini-research projects of their own design.    By
              acquainting  students with the principles of chromatography and the unique 
              problem solving capabilities of GC-MS early in their chemistry  experience, the
              project (1) creates excitement in lower division  courses; (2) gives students
              confidence in their ability to  utilize sophisticated instrumentation; (3)
              allows upper level  courses to focus on problem solving capabilities of the 
              instrumentation, rather than on details of operation; and, (4)  allows students
              to pursue student-initiated research.
