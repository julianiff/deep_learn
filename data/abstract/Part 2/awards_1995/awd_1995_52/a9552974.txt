Abstract    :
              9552974  AUDET    Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have a very high
              potential for changing the way students learn in schools.  However, since the
              use of GIS requires new pedagogy, new content and new ways of using
              instructional technologies, GIS may be very difficult to implement in the
              classroom.  The introduction of NSF-funded GIS materials in the Chelsea School
              District is studied to provide materials and software developers, teacher
              educators, school districts, teachers and commulity members information about
              implementation issues and their mitigation.
