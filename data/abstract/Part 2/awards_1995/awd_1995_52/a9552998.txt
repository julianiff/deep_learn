Abstract    :
                9552998  Shubert    This three year project would provide hands on enhancement
              of 20 teachers of chemistry each year at one of four geographically distributed
              sites across Kansas.  Each workshop would be four weeks in length with two days
              of follow-up during the academic year.  There would be a total of five separate
              workshops each serving 20 teachers for a total of 100.  These teachers will
              experience learning about the various experiments by a combination of
              cooperative learning and traditional lecture.  Each group of 20 teachers will
              share 3 complete ChemKits via mail.   There is in place a system for continuing
              the project after Foundation funding ceases.  The cost share is 39% of the
              request from the Foundation.
