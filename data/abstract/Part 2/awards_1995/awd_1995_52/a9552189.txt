Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to improve student understanding of  physics
              concepts, attract interest, and improve retention through  the use of computer
              technology.   Having tested the concept (as a  pilot project) taken from Ron
              Thornton and Priscilla Laws during  the past 2 years, this investigator and
              cal-based Physics 213  students have demonstrated the advantages of the 
              microcomputer-based laboratory (MBL) method.   Students can be  actively
              involved in lab activities and can experiment with  different data.   The
              success of the pilot project causes this  investigator to expand MBL into
              physics and physical science  courses.   This enhanced lab provides students
              with effective  learning experiences to support lecture theory.   In addition
              to  increasing learning, exposure to new lab instrumentation and  technology
              makes the students more competitive with peers upon  transfer to a senior
              college or entrance into the workforce.    Partial implementation of the
              Conceptual Exercises/Overview Case  Study (CE/OCS) method has begun and is
              being expanded into  others.    The project provides support for six
              workstations  equipped with Mac Quadra 630 computers, appropriate software, and
               supplementary lab equipment to implement redesigned and newly  developed lab
              experiments.   Up to 24 students per course in 6  different courses can benefit
              and be better prepared for the  technologies of the twenty-first century.
