Abstract    :
              9552948  DeLoatch    Morgan State University proposes to again collaborate with
              NSF in  the implementation of the student component of the NSF fourth  National
              Conference on Diversity in the Scientific and  Technological Workforce, which
              is scheduled in Washington, DC on  September 22-23, 1995.  Grant activities
              would include, in  conjunction with NSF, the selection of approximately 400
              student  participants in HRD and other NSF-funded research projects to  attend
              the conference in Washington and present findings from their  research
              activities.  The university would host the student  orientation, prepare
              abstracts of student presentations, and design  and schedule activities to
              encourage student interactions with role  models and other students, leading to
              the formation of a support  group to reinforce student selection of science,
              mathematics,  engineering and technology (SMET) majors and careers.  Grant 
              activities also would include scheduling student travel and hotel 
              accommodations, and arranging transportation to the conference for  local area
              precollege and college students and teachers.
