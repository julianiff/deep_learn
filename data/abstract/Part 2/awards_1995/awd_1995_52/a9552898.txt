Abstract    :
              9552898  Coble    The University of South Florida (Tampa) will initiate a
              five-week summer commuter Young Scholars program serving thirty young women
              entering 8th grade in the summers of 1997 and 1998.  The disciplinary focus of
              the program is marine science, emphasizing biology, chemistry, geology, and
              physics, with mathematics applications.  The students experience field trips, a
              data collection cruise on a research vessel, and laboratory experiments. 
              Female USF faculty and graduate mentors serve as role models.    Also to be
              initiated is an Mathematics and Science Teaching Perspectives component to
              provide opportunities for research and learning opportunities for six middle
              school teachers.  In addition to completing research the teachers will develop
              lessons to take back to their classroom, thus impacting a greater number of
              students.
