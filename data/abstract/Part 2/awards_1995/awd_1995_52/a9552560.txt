Abstract    :
              9552560  Valenta    The California Museum of Science and Industry requests
              $1,103,410  over three years to work in a partnership with the National Council
               of La Raza to develop two content-rich "discovery rooms" in the  Museum that
              are supportive of further learning in the larger museum  context and that guide
              parents from culturally diverse backgrounds  in supporting their children's
              science learning at the museum and  in the home.  A major component of the
              project is the "Our Place  Academy," a comprehensive education program that
              will train Latino  parents of preschool and school-age children to serve as
              learning  facilitators in the discovery rooms.  The curriculum of the Academy 
              will focus on skills that will both serve Latino parents as  partners in their
              children's science education and as leaders and  disseminators within their own
              communities.    A training guide entitled, "Making it our Place" will be
              developed  as a practical guide for building a trained staff from the parents 
              in a community to facilitate learning in a discovery setting.    Target
              audience is parents with preschool and school-aged children.
