Abstract    :
              This project provides improvement of a semiconductor  manufacturing laboratory
              that provides industry-specific  microelectronics education for undergraduates.
                To this end, the  Electronics Technology Department is obtaining three pieces
              of  semiconductor wafer testing equipment and a vacuum leak detector.    While
              geared in the main toward Electronics Technology students  and Core Electronics
              students, the laboratory affords new  capabilities for crossover electives and
              in-depth projects for  students in advanced courses in Manufacturing
              Technology,  Automation, Robotics, Telecommunications, Computer Maintenance, 
              Drafting and Design, Information Processing, and Industrial  Management.   With
              high technology used to teach high technology,  the semiconductor manufacturing
              lab emulates current trends in  industry and provides the students with the
              higher skill levels  required for success in this increasingly complex field.  
              The  new equipment is programmable, process-critical equipment that  allows
              students to make wafer tests and measurements usually  exclusively limited to
              small numbers of engineering students at  4-year degree schools.   They
              produce, from the first wafer  cleaning to the final electrical test, in real
              time in a  controlled M 4.5 (Class 1000) environment, integrated circuits  that
              differ from those produced in commercial fabs only in their  geometries.
