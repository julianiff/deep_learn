Abstract    :
              ***  Pallrand    Rutgers University seeks to provide a four-week, summer
              commuter, Young Scholars program with follow-up during the academic year in the
              biological sicences for 28 students entering grades 10,11, and 12.  The program
              provides students opportunities to work on a research project that is
              intellectually challenging and one that is not ordinarily a  part of the school
              curriculum.  Students will be involved in an authentic, ongoing investigation
              in molecular biology while they participate in a research problem under current
              study by the scientific community.  Additional experiences include structured
              field trips, classroom lectures and discussions, and hands-on laboratory
              investigations.  A unique feature of the Waksman Student Scholars Program is
              the sustained academic year involvementof students, teachers, scientists, and
              project associates.  ***
