Abstract    :
                   The primary purpose of this project is to provide the  equipment necessary
              to prepare prospective secondary mathematics  teachers to teach effectively
              using technology, as recommended by  the National Council for the Accreditation
              of Teacher Education  (NCATE) and the National Council of Teachers of
              Mathematics  (NCTM).  This is accomplished through the provision of the 
              equipment necessary to create the Mobile Mathematics Laboratory  (MML), which
              can be transported from school to school and set up  inside the classrooms of
              prospective mathematics teachers  undergoing the student teaching experience. 
              The equipment is  chosen so that the laboratory can be set up quickly using the
               existing furniture, no retrofitting of the classroom is required,  and no
              wires are running across the room.       Because prospective mathematics
              teachers will need to be  familiar with using the machines in the MML and will
              need to be  taught mathematics using computers, the Advanced Mathematical 
              Laboratory (AML) is also being created.  The AML, which is used  to teach
              computer-intensive mathematics, will be stocked in  virtually the same
              arrangement as the MML because using these  machines prepares the prospective
              mathematics teachers for using  the MML and the absence of wires and the low
              profile and small  footprints of the notebook computers are very desirable.
