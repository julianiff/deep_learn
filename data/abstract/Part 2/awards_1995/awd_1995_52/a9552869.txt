Abstract    :
              9552869  Kennedy    The request is to fund a planning effort that will bring
              together  stakeholders in Educational Service District 112, Washington State, 
              to collaboratively plan and develop a comprehensive model and  process for
              implementing a multi district Local Systemic Change  project in elementary
              science education.  Planning and program  development workshops, focus groups,
              peer-review and discussion  conferences will characterize much of the
              interaction between  stakeholders, project staff and consultants.    Funds are
              requested for a planning grant in the amount of $49,728  with cost share
              estimated as $6,200.
