Abstract    :
              A thorough integration is being conducted of the study of  mathematics with
              courses in physics, chemistry, geology,  biology, social science, economics,
              art, music, philosophy,  computer science, architecture, medicine, engineering,
              and  literature.  Engaged in the project are faculty  representing these
              disciplines at a large number of  institutions.  Materials are being developed
              that will be  designed for use in conjunction with other texts, as  independent
              reference materials, and as basis for  interdisciplinary courses.  Support
              materials for faculty,  including documented software, online materials, and 
              videotapes, are being developed.  The project is expected to  result in
              fundamental changes at the institutions in the  project.  In addition, through
              the materials being developed  and a series of intensive summer workshops, the
              project will  benefit faculty and institutions other than those directly 
              involved in the project.
