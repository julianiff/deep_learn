Abstract    :
              ***  9552915  Mirand    Roswell Park Cancer Institute will initiate an
              eight-week, summer commuter and residential, Young Scholars project in the
              biological sciences for 15 students entering grade 12. The program encompasses
              both research (90%) and didactic (10%) experiences for high ability, high
              potential students from across the country. The specific objectives of the
              program are: to expose students to an atmosphere of an active research
              environment; to develop their interests in research and science as a career; to
              learn the problem solving skills, habits and attitudes required by scientific
              investigators; to provide students with an opportunity to interact with
              college, pre-doctoral, doctoral, and scientific faculty members; to make
              students aware of academic requirements of a career in science; and to increase
              students' self-confidence by allowing them to conduct their own research
              projectq.  ***
