Abstract    :
              This project addresses (1) how to make Priscilla Law's Workshop  Physics (WP)
              applicable and cost-effective at the university with  a large number of
              students taking physics and (2) how to enhance  learning in the physics
              laboratory for the average student,  particularly Science, Engineering, and
              Architecture majors.   For  these objectives, new equipment establishes
              networked  Microcomputer-Based Laboratories in two physics laboratories.    The
              university is using the "Motion and Force Evaluation Test" of  Ronald
              Thornton's Tools for Scientific Teaching (TST) project as  a screening device
              to determine which students should take an  Introductory Physics course before
              taking the University or  College Physics courses.   This Introductory Physics
              course is  being run like WP.   Those students who actually need intensive 
              training get it, but those who do not go on to the standard  College or
              University Physics courses, thus educating the  students in a cost-effective
              way.   All the students also use the  computer tools in a Physics Lab course
              which most of the students  at the university must take.   About 600 students,
              primarily  Engineering and Architecture majors would be exposed to the TST 
              microcomputer-based lab each year.   Since the experiments have  been developed
              primarily for Science and Engineering majors, new  experiments are being
              developed for the Architecture majors, to  suit their interests and profession.
                This pilot program can  have national significance by establishing a model
              for those  universities who have a large number of physics students and 
              limited lab space.
