Abstract    :
              Through this project, the university is incorporating in its  curriculum
              practical work based on capillary electrophoresis  (CE), thus enabling students
              to gain proficiency in this recently  developed technique.   CE is destined to
              become an indispensable  analytical separations method because of its unrivaled
               efficiency.   The acquisition of this equipment significantly  upgrades the
              undergraduate chemistry and biochemistry laboratory  programs for B.S. 
              chemistry and biochemistry majors and B.A.   chemistry majors.   The
              experiments included in the analytical  chemistry course illustrate the
              complementary nature of CE to  HPLC by demonstrating its utility where liquid
              chromatography  fails.   The experiments included in the biochemistry
              laboratory  courses illustrate the utility of CE in the area of protein 
              analysis and protein-ligand binding.   An automated unit permits  students to
              develop awareness of the greatly increased workload  achievable with a
              state-of-the-art instrument.   It also compels  students to revise their
              notions concerning the planning and  design of experiments in order to exploit
              fully the productive  capacity of a computer-controlled instrument.   These
              curricular  changes enable the university to maintain its excellent record of 
              training undergraduates, particularly minorities and women, for  research
              careers in the chemical and biological sciences.
