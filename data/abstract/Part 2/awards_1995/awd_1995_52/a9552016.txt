Abstract    :
                   This project is designed to excite student interest in  science at the
              entry level through an Open Laboratory.  The  laboratory, located in college
              library, is being used to support  the three entry-level biology courses.  The
              target population  includes first-generation college students who are
              underprepared,  nontraditional students and non-majors who plan to become 
              elementary or high school teachers.  The curriculum for the  entry-level
              courses is being enhanced through increased emphasis  on problem-solving
              experiments, conducted by students in the Open  Laboratory.
