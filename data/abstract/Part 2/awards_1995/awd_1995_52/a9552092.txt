Abstract    :
              This project provides physics majors with familiarity and  confidence in the
              application of modern computational tools to  problems of interest to
              practicing physicists and other  scientists.   In addition, this topic provides
              a natural arena in  which to extend experience with the lecture-free Workshop
              Physics  course to an intermediate-level physics course.   This project 
              includes the development of a computational physics laboratory  and the
              concurrent development and implementation of curricular  materials for an
              inquiry-based computational physics course.    This course utilizes a standard
              spreadsheet program to  investigate the theoretical underpinnings and practical
               limitations of computation.   The course also uses a high-level  package
              (probably Mathematica) for application to more  challenging, "real" problems.
