Abstract    :
              9552924  Farley    Virginia Commonwealth University will initiate a 3-week,
              commuter Young Scholars project during the summers of 1996 and 1997.   The
              project will serve 30 students entering seventh grade each year.  The
              disciplinary focus of the project is on mathematics, biology, and physics. 
              Honors topics instruction will be provided by university faculty and by
              pre-college faculty who are members of the Mathematics Teacher Professional
              Network.  Student interest in mathematics and science will be nurtured as
              students report on small group interactions with industry and academic
              researchers.  Students will conduct an report on small scale research projects.
               Academic year follow-up includes regular contact with mentors and group
              activities through the Richmond Area Mathematics and Science Center.
