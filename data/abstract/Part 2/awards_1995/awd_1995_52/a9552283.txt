                               Interdisciplinary    Title: Building Environmental Literacy
              Through Participation in     GIS and Multimedia Assisted Field Research        
                We will develop, evaluate, and implement three related  laboratory exercises
              to support the undergraduate environmental  literacy initiative at the
              University of Georgia.  This  collaborative effort involves four University
              units:  Departments  of Geography and Instructional Technology, Institute of
              Ecology,  and The State Botanical Garden.  Students will become active 
              participants in long-term ecological studies that require them to  test formal
              hypotheses based on data they collect in the field.   They will be assisted by
              a computerized geographic information  system (GIS) as they analyze and
              interpret results.  An interactive  multimedia program, which incorporates a
              performance support  system, will guide them through the field research and
              data  analysis.  The following goals are addressed by the project:   instruct
              students from a broad diversity of backgrounds and  interests in fundamental
              scientific concepts including the design  and testing of hypotheses;
              demonstrate the importance of spatial  and temporal variation in the study and
              understanding of natural  systems; strengthen geography skills and familiarize
              students with  the purpose and use of computerized geographic information
              systems;  create interest in scientific research and science education as 
              career opportunities.  Our immediate audience is the undergraduate  student
              population of the University of Georgia, where completion  of an environmental
              literacy course is a requirement for  graduation.  The project will be
              disseminated as a model that can  be  adapted for use at other institutions to
              increase environmental  literacy and expose undergraduates, including future
              teachers, to  new technologies that enhance the study and teaching of science.
