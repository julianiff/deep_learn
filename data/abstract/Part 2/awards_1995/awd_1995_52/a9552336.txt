Abstract    :
              Within the decade, career opportunities in the environmental  sciences will
              outpace those in many other disciplines.   To  strengthen the curriculum in
              this area, eight univesity biology,  geology, geography, and chemistry faculty
              are involved in a  project to prepare students to address contemporary
              environmental  issues.   One such issue is the contamination of soil, water,
              and  marine sediments with heavy metals, especially lead which is  toxic to
              children at low blood lead levels.   The state-of-the-  art method of analysis
              employed by environmental laboratories for  low levels of heavy metals,
              particularly lead, is atomic  absorption spectrometry utilizing a graphite
              furnace.   A new  automated atomic absorption spectrometer equipped with a
              graphite  furnace allows collection of heavy metal data in air  particulates,
              river sediment, marine sediments, soils, plants,  mussels, and shrimp in
              courses spanning four disciplines and  ranging in difficulty from general
              education courses to advanced  senior level courses for majors.   The data are
              stored on an  environmental science database shared by natural science classes 
              that can be the basis for integrated studies in the form of  special projects,
              statistical analyses, and independent study  assignments.   The new equipment
              can thus be used to expose non-  science-majors to contemporary environmental
              issues, to prepare  undergraduates for the technical demands required of
              advanced  environmental professionals, and to strengthen critical thinking 
              from an interdisciplinary perspective.
