Abstract    :
              This project funds the development of a biology laboratory  curriculum based on
              the integration of interactive animation and  simulation courseware,
              computer-aided data acquisition from real  and simulated lab environments, and
              data analysis and  presentation capabilities.   Distinguishing features of this
               project include the combination of a number of diverse  instructional
              capabilities of instructional computing into an  integrated laboratory
              curriculum that promotes active learning by  students and the use of laptop
              computers in networked or  standalone configurations to provide maximum
              flexibility in  laboratory organization.   The general laboratory curriculum 
              development scheme presented in this proposal enhances a number  of courses,
              including courses for department majors, general  education courses for
              nonmajors, and service courses for students  in nursing and other health
              preprofessional areas.   As such,  this project serves the needs of a diverse
              group of students and  promotes the general science literacy of students.
