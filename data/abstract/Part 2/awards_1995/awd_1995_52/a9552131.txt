Abstract    :
              The computer science department is developing a course laboratory 
              component--based on a networked computer laboratory-- for its  upper-division
              undergraduate course on the principles of  telecommunication and computer
              networks.   Students in this course  benefit from well-designed programming
              assignments that illustrate  and reinforce the principles discussed in lecture
              classes.   The  laboratory adapts easily to different network hardware and
              software  configurations, enabling students to fully explore a wide range of 
              telecommunication issues, from bit-level signal transmission to  Internet
              exploration.   Advanced students from related departments  benefit as well as
              computer science majors.   The computer  laboratory is also used to enhance
              exploration of traditional,  networked, and distributed operating systems in
              the computer  operating systems course.   This project presents the student
              with  an integrated view of telecommunications and operating systems.   
              Project development and results will be recorded and disseminated  through
              workshop participation, conference presentation, and  journal publication.
