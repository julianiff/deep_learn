Abstract    :
              The faculty have determined that the primary curricular  improvements needed for
              the biology majors program are to provide  computer experience in the
              laboratories, develop additional labs  that require critical thinking in
              investigations using the  scientific method, and provide students with
              biotechnology lab  experience.   Laboratory exercises in which the students 
              formulate hypotheses concerning the effects of several variables,  design the
              experiments, and collect and analyze the data were  developed for the biology
              majors courses in zoology, cellular  processes, and botany.   The equipment
              funded through this  project includes (1) 10 Macintosh PowerPc's, software for
              student  use in collecting, analyzing, and manipulating data, and three 
              printers for student use in the labs; (2) the MacLab system, an  integrated
              data recording and analysis system that allows for the  acquisition, display,
              analysis, and manipulation of physiological  data; (3) computer-linked
              spectrophotometers and probeware for  data collection of variables that change
              rapidly over time; and  (4) biotechnmlogy-related equipment, including
              pipetters,  centrifuge, ultracold freezer, gel boxes, transluminator, and 
              vacuum pump.
