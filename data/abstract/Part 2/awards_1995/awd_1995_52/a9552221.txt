Abstract    :
              Through this project new experiments in optical spectroscopy and  magnetic
              resonance are introduced into the undergraduate physics  curriculum as part of
              an innovative upper-division laboratory  course for physics majors.   The
              course (Spectroscopy and  Magnetic Resonance) investigates electronic
              transitions in  molecules and solids, vibrational and rotational transitions in
               molecules, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy.   Students are  exposed to the
              most important experimental techniques in visible,  infrared, and
              magnetic-resonance spectroscopy.   The first  component of the course
              introduces absorption spectroscopy,  laser-induced fluorescence, and
              photoluminescence.   In the  second section, students investigate Fourier
              transform infrared  spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy.   The third component 
              introduces pulsed (i.e., Fourier transform) nuclear magnetic  resonance.   This
              course has a significant interdisciplinary  component.   The experiments and
              techniques explored in this  course are central to physics, physical chemistry,
              and  biophysics, and the experiments developed in this course are  available to
              students in chemistry and biology.
