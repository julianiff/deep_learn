Abstract    :
              9552941  Wyche    The Leadership Alliance is a committed group of colleges and 
              universities that have joined forces to improve the status of  underrepresented
              students and faculty at various stages of the  educational pipeline.  By
              working as a consortium, members of the  Alliance hope to effect change in the
              culture of American  education.  The Alliance intends to address the problem of
               institutional barriers that inhibit access to the crucial  educational
              resources that determine success and leadership in  academia.    The purpose of
              this symposium is to provide 200 Leadership Alliance  undergraduate and
              graduate students with a forum of encouragement  that will reinforce their
              aspirations to complete advanced studies  in mathematics, science, engineering
              and the social sciences--as  well as gather the tools to prepare for and enter
              careers in these  areas.  There will be poster sessions, several nationally and
               internationally recognized speakers, workshops, a reception and at  least one
              major social activity.    The symposium will also serve as an opportunity to
              provide detailed  information on the current climate of academia and industry,
              with  emphasis on scientific/technical specialties; practical information  on
              how undergraduate science/engineering studies differ from  graduate studies and
              how science/engineering career paths can be  varied, and pointers on how to
              survive and succeed, especially in  predominately non-minority settings.   
              Most importantly, the symposia will provide the students with a  sense of
              community and a feeling psychological optimism that comes  out of being part of
              a "critical mass" of serious students and  mentors--where everyone understands
              the struggles to be faced as we  approach the 21st century and can offer moving
              personal  testimonials and advice on how barriers have and can continue to be 
              overcome.  ***
