Abstract    :
              This project computerizes the physiology laboratory with four  Macintosh-based
              data acquisition stations, each with associated  transducers and data analysis
              software.   This equipment allows  for expanding the goals of laboratory
              experiences in Human  Anatomy and Physiology, Advanced Topics in Physiology,
              Organismal  Biology of Animals, and Animal Behavior to address recent  findings
              about the role of misconceptions in students'  difficulties with science.   Old
              laboratory experiences  emphasized reinforcing and demonstrating the material
              covered in  class; carrying out scientific hypothesis-testing experiments;  and
              engaging in collaborative dialogue about, and criticism of,  one another's
              experimental designs, findings, and inferences from  the data.   The new
              exercises include exploratory research,  qualitative and quantitative model
              construction, and model  testing.   The new equipment is easy and fast enough
              to enable  students to begin each laboratory with a period of discovery 
              experimentation in which they explore subjects about which they  may already
              hold misconceptions (e.g., the roles of oxygen and  carbon dioxide in
              regulating respiration rates).   Its  mathematical abilities allow them to
              build and evaluate models,  which they can then evaluate through
              hypothesis-testing  experiments.   When not in use for classroom experiments,
              the  computers can be used for studying tutorial programs and for  Internet
              access.
