Abstract    :
                9552926  Houston    This two year project will provide a research experience
              of eight weeks duration at UTMB for 20 students each year. The students will
              all be from those who are entering either the 11th or 12th grade and are
              interested in science.   Five of these would be fully supported by the YS
              program while an additional fifteen would be supported from other sources.  The
              students would be engaged in active research in the laboratories of their
              mentors.  In addition they would be strongly encouraged to participate in
              academic year follow-up activities including a science fair project.  The cost
              share is 265 % of the request to the Foundation.
