Abstract    :
              9552566  LaBar    The Tech Museum of Innovation developed a prototype of 
              "Innovation," a proposed permanent 8,000 sq. ft. exhibit, which  will be one of
              four major exhibit theme areas and will incorporate  approximately 80 hands-on,
              interactive experiences which promote  critical and innovative thinking,
              invention and problem solving.   The exhibit is designed to introduce visitors
              of all ages to  advanced technology and the process of innovation from idea to 
              usable product.  The exhibit will use engaging techniques such as  "immersive
              environments," "story lines," "open-ended elements," and  the "challenge
              approach."    The target audience is the general visitor of all ages.
