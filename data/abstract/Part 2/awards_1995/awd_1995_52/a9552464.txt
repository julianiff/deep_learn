               Middle Atlantic Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications Throughout the
              Curriculum    This project is designed to promote a climate in which faculty
              from all disciplines view  themselves as being jointly responsible for the
              scientific, mathematical, and technical education of  undergraduates, rather
              than clients and servers. To help accomplish this, a consortium comprised of
              the  University of Pennsylvania, Villanova University, Polytechnic University,
              Community College of Philadelphia, two  Philadelphia public schools, and the
              Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) is planning to  undertake
              this major initiative to integrate research and real-world applications from
              various disciplines into the  mathematics curriculum, and to achieve more
              effective integration of advanced mathematics and computing into  the curricula
              of disciplines that use mathematics.      To begin a process to achieve this
              overall goal, this project consists of four parts:    I.      Creation of
              application modules for mathematics courses and mathematics modules            
                    for          other-discipline courses.  II.     Development of basic and
              advanced interdisciplinary courses that integrate mathematics with specific    
                   application areas.  III.    Development of applications and
              laboratory-oriented courses for mathematics majors.  IV.     Development of
              materials for students in courses such as business, economics, psychology, and
              liberal           arts and humanities courses that focus on mathematical
              literacy issues.    Topics are chosen from a broad range of discipline areas,
              including biological and social sciences, as well as  engineering, business,
              and physics modules. These modules involve many different important
              mathematical topics  and techniques.  The two different types of modules which
              are planned allow for multiple levels of student  backgrounds. They impact
              multiple points of the curriculum ranging from courses for majors in fields
              which have  traditionally used little or no mathematics to those for lower
              division students in mathematics and mathematically  oriented disciplines to
              those for upper division mathematics majors. Several interdisciplinary courses
              are being  created, including one incorporating mathematics, physics, and
              chemistry as well as one in geographiometry. A  team of faculty are also
              developing a two-semester course for mathematics majors that surveys industrial
              uses  of mathematics via applications.  SIAM is proving expertise both in the
              development of the interdisciplinary  modules and courses and in broad
              dissemination of materials through conferences, workshops, and products.  
              Distribution of materials is through World Wide Web sites at the University of
              Pennsylvania and SIAM as well  as by commercial publication.
