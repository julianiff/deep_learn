              physics and mathematics for 36 students entering the 7th and 8th  grades.  The
              summer component consists of laboratory classes in  physics and mathematics. 
              Student work manipulative, calculators  and real world problems in the
              mathematics component.  Physics  laboratory classes focus on research related
              to energy and  mechanics.  Students participate in workshops related to their 
              individual research efforts during the follow-up sessions.  College 
              orientation, career exploration land ethics of science activities  complete the
