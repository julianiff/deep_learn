Abstract    :
              This project is enhancing the school's Parallel Processing  Laboratory by
              supporting students' laboratory activities for  undergraduate courses related
              to parallel processing.   The  laboratory supports parallel processing on
              different parallel  architectures and in different parallel programming
              paradigms.    The laboratory is equipped with a multiprocessor that provides 
              efficient support to symmetric multithreaded parallel processing,  a new
              technology in developing massively parallel processors.   In  addition to the
              existing multitransputer system for practicing  message-passing programming,
              this machine enables students to  practice shared-variable programming as well.
                The laboratory is  also suitable for graduate students to conduct independent
              study,  graduate projects, and research.   The dissemination plan features  a
              workshop attended by the faculty of all interested colleges and  universities.
