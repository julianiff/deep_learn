Abstract    :
              This project has students perform nondestructive laboratory work  on truss
              assemblies and members of varying geometry to verify  loads and deflections
              that were predicted by classroom problem  solving.   Implementation includes
              the construction of  pin-connected truss models and machine components with
              varying  geometry.   These are instrumented with strain gages and  appropriate
              readout equipment in order to demonstrate load  sharing and distribution in
              trusses and the phenomena of stress  concentration factors.   The project
              permits the student to  manipulate physical models in the laboratory to
              demonstrate  topics that now rely solely on problem solving.
