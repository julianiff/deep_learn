Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to improve the undergraduate  chemistry
              laboratory program by incorporating new electrochemical  experiences within the
              existing framework of the laboratory  courses.   The project operation requires
              the purchase of an  electrochemical analyzer suitable for teaching, routine
              analysis,  and senior research applications.   Increasingly complex  laboratory
              utilization of the instruments is planned as the  students progress from
              organic chemistry to instrumental analysis  and physical chemistry and finally
              to senior research  applications.   These laboratory experiences complement and
               supplement the student's present laboratory experiences, which  are centered
              around an array of basic instrumentation and a few  more sophisticated items.
