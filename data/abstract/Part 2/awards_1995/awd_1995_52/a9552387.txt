Abstract    :
              The Psychology Department is developing a computer-based  multimedia laboratory.
                The department has a well-established  research-based curriculum with an
              independent senior research  project at its focus.   In the past, students
              began their  research training in the second year, with Research Methods in 
              Psychology.   With the new facility, an Introductory Laboratory  is added,
              requiring students to begin their research training in  their first semester.  
              This laboratory introduces students to  the experimental nature of psychology
              at the beginning of their  college careers.   The laboratory provides for
              multimedia-based  presentation of stimuli and nomothetic rather than
              idiographic  analyses of data.   The new facilities also allow enhancement of 
              existing upper-level laboratory classes.   Laboratory classes  that benefit
              include experimental courses in Cognitive, Sensation  and Perception, and
              Social Psychology.   The facility also  provides an expanded technological
              foundation for independently  conducted senior research projects.
