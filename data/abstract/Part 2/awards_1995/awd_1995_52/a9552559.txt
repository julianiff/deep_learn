Abstract    :
              9552559  McCreedy    The Franklin Institute and the Girl Scouts of the USA will
              develop,  implement, and evaluate "Girls at the Center," a family outreach 
              program that will foster girl-centered, learning within the context  of the
              family.  Partnerships will be promoted between local science  and technology
              centers and Girl Scout Councils.  It is a multi-  component program that will
              increase girls' and their families'  understanding of and interest in basic
              science principles and  processes.  Consisting of a series of family-oriented
              activities  that coincide with the school year, science/technology centers will
               serve as the hosts.  These museum-based activities will be  supplemented by
              home-based activities.  The activities will follow  the constructivist theory
              of education and will cover a broad menu  of scientific disciplines including
              ecology, energy, and human  physiology as well as science careers
              opportunities.  They will be  linked to the requirements for the Girl Scout
              recognition (badges)  program.  It is building on the success of a previously
              NSF funded  project "National Science Partnerships for Girls Scout Councils and
               Museum" and is expected to reach 75,050 girls and 112,575 adults in  25 sites
              across the US during the funding period.  It will be  institutionalized and
              will continue to operate in those sites as  well as expand to other sites after
              the NSF-funded period.
