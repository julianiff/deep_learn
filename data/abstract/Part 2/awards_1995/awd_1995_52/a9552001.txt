Abstract    :
              Through this project, state-of-the-art diode array detector  spectrophotometers,
              microscope attachments, an ELISA plate  reader, cold cabinets, and supporting
              equipment is purchased and  an HPLC system upgraded to achieve full integration
              of  collaborative learning activities into selected core and elective  courses
              in the Biology Department.   Incorporation of  collaborative approaches to
              laboratory work have been highly  effective in a trial program in Research and
              Analysis.   This  approach is now enalarged to include additional core courses
              and  elective courses in biology.   The new equipment permits the  introduction
              of modern cellular-focused activities and projects  into a required
              sophomore-level course, enabling faculty to  introduce students to this
              important phase of biology early in  their curricula.   As a result, a
              significant increase in  hands-on student involvement is occurring in a number
              of courses.    A corresponding expansion in the range of undergraduate research
               projects our students might pursue is anticipated.   The new  equipment is
              greatly enhancing the learning opportunities  available to students.
