Abstract    :
              Atomic absorption spectroscopy has been established as the most  important
              technique in the identification and quantitative  determination of trace
              metals.   This project educates chemistry,  environmental studies, and selected
              non-science-majors in the  theory and operation of this powerful technique.  
              The instrument  is being used in introductory non-science-major and science 
              majors labs as well as for advanced chemistry and environmental  studies majors
              courses.   Starting with basic flame atomic  absorption of single elements,
              students advance to multi-element  analyses by graphite furnace atomic
              absorption.   This  effectively ensures proper training in modern atomic
              absorption  techniques for students who go on to strong industrial positions 
              or excellent graduate schools.   In addition to the students and  faculty at
              the college involved in this project, the local  Mathematics and Science Center
              has the opportunity to benefit  from this equipment.
