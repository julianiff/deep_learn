Abstract    :
              ***  Usiskin  9552990    The Gateways IV Conference, being held in Chicago, IL
              on October 7-9, 1995, brings together leaders from all the National Science
              Foundation funded elementary, middle, and high school comprehensive mathematics
              curriculum projects in order to share information and experiences and address
              common questions which have surfaced as materials have been developed, tested,
              and implemented.  A major focus of the conference is the discussion of
              evaluation studies related to the materials and methods developed thus far.  A
              special closing event acquaints the general public, the media, and policy
              makers with the progress being made by the funded projects.  ***
