Abstract    :
              In addition to a complete redesign of the curriculum, this  project is adding a
              capillary gas chromatograph, a UV/VIS  spectrophotometer detector, and a planar
              separations module to  the instrumental analysis laboratory facilities.   In
              the new  curriculum, students role-play pharmaceutical analytical  development.
                Each lab section consists of up to five groups of  four students that develop
              methods and acquire data sufficient to  complete an analytical profile for an
              assigned, pharmaceutical  compound.   Each of the seven instrumentation modules
              provides a  key piece of data for the profile.   The analytical profiles are 
              examined by pharmaceutical chemists, who will be serving as  mentors to our
              program.   Students work individually and  collaboratively within groups.  
              This curriculum is dramatically  improving the proficiency of bachelor's level
              chemists, making  them much more competitive in the job market.   In addition
              to  Instrumental Analytical Methods, the new instrumentation is being  used in
              a total of four upper and lower-level chemistry courses.
