Abstract    :
              The university is vitalizing its chemistry program with the  incorporation of
              modern instrumentation at all levels of  instruction.   It has recently added
              an FT-IR to existing  holdings that include a GC-MS, UV-visible spectrometer, 
              spectrofluorometer, and high-performance liquid chromatograph.    This project
              specifically addresses the need for a Fourier  Transform Nuclear Magnetic
              Resonance Spectrometer and explains  its integration into the curriculum, which
              is designed to prepare  undergraduate students for graduate school and chemical
              industry  positions.
