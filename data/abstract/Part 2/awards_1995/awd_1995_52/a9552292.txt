Abstract    :
              This project constructs two portable computer laboratories, one  in the
              Department of Mathematical Sciences, and the other in the  College of
              Business's Department of Decision Sciences.   The  laboratories, made of laptop
              computers, do not require that a  classroom be converted into a computer
              facility.   The classroom  is made more versatile by having network access.   
              The two  departments are collaborating on revitalizing Business Calculus.   
              The traditional course is being replaced by one that focuses on  analyzing
              real-world business applications and that makes heavy  use of standard business
              software, e.g., spreadsheets; the  interdisciplinary aspect of the team of
              investigators ensures  that the material developed is truly applicable to
              business.    Symbolic algebra programs are used for higher-level symbolic 
              analysis.   The students have laboratory projects that they must  analyze and
              solve and for which they must submit written reports.    The projects are
              designed to be used in, and thus enhance, both  courses.
