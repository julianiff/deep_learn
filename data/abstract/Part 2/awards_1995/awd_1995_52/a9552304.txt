Abstract    :
              An informal study revealed that new graduates in  materials-related fields had
              problems relating fundamental  engineering principles to manufacturing.   At
              present, the study  of ceramic machining is virtually unavailable nationwide to
               undergraduates in manufacturing as well as ceramic engineering  and must be
              learned on the job at the employer's expense.   With  machining contributing
              30%-60% and sometimes up to 90% of the  total production cost of a finished
              part, the Manufacturing  Engineer should be familiar with the intricacies of
              machining  ceramics.  The objective of this project, Machining of Ceramics,  is
              to show undergraduates the relationship between material  properties and
              machinability.   Machining exercises are performed  using a surface grinder and
              ultrasonic drill.  Variables, such as  feed rate, grit size, type of grinding
              wheel, as well as material  characteristics, are investigated.   Students learn
              how material  characteristics and machine performance interact to produce 
              different surface finishes and what variables are responsible for  diminishing
              the structural integrity of the machined ceramic.
