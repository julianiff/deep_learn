Abstract    :
              HRD 9552986  Moulton  The National Coalition of Girls Schools (NCGS) sponsored a
              three-day international Girls and  Technology conference for K-12 educators at
              Wellesley College in June 1995.  With NSF  support, the organization is to
              design and produce both print and multimedia information and  dissemination
              products stemming from that conference, particularly to showcase successful 
              approaches to the use of technology in elementary/secondary instruction.  The
              video is to be  disseminated as a professional development tool for precollege
              teachers.  To the greatest extent  possible, all print and multimedia materials
              are to be made available, not only in hard copy, but  electronically, through
              the Internet and WWW.  Extensive publicity and information  dissemination are
              to be undertaken by the NCGS.
