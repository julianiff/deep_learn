Abstract    :
              This project funds two new research-oriented courses in the  upper-division
              biology and environmental science curricula:  (1)  Life at the Edge: the
              Physiological Ecology of Life in Extreme  Environments and (2) Bioenergetics.  
              Students in these new  courses are engaged in the actual "doing" of science as
              they  conduct open-ended scientific inquiries for the lab portion of  these
              courses.   The new equipment, together with existing  equipment, enables
              students to design their own research projects  in many areas of ecological
              physiology and bioenergetics,  including studies of whole animal responses to
              environment as  well as the cellular bases to those responses.   These research
               experiences are critical to providing context for the lecture  portions of
              these courses as well as stimulating the development  of skills in scientific
              inquiry that are not possible in other  formats.   The objective is that
              students learn and use methods  of physiological inquiry and construct their
              own understanding of  physiological phenomena.   Another aim is to bring these
              skills  into the classroom and design and implement a "research as  curriculum"
              pedagogical model.
