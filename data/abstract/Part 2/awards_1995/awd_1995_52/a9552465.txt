              Title:    Mathematics and its Applications in Engineering and           
              Sciences:  Building the Links    The division of courses into many different
              departments often makes  it difficult for students to grasp the intimate
              connections that  exist between mathematics and its applications in engineering
              and  science. To make these connections clearer we propose to develop a 
              library of hypertext documents that will link important  mathematical topics
              with contemporary interesting applications in  various fields of engineering
              and science. This library will cover  the mathematical areas normally studied
              by undergraduate students  in engineering and science, including calculus,
              differential  equations, mechanics and linear systems, advanced mathematical 
              methods, and probability and statistics. The library that is  created initially
              will constitute the basis for a constantly  expanding resource that will
              support a growing movement, at  Rensselaer and elsewhere, to move away from a
              lecture-dominated  mode of instruction to what we call a workshop or studio
              mode. The  development of these materials will involve a collaboration among 
              faculty at Rensselaer and at a number of other institutions,  including the
              University of Delaware, Siena College, Virginia  Polytechnic Institute, Central
              State University, Hudson Valley  Community College, and the University of
              Maryland. By means of  Visiting Professorships, faculty at several other
              institutions will  also become involved as the project develops. After careful
              testing  and evaluation, the library of hypertext documents will be made 
              available on the World Wide Web, on CDs, and in printed form. Among  the added
              benefits to Rensselaer and the other institutions  directly participating in
              the project is a much enhanced level of  cooperation among faculty who teach
              related courses in many  different a cademic departments.
