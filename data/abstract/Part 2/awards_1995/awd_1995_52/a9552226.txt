Abstract    :
              Through this project, the Botany Department is microscaling the  labs of
              upper-division courses that feature analytical  biochemistry as a key component
              of the lab assignments.   This  project mostly affects Plant Physiology, but
              Plant Genetics,  Plant Growth and Development, and a newly approved thesis
              program  for botany majors also benefit.   These courses serve mainly  botany
              majors and biology teaching majors.    Performing labs on  a microscale, rather
              than a conventional scale, allows the Botany  Department to address several
              problems.    The cost of reagents  on a conventional scale is prohibitive;
              microscale labs reduce  the amount of chemical waste generated.   Student lab
              technique  improves, as students are more careful when handling chemicals in 
              small amounts rather than in large quantities.   Finally,  microscale labs can
              be completed more quickly than full-scale  ones, allowing students to analyze
              and interpret, not just  collect, their data while they are still in class.  
              This project  funds the purchase of a microtiter plate reader with supporting 
              computer hardware and software for data collection and analysis.    The plate
              reader is used in place of a spectrophotometer for  microscale labs.   The
              plate reader also gives students the  opportunity to use computer-interfaced
              laboratory equipment.    This project also shows application of the microscale
              approach in  a subject area other than organic or inorganic chemistry.
