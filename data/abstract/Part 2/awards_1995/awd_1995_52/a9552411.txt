Abstract    :
              This project provides the Computer Science Department with the  funds to equip
              laboratory rooms with modern computing equipment  essential for carrying out
              experiments and exercises in computer  science.   The Department has
              implemented an innovative set of  laboratory courses that span the
              undergraduate curriculum.   The  cornerstone of this set of laboratory courses
              is a unique,  breadth-first sequence of four courses required of all majors, 
              minors, and preservice teachers of computer science, entitled CS  I-IV.   This
              sequence incorporateq all of the traditional lower-  division topics in
              advanced programming, data structures,  algorithms, and discrete math--along
              with a strong ethics  component and introductions to the major subject areas of
               computer science (artificial intelligence, compilers, networks,  operating
              systems, and so forth)--into a seamless presentation.    The laboratory
              sections accompanying CS I-IV allow students to  explore and experiment with
              these topics in weekly 2-hour  meetings.   An innovative program animation
              system (DYNALAB) has  been developed locally with NSF funds in support of these
              labs;  algorithm and concept animators from other sources are also being 
              incorporated.   Students in upper-division undergraduate  laboratory courses
              use professional software and hardware tools  for their experiments.
