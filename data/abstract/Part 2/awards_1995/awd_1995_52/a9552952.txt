Abstract    :
              9552952  Kozma    The Center for Technology in Learning at SRI International and
              the  Software Publishers Association represent the two constituencies  targeted
              by these objectives.  The intended approach of this  project is to use the
              position of these two organizations to bring  together members of the academic
              research and development community  with members of the software publisher
              community to identify  issues, discuss their resolution and develop
              collaborations that  will bring NSF-funded ideas and projects to market and
              increase  their impact on education. The vehicle for this meeting is the 
              national meeting of the Software Publishers Association, scheduled  for Boston,
              MA Sept 26-30, 1995. Typically, 1,500 people attend the  east cost conference
              of SPA.    We plan a series of activities during this conference that will 
              address the objectives above. Some of these activities will be open  to the
              general audience attending SPA. Other activities will be  limited to an invited
              group of academics and publishers that will  begin what is hoped will be an
              on-going dialog that contributes to  the resolution of the identified issues.
