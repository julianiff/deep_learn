Abstract    :
              ***  9552911  Granger    Florida State University will initiate a six-week,
              summer residential with MSTP, Young Scholars project in science, mathematics,
              and computer science for 36 students entering grades 11 and 12 and 5 teachers.
              Each student completes an individual research project in collaboration with a
              faculty research mentor from Florida State University and participates in
              activities involving mathematics, computer science, and science (biochemistry,
              physics, or science communication). Evening seminars on science ethics and
              career exploration and weekend field trips complete the summer program. Student
              computer networking and the results of the individual research projects form
              the basis for the follow-up activities that take place during the academic
              year. Five high school teachers participate in a mathematics and science
              teaching perspective.  ***
