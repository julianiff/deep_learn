Abstract    :
              ***  9552840  Lucarelli    This project is for a one year planning grant to
              develop a project in three districts in the state of Maine.  The plan is for
              the three districts to develop a professional development infrastructure.  The
              communities are diverse, consisting of the blue collar community,
              professionals, and many socioeconomic groups.    The focus of the planning and
              the core of the work is to create  an infrastructure that directly enables and
              suppmrts the vision, to share resources, and serves all teachers K-12.  The
              project will plan a program of collaborative strategic action to address the
              needs identified.  The collaborative will:     identify existing capacities,
              connections, services and resources:   maximize existing human and
              institutional capacities, connections, service and resources; and   create and
              find new capacities, connections, services and resources.    The project will
              work closely with Maine's SSI, using the SSI's science and mathematics
              curriculum framework.  A cross-district inquiry approach to planning will be
              used which will build on the prior initiative of the Maine Center for
              Educational Services.  Educational technology will be an important tool for
              those involved in the project.  Educators in all three sites will be able to
              send and receive email, connect with MaineNet information services, and
              communicate with Internet users world-wide through the use of MaineNet's
              statewide electronic information network.  Cost sharing will be 80%  The
              project requested $50,000 from NSF.   ***
