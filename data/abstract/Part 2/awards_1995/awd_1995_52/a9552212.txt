Abstract    :
              The Scientific Visualization and Virtual Design Environment  Laboratory enhances
              undergraduate courses in science, mathematics,  and engineering.   It also
              improves the preparation of  undergraduates who plan to pursue a career in
              teaching science and  mathematics.   This project funds six Silicon Graphics
              INDIGO  workstations, CrystalEyes VR, and software packages by Alias  Research
              Incorporated and Sense8 Corporation.   This laboratory is  being used by
              undergraduates to develop maintainable graphics  programs and to visualize
              scientific data.   Students learn about  using visualization as a tool for
              discovering and understanding  complex phenomena.   In addition, students use
              the proposed  laboratory to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate potential design 
              solutions.   Students easily develop virtual worlds, animate them  with
              realistic properties, and experience them in partially  immersive mode.  
              Finally, the new laboratory provides students  with hands-on experience of
              software packages that are widely used  in the field.   This project injects a
              component into our  curriculum that heretofore has not been widely applied in
              the  science and engineering disciplines.
