Abstract    :
              The University will use computer laboratory exercises in its  introductory
              statistics course to foster scientific thinking  among students by encouraging
              creativity, communication, and  teamwork.  The project directors are
              constructing laboratory  exercises that emphasize real-world data sets and
              non-trivial  data manipulation.  Through the use of graphical displays and a 
              variety of other computer tools the students are more involved in  learning and
              developing levels of intuition and understanding not  achieved in the current
              course.
