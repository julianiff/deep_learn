Abstract    :
              HRD 9552991    The Public Policy Institute of Radcliffe College and the
              Commission  on Professional in Science and Technology propose to organize a 
              working conference, followed by dissemination of early printing of  the
              proceedings to key contacts in scientific associations and  other
              organizations.  The conference goal is to look at the future  of science
              careers through the lens of gender equity.  Given the  fact that we are in the
              midst of a major transition in our national  economy, it is clear that the
              nature of scientific workplaces will  be undergoing dramatic changes over the
              next decades.  During this  shift, those interested in ensuring equal
              partnership for women in  the sciences will need to be armed with information,
              analysis, and  understanding of the era to come.      The conference's targeted
              population will be those in the  scientific and women's communities who have
              been most concerned  with gender equity in the sciences, including
              representatives from  education, industry and government.  Additional
              participants are to  be selected from the economics and business communities
              who can  share with the targeted group their analyses of economic and 
              demographic trends and questions regarding the new scientific  workplace.  The
              conference will consist of one public lecture and  four sessions.  At each of
              the latter, two presenters will  summarize key idea from their papers, and
              raise principal questions  to be addressed during participant discussions.  ***
