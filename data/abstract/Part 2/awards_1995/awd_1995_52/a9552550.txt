Abstract    :
                95-52550  Byrd    ABSTRACT:  Byrd & Block Communication, Inc. is continuing
              production and distribution of the widely broadcast two-minute radio spots
              which focus primarily on astronomy, earth science, or environmental science. 
              Some programs also contain information about other sciences such as marine
              biology or chemistry.  The series is carried on 519 affiliate stations in 627
              carriage locations in the United States and can be heard in all 50 states.  Of
              these stations, 315 are public radio stations and 204 are commercial stations. 
              It also is broadcast by the Armed Forces Radio network and by the Voice of
              America.     The current grant will enable the producers to enhance the series
              by:    - Adding programs for weekend broadcast, thereby increasing the number
              of programs produced each year from 260 to 365.  - Making a concerted effort to
              add more stations, particular commercial stations, that carry the series.  -
              Working with Kalmbach Publishing, fulfilling listener requests for free copies
              of science magazines.  - Producing and distributing classroom materials in
              collaboration with the Astronomical Society of the Pacific  - Conducting a
              second and third annual "Earth & Sky Young Producers Contest."  - Expanding
              "Earth & Sky's" on-line presence on the Internet.    The writer/producer/host
              will continue to be Deborah Byrd and Joel Block, VP of Byrd & Block
              Communications, Inc., will continue as studio producer and co-host.  The
              principal content consultant for astronomy is Derek Wills, a McDonald
              Observatory astronomer, and the primary earth content consultant is Cliff
              Frolich, a research scientist at the University of Texas Institute for
              Geophysics.
