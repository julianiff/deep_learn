Abstract    :
                   This project addresses the need to extend reform from first-  year calculus
              through the second year and into upper-division  mathematics.  It uses
              computers in the classroom to assist  students' visualization, develop their
              insight, and enhance their  confidence in Multivariable Calculus, Real and
              Complex Analysis,  and Differential Equations.  Experiences are shared through 
              publications and presentations at meetings.  Materials developed  are
              disseminated through an anonymous ftp site.
