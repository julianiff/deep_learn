Abstract    :
              This project funds the development of an x-ray fluorescence (XRF)  spectroscopy
              laboratory in the Department of Geology.    Improvement of the analytical
              geochemistry laboratory is the next  logical step in development of the
              department's instructional and  undergraduate research program.    The new
              equipment consists of  a Rigaku RIX-2000 wavelength dispersive sequential XRF 
              spectrometer and associated sample preparation equipment to  support complete
              whole-rock, major-element, and trace-element  analysis of the full range of
              geological samples.   The  acquisition of this instrumentation allows full
              implementation of  a new geology curriculum that is aimed at improving the 
              undergraduate students preparation for entry both into the work  force and
              graduate school.   The new curriculum involves  reworking the
              mineralogy/petrology sequence of courses,  significant modernization of the
              sedimentation and stratigraphy  curriculum, updating of courses throughout the
              program, and the  addition of a capstone experience that will include a 
              collaborative research project for the majority of students.    The XRF is used
              directly for instruction in one introductory  course, four upper-division
              courses, and an interdisciplinary  course for chemistry majors and
              significantly enhances  opportunities for interdisciplinary teaching and
              research.
