Abstract    :
              9552914  Sullivan    With a discipline focus of physics and mathematics this
              Young Scholars project would enroll 30 middle school girls for each of two
              summers.  Using Seattle University as a base, during the four week summer
              program, they will work with practicing scientists on a series of field,
              laboratory and computer simulation activities to understand wave behavior and
              scientific methodology.  These activities will be complemented with field trips
              to industrial and environmental sites.  During the following academic year they
              will work on a small group research projects.  The fourth week of the summer is
              spent at Camp Hamilton in the Cascade Mountains where the young scholars will
              make environmental measurements on Lake Hannah and construct a model of the
              lake bottom from soundings they've taken.
