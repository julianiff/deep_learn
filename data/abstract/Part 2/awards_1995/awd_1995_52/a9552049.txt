Abstract    :
              This project funds the development of computer-assisted,  investigative
              exercises for improvement of undergraduate  laboratory classes in General
              Biology, Cell Biology, and Human  Physiology.   The project includes three
              principal objectives:   (1) modify several laboratory activities to follow an 
              investigative rather than a cookbook type of approach; (2)  purchase additional
              data acquisition systems that enable us to  conduct computer-assisted
              investigative laboratory activities on  a larger, more practical scale; (3)
              develop or purchase tutorial  materials for prelaboratory instruction
              accessible to the  students by way of computers in the Life Science Computer 
              Learning Center.  Recent experience in this department with  Macintosh-based
              data acquisition systems in undergraduate Human  Physiology classes have
              demonstrated the value of  computer-assisted activities for augmenting an
              investigative  approach in laboratory classes.   Computer-based data
              acquisition  reduces the time required to perform the laboratory exercises and 
              thereby permits dedication of more of the laboratory period to  developing 
              hypotheses, predicting outcomes, devising alternative  test conditions, and
              pursuing other aspects of the investigative  approach.   This places greater
              focus on the process of science  and motivates student interest in laboratory
              classes.
