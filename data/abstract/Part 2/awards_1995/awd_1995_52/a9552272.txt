Abstract    :
              Concepts of molecular structural are second in chemical  importance only to
              knowledge of a compound's elemental  composition and should therefore be
              introduced early.   Recent  declines in cost and increases in speed of machine
              computation  allow computer modeling to be used for such purposes in 
              baccalaureate level instruction as they have been by practicing  chemists.  
              This project focuses on the organic chemistry  laboratory, combining molecular
              modeling, molecular mechanics,  and electronic structure calculations.   The
              lab provides  students with the experience and ability to apply molecular 
              structural concepts in elucidating chemical problems.   The  approach builds on
              the department's experience with computational  chemistry, thus expanding the
              range of problems encountered and  techniques taught, and emphasizing display
              of the results as  high-quality molecular images which can be manipulated and 
              combined to provide greater insight into the structural basis for  chemical
              behavior.
