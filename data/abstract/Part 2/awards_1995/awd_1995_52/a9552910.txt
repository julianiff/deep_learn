Abstract    :
              9552910  Buikstra    The Center for American Archeology (Kampsville, Illinois)
              will initiate a 6-week, residential Young Scholars project for 34 students,
              recruited nationally and entering grades ten, eleven, and twelve during the
              summers of 1996 and 1997. The disciplinary focus is in archeological research
              with an emphasis on the role that geomorphology, botany, zoology,
              bioathropology and other disciplines play in understanding past societies. 
              Students will spend three weeks excavating at a prehistoric Native American
              site.  Activities will introduce the students to ethical issues, career
              choices, and computer applications in archeology.
