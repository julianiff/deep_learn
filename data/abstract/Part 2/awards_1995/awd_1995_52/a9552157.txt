Abstract    :
              This project supports the Electronic Instrumentation course of  the Scientific
              Instrumentation Option program available to  physics majors.   The course
              consists of one lecture and six  hours of laboratory per week.   The revised
              course focuses on  data acquisition and manipulation.   The intent of this
              course is  to produce a senior or graduate-level student who can walk into 
              almost any science laboratory, determine the sensor and  microcomputer needs
              for the laboratory, connect the various  sensors and cards to the computer,
              write simple software to  perform the data acquisition task, and then analyze
              the resulting  data knowledgeably to minimize the effects of noise or
              transducer  nonlinearities.   This course is taught concurrently with a 
              semester lecture course on Fourier transforms, Laplace  transforms, Z
              transforms, and their applications.    This project  specifically funds the
              purchase of equipment for the laboratory  in support of this course revision: 
              10 IBM-compatible PC  workstations with I/O cards, Ethernet Linkage, and a
              large  variety of sensors.
