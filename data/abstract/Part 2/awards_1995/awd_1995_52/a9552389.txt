Abstract    :
              Microscopy equipment is being utilized within the manufacturing  processes and
              materials laboratory, and laboratory projects are  being developed for student
              use.   The microscopy equipment that  was used in the Materials Laboratory was
              limited to the extent  that only one person could view the image at any given
              time.    The instructor's ability to provide a meaningful answer to any 
              questions the student asked about the structure was dependent  upon the
              student's ability to describe what was seen.  The new  use of a video camera
              and console allows for a more positive  identification of and discussion of the
              observed microstructure,  since both student and instructor view the structure 
              simultaneously.   Other students benefit from the discussion of  the
              microstructure in question, and all can see that structure.    The imaging
              equipment is giving the student greater flexibility  in obtaining photographic
              images for inclusion in laboratory  reports.   Using the video camera and
              digital printer allows  making a hard copy without moving the specimen from one
               instrument to another.   Since the digital images are less  expensive as
              compared with the photographic methods currently  used, time and money saved
              allow the individual student to make  increased use of the microscopy
              equipment.
