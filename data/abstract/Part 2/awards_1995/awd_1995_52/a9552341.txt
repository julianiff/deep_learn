Abstract    :
              This grant is enabling the Department of Computer and Information  Science to
              build a Silicon Graphics (SGI) computer laboratory.   To  foster computer
              graphics use in the sciences and arts the  university has initiated a series of
              undergraduate courses in  computer graphics.   These courses prepare students
              to use  available graphics software and to develop graphics output to solve 
              their specific needs, enhance student understanding of math and  science data,
              and allow students to better visualize their  environment.   These courses are
              open to students in computer  science, engineering, mathematics, chemistry,
              physics, biology,  radio, television and film, and art.   The lab serves as a 
              campuswide resource for new courses, previously funded research  projects, and
              all interested students.   As many as 400 students  are expected to use this
              computer graphics lab each academic year.
