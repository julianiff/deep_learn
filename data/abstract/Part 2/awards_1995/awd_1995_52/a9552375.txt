Abstract    :
              This project upgrades the status of the biotechnology laboratory  in order to
              serve the specific training needs of the  biotechnology private sector.  
              Students graduating with a degree  in biotechnology from the college are
              conducting analyses using  the HPLC in the following areas of biotechnology:
              (1) analysis,  separation, and purification of polypeptides and
              oligonucleotides  proteins including protein variants; (2) pharmaceutical
              compounds  such as water soluble vitamins, anticonvulsants, antihistamines, 
              cateholarnines, antidepressants, and polyaromaic hydrocarbons;  (3) compounds
              sometimes found in air, water, or other natural  environments that need to be
              monitored to maintain a healthy  environment; and (4) compounds found in the
              food industry.
