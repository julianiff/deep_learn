Abstract    :
              Static blackboard drawings do not help instructors engage  advanced psychology
              students in learning how humans process  perceptual information.   Moreover,
              blackboard drawings do not  permit students to conduct research investigating
              perceptual  processing.   This project funds a perception teaching laboratory 
              capable of supporting student research projects and  teacher-initiated class
              demonstrations.   The laboratory contains  microcomputers and software designed
              for tachistoscopic  presentation of visual stimuli that both teach and permit 
              students to explore kinetic factors in depth perception.     Specific
              objectives for the project are (1) to enhance student  understanding of
              perception of depth through motion, perception  of motion and velocity, visual
              persistence, backward visual  masking, and the perception of moving
              equiluminant contours and  (2) to place students in active research roles that
              require them  to use the requested microcomputers to perform individual 
              experiments on each of the perceptual topics being taught.   The  project
              overcomes current pedagogical deficits by allowing for  experiential, as well
              as decriptive, learning.
