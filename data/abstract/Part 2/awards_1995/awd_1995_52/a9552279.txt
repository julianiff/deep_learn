Abstract    :
              Conduction in multilayer materials is currently of great  interest, but is
              neither well understood nor has it been  exhaustively investigated.  
              Measurement of conduction processes  is fundamental in material science, and
              because it is relatively  straightforward it is ideal for upper-level students
              at  undergraduate institutions.   In this project, a low-temperature  cryostat
              is integrated into an existing resistivity and Hall  effect apparatus and used
              to study the temperature dependence of  the electronic transport properties of
              multilayer materials.    The apparatus has been under development and is now
              used in a  junior- level advanced laboratory course to study metal and 
              semiconductor systems.   The cryostat greatly increases the  experimental
              capabilities in the junior-level laboratory course  and in independent study
              and senior-level thesis projects.   New  projects focus on the temperature,
              magnetic field, current  direction, and layer spacing dependencies of the 
              magnetoresistance and Hall voltage in multilayer systems.   Low-  temperature
              capabilities allow the transport properties to be  characterized over a
              temperature range broad enough to study the  nature of the electronic
              scattering mechanisms.   Initial systems  of study are C/Ge and W/Si
              multilayers, with layer thicknesses  ranging from 5 to 50 Angstroms.  
              Fabrication and structural  studies of these multilayers are performed in
              collaboration with  another research group.   This project should increase the 
              presence of material science education and research at  undergraduate
              institutions.
