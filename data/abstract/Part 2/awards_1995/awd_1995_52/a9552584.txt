Abstract    :
              9553584  Hein    Under the Small Grants For Exploratory Research guidelines, Dr.
               George Hein will carry out basic research in informal learning in  a museum
              setting.  Dr. Hein will examine the literature and provide  a summary of 1)
              what is known about the motivations of museums  visitors, how they learn and
              how they react to the intellectual,  social, and physical context of museums
              and 2) what is known about  the theory and methods of visito research in
              museums.  These  results will then be linked to a detailed discussion of 
              constructivist learning theory and he will explore how that theory  can be used
              to explain visitor behavior and how it can be used as   a guide to research in
              learning in museums.  Research will be  carried out in England and the United
              States and will include a  thorough review of the relevant literature written
              in English and  extensive consultations with other professionals working on the
               theory of informal learning in museum settings.  The research will  result in
              a monograph that will be broadly disseminated.  Although  focused particularly
              on learning in a museum setting, the monograph  will be of interest to all
              those interested in the informal  learning process which includes museum
              professionals, formal  educators, executives of community-based programs, and
              media  producers.
