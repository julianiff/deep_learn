Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is for the Physics Department to be an  active center
              for observational astronomy.   This is being   accomplished through the
              purchase of instrumentation specifically  designed to be both portable and
              effective in providing a  first-hand experience with modern techniques in
              observational  astronomy.   This instrumentation consists of three basic 
              components:  (1) a portable 12-inch computer-controlled  Schmidt-Cassegrain
              telescope, (2) a thermally cooled CCD camera  to attach to the telescope, and
              (3) a portable laptop computer to  control the telescope and to display, in
              real time, digital  images.   The project's primary group is non-science-majors
               taking Introductory Astronomy and physics majors enrolled in the  Advanced
              Laboratory course, but the equipment is also available  to all
              non-science-majors.   In addition, the college is  attempting to meet the
              demonstrated need of the Sioux Falls  community, and the surrounding area, for
              access to telescope  viewing.
