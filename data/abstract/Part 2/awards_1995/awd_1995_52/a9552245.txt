Abstract    :
              The laboratory provided by this grant allows and encourages the  distribution of
              parallel processing throughout a Computer Science  curriculum where it is
              already established.   Parallel processing  is being used as a tool as well as
              an object of study.   In  addition, it is being used to support term projects
              and independent  student research.   Through this project, seven additional
              courses  can include parallel processing.   The laboratory provided by this 
              grant includes a SIMD parallel processor that is ideally suited for  many of
              the assignments and projects in areas such as image  processing, speech and
              language processing, and neural networks.    In addition, a MIMD processor is
              being used in some Artificial  Intelligence courses, such as Natural Language
              Processing and  Machine Learning, and in Graphics courses.   Students from 
              disciplines such as physics and mathematics have access to the  parallel
              processing lab for research.   This project can  demonstrate the feasibility of
              using parallel processing on a large  scale in the undergraduate computer
              science curriculum.
