Abstract    :
              The central theme of this project is the creation of a computer  laboratory in
              which students will do exercises, projects, and  experiments designed to
              strengthen and deepen their understanding  of concepts of linear algebra and
              vector calculus.  An increased  emphasis on numerical and graphical techniques
              will build upon  students' recent experiences in single-variable calculus.  A 
              laboratory-enhanced Linear Algebra/Vector Calculus sequence will  benefit
              students by:  (1) making them active learners of the  material instead of
              passive listeners, (2) encouraging  cooperative learning, (3) placing more
              emphasis on writing, (4)  empowering students to use computers as natural tools
              for  visualizing and exploring mathematical ideas, (5) strengthening  the
              connection between Linear Algebra and Vector Calculus, and  (6) introducing
              realistic applications.  The PC-Lab contains 20  networked Pentium PC's and
              supporting devices.  The primary  software is MATLAB and the Symbolic Math
              Toolbox.
