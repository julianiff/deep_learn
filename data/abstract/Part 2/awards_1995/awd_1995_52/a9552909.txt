Abstract    :
              9552909  Narayan    The SUNY at Oswego will initiate a four-week, residential
              Young Scholars project to serve thirty-two students entering eighth grade
              during the summers of 1996 and 1997.  The disciplinary focus of the project is
              in mathematics and physics with an emphasis on using mathematics and
              spreadsheet applications to study physical concepts related to motion, light,
              and everyday activities.  Students will explore career options and study issues
              related to ethical concerns in science and industry.  Follow-up involves
              teacher mentors, student participation in research projects and group meetings.
