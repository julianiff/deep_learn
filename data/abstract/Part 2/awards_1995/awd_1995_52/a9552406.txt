              Title: Improvement of Undergraduate Education in Geoscience and  Engineering
              Through the Acquisition of New Subsurface Exploration  Technology    The
              ground-penetrating radar system (GPR) in this proposal is being  used to
              establish an inquiry-oriented, hands-on approach to  educating undergraduates. 
              The equipment is an integral part of a  new course in environmental geophysics
              that allows students to  apply scientific concepts and state-of-the-art
              technology to  geological, engineering and environmental problems.  This course
              is  intended to teach upper-level undergraduate students how to ask  questions,
              collect appropriate data and how to interpret that data  in a meaningful way,
              in short, train students to think  scientifically.  In addition, GPR is used to
              demonstrate the  practical utility of geophysical measurements to first and
              second  year undergraduate geology and engineering majors through real time 
              visualization of familiar shallow sub-surface structures.
