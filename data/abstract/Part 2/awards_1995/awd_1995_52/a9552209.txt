                      Geosciences    Title: Enhancement of Courses in Mineralogy, Petrology,
              and Soil  Science with X-Ray Diffraction Laboratory Experiences    This project
              improves instruction in geoscience and soil science  courses through the
              incorporation of instruction in X-ray  diffraction (XRD).  The courses to be
              effected are Rocks and  Minerals, Mineralogy and Petrology, Optical Mineralogy
              and  Petrography, Clay MIneralogy, and Soil Classification and Resource 
              Management.  The XRD equipment also opens exciting investigations  that can be
              pursued under Introduction to Geoscience Research and  the capstone course,
              Senior Research and Seminar.  The development  plan involves introducing the
              XRD powder methodof identification  early in the sophomore year followed by
              progressively more  sophisticated mineralogical problem-solving in upper level
              courses.   The impact will be assessed by student evaluation and peer 
              observation of laboratory activities, and publication of the  developments is
              anticipated.
