                      Interdisciplinary    Title: Instructional Improvements in Analytical
              Instrumentation     Used for Environmental Studies           Mesa State College
              is providing leadership through its  development of an interdisciplinary
              curriculum within undergraduate  environmental education.  One of the program
              strengths lies in the  extensive laboratory experiences for students.  There is
              an  emphasis on the proper use of analytical instrumentation to aide 
              environmental site assessments.  The use of field portable  instrumentation in
              conjunction with more traditional analytical  chemistry is the key to insuring
              effective assessments of  contaminated areas.   We will develop a series of
              laboratories  which will provide students with an understanding of how to 
              effectively use modern instrumentation both in the field and within  the
              laboratory. Students will learn through hands-on exercises and  classroom
              discussions the importance of scientifically assessing  environmental systems. 
              This will also provide students with a  basis for understanding the chemical
              and physical factors which  affect the environmental fate of contaminants.  The
              instrumentation  in this project will be used in an integrated manner to
              examine the  metal composition of environmental matrices.  The results of this 
              project will be disseminated through presentations, preparation of  lab
              manuals, textbooks and research publications.  This project  will also improve
              geology studies and a new chemistry degree.
