                                      Project:                                               
                    Mathematics    Title: The Golden West College Multimedia
              Classroom-Laboratory             This project converts two traditional
              classrooms into  Multimedia Classroom-Laboratories each equipped with two large
               screen monitors and a computer capable of running Macintosh and DOS  software.
               This project also expands the Mathematics Department's  existing Mathematica
              Computer-Lab from 16 to 25 stations in order  to accommodate the anticipated
              increased usage.  In addition to the  initial target group of Precalculus and
              Calculus students, the use  of the lab will be expanded to include Linear
              Algebra, Discrete  Math, Statistics, and Math for Elementary Teachers.  The use
              of  cooperative learning activities and projects are the catalyst to  transform
              students from observers to active learners capable of  using technology to
              solve mathematical problems and implement  mathematical models.  Transforming
              the traditional classroom into  the Multimedia Classroom-Laboratory addresses
              the need to use  appropriate technology, projects, and increased student
              involvement  on a daily basis to:                  modify the role of the
              student from observer to active                learner;                increase
              the effectiveness of learning activities by                reducing student
              frustration in interfacing with the                computers;               
              enhance communication with both native and non-native                English
              speakers;                improve student problem solving and modeling skills;  
                           modify the instructor's role from lecturer to coach.          
              Evaluation and dissemination include the formation of an  advisory board for
              evaluation and a video tape for  dissemination.  An advisory board consisting
              of faculty in mathematics and other  disciplines; representatives of High
              School, four year schools,  selected local industries, and students will
              provide feedback on  the appropriateness and effectiveness of the changes in
              the  curriculum.  The video tape is to demonstrate the Multimedia 
              Classroom-Laboratory in action and is intended to communicate  results to the
              teaching community.
