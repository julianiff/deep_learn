Abstract    :
              9552540  Anderson    ABSTRACT:  The Cincinnati Museum of Natural history,
              working with MacGillivray Freeman Films, will conduct developmental work on an
              OMNIMAX/IMAX film about caves.  This pilot phase will include:    o Development
              of a treatment for the film that takes advantage of the qualities of the IMAX
              medium; maintains the high quality science which is in the preliminary draft
              treatment; and adds the storyline, adventure, and interest factors needed to
              attract and hold an audience.      o Conduct trial filming in a cave to test
              the feasibility of working in this "hostile" environment.  No post production
              will be completed on this short footage at this stage of the project.  However,
              the film will demonstrate the ability to film with the bulky IMAX equipment
              well into a cave, to produce moving camera shots if they may be part of the
              film, and to get sufficient lighting into the cave to shoot high quality film.
