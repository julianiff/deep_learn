                    Chemistry       Title: Computerized Data Acquisition and Management in
              Freshman     Chemistry Laboratory                  Students are being exposed
              to the pedagogically sound use of  computers in those laboratory tasks they
              traditionally perform.   The objectives are:  more expeditious use of
              laboratory time,  timely feed-back about the quality of data being gathered, 
              opportunities to engage in "what if" exploration of the laboratory 
              information, and broadening of student experience beyond the  familiar use of
              computers while retaining the familiar  approachability of the personal
              computer.         Methods already used in our laboratories in the instruction
              of  science majors are being extended to non-majors.  All beginning  chemistry
              students, majors and non-majors alike, have the benefit  of computer-assisted
              data gathering and manipulation, affecting  approximately half of their
              laboratory experiences in newly  constructed laboratory facilities designed
              explicitly for this  purpose.  Data collection is being done using the Labworks
               interface, using "scripts" easily understood and constructed by the 
              experimenter.  Computer-generated report guidance reflects  students' own tasks
              of data manipulation and also announces  measures of the quality of the
              individual data set.
