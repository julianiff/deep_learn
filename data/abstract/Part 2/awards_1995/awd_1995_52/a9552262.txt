                    Mathematics    Title: Mathematics Computer Laboratory             Through
              this project, a networked computer lab dedicated to  college level mathematics
              courses is being established.  The  courses include Calculus I, II, and III and
              Differential  Equations.  The first 3 of these courses are 5 semester hours.  
              Differential Equations is likely to change from 3 semester hours  to 4 to
              incorporate more linear algebra in response to changes at  transfer
              institutions.  Graphing calculators have replaced  computers on projects.  They
              have enabled students explore  functional behavior, visualize, and program
              numerical techniques.   In Differential Equations, students draw by hand a
              direction  fields and trajectories in the x,y-phase plane for a differential 
              equation of the form dx/dt = f(x,y), but they will explore a  number of
              differential equations of this form using MacMath.  In  Calculus III,
              three-dimensional graphing using Theorist will  enable students to visualize
              vectors and analytic geometry in  space as well as partial derivatives. 
              Calculus I and II projects  will focus on mathematical modeling.
