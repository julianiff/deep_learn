Abstract    :
                   Indiana University South Bend proposes to incorporate low-cost  laser-based
              experiments into its curriculum.  A pulsed nitrogen/dye  laser and associated
              electronics will be used in general and  introductory chemistry laboratories to
              measure the speed of light.  This experiment will introduce students to the
              time scale that is  measured by lasers.  The same equipment will be used in
              upper-level  laboratories in luminescent lifetime experiments to probe excited 
              states of molecules and tm study chemical events such as the  collision-induced
              energy transfer between excited metal complexes  and organic quenchers.  The
              computer-based data acquisition which  will be employed will remove the
              "black-box" approach to  experimental design and computer software.
