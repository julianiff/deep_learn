Abstract    :
              While scanning electron micrographs are common in science  textbooks, most
              students are limited to using light microscopes  in laboratory exercises.  
              This makes these text references  abstract and prevents students from
              understanding them fully.    Hands-on experience with a scanning electron
              microscope (SEM) can  make this information more concrete.   In order to
              provide this  experience, the college is buying an SEM and supporting equipment
               for use in the science curriculum.   This project enables science  instructors
              to offer effective, innovative laboratory experiences  to freshman and
              sophomore science students.   Science students  can use this technology in the
              existing curriculum, and  instructors can produce instruction materials for use
              in their  classes.   The SEM is also be used to offer workshops for local 
              secondary science teachers who need in-service training or who  desire
              professional growth.
