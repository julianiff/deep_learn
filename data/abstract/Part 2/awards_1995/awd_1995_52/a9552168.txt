Abstract    :
              This project introduces microcomputers into the elementary  physics and
              intermediate optics labs at the institute.   Interactive sessions using digital
              movie analysis, sound input  and output, and the production of moving graphs
              are being used to  teach fundamental concepts in mechanics, wave motion, and
              optics  in a way impossible using traditional methods of instruction.    The
              main objective of the project is to give undergraduate  students a greater
              conceptual understanding of these basic  principles of physics.   Aside from
              the planned interactive  sessions, the computers are being used throughout the
              academic  year for routine data analysis and plotting.   A shift in  emphasis
              from greater topical coverage to a more in-depth,  exploration-based treatment
              accompanies the introduction of  computers into the curriculum.   Unique
              aspects of the project  include the incorporation of digitized video clips made
              during  the laboratory session, and the use of the high-end, fully  scriptable
              data analysis and graphing program Igor Pro for other  interactive sessions.
