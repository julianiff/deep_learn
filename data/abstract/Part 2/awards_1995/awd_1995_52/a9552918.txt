Abstract    :
              9552918  Tigyi    The University of Tennesee Memphis will initiate an 8-week,
              commuter Young Scholars project for 35 high-potential 10th graders during the
              summers of 1996 and 1997.  The disciplinary focus of the program is biomedical
              science with additional emphasis on mathematics and biostatistics.  Each
              student will work in the laboratory with a University of Tennessee, Memphis
              faculty member to develop research skills and conduct a research project. 
              Academic coursework, career counseling, and a study of science ethics are
              included in the project.  Students present their research in a poster
              session/science fair at the conclusion of the program.
