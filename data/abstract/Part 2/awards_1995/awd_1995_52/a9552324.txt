Abstract    :
              This project establishes a teaching laboratory for undergraduate  instruction in
              digital signal processing (DSP).   The laboratory  gives students practical,
              hands-on training in DSP concepts and  techniques using modem hardware and
              software design tools that  complement the more theoretical approach of a
              lecture course in  DSP.   The laboratory uses PC-type workstations with add-on
              DSP  processing boards and a complement software to provide both  non-real-time
              and real-time DSP environments for algorithm  development and testing.   The
              new laboratory course consists of  a dozen laboratory exercises, about one per
              week during the  semester, each emphasizing a particular topic in DSP (for 
              example, convolution, sampling, filter design, and Fourier  transformation).  
              In the laboratory, students program  non-real-time simulations of common DSP
              procedures using MATLAB   and compare the results of these simulations with
              theoretical  predictions.   They then implement these same DSP procedures in 
              real time using a hardware/software system that allows them to  graphically
              program a DSP coprocessor card.   Students have the  opportunity to visualize
              and hear the results of applying  real-time DSP procedures to real-world
              signals such as speech and  music.   The proposed laboratory augments and
              enhances offerings  in the School of Engineering and the Department of Computer
               Science in digital signal processing, control and robotics,  computer music,
              and multimedia.
