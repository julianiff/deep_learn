Abstract    :
              The university is creating a joint Electrical Engineering/Physics  optics
              laboratory consisting of (1) the fundamentals of optics  and (2) optical system
              design and engineering.   The objective of  the lab center is to educate
              undergraduate students in the  fundamentals of optics; in interdisciplinary
              problem-solving; in  design, analysis, and manufacturing issues; in handling
              and using  optics in a variety of applications; and in nontechnical skills, 
              such as written and oral communications.   In the first semester,  students
              learn fundamental optical techniques.   The second  semester focuses on more
              sophisticated procedures, such as  holography, four-wave mixing, and advanced
              fiber optics.   The  class is divided into teams, and each team is assigned a
              design  problem.   Written technical reports, in professional format, are 
              required, as are formal presentations.   The lab complements an  optics course
              sequence and is used for demonstrations to and  active participation by K-12
              students in optics experiments.
