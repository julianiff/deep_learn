Abstract    :
                   This project strengthens the university's undergraduate  Computational
              Mathematics program by targeting for improvement  the Numerical Analysis,
              Linear Algebra, and Parallel Computation  courses and by implementing an
              undergraduate research program in  Computational Mathematics. To this end,
              improvement in the Unix  environment open laboratory facilities is needed and
              Unix  environment classroom is established. This project will  contribute to
              increasing the number of students who pursue  advanced degrees in Computational
              Mathematics and as such is in  accord with the long-term developmental goals of
              the Department  of Mathematics.
