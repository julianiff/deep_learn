Abstract    :
              ***  9552943  Meeker    The University of New Hampshire will initiate a
              three-week, summer residential, Young Scholars project for 25 talented students
              entering grade 10 from New Hampshire and Maine. The project integrates
              probability, statistics, and computer technology within a marine science
              experience focused on a field-based study of the Great Bay estuarine system in
              coastal New Hampshire. Students engage in classroom lectures and discussions,
              field trips, laboratory and research activities to gain an understanding and
              appreciation of scientific techniques.  ***
