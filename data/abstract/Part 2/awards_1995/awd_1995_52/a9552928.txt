Abstract    :
              9552928  Marshall    The Marine Science Consortium will initiate a 4-week,
              summer  residential, Young Scholars project for 20 deaf and hard-of-hearing 
              students entering grades 10 and 11.  The project provides an  enriching
              experience for the students in marine science and  oceanography.  Activities
              include research, lectures and  discussions,  laboratory, and field and
              shipboard experiences.  The students will  also engage in ongoing projects
              concerning the national history of  the Chincoteague/Assague area.  Each
              student will participate in  an individual research project guided by a senior
              scientist.  The  program will be located at the Marine Science Consortium at
              Wallops  Island, Virginia.
