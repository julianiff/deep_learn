Abstract    :
                  9552531  Fisk    ABSTRACT: Georgia Public Television is producing and
              evaluating one pilot program and accompanying ancillary material for a series
              of 30-minute television quiz shows for 8 to 10 year olds.  The series would be
              designed to entertain a home audience while educating them about issues and
              facts relating to nature and the environment.  The primary goals of the project
              are to increase knowledge about the world around us, to develop a concern for
              the conservation of wildlife and wild places, and to encourage critical and
              creative thinking skills in relation to the environment.  The television
              programs and the formal and informal ancillary materials and activities will
              engage viewers in use and development of science process skills:  observation,
              classification, measurement, prediction, inference, identification and
              manipulation of variables, interpretation of data, formulation of models,
              experimentation, construction of hypotheses, and drawing conclusions.     The
              project is being developed in collaboration with the Zoo Atlanta, whose staff
              will have responsibility for content development, and with educational advisors
              who will help assure that age- and developmentally-appropriate skills are
              exercised and the topics have the maximum relevance to elementary and middle
              school science.  The senior producers would be Carol Fisk, a producer with
              Georgia Public Television and previously a news producer and correspondent in
              Great Britain and with the BBC in Washington, and Nancy Lebens, a Georgia
              Public Television staff producer.  Cindy Horton, a zoo education program
              coordinator with Zoo Atlanta, will be the host.
