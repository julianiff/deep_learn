Abstract    :
              This project makes possible the incorporation of more physiology  into
              traditionally anatomy-based biological sciences laboratories  in order to more
              effectively tie in laboratory with lectures in  human anatomy and physiology.  
              Additional physiology is  imperative in order to prepare future health care
              workers or  future scientists as relates to the assessment and management of 
              real-life situations concerning the recovery of and maintenance  of
              homeostasis.  This can be accomplished through the use of  computers and two
              types of computer software package.    Quantitative Circulatory Physiology
              (QCP) is a computer that  allows students to challenge people's homeostatic
              capabilities  through the application of various stressors such as trauma, 
              exercise, or environmental changes and noting the body's  responses through
              changes in various cardiovascular, respiratory,  and endocrine parameters.  
              Physiological data acquisition can  also be accomplished by combining computer
              software components  with traditional lab equipment.   This setup allows
              students to  see themselves as models to determine the effects of exercise, 
              various drugs, etc., on their cardiovascular, respiratory, and  muscular
              systems.   Ideally, this computer-supplemented  laboratory allows the student
              to exit a biology course with a  much better understanding of how living
              organisms interact with  their environment.
