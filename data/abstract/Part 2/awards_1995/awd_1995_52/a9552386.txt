Abstract    :
              A Molecular Modeling Laboratory is being established to introduce  undergraduate
              science students to the extremely important area of  computational chemistry.  
              Students use the laboratory for  class-related studies and in undergraduate
              research.    Instruction of the basic principles of biological, organic, 
              inorganic, and physical chemistry are substantially improved  through the
              calculation and visualization of 3-D structure,  molecular orbitals, protein
              dynamics, enzyme substrate binding,  reaction pathways, vibrational spectra,
              and more.   Whenever  possible, calculations from the laboratory are used to
              address  questions arising from measurements the students make in the 
              experimental laboratories.   Senior thesis students in the  chemistry,
              biochemistry, and molecular biology programs use these  powerful computational
              methods and visualization techniques to  understand and interpret their
              research results.   In both  course-related studies and undergraduate research,
              the laboratory  enhances the students' understanding of basic chemical
              principles  as well as introduces them to modern computational methods 
              routinely used in graduate school and industry.
