               Life Sciences    Title: Neuroscience Laboratory Courses Developed    A new
              interdisciplinary program and major in Neuroscience was  inaugurated in 1994,
              which is a collaborative effort between the  Departments of Biology, Psychology
              and Anthropology.  The program  is a rigorous approach to the study of the
              functions and mechanisms  of the nervous system and related organ systems, and
              rests on a  foundation of lower-division laboratory courses in Biology, 
              Psychology, and Chemistry, plus 2 introductory core courses in  Neuroscience. 
              Upper division classes are specialized lab classes  in the participating
              disciplines.  The equipment pupchased is  allowing for the development of
              modern, investigative laboratory  courses in molecular and cellular
              neurobiology, and in behavioral  and comparative endocrinology.  Students are
              conducting lab  exercises in electrophysiology and neuroanatomy, the properties
              of  hormone receptors, and of the role of the endocrine system in  regulating
              metabolism.
