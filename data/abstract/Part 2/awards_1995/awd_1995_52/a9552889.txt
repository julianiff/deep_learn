Abstract    :
              9552889  Oseto    Purdue University seeks to provide a seven-week, summer
              residential, Young Scholars project in agricultural and environmental science
              for 25 students in grades 10, 11, and 12. The project will be held on the West
              Lafayette campus of Purdue University for students enrolled in schools in
              Indiana, Illinois, and Ohio. The project will provide students an opportunity
              to broaden their appreciation and knowledge of the scientific challenges
              offered by agriculture and natural resources disciplines through a combination
              of activities consisting of classroom lectures and discussions, field trips,
              and directed student research.
