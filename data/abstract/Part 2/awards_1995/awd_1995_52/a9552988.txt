Abstract    :
              The Evaluation Center at Western  Michigan University will conduct a study of
              the evaluations done on EHR science and mathematics education projects.  The
              purpose of this study is to describe the current state of practice and to
              compare this with the Standards for Educational Evaluation that represent the
              accepted goals for evaluation in the education field.    The study by Western
              Michigan University has three elements.   The first is a metaevaluation of the
              evaluations done for 40 EHR projects as well as generating example materials of
              interest to the field.  Second, WMU will conduct training in evaluation through
              two institutes, two conferences will introduce the issue of internships.  The
              conferences will introduce the issue of evaluation at NSF to a broad audience
              and provide a forum for discussion of the study findings.  Institutes will
              provide month-long, in-depth training in NSF educational evaluations. 
              Internships will be an extension of the institute, providing continuing
              opportunities for evaluation experience with NSF projects.  The  third element
              in the study is providing support services for the first two activities,
              including electronic dissemination of the results, technical assistance to
              projects base on the findings, and development of a directory of science and
              mathematics education evaluators.
