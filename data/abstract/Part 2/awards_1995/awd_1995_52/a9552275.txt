Abstract    :
              This project provides Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission  Spectroscopy
              (ICP-AES) to students and faculty with the goal of  expanding elemental
              analysis capabilities.   The ICP-AES will  also be available as a resource for
              local educational  institutions.   Students use ICP in Analytical Chemistry
              during  their sophomore year.   Analysis of more complex mixtures, soil 
              samples, biological tissue analysis, and environmental samples is  emphasized
              in subsequent course work; Advanced Inorganic,  Biochemistry, Environmental
              Studies, Instrumental Analysis,  Polymer Chemistry, and student/faculty
              research projects.   The  integration of information obtained from
              high-performance liquid  chromatography, gas chromatography, mass spectroscopy,
              infrared  spectroscopy, ultraviolet and visible spectroscopy, and nuclear 
              magnetic resonance spectroscopy is used for the identification  and
              quantification of chemical species present in complex  mixtures.   Particular
              emphasis is placed on samples of  environmental importance.
