Abstract    :
              9552863  Carl    This Local Systemic Change project will enhance all elementary 
              teachers in 60 out of the 130 elementary schools in Clark County  (CCSD).    It
              is a five year project that will begin with 10 schools, then  bring in 20 more
              and finally 30 more to reach a total of 2,040  teachers.  The effort will be
              centered around 6 Teachers on Special  Assignment (TOSA's), 50 teacher leaders
              and 20 administrators.   Each teacher will be engaged in over 100 hours of
              professional  development over three years.  Approximately 40 hours will be
              based  in classroom settings.  TOSA's will support teachers to implement  newly
              adopted science and math modules.  Each TOSA will spend full  days in assigned
              schools but much of their leadership work will  take place after school, on
              Saturdays and during the summer.    Professional development activities will
              target three levels of  teachers.  1. Emerging-introductory institutes for
              those new to hands on  learning to acquaint them with newly adopted resources. 
              2. Developing continuing workshop and classroom support for  teachers as they
              focus on effective use of adopted exemplary  materials.  3. Extending sessions
              for personal growth and reflection and for  leaders of the reform.    The
              school district is committed to establishing five materials  resource centers
              which will supply and distribute materials to all  schools.    The mathematics
              and science expertise is provided by a cadre of  external consultants who will
              deliver the workshops to the  teachers.    The request is for $6,000,000 with
              cost share amounting to  $8,108,950.
