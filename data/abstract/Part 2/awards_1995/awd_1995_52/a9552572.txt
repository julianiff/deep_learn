Abstract    :
              9552572  Fonteyn    San Francisco State University is collaborating with MESA of
               California to replicate the Mission Science Workshop (MSW) model  for informal
              science education to establish 10 self-supporting  interactive Community
              Science Workshops (CSW's) throughout  California.  The overriding theme for
              activities at the CSW's is to  let children and parents "be" scientists as they
              explore through  the use of interactive exhibits, hands-on building/tinkering 
              activities and content workshops, while at the same time ensuring  they learn
              correct science concepts.  Content to be presented is  from the areas of
              Engineering, Life Sciences, Physical Sciences,  and Mathematics.    The target
              audience is primarily African-American, Latino, and  Native American children
              in grades K-8 and their families.
