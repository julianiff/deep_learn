Abstract    :
              This project expands the demonstrative capacity of biology  laboratories and
              increases opportunities for hands-on and  research at the undergraduate level. 
               It enhances students'  opportunities for advancement in their chosen degree
              programs.   The grant provides three Ward Model 16 LEAP computerized biology 
              lab systems, one Ward spectrophotometer and supplies, three  386/486 computers
              to run the equipment, and one laser printer.    The equipment is being
              integrated into biology labs at all  levels.   The project better prepares
              biology students to bridge  to 4-year biology programs successfully by
              providing them with  better technological training and a firmer hands-on grasp
              of  basic biological concepts.
