Abstract    :
              This project funds the purchase of state-of-the-art equipment for 
              archaeological field surveying.   The equipment is the type  referred to as a
              total station, which enhances considerably the  rate at which field data can be
              generated and recorded.   A  visual orientation replaces a plumb-bob, and an
              infrared beam  measures distance, features that both speed information
              retrieval  and improve accuracy.   Auxiliary equipment includes prisms for  the
              proper control of the infrared beam, a data collector for  temporary storage of
              information, and sundry poles and tripods  for field use of the major
              equipment.   The immediate need for  such equipment stems from field research
              in Chile, in which a  large data base is generated rapidly in surveying a
              dispersed and  segmented irrigation system.   Undergraduate students 
              participating in a field school in Chile are well served by the  new equipment
              since they can train on up-to-date technology and  can accomplish the task
              without data saturation.   In an  undergraduate science/social science
              environment, the equipment  can continue in use for future editions of the same
              or other  field schools in archaeology and can also be used by faculty and 
              students of the Geology Department.
