                     Engineering    Title: Electrical Engineering Systems Laboratory      The
              aim of this project is to establish a Systems Laboratory in the  Electrical
              Engineering area. The growth of new technologies such as  wireless
              communications (Cellular, Personal Communications  Networks, High Definition
              Television, Global Positioning Systems)  in the communications and signal
              processing areas have increased  the curriculum and laboratory needs in the
              systems area.  Additionally, the developing program serves a primarily Hispanic
               student body (89%); and improved laboratory experiences is a goal  the faculty
              is determined to achieve. Objectives include  integrating Systems Laboratory
              experiences across the Electrical  Engineering curriculum. Experiments are
              outlined which expose  students to the Systems Laboratory equipment and
              software early in  the curriculum with continued emphasis through the senior
              design  courses. Ildustrial-quality software such as Matlab, Mathcad and 
              Signal Processing Workstation (SPW) are used in parallel with  measurement
              equipment.
