Abstract    :
              To be successful in the electronics and robotics fields, students  must
              understand the fundamental control devices used in modern  industrial
              electrical systems.   Through this project, a new  industrial controls
              laboratory promotes curricular reform,  allowing the presentation of concepts
              and applications in a  setting more conducive to promoting "learning as an
              active  process" as recommended by the National Science Educational  Standards.
                Such a laboratory also directly responds to the  needs of industrial clients
              who have participated actively in the  redesign of the engineering technology
              program.
