Abstract    :
              The field of scanning probe microscopy is expanding rapidly.    Scanning
              tunneling and atomic force microscopes are being  utilized in applications in
              industry and research in the fields  physics, chemistry, and materials science.
                To maintain the  excellence of our departments, the university is obtaining 
              scanning probe microscopes and integrating them into several  laboratory
              courses.   The targeted courses are Modern Physics  Laboratory, Physical
              Chemistry Laboratory, Advanced Laboratory,  and Surface Science.   Students
              enroll in these courses during  their sophomore, junior, and senior years.  
              Since most of these  courses are required of the respective majors, students
              use the  equipment in multiple courses.   The equipment can also be used  in
              student research, in conjunction with independent research  courses, and for a
              summer research program.
