Abstract    :
                  Hunter    9552491    In this project "Vanguard for Learning: A Plan for an
              NSF/DoDDS Testbed," BBN will lead a consortium to conduct Phase I of an
              anticipated two phase project. Phase I is a planning grant in which BBN will
              identify and review K-12 educational research products which can be aligned
              with National Standards and goals identified in the DoDEA Strategic Plan,
              assess DoDEA educational challenges and instructional culture, develop a
              prototype plan for integrating technology based or enabled resources across the
              entire DoDEA school system and develop a plan for experimentally testing that
              plan using two K-12 school complexes. The project is designed to address the
              use of technology to achieve pervasive integration across all grade levels and
              all subjects of two operational K-12 school complexes. It is expected that a
              rich  mix of technologies, pedagogies, educational resources, curricula and
              professional development methods will be concentrated in the testbed schools.
              This "research on practice" project is designed to gain insight into how to
              conduct pervasive change, identify alternative technologies and cost/benefit
              trade-offs for causing student centered paradigm shifts,  solve technical
              issues arising from incompatible communications systems and heterogeneous
              network environments, and identify overlooked research issues associated with
              technology enabled systemic change in K-12 education. Phase II of the project
              will consist of a two year experimental test of  a modified version of the
              plans generated during Phase I.
