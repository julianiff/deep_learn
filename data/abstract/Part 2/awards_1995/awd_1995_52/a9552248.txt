Abstract    :
              This project enriches the educational experience in three facets  of the
              Manufacturing Systems Engineering and the Mechanical  Engineering curricula.  
              The addition of a Stereolithography  Apparatus allows Polymer Processing,
              Computer Integrated  Manufacturing (CIM), and Metal Casting Processes students
              (among  others) to participate actively in multiple phases of a  manufacturing
              system.   Part design information along with mold  design requirements, derived
              and gathered by Polymer Processing  students, is fed to students of Computer
              Integrated  Manufacturing.   Working with the Polymer students, and equipped 
              with SLA requirements, CIM students develop appropriate solid  models for
              prototyping.   Finally, metal casting students are  provided with prototypes
              useful in developing permanent molds.    Use of the new equipment extends
              through all levels of secondary  and postsecondary education.   Junior and
              senior level Mechanical  and Manufacturing Systems Engineering students are
              provided with  experiences integrating all aspects of rapid prototyping 
              technology.   The addition of SLA to GMrs Polymer  Processing/Computer
              Integrated Manufacturing laboratories  provides exposure manufacturing systems
              engineering to the  students of GMI and inspiration in the area of
              Manufacturing  Systems Engineering to young people considering further
              education  in this field.
