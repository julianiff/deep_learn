Abstract    :
                   As the second part of a 5-year plan to revitalize the  chemistry program,
              the General Chemistry laboratory experience  has been completely restructured. 
                     Three new projects implement the use of visible-ultraviolet  absorption
              spectrophotometry (UV-Vis), atomic absorption  spectrometry (AAS), and
              high-performance liquid chromatography  (HPLC).  For the UV-Vis, taking
              advantage of the speed of a  diode-array instrument, students design a dye
              "pH-meter" by using  a selected plant dye for spectrophotometrically
              determining pHs.   The AAS project asks students to decide the changes in the 
              aluminum concentrations in a rhubarb sauce, or similar food,  after cooking in
              an aluminum container.  Finally, the HPLC  project has students isolate and
              purify lysozyme from egg white,  tears, or nasal mucus.       With the
              instrumental projects included, presentations are  planned for the American
              Chemical Society (ACS) and Midwestern  Association for Liberal Arts Colleges
              (MACTLAC) meetings.   Publications of the redesign of the laboratory and the
              individual  instrumental projects are planned for publication.
