Abstract    :
              With the recent introduction of relatively inexpensive Digital  Signal
              Processing (DSP) cards for PCs, a large number of  sophisticated and innovative
              acoustics experiments involving  digital fast Fourier transform (FFT) spectrum
              analysis become  possible at a considerable savings compared with stand-alone
              FFT  analyzers.   This grant remedies the lack of equipment to perform  FFT
              spectrum analysis in the laboratory of the introductory  musical acoustics
              course, The Science of Music.   The labs had  been based on stand-alone digital
              storage oscilloscopes.   The  lack of FFT capability is a serious pedagogical
              deficiency in  light of the enormous importance of harmonic spectra to the 
              understanding of the physics of sound and musical instruments.    Fourier
              analysis is often a difficult concept for students to  understand in the
              abstract.   They need to be provided hands-on  laboratory experiences to
              enhance their understanding.   This  grant equips eight previously purchased
              computer lab stations in  the acoustics lab with DSP cards and software
              required to perform  FFT analysis.   In addition, one unit is being placed in
              the PC  dedicated to the acoustics lecture room, facilitating in-class 
              demonstrations and discussions.   Additional utilization of the  new equipment
              occurs the form of senior research projects,  advanced laboratory experiments
              (for physics majors), and use in  a new course in Physical Acoustics for
              majors.
