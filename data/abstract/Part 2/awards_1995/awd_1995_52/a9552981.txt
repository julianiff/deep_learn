Abstract    :
              9552981  Bybee    This project is to convene curriculum developers with the
              specific  task of addressing issues of aligning materials with the National 
              Science Education Standards.  The outcome is a report that  describes the
              proceqs and recommendations for aligning curriculum  materials with standards. 
              The term align refers to the  comprehensive definition as to different ways
              states and school  districts improve curriculum.  The project addresses some of
              those  ways including developing new materials, adopting national  programs,
              and adapting extant materials.
