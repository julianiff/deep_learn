Abstract    :
              The objective of the Spatial Analysis Laboratory is to achieve a  better
              integration of the collection, analysis, and visual  presentation of geographic
              information at the undergraduate  level.   With this new lab, project
              objectives are reached  through the integration of techniques courses and
              content-  oriented courses and through extensive real-world problem-solving 
              projects.   Students are able to apply computer and statistical  knowledge in
              content courses as they advance through the program.    Extensive hands-on,
              project-oriented, and cooperative learning  fully engages students in classes. 
               Projects are related to the  real-world problems in the region, such as
              economic development,  so that students can be personally and emotionally
              involved.    Six annual publications result from class projects: Geographic 
              Data: Sources and Quality, Data Book for Economic Development in  Appalachian
              Kentucky, Statistical Atlas of Appalachian Kentucky,  Geographical Distribution
              of Landfills in Appalachian Kentucky,  International Trade Reference Book for
              Appalachian Kentucky, and  Student Portfolios.
