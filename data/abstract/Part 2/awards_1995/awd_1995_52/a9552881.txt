              comprehensive plan that will initiate action in four areas:  1) Systemwide

              accountable for ambitious outcomes, and will reallocate resources to support
              improvement. The USI will strengthen systemwide leadership and the organization
              of instructional programs.  2) School Sie Capacity Building and Community
              Involvement:  Schools wil address mathematics and science through a
              Compreshensive Site Planning process, and will form a cadre of Key Teachers. 
              The USI is an integral part of a plan to provide technology links to all
              classsrooms.  3) Learning Environment and Student Opportunities: The USI will
              implement rigorous content and perforance standards, and students will have
              access to increased academic support.  4) School Staff Quality:  The USI will
              provide teachers with ongoing opportunities for professional development in
              mathematics and science, at summer camps, at district centers, and at area
              colleges and universities.  ***
