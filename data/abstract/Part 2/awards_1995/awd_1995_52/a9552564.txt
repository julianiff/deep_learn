Abstract    :
              9552564  Maurer    The Science Museum of Minnesota will prepare and circulate a
              2500  sq. ft. traveling exhibit of the physical science activities from  their
              successful "Experiment Gallery" exhibit, previously supported  by NSF. 
              Visitors studies indicate this gallery is the most popular  and most visited of
              the museum's science halls.  The activities  cover five areas of physics; sound
              and saves, light, mechanics,  weather, and electricity.  It will include more
              than 25 activities  and will go to a minimum of eighteen mid-sized and smaller
              museums  over a six year period.  Complementary activities include the 
              development of a recipe book describing eleven volunteer-mediated  science
              experiment activities developed by Experiment Gallery  staff.  The tour will be
              managed by the Science Museum's Touring  Exhibits Department.
