Abstract    :
              The college recently completed plans for the renovation of its  physical
              sciences building, including a new observatory with an  adjacent
              classroom/computer lab.   It also changed its astronomy  and astrophysics
              curriculum to offer students more experience  with modern observational
              astronomy.    This grant allows the  pruchase of CCD cameras, computers,
              computer-controlled  telescopes, and photometers, which expand and enrich the
              teaching  of modern astronomical techniques.
