Abstract    :
              9552908  Fletcher    Texas A&M University will initiate a four-week, summer
              commuter, Young Scholars project in Engineering for 20 students entering grades
              11 and 12. Students will be provided the opportunity to participate in a
              variety of activities related to engineering and offshore technology.
              Activities include classroom instruction and discussions on engineering careers
              and opportunities, hands-on laboratory experimentation, discussions on ethics
              and the ocean environment, and individual and team research.
