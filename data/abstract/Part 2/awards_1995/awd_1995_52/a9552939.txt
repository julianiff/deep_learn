Abstract    :
              9552939  Snow    The University of South Florida (Tampa)will initiate a 4-week,
              commuter Young Scholars project to serve 48 young women entering the seventh
              and eighth grades during the summers of 1996 and 1997. The disciplinary focus
              will be on earth and life sciences with an emphasis on how the plants, animals,
              water, and soil interact in three diverse Florida ecosystems:  coastal/estuary,
              freshwater wetland, and upland/sandhill.  Students will develop questions and,
              with guidance, gather and analyze data to answer their questions.  Field trips
              will focus on environmental policy and ethics, while faculty and guest leaders
              emphasize career options and build participants scientific interest, knowledge,
              and self-confidence.
