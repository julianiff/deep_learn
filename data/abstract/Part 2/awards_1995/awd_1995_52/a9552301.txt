Abstract    :
              Through this project, a state-of-the-art tensile testing  equipment is pruchased
              for use in Adhesive Technology &  Applications Lab, Engineering Materials, and
              Polymer Processing.    The tensile tester is one of the central tools used in
              the study  of adhesion.   In the lab, many of the experiments performed  
              changes in adhesive bond strengths due to (a) surface  preparations methods,
              (b) service environments, (c) types of  substrate, and (d) types of adhesive 
              involve the use of the  tensile tester to observe the effect.   The new
              instrument has a  wide range of tensile load forces, hot and cold environmental
               testing capabilities, fatigue testing, and computer control and  storage of
              data to enhance the results measured.
