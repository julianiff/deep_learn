Abstract    :
              This project is integrating a portable planetarium into a  preservice
              teacher-preparation program.   The three objectives  for this project are:  (1)
              to improve the astronomy knowledge of  preservice teachers; (2) to improve the
              instructional skills of  preservice teachers; and (3) to develop effective
              curriculum  materials to augment the planetarium environment as an effective 
              laboratory setting for observation.  The unit is being integrated  into a
              physics course, specifically designed for elementary  education majors, and in
              an elementary science teaching methods  course.
