Abstract    :
              ***  9552868  Pagni, David    This is a 5-year project at $5,972,910 to provide
              a two-year enhancement of 100 hours for each of 1620 teachers of mathematics
              and 480 instructional assistants, responsible for Limited English Proficiency
              students, and administrators, K-9, with focus on content and pedagogy with
              emphasis on newly-adopted instructional materials aligned with the California
              Mathematics Framework.  Ongoing support will include an additional 100 hours of
              enhancement through the implementation of site-based Action Plans focusing on
              teacher discourse, reflection, and classroom observation and coaching.  
              Parents, community, and business partners will participate in 100 hour programs
              in site-based activities.  Two district-wide staff development days per year
              will be devoted to mathematics for all teachers, instructional assistants, and
              administrators.  Project cost per participant: $2844 per person.  Cost sharing:
               $15,809,754 or 260%.  ***
