Abstract    :
              This project integrates basic research training in psychology  with student
              involvement in multimedia projects that analyze  stress and coping research.  
              Basic psychology research training  involves courses in seven required and four
              elective courses.    Basic science issues addressed in these courses involve
              student  training in conducting and interpreting statistical analysis of  data,
              utilizing appropriate research designs, developing critical  analysis research
              skills, and developing capabilities to complete  independent and honors
              research in psychology.   Students  complete a graded series of increasingly
              advanced data analysis  and experimental design projects that fit into a
              competency  growth plan for training students in the scientific approach to 
              psychology.   Multimedia projects are located in one required  course (theories
              of personality) and four elective courses in  which students are involved in
              creating multimedia visualizations  of concepts related to stress, coping, and
              emotion.   This  project upgrades the computer lab to enhance capabilities in
              both  basic research and multimedia training.   This project allows  continued
              development of student projects that enables them to  visualize the
              interactions among behavioral, physiological, and  cognitive aspects of stress
              and coping.   Involvement of students  in multimedia projects attempts to build
              upon Chute's "Classroom  2000" model in which students directly experience and
              work with  course materials in a multimedia format to enhance active  learning.
