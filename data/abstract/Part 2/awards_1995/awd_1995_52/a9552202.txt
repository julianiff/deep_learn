              Laboratory      To broaden our offerings in cellular biology and introduce
              students  to a rapidly developing and exciting field we are establishing a 
              junior/senior level lecture/laboratory course in neurobiology for  biology and
              biochemistry majors.  Students conduct several weeks of  structured exercises
              to familiarize them with the use of equipment,  followed by 7-8 weeks of
              student designed and executed  mini-research projects.  The new course builds
              on and extends  skills students are learning in the Department's newly-designed
               introductory level core courses that feature investigative  laboratories, and
              provides students the opportunity to pursue  curiosity-driven experiments in a
              somewhat structured format.  To  establish the laboratory, which emphasizes
              cellular neurophysiology  and neuron-muscle interactions, electrophysiological
              setups  centered on the Macintosh computer-based MacLab data acquisition  and
              analysis system have been acquired.  This system allows digital  storage and
              manipulation of physiological data, which is acquired  using micromanipulators,
              preamplifiers for intracellular recording,  and stimulators/stimulus isolation
              units.  The experience benefits  not only those students who choose to pursue
              postgraduate studies  in biology or medicine, but will also provide an
              important  education in the methods of scientific investigation for students 
              who pursue careers in education, public service, law, etc.
