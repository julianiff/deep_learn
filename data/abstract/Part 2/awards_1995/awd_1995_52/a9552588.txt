Abstract    :
              9552588  Sprague    This project is a follow up to the conference entitled First
              Step.   The current proposal seeks funds for a second conference, the Next 
              Step Institute '95.  Seventy teams of 4 members each, will be  accepted for a
              three and one half day institute.  Teams will be  selected from across the
              nation, and will all be members of The  Association of Science Materials
              Centers (ASMC).  The Institute  will have two major components the first for
              districts and  consortia, already involved in systemic support for science 
              education, who need to upgrade their skills and keep current with  the latest
              reform efforts.  Participants in this component will  attend two keynote
              presentations, four specialized strands which  will allow different team
              members to participate more fully in a  focused topic such as; Sharing the
              Vision, Nuts and Bolts,  Assessment and Standards, Professional Growth and Team
              Building.   In addition time will be set aside for cross strand highlights 
              during which participants will be able to share information in  order to learn
              about presentations they have not attended and time  for team planning.  The
              second component of the Institute will be  to produce a long term plan and a
              proposal based on a needs  assessment from data gathered from both the First
              and Next Step  conferences.  The request is for $84,568 with cost share
              estimated as $105,250.
