                             Physics         Title: Course Modules in Apparatus Design and
              Experimental          Techniques           Insufficient attention is given in
              science curricula to  training students, at an early stage, in the practical
              techniques  of laboratory work.  When students begin undergraduate research 
              projects, industrial co-ops, and jobs, many are ill-prepared to  construct,
              select, adapt, and use scientific equipment.  This  project introduces a series
              of self-contained course modules in  practical methods that will come after the
              first year of college  laboratory courses.  Six foundation modules form a one
              year course:   (1.) materials, mechanisms & machining; (2.) basic electronic 
              circuits & measurements; (3.) signals & electronics for signal  conditioning;
              (4.) computer-assisted experimentation; (5.)  introduction to metrology &
              transducers; and (6.) optical systems.   Upper division elective modules are:
              (7.) vacuum systems & surface  technologies; (8.) feedback control; and (9.)
              lasers &  optoelectronics.  In five weeks, each module will cover a small 
              number of the most basic methods and technologies of a topic.   There will be
              90 minutes of discussion, lecture, and demonstration  and four hours of lab per
              week.  Students will document their  practical experience through individual
              portfolios of their  projects.  The modular form of this course material makes
              it  readily adaptable to other colleges, where further topics can be  developed
              in the same format.  Student lab manuals, exercises,  suggested projects,
              lecture transparencies, demonstrations,  software, designs, and parts lists
              will be available and  continuously updated over the Internet.
