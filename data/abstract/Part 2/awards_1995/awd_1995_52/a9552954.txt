Abstract    :
              Community College Science Connection Conference      The Community-Senior
              College Science Connections conference will  enhance collaboration and
              articulation between community colleges and  senior colleges in science and
              mathematics education and teacher  preparation. The conference seeks enhanced
              partnerships in science and  mathematics education at the undergraduate level
              and improved student  awareness of science and mathematics teaching as a
              career. The workshop  will focus on communication and cooperative interaction
              between 2- and  4-year institutions in science and mathematics education and
              teacher  preparation; improved science and mathematics instruction in
              introductory  science and mathematics courses; baseline information on
              partnerships to  share as a vital career choice, and will generate regional
              groups to work  for systemic impact. The workshop will result in a report of
              partnerships  and a proceedings of the conference and the establishment of an
              Inernet  home page for Community-Senior College Science Connections 
              information.
