Abstract    :
              A Geographic Information System (GIS) laboratory is being  developed to
              demonstrate ecological principles and processes on  large spatial scales and
              promote interdisciplinary research by  undergraduate students.   GIS technology
              provides the means for  users to input, edit, overlay, analyze, and display any
               information that has a spatial component (e.g., streams, roads,  vegetative
              cover types, animal movements and locations,  elevations).   As such, GIS is a
              powerful tool for studying  spatial patterns and relationships.   The new
              laboratory  complements existing laboratory and field studies in  environmental
              biology, but provides the technology to investigate  the influence of landscape
              and regional environments on local  biotic communities and functions.   The
              laboratory is being  equipped with eight Pentium-PC workstations, digitizing
              tablets,  scanner, color printer, digitized data sets, and requisite  software
              packages.   Multiple workstations provide access to GIS  technology for
              students enrolled in upper-division ecology and  natural resources management
              classes and for student research  teams testing hypotheses in landscape
              ecology.   The laboratory  is also being equipped with a mobile Global
              Positioning System  receiver and antenna, so that students can accurately
              record and  store the locations of study plots and boundaries for subsequent 
              entry into the GIS system.
