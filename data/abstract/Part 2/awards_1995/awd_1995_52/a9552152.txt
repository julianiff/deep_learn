Abstract    :
              The university is developing a computer science laboratory to  provide students
              with hands-on project experience in the areas of  computer hardware, operating
              systems, and software engineering.    This laboratory also gives faculty
              opportunities to collaborate  with other universities and the capacity to
              explore several  innovative teaching techniques.
