Abstract    :
              9552919  Reibstein      The University of Pennsylvania will initiate a 4-week,
              summer residential and commuter, Young Scholars project in molecular biology,
              environmental science, and mathematics for 100 rising 10, 11, and 12 grade
              students. Molecular biology students carry out laboratory projects, guided by
              faculty, and attend lectures on enzymes, molecular genetics, and developmental
              biology. Students in environmental science collect data and do environmental
              analysis of various types of ecosystems in the Delaware Valley area.
              Mathematics students explore areas of research including number theory,
              geometric optimization, chaos, and statistics. All students have a computer lab
              and will engage in follow-up activities during the academic year.
