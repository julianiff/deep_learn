Abstract    :
              This project funds a new networked multimedia computer and  audiovisual
              equipment for use by undergraduates in order to link  and reform the
              undergraduate component in two independent  language research labs.   This new
              equipment involves high-end  satellite work stations with CD-ROM and multimedia
              capacities in  each lab, to be centralized in one new interdisciplinary 
              Cognitive Studies undergraduate research laboratory/computer  room.   The
              project assists labs in developing innovative methods  of involving
              undergraduates in hands-on scientific  (hypothesis-testing) lab experiences
              that they can integrate with  the theoretical study of linguistics.   A larger
              number of  undergraduates can be integrated in a sustained research 
              experience, providing a model formal mechanism through the  university's
              recently established Cognitive Studies program for  undergraduate interaction
              and sharing of resources across labs.    In addition, the project introduces
              and integrates a third  research group, Adult Second Language Acquisition.  
              Several new  courses are being planned on the basis of the new lab 
              improvement.   Demonstration materials regarding language  knowledge and
              organization, including multimedia learning  modules, available on-line, are
              being developed and integrated in  new and existing courses.
