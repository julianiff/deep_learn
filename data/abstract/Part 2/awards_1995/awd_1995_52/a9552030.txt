Abstract    :
              This project is purchasing six automatic titrators to acquaint  students with
              the capabilities and limitations of these devices  which are routinely employed
              in many working laboratories.   The  units are being used for three experiments
              (oxidation-reduction  titration, neutralization titration, and direct
              potentiometry  with an ion selective electrode) in the Introductory Analytical 
              Chemistry Laboratory, and one experiment (Karl Fischer titration)  in the
              Instrumental Analysis Laboratory.   Both laboratories are  required of
              chemistry majors.   The introductory course is also  heavily populated by
              students from other departments, including  microbiology, zoology, and allied
              health fields.  The automated  systems include modules for both potentiometric
              and  spectrophotometric endpoint detection, so that students are able  to
              compare the capabilities of the two methods.   Two video tapes  are being
              produced to reinforce these concepts and to teach the  theory of operation of
              ion selective electrodes.
