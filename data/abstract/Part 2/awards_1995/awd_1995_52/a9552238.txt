Abstract    :
              The Biology Department's undergraduate curriculum in physiology  is being
              enhanced by adding new or revised courses in human and  comparative vertebrate
              physiology to the current offering in  animal physiological ecology.   The
              courses are designed to have  a significant research component.   The
              university's goal is to  inculcate in students: (1) a fundamental understanding
              of  physiological processes, (2) an interest in scientific inquiry,  (3) an
              ability to formulate and test cogent hypotheses, and (4)  proficiency in the
              use of modern technology for acquisition and  analysis of physiological data.  
              An essential component of this  plan is to use student-friendly, research-grade
              instrumentation.    The computer-interfaced instruments funded through this
              project  permit students to examine several simultaneously changing 
              physiological functions in a much more dynamic and interactive  manner than is
              possible with older analog instruments.   The  BioPac physiological data
              acquisition system and Sable Systems  respirometry system have been chosen for
              their combined features  of ease for student use and superior research
              flexibility.    Multiple sets of instruments are obtained to enable us to 
              accommodate larger laboratory classes.   These instruments permit  class
              exercises and student research to be more extensive in  design and better
              replicated.   Students are finding the  investigative laboratories to be more
              informative and  enlightening than the "standard" labs of the past.
