Abstract    :
              9552983  Serrell    Under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research Guidelines,
              Serrell  and Associates will do "A Meta-Analysis of Visitor Time/Use in  Museum
              Exhibitions."  The research will examine the long considered  and debated
              questions revolving around visitors expenditure of  their time (duration and
              allocation) in science museums exhibits.   Serrell will undertake the largest,
              systematic study of its kind.   Using a large number of systemically made
              observations of visitors  time/use, baseline data will be developed that will
              answer some of  the fundamental questions about visitor's movements in an
              exhibit.   This work builds on and expands, considerably, the current data 
              base of observations from 48 exhibits to over 100 exhibitions.   This is not a
              new research topic but it is one that deserves more  attention because it has
              not been studied systematically.   Researchers generally assume a positive
              correlation between time  spent on task and learning but beyond that there are
              a number of  provocative questions and unverified theories.  Many questions
              lack  sufficient data to draw conclusions.  This study will provide 
              statistical correlations between variables observed and will be  absed on
              large, methodologically similar database, which does not  currently exist.
