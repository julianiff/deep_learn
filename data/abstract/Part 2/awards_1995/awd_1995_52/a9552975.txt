              Colleges in  Advanced Science and Engineering  Technology Education       The
              American Association of Community Colleges is conducting a two year project
              consisting  of a series of interconnected activities designed to enhance the
              quality of science,  mathematics, engineering, and technological education in
              community colleges.  The activities  include (a) two national meetings
              approximately one year apart of representatives from groups  interested in
              science and engineering advanced technological education including the
              principal  investigators from many current Advanced Technological Education
              (ATE) projects and  centers, private and public sector leaders, and
              professional associations; (b) a roundtable of  experts on issues in science
              and engineering advanced technological education; and (c) a live  national
              teleconference on such issues.    The sequence of programs is designed to
              provide people interested in advanced technological   education opportunities
              to network with one another; identify significant issues related to the 
              delivery of effective science and engineering technological education;
              disseminate the results  of these activities to a broad national audience; and,
              broadcast a national teleconference on  these issues.    Expected outcomes
              include a sharper understanding of the characteristics of successful science 
              and engineering technological education programs for all stakeholders in this
              arena, the  development of additional resource documents of use to current and
              future participants in  these education programs, and an increased awareness of
              the value of each of these activities  for deliverin g information to a broad
              audience.
