Abstract    :
              9552947  Fate  The public broadcasting radio station KCAW-FM is to produce a
              five-part radio series profiling  Arctic women in science.  The series, to be
              called, "Alaska Women in Science," is scheduled  to be broadcast with the
              cooperation and support of the Alaska Public Radio Network.  It will  be
              distributed statewide, with curriculum materials for grades 6-12 to be
              distributed under the  auspices of the Alaska Department of Education.  Both
              five and fifteen minute versions of the  programs are to be prepared for
              broadcast and distribution.  A series of profiles featuring  Alaskan women
              scientists, representing a range of disciplines, will show them at work in
              their  laboratories and/or field environments.  Each segment is to offer both
              personal and professional  insights into the experiences of the woman scientist
              featured, and is to provides a positive role  model for young women listeners.
