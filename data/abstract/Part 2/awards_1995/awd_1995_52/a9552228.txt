Abstract    :
              The chemistry department is creating a computer-interfaced  chemistry
              laboratory.   The objective for the project is to  strengthen chemical
              principles recognition by (1) simplifying  data collection and (2) simplifying
              methods for representing  relationships from the data.   The revisions provide
              an avenue  for open-ended experiments and experimental design which, in  turn,
              foster critical thinking skills.   The college is  purchasing 12 MacIntosh
              laptop computers linked to the campus'  instructional computing network for
              greater software  availability, a TI Graph link for each computer to allow the 
              students to transfer data for calculations at home, Labworks  computer
              interface package to allow data acquisition, and a  printer for hard copies of
              data, graphs, and reports.   The  lap-top computers allow other science labs,
              such as physics and  physical science, to have access the equipment.   The
              project  also takes the equipment into area high schools to demonstrate a 
              computer-interfaced lab.
