              Introductory Biology          Laboratories           This project enhances and
              modernizes General Biology labs  for three courses by allowing the permanent
              establishment of a  series of molecular biology experiments that have been
              conducted  on a trial basis for the past 2 years.  Students from science and 
              nonscience curricula have been conducting exercises to learn more  about genes
              and their expression through the genetic  transformation of E. coli with
              plasmids containing the genes that  are responsible for bioluminescence.  When
              transformed colonies  are observed in a darkened room, their bioluminescent
              glow  elicits "wows" and "oohs" from observers, adding to the  excitement
              associated with learning about new biotechnologies.   Each year the project
              affects approximately 2500 college students  including 150-200 preservice
              teachers.  Additionally, each year  48 precollege students (grades 8-12) and
              their science teachers  are exposed to the aforementioned experiments.  Through
              this  project, sufficient equipment is funded to continue the current 
              transformation experiment and to reduce team sizes such that all  students are
              able to get "hands-on" experience.  In addition,  implementation of additional
              exercises in restriction  endonuclease digestion, gel electrophoresis, and gene
              regulation  is possible.
