Abstract    :
              In reply to student requests and in recognition of the rapid  advancement of the
              neurosciences over the past decade, the  Psychology Department has set a goal
              to establish a neurosciences  curriculum.   This series of lecture and
              laboratory courses  provides a structured approach for studying brain and
              behavior  interaction.   The equipment requested through this grant 
              significantly enhances the science education of lower- and upper-  division
              students through demonstration and active participation.    However, the
              greatest impact is being achieved through the  creation of a Neurosciences
              Laboratory facility.   This  Laboratory supports three new courses and four new
              laboratory  classes in which psychology students first learn, and then 
              empirically validate, scientific concepts and theories.    Included in the new
              curriculum are laboratory sections for  existing basic courses in physiological
              psychology and learning,  as well as completely new courses with Laboratories
              in  Experimental Neuroanatomy, Electrophysiology and Behavior, and 
              Neuroimaging in Neuroscience.   With over 550 undergraduate  majors in
              psychology, the cost effectiveness and educational  impact of this new science
              program can be significant.
