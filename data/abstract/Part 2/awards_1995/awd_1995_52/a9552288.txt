Abstract    :
              This project provides funding to equip the School of Engineering  and Technology
              Manufacturing Laboratory with a versatile rapid  prototyping facility to allow
              undergraduate students from the  departments of electrical engineering,
              mechanical engineering,  and technology to gain hands-on experience with modern
              Computer  Integrated Manufacturing processes, including Simulation based 
              Design, Design for Manufacture and Assembly, and Agile and  Concurrent
              engineering strategies.    By using the rapid  prototyping equipment, our
              engineering and technology graduates  can be better prepared for the rapidly
              changing manufacturing job  market.   Faculty teaching design, systems
              engineering, and  manufacturing courses will be able to demonstrate in
              real-time  concepts crucial to improving product designs.   Therefore, the  new
              equipment significantly enhances the manufacturing education  at the university
              and further improves its excellent record of  educating and training students.
