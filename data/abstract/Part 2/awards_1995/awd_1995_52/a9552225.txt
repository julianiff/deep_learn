                 Mathematics    Title: Mathematical Software in Current Computer Laboratories
                        The Mathematics Department at Towson State has made a firm 
              commitment to the "Reform Calculus" philosophy and is scheduling  its Calculus
              classes in a Computer Classroom.  In addition, many of  the statistics classes
              are being taught in this Classroom.   Consequently this Computer Classroom is
              currently being utilized  almost entirely for classroom teaching.  Lack of open
              access to  this Computer Classroom by students makes the use of the computer 
              technology and useful mathematical software primarily for  demonstration
              purposes only in calculus and statistics courses, and  also discourages faculty
              teaching other mathematics courses from  incorporating innovative computer
              based instruction and projects.   This project is extending calculus and other
              mathematical reform  efforts at Towson by helping prepare an open computer
              laboratory  for students use for projects and assignments outside of 
              mathematics classes.  This is allowing students to use mathematical  computer
              software programs outside of their class meeting time.   This open laboratory
              is also being used by students taking other  courses such as Numerical
              Analysis, Linear Algebra, Differential  Equations, Mathematical Models and
              Concepts of Mathematics for  Elementary Teachers to complete computer
              assignments and projects  as well to use commercial and faculty authored
              interactive text  material to enhance their comprehension of the material.  In 
              summary, this proposal will ensure that the computer technology and  use of
              mathematical software becomes an integral part of the  curriculum.
