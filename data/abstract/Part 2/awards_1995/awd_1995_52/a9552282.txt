Abstract    :
              This project provides support for a major reorganization of the  laboratories
              for the second half of the introductory physics  sequence for all science
              majors and pre-engineers (approximately  80 students per year).   This
              continues the restructuring of the  introductory laboratory sequence for these
              majors.   Four new  laboratory modules, Wave Motion, Electricity and Magnetism,
               Optics, and Modern Physics, each require 3 or 4 weeks to  complete.   This
              project addresses module 1, Wave Motion.   New  and exciting experiments in
              wave motion have been formalized to  introduce the concepts of simple harmonic
              motion, superposition,  interference, resonance, and Fourier analysis in a way
              that  encourages creative curiosity and relies heavily on the use of 
              analytical techniques made possible by computers.   Module 1 was  selected for
              this project in that it will provide for sufficient  time and funding for
              experiment, software, and manual  development.   The module represents a more
              loosely structured  laboratory than the conventional approach in which everyone
              does  the same experiment at the same time.   The involvement of  students in
              discussions with one another and the enhancement of  creative curiosity should
              occur more readily in a less structured  environment.
