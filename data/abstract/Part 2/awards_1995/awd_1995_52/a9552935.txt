Abstract    :
              9552935  Wardle      Brandeis University will initiate a four-week, summer
              residential, Young Scholars project with follow-up activities during the
              academic year for 30 students entering grades 10,11, and 12. The project will
              introduce several scientific disciplines to students to pursue their interest
              in science and mathematics. The students are placed in Directed Research
              Projects that take advantage of on-going research at Brandeis University. The
              students are introduced to academic and career options through laboratory work,
              field research, field trips to various research facilities both academic and
              commercial, and interaction with leading scientists.
