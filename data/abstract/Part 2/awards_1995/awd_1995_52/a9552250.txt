Abstract    :
              This project is introducing infrared spectroscopy and microscopy  as key
              elements of the freshman laboratory experience, in  addition to the current
              means of investigation.   These are  powerful but uncomplicated tools
              applicable to study of many  kinds of samples.   Infrared is also pedagogically
              valuable for  illustrating molecular dynamism and many aspects of bonding.   
              Microscopy contributes a favorable esthetic element to the  student experience
              of chemistry.  This project is addressing  student perceptions that chemistry,
              at least as taught in  introductory courses, has little or nothing to do with
              their  lives, by focusing the freshman chemistry laboratory program on  working
              with "real world" materials such as analgesics, household  cleaning agents,
              plastics, textile fibers, vitamins, and the  like.   This project harnesses the
              resulting interest by  providing opportunities for students, working in groups,
              to plan  and carry out small-scale investigations of such materials in a 
              "directed-inquiry" mode.
