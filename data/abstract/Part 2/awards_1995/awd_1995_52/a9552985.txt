Abstract    :
              9552985  Bamberger    In this project, key components of a distance learning
              computer  laboratory will be prototyped.  In particular, the following  systems
              will be developed: an interpersonal communication tool  which combines elements
              from email, video-conferencing,  listserv/listproc, usenet news, WAIS, gopher,
              and WWW; network  based, interactive, media-rich, digital collections or
              curricular  material; and authoring agents for the seamless integration of the 
              interpersonal communication systems and interactive digital  collections. The
              prototype sytems will be developed and field  tested during the grant period.
              Deliverables will include the  prototype systems, raw data for assessment of
              the impact of the  tools on educational delivery, and a preliminary assessment
              study.  In order to fully demonstrate the need for and benefits of distance 
              learning computer laboratories, the prototype system will be  developed in the
              context of a course on digital image processing.  ***
