Abstract    :
              This project leads to a series of laboratory modules that, as a  whole, compose
              a laboratory for physics majors, but individually  are appropriate for courses
              in chemistry and astronomy.   Each  module is being built upon an experiment
              that determines a  fundamental constant or important physical constant.  The 
              experiments are clearly distinct from the traditional chemistry  or astronomy
              experiments both in the nature of the information  sought and, in many cases,
              by the techniques and processes used.    They do, however, serve as an integral
              part of these courses.    In each case, the goal is to emphasize the role that
              physics  plays in the discipline it supports while simultaneously  identifying
              it as a distinct discipline.   The educational goals  of the experiment are to
              (1) have students appreciate the  relevance of the supporting physics
              experiment since it is  carried out within the related nonphysics course; (2) 
              maximize  the number of students that are exposed to landmark physics 
              experiments; and (3) increase the student's appreciation of the  distinctive
              nature of physics as a discipline.   The experiments  are designed to (1) be
              carried out with only computer-aided  instruction; (2) use computer interfaces
              to allow for high-  precision work and to support calculations; and (3) measure
               fundamental constants that have a direct impact on the associated  course.
