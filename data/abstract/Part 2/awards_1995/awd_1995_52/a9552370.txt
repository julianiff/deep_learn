Abstract    :
              This project is enhancing and expanding undergraduate teaching  and research
              laboratories through the acquisition of a  multipurpose rapid-scanning
              spectrophotometric system.   The  system is designed for easy flexibility such
              that novel  absorbance, fluorescence, and chemiluminescence experiments can 
              all be performed.   Time-resolved absorbance or fluorescence  spectroscopy can
              be done with or without the stopped-flow  attachment.   The instrument is
              intended for specific laboratory  uses in undereraduate laboratory courses
              including analytical  chemistry, instrumental analysis, physical chemistry,
              inorganic  chemistry, polymer chemistry, biochemistry, and the organic and 
              inorganic synthesis laboratories.   In addition, the instrument  is a valuable
              addition to extensive ongoing undergraduate  research programs which require
              fluorescence and time-resolved  kinetic experiments.
