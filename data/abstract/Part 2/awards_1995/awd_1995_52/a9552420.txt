Abstract    :
              This laboratory enhancement project is developing instructional  capabilities in
              four environmental engineering courses:  "Introduction to Environmental
              Engineering," "Environmental  Biochemistry," "Aquatic Chemistry for
              Environmental Engineers,"  and "Groundwater Protection and Remediation."  The
              project is  introducing nine new experiments to the laboratory sections that 
              supplement these courses.   These exercises are specifically  designed to give
              students an opportunity to simulate physical,  chemical, and biological
              processes that take place in natural and  engineered environments. 
              Quantitative data collected during  these experiments are applied toward
              solving realistic  engineering analysis and design problems.   A total organic 
              carbon analyzer and a scanning spectrophotometer are the major  equipment
              components used in this project.   This instrumentation  also serves to further
              expose students to the capabilities and  limitations of modern equipment
              commonly found in research  environmental laboratories but often absent from
              undergraduate  facilities.   An environmental degree option was offered for the
               first time by the school's Department of Civil Engineering in  1993.   As part
              of this program, an environmental engineering  laboratory was developed and put
              to use in early 1994 for a new  aquatic chemistry course.   This project is
              further enhancing the  capabilities of the laboratory by providing students
              with  exercises designed to synthesize the concepts offered within the 
              environmental curriculum.   Many of the new experiments are  unique to
              undergraduate environmental engineering laboratories,  and provide
              undergraduates with the opportunity to apply their  results directly toward
              solving realistic engineering problems.
