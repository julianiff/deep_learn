Abstract    :
              9552565  Osberg    The San Jose Children's Discovery Museum will develop an
              exhibit  "Take Another Look."  A semi-permanent version will be installed at 
              the Children's Museum and a 600-750 sq. ft. traveling version will  be
              developed and circulated under the auspices of the Association  of Science and
              Technology Centers Traveling Exhibition Service.   Consisting of 14 individual
              elements, the exhibit is to communicate  the essential role and significance of
              observation in the human  experience and its more purposive character in
              science; the role  and importance of instrumentation in scientific observation;
              and  the importance to science of observing and interpreting phenomena  in
              different ways.  "Take Another Look" is aligned with nationally  developed
              science education goals as outlined in Goals 2000, the  AAAS Benchmarks, and
              with the California's Science Framework.  The  project targets the adult/child
              unit (parents and teachers with  children age 2 to 10 that they accompany). 
              Particular attention is  being paid to reaching traditionally underserved
              audiences  including Latino, Asia, and African American.  Complementary 
              materials include a Teacher's Guide, a Family Activities Guide, and  a free/low
              cost "take-away" card with suggested activities and  recommendations for other
              activities.  It is estimated that in four  years it will reach over two million
              children and adults both at  the San Jose Children's Discovery Museum and host
              museums of the  touring version.
