Abstract    :
              9552978  Scott    ABSTRACT:   This funding is for a planning phase of the Genome
              Radio Project,  a multifaceted project that will produce 17 1/2 hours of radio
              programming, plus a variety of printed and electronic ancillary materials,
              exploring the science and social implications of human genetic research.  The
              planning grant will enable the project team to develop further five key areas: 
                o To work with advisors to define their process of editorial oversight and
              their involvement in the program ppoduction process;    o To produce a
              half-hour documentary pilot program;    o To use the pilot program to solidify
              distribution agreement with networks and major market stations;    o To develop
              ancillary materials to accompany the pilot program and to determine mechanisms
              for the distribution of these materials; and    o To conduct focus group
              evaluation of the pilot program and to define specific evaluation plans for the
              broader series.
