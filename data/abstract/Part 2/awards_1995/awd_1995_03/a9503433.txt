Abstract    :
              9503433  Li     The proposed conference is in the area of geometric analysis. A
              wide spectrum of topics in geometric analysis is covered: gauge theories,
              Riemannian geometry, symplectic geometry, evolution equations and curvature
              flows are some of the topics covered in the past by this series of conferences.
                 This annual series of conferences has been supported by the National Science
              Foundation since 1991, and it is the only one of its kind serving the west
              coast. The organizers expect about 60-70 participants; a large fraction of the
              funds is to provide travel support for graduate students.
