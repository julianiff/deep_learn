Abstract    :
              9503883  Campuzano  The technique of Angle-Resolved Photoemission (ARPES) is 
              currently the only method of determining the energy - momentum  relationship of
              electrons in materials, that is, the complete  electronic structure of
              materials.  Recently, we have  dramatically improved the technique of ARPES
              from its previous  typical resolution of ~30 meV to 8 meV.  This improvement
              opens  up new possibilities in understanding new materials,  particularly the
              man-made ones with large unit cells.  This is  because in materials with large
              unit cells the eclectron states  are closely spaced in energy, requiring
              extreme  resolution.  Examples of what we propose to study are the high
              temperature  and organic superconductors, quantum confinement in metallic, 
              magnetic, and semiconducting multilayers, etc.  Although we  have made great
              strides in improving the energy resolution, the  same cannot be said about
              momentum resolution.  The new man-  made large unit cell materials have very
              small Brillouin zones.  This problem is fortunately only geometrical in nature:
               the  momentum resolution can be improved by simply restricting the  acceptance
              angle of the electron analyzer.  However, since the  counting rate decreases as
              the square of that aperture, higher  photon beam flux is required.  %%%  With
              this award we will construct an undulator-based beamline  with a high
              throughput-high resolution normal incidence  monochromator at the University of
              Wisconsin-Madison's  Synchrotron Radiation Center;s Guest Investigator Program.
               The  instrument will not only open new possibilities in the study of 
              electronic structure, but will also relieve the heavy burden  placed on the
              existing 4m NIM beamline at SRC.  ***
