Abstract    :
              9503714  Strittmatter    This Americas Program award will provide support for
              establishing  collaboration  between astronomers at the University  of  Arizona
               and  the Carnegie Institution of Washington in the United States,  and Mexican
              astronomers from the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de  Mexico  (UNAM).   The 
              proposed  work,  headed  by  Prof.   Peter  Strittmatter  of  the  University
              of  Arizona  and  Prof.  Gloria  Koenigsberger,  Director of the Institute of
              Astronomy  of  UNAM,  has  as long term goals the construction of a Magellan
              class 6.5m  optical/infrared  telescope  which will  facilitate  astronomical 
              research  by  Mexican and U.S. astronomers,  the  development  of 
              state-of-the-art  instrumentation  for  this   and   other   such  telescopes,
              and the advancement of optical design and fabrication  technology in both
              Mexico and the U.S.    Researchers  will  visit  Mexican  sites  at  UNAM,  the
               Mexican  National  Observatory at San Pedro Martir, the National Institute 
              for  Astrophysics,  Optics, and Electronics in  Puebla,  and  the  Institute
              for Optics in Leon in order to plan collaborative work,  develop  a  site
              testing program at San Pedro Martir,  carry  out  critical  studies in
              engineering and optics, and  develop  active  collaboration   in  astronomical 
              sciences  based   on   existing  observational facilities.  ***
