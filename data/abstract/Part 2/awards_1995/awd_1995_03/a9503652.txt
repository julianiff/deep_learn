Abstract    :
              DMS-9503652  Tartakoff/Lewis    This award will continue to partially support
              the Midwest Partial Differential Equations Seminar, a semiannual meeting on
              recent developments in partial differential equations.  The Seminar is hosted
              by several midwest universities, and are of particular value to graduate
              students and young post-doctorals.  They have the opportunity to the meet
              research mathematicians from other campuses and discover new facets of their
              field which are not represented at their own institutions.      Partial
              differential equations form a basis for mathematical  modeling of the physical
              world.  The role of mathematical  analysis is not so much to create the
              equations as it is to  provide qualitative and quantitative information about
              the  solutions.  This may include answers to questions about  uniqueness,
              smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often  develops methods for
              approximation of solutions and estimates on  the accuraay of these
              approximations.
