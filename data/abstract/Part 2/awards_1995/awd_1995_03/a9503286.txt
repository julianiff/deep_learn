Abstract    :
              This project will help to prepare, and make available to the scientific
              community, a  complete, worldwide systematic catalog of spiders.  The project
              includes two phases.  The first phase  involves the publication of a third
              volume in the Advances in Spider Taxonomy series; that volume will  update and
              supplement existing, published systematic catalogs of spider biodiversity by
              detailing the  illustrated redescriptions of previously described species that
              were published form 1940 through 1980,  and by providing full coverage of the
              new literature published form 1992 through 1995.  The second  phase involves
              the production of a complete catalog through the capture, and merging with all
              the  post-1940 information, of relevant data from earlier published catalogs. 
              The complete bibliographic  and taxonomic files will be made available on
              Internet and CD-ROM (in both text and database formats,  for various computer
              platforms, with annual updates to follow).  The results will serve as authority
               lists for all biodiversity projects involving spiders, and should eventually
              promote a stable nomencla  torial base for all biological studies of spiders
              and for use by scientists in agriculture and forest  management fields.
