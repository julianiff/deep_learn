Abstract    :
              9503426  Sinton       The East Pacific Rise from 15-19 S is the fastest
              spreading  of all the ocean ridges.  This is also an area of extensive 
              volcanism on the flanks of the ocean ridge, which is evident from  strings of
              seamounts that stretch northwest from the ridge axis.  The investigators plan
              to analyze rocks that are already in hand  to determine their major and trace
              element chemical compositions  and to measure selected isotope ratios.  The
              major and trace  elements will be used to determine when and where melting
              occurs  in the mantle by inferring conditions and depths of melting.  The 
              isotope ratios will be used to identify the location and  longevity of chemical
              heterogeneities in the mantle.  This  project is in the same area and is
              related to the large seismic  experiment called MELT which intends to determine
              the  distribution of melting in the mantle, and the two projects  complement
              each other.  ***
