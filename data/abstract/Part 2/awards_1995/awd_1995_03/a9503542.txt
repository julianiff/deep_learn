Abstract    :
              9503542  Veech     The proposed research lies in the area of complex dynamical
              systems. The proposer wants to evaluate certain integrals over the Teichmuller
              moduli space coming from an identification of the Teichmuller space with the
              space of cone metrics. Techniques for the study of the billiard in a regular
              polygon are expected to play an important role.    The Teichmuller moduli space
              corresponds to a family of pretzel-like surfaces known as compact Riemann
              surfaces (of a fixed genus); these surfaces play an important role in studying
              complex-valued functions. The proposed research aims to give a geometric
              description of some of these surfaces.
