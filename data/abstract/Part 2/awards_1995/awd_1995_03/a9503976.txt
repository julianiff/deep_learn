Abstract    :
              9503976  Dietterich  The goal of this research is to develop and prototype
              methods for the automatic calibration and validation of computer models of
              complex systems.  The platform for this research is an ecosystem model called
              MAPSS (Mapped Atmosphere-Plant-Soil System).  The purpose of the MAPSS model is
              to predict the biosphere impact of global climate change.  This project aims to
              improve the development, maintenance, calibration, and accuracy of MAPPS by
              combining and extending ideas from three areas of computer science: (a)
              declarative programming, (b) parallel computing, and (c) machine learning. 
              Together the proposed methods will provide model developers with significant
              speedup through a more efficient representation and parallel implementation, a
              system for automatic model calibration, and a system for model validation
              designed to maximize predictive power.  These methods will improve the
              efficiency of model development as well as help to ensure that the finished
              product is as accurate as is possible.  Further, these methods should
              generalize beyond the MAPSS project, providing a set of tools for the
              development of many computer models of complex systems.
