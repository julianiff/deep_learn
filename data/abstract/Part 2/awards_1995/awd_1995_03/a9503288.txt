                                 The U.S. - Japan Workshop on Bridge Engineering is an annual
               meeting  between  American  and Japanese  bridge  engineers,  which  is
              conducted under the auspices of the U.S.  -  Japan  Panel of Wind and Seismic
              effects of the UJNR program.  This  meeting   includes   a  two-day  workshop  
              with   technical  presentations   of  the  participants  related   to   recent 
              advantages of bridge engineering and a study tour of  bridge  structures  and 
              organizations.   Ten  meetings  have   been  conducted  so far, and all of them
              have proven  to  be  very  fruitful  and productive experience for the
              participants  of  both countries.    The  workshop will be held in Japan in May
              1995, to  support  the  participation of U.S. delegates who will make technical
               presentations and participate in the study tour.
