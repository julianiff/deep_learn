Abstract    :
              9503234  Stanback      The International Junior Investigator and Postdoctoral 
              Fellows Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to  conduct three to
              twenty-four months of research abroad. The  program's awards provide
              opportunities for joint research,  and the use of unique or complementary
              facilities, expertise  and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will
              support a six-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Mark Stanback with Dr.
              Robert Simmons at the  Namibia National Veterinary Laboratory in Windhoek,
              Namibia.    The goal of this project is to study sperm storage and sperm 
              competition in Tockus hornbills.  The focus will be on the  red-billed
              (T.erythrorhynchus) and Monteiro's hornbills (T.  monteiri).  Using a
              population of Tockus hornbills breeding  in nestboxes, the PI will combine a
              field experimental  approach with laboratory analyses, thus bridging the gap 
              that presently exists between lab studies of sperm storage  in domestic species
              and field studies of behavior and  paternity. ***
