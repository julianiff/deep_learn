              Presentation Tools for Argumentative Discourse    Good reasoning and argument
              is necessary for writing, thinking,  and arguments.  In the hypertext and
              visual language domains,  presentation tools are developed for arguments and
              design  rationales.  This project focuses on research on tools for the 
              presentation of arguments and for the support of argumentative  communications
              among humans.  In the thirty years after Toulmin,  there have been advances in
              the philosophical and logical  communities on the understanding of
              non-demonstrative and  defeasible arguments.  With applications to the legal
              domain, the  computer study of these argumentative communications becomes 
              useful.
