Abstract    :
              9503295  Whitaker         The primary objective of this project is to develop
              improved methods for ensemble  weather prediction.  Numerical experiments with
              idealized models will be performed to examine  the utility of different
              strategies for ensemble prediction.  the reduced dimension of the models  will
              allow the principal investigator and his colleagues to perform experiments with
              much larger  ensemble sizes than would be feasible with complex, operational
              forecast models.  Archived  operational ensemble predictions produced by the
              National Meteorological Center will be  examined to test diagnostic techniques
              and methods for predicting forecast skill suggested by the  idealized model
              experiments.         The research will focus on three critical topics:  (1) the
              method of constructing the initial  conditions for ensemble runs; (2)
              determining the optimal number of ensemble members required  for useful
              estimates of the most probable forecast state and (3) how systematic errors in
              the  model affect the efficacy of the ensemble prediction.         This
              research has an enormous potential for contributing to the improvement of 
              operational medium-range weather forecasts.  ***
