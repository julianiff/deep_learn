Abstract    :
              DMR-9503941  Hiltner    A layer-multiplying technology is proposed that will
              process  elastometers, thermoplastics, and composites into sheets of  films
              with hundreds or thousands of alternating layers.  With this technology, two
              polymers are fed from extruders  into a feed block as parallel layers, and then
              into a die  that splits, spreads, and recombines the melt. Any number of  die
              elements can be combined in series to produce two-  component multilayered
              structures, or three-component  multilayered structures by adding a third OtieO
              polymer.  Fundamental research topics include mechanisms of polymer 
              compatibilization and of interface formation. As the  individuial layer
              thickness becomes comparable to the size  of the polymer molecule, new
              phenomena and  properties  arising from the high interface to volume ratio are 
              anticipated.    There is a need for new processing technologies to create 
              engineered microstructures of incompatible polymers.  The  processing facility
              to be developed at Case Western Reserve  will make it possible to scout a wide
              range of multilayered  compositions of interest to the academic as well as to
              the  industrial communities.  The  co-extrusion technology can  potentially 
              produce layered polymers with unique toughness  and permeability
              characteristics.
