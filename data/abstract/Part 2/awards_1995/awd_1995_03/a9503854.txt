Abstract    :
              9503854  Gonsalves    This Americas Program award will support Dr. Kenneth
              Gonsalves of  the   Institute  of  Materials  Science  of  the  University   of
               Connecticut  in  a research collaboration with Dr.  Ramiro  Perez  Campos  of 
              the Institute of Physics of the Universidad  Autonoma  Nacional (UNAM) at
              Cuernavaca, Mexico.  The researchers intend to  characterize  and  investigate
              the properties  of  nanostructured  materials.  These novel materials, which
              include M50 type steels,  are   of   increasing  interest  to  the  aerospace 
              and  related  industries in North America.    The  research  will  focus  on 
              the principles  of  metal-organic  chemistry and materials processing concepts.
               Researchers at  the  University of Connecticut will emphasize chemical
              processing  and  consolidation aspects, while the group at UNAM will focus on 
              the  microstructural  characterization  of  powders  and  consolidated  samples
               via X-ray and electron diffraction, as well  as  lattice  imaging by high
              resolution transmission electron microscopy.   It  is expected that the
              complementary efforts of the synthesis group  at the University of Connecticut
              and the microscopy group at UNAM  will strengthen and promote long-term
              scientific interactions.  ***
