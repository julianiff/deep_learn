Abstract    :
              9503676  Larson    This U.S.-Venezuela Cooperative Program award will support 
              travel and related expenses for eleven U.S. scientists to  participate in a
              conference to be held in Curacao,  Netherlands Antilles, in June 1995.  The
              participants  include nine senior scientists, two postdoctoral associates,  and
              one graduate student.  Organizers are Dr. Jean A.  Larson, University of
              Florida and  Dr. Carlos A. de Prisco,  Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones
              Cientificas.  The  conference will focus on combinatorial set theory and its 
              applications.  It is designed to stimulate existing  collaborations and to
              initiate new projects between  researchers in the U.S. and Venezuela.   
              Combinatorial Set Theory is at the heart of modern day set  theory.  The
              techniques and constructions developed to look  at the basic structure of the
              universe of sets also find  applications to other areas of mathematical logic
              and to  algebra, topology and analysis.  While progress in certain  areas of
              algebra and topology have long been closely tied to  set theory, recently the
              range of applications has broadened  to include such areas as harmonic analysis
              and the braid  group in topology.  This meeting will seek to build on those 
              trends and stimulate individuals who may be working in  increasingly narrow
              specializations.    Besides support from the NSF and the Venezuelan National 
              Council for Science and Technology (CONICIT), the Caribbean  Mathematics
              Foundation will support expenses for  participants from the European Union and
              from other parts of  Latin America.    ***
