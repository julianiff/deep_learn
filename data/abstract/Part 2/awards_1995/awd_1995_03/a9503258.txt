Abstract    :
              Professor Benny Gerber, U. C. Irvine, is supported by a grant from the  
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to study the dynamics of  
              molecular reactions in clusters.  Gerber will study photochemical   reactions
              in hydrogen bonded and in van der Waals cluster as well as   collision-induced
              reactions of atoms with such clusters.  Research will   be conducted in four
              areas: 1) The study of possible collective reactions   induced by UV excitation
              of hydrogen bonded clusters; 2) Differences in   reactivity between solid-like
              and liquid-like states of clusters; 3)   Electronic relaxation of excited atoms
              and molecules solvated in   clusters; and 4) Photodissociation / recombination
              on the electronic   ground state of molecules in clusters.  A combination of
              classical MD and   semiclassical wavepacket treatments will be employed.  A
              semiclassical   technique will be used to preserve zero point energy in the
              molecular   dynamics treatments which employs wavepackets for stiff vibrational
              modes   and classical dynamics for soft modes.  The study of molecular
              reactions in clusters is of primary importance as   a technique for gaining
              additional insight into the effects of solvation   upon chemical reactions.  
              Experimental and theoretical conditions can be   varied in a systematic fashion
              from relatively small clusters consisting   of a few  isolated molecules all
              the way to large clusters which mimic   condensed matter in the bulk solution.
