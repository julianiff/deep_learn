Abstract    :

              (Knoxville)  "Unstable Regions Around Underground Openings:  A Model  Based on
              Block  Theory, Reliability, Stress Analysis and Linear Programming"   
              Knowledge of unstable regions is crucial to the safe design  of underground 
              structures and facilities.  At low to moderate in situ  stress, the unstable 
              zone location and dimensions are strongly influences by  excavation  geometry,
              in situ effective stresses, and rock mass  inhomogeneities and 
              discontinuities.  A rational approach to excavation design,  including  design
              of support systems, should be based on an  understanding of the  combined
              effects of these major influences.    This research addresses the problem of
              determining the size  and shape of  the unstable zone around underground
              openings in cases where  the block  theory model is appropriate, i.e., hard,
              jointed rock at low  to moderate  stress levels.  Unstable keyblocks, the
              dominant failure  mechanism, are  limited in size by two main factors in
              addition to the  excavation size:  the sizes and shapes of the bounding
              discontinuities, and  the stabilizing  effect of in situ stress.  This research
              will be completed  with 1)  development of an analytical model for keyblock
              size  distribution, 2)  development of characteristic probability density
              functions  for keyblock  size, 3) combining block theory with stress analysis
              to  determine maximum  size of unstable keyblocks, and 4) combining 2) and 3)
              to  develop a  reliability analysis for support systems.    The results of this
              research will be applicable to  tunneling, mining, and  the development of
              underground space, as well as to  infrastructure  rehabilitation and safety
              assessments.  The methods  developed can be  extended to rock slopes and
              foundations, with significant  cost savings  possible from designs based on
              objective, consistent and  rational  procedures.
