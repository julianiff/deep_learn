Abstract    :
              9503176  Mohan       Utility-interactive photovoltaic, wind-electric and fuel- 
              cell systems are being planned at sufficiently large power  levels.  The
              technical and economic feasibility of such systems  partially depends on the
              reliability, safety, cost, and the  efficiency of their grid interface.  A
              novel interface, which  takes advantage of the system conditions in a
              utility-scale  application is proposed.  Several research tasks are proposed to
               demonstrate and verify its performance by means of a 7.5 kW  laboratory
              hardware prototype.  The success of the proposed  interface can be a
              significant step towards the feasibility of  utility-interactive PV,
              wind-electric and fuel-cell systems.   Because the proposed topology is
              completely novel, new  discoveries are entirely possible which will also be
              beneficial  to systems other than the proposed utility interface.  ***
