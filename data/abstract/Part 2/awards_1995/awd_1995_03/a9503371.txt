Abstract    :
              Professor Renken will initiate a new program of  computational research in the
              subject of quantum gravity.  He will use the mathematical technique of
              dynamical  triangulation and the renormalization group to model  important
              features of quantum gravity.    The problem of quantum gravity in 3 or 4
              dimensions is  currently a very active area of theoretical research.  Although
              it is impossible to predict whether this work will  provide a final theory, it
              is highly likely to generate  significant advances in our understanding of
              thermodynamics  and continuum limits in candidate lattice theories.
