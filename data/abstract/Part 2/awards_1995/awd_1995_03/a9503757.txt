Abstract    :
              9503757  Hu  This project will investigate efficient parallel algorithms to 
              find all numerical solutions for large-scale nonlinear systems of  equations in
              a given domain with mathematical certainty, even in  the presence of
              uncertainty in the data, roundoff error, and  nonlinearities by finite digit
              computations.  The basic algorithm  to be used is based on the interval
              Newton/Generalized bisection  method.  Parallel algorithms will be implemented
              on vector  processors, shared-memory multiprocessors, and distributed-memory 
              multicomputers.  On a vector processor, new data structures will be designed to
               take full advantage of completely pipelined functional units of  vector
              processors.  To speed memory accessing, techniques will be  developed to
              increase cache hit ratio on machines with cache such  as the IBM 3090, and to
              reduce bank conflict on interleaved  memory systems such as the CRAY C90.  On a
              shared memory  multiprocessor, optimal partitioning schemes will be studied for
               given nonlinear systems based on two protocols.  By overlapping  communication
              and computation, in addition to reducing  communication and contention, large
              speedup is expected.  On  distributed-memory multicomputers, algorithms on
              coarse grained  SPMP schemes and fine-grained MPMP schemes will be implemented
              on  realistic machines.  General sparsity and scalability will be  considered
              in all implementations.  ***
