Abstract    :
              9503877  Browning    The aim of this project is to link the macroscopic 
              electromagnetic performance of Ag sheathed Bi(Pb)SrCaCuO  (2223) tapes to the
              atomic and electronic structure of their  defects.  Low-temperature scanning
              electron microscopy  (LTSEM) will be used to locate the presence of weak-link 
              behavior.  Using STEM & EELS techniques correlation of the  local hole
              concentration with the atomic structure on a  scale below the superconducting
              coherence length will be  made.  The wealth of spectroscopic data on carrier 
              concentrations and doping effects in this material will be  applied on a local
              scale to determine the actual microscopic  origins of tape performance.  In
              turn, the substantial  technical expertise of the industrial tape supplier will
               enable the defect content to be tailored for enhanced tape  performance.  %%% 
              The proposed studies will aim to link the macroscopic  electromagnetic
              performance of silver sheathed bismuth  superconductor tapes to the atomic and
              electronic structure  of their defects.
