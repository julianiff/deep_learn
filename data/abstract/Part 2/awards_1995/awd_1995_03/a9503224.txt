Abstract    :
              The PI will continue current NSF research completing theoretical  quantum
              chemical calculations of rate coefficients and cross  sections for the
              dissociative recombination of nitrogen.  The  measurements will help resolve a
              long standing discrepancy between  measured ionospheric nitrogen concentrations
              and model predictions.   Dissociative recombination rate constants and atomic
              quantum yields  will be calculated as a function of ion vibrational level and 
              electron temperature.  Also, the PI will calculate the dissociative 
              recombination of nitric oxide with an electron as an important  parameter to
              many ionospheric models.  Finally, the PI will  continue studying the rate
              constants for collisional deexcitation  of excited states of oxygen by ground
              state oxygen.  Because these  processes are important relaxation mechanisms for
              excited oxygen  (especially at low altitudes), they have been identified by
              others  as major sources of hot atomic oxygen in the thermosphere, and have 
              never been measured in the laboratory or calculated  theoretically.***
