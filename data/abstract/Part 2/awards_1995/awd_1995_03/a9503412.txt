Abstract    :
              9503412  Sen       This is a project to develop a more rigorous technique of 
              amplitude variation with offset (AVO) inversion for application  to marine
              multichannel seismic data.  Global optimization methods  such as simulated
              annealing and generic algorithms will be used  to estimate the background
              velocity field which will then be  combined with a very simplistic approach to
              derive estimates of  the high frequency material property components.  The
              primary  goal is to develop, test, and evaluate the proposed methodology  in
              the estimation of material properties from multichannel  seismic data.  ***
