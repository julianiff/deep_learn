Abstract    :
              9503716  McEwen    This U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Research grant will support 
              the collaborative research of Dr. Alejandro de Nicola of  Argentina (Instituto
              de Biologia y Medicina Experimental)  and Dr. Bruce McEwen of the U.S.
              (Rockefeller University) to  investigate the role of Na,K-ATPase in the
              amygdala in the  control of salt appetite in the rat caused by injections of 
              deoxycorticosterone (DOC). The effects of the  mineralocorticoid agonist,
              aldosterone, as well as the  glucocorticoid receptor agonist, Ru 28362, on the
              amygdala  and hippocampus will also be studied.    The laboratories of both
              Drs. de Nicola and McEwen are well  established and recognized for the high
              quality of research  which has come out of them.  The questions proposed
              generate  much interest in the scientific community; in particular,  the neural
              basis of steroid control of salt appetite in rats  is recognized as an
              important problem.  Both in Argentina  and in New York, young scientists will
              be given an  opportunity, as part of this grant, to participate in an 
              important area of research in well-equipped laboratories.  ***
