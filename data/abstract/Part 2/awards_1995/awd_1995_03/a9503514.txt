Abstract    :
              9503514  Moore  Centre College proposes to install and maintain a 1.5 Megabit
              (T1)  communications circuit for the purpose of establishing a permanent 
              connection to the Internet.  This line will enable Centre College  to replace
              the current temporary connection to the Internet and to  expand current
              services to two public school systems and the  Kentucky School for the Deaf. 
              This connection will also afford  improved sharing of resources by and with
              other educational  institutions by providing connectivity with federal and
              state  agencies and institutions of higher education worldwide.
