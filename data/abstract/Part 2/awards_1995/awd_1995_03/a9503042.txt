Abstract    :
              9503042  Kasilingam  The PI's career plan is to develop an integrated remote 
              sensing program at the University of Massachusetts,  Dartmouth.  The program
              will have an emphasis on marine  related remote sensing in accordance with the
              needs of the  local region.  The PI's research plan will focus on  developing
              advanced signal processing techniques for  extracting information from remotely
              sensed data from the  ocean. With this goal in mind, it is proposed to develop
              a  technique based on artificial neural networks to extract  ocean surface wave
              information from synthetic aperture radar  images of the ocean and to improve
              wind speed and  directional estimates from radar scatterometers.  The two  tier
              approach is expected to test the applicability of this  technique to both
              imaging and non-imaging applications.  Through a grant from the Engineering
              Foundation the PI is  currently supporting a graduate student for a year to
              study  the properties of artificial neural networks and how they  may be
              utilized for nonlinear mapping applications such as  the two proposed projects.
               It is planned to continue this  effort as a part of the proposed research
              program.  The  ultimate research objective is to use remotely sensed field 
              data along with in-situ measurements to test the inversion  schemes.  If
              successfully completed, the technique is  expected to provide greater insights
              into the physics of the  measurement processes.  There is also the potential
              for  using similar techniques in other areas of ocean remote  sensing such as
              marine pollution monitoring.  ***
