Abstract    :
                Dawes  9503017     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              will result in a new method for detecting and classifying acoustic emissions
              (AE) resulting from crack growth in complex metal structures. To perform this
              research, a prototype acoustic emission sensor-processor system will be used to
              collect AE data in situ from the wing skin of a flight training aircraft in the
              vicinity of a landing gear assembly where fatigue cracking of the skin is a
              known problem. The proposed innovation, whose feasibility for this application
              was demonstrated in the Phase I project, is based on the use of the Parametric
              Avalanche Stochastic Filter (PASF), and on the similarity of the acoustic
              emission classification problem to certain problems of continuous speech
              recognition. In particular, the PASF is able to directly distinguish between
              crack events and other classes of acoustic signatures imbedded in a continuous,
              noisy data stream. It is anticipated that the results of this Phase II research
              will advance the use of AE technology to perform non-destructive evaluation
              (NDE) in a variety of applications, at a considerable cost savings over current
              methods.   Phase II research will demonstpate a successful AE-based NDE
              technology which can be marketed to the commercial and military aircraft
              manufacturing industry, commercial airlines, and aerospace maintenance and
              refurbishment firms. Technology developed in Phase II will also be used to
              pursue other NDE applications, including monitoring of pipelines, pressure
              vessels for the petrochemical and nuclear power industries, and testing of
              load-bearing structures.  p:\sbir\yhashimi\9503017c.doc
