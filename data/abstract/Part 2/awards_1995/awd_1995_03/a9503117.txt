Abstract    :
              ***  9503117  Liu  Multiple scale methods, which are based on reproducing kernel
               and wavelet analysis, will be developed.  These permit the  response of a
              system to be separated into different scales.  These scales can either be the
              wave numbers corresponding to  spatial variables or the frequencies
              corresponding to  temporal variables; and each scale response can be examined 
              separately.  This complete characterization of the unknown  response will be
              performed through the integral window  transform; and a space-scale and
              time-frequency localization  process is achieved by dilating the flexible
              multiple scale  window function.  These developed methods will be applied to
              nonlinear dynamics  of structures in particular emphasize on fluid-structure 
              interaction.***
