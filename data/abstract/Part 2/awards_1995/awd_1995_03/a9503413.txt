Abstract    :
              9503413  O'Brien      This proposal requests funds for Indian River Community
              College to  establish a direct connection between its campus wide network and 
              NSFNET via SURANET, a regional network.  These connections will  provide
              operations management and information services and it will  give the college a
              56 thousand bits per second connection to the  NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45
              million bits per second) National  Backbone network.    The benefits of this
              NSFNET connection include e-mail between local  and remote researchers and
              educators, file transfer capability and  the ability to use remote computer
              resources.  Also the college  will have the ability to investigate innovation
              in educational  resources and incorporate them into their curricula.
