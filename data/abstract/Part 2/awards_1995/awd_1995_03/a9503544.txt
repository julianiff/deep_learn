Abstract    :
              9503544  Binder  Maryville College is seeking support in connecting its campus
              to  INTERNet by installing a node on campus.  The support would be in  the form
              of computer hardware, communications software, and  communication services. 
              Maryville College currently has dial-in  access to INTERNet through the
              University of Tennessee in Knoxville  for most of its faculty and staff, but
              this service is quite  limited, and it is not available to students.  By
              connecting to  INTERNet via a node, Maryville College would be able to greatly 
              improve and expand its current computer services to its  constituents,
              especially its students.    These connections will provide operations
              management and  information services and it will give the college a 56 thousand
               bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high  speed (1.5 - 45 million bits
              per second) National Backbone network.  The benefits of the NSFNET connection
              include e-mail between local  and remote researchers and educators, file
              transfer capability and  the ability to use remote computer resources.  Also
              the college  will have the ability to investigate innovation in educational 
              resources and incorporate them into their curricula.
