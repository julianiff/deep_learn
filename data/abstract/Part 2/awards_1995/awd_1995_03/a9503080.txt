Abstract    :
              9503080  Gramila  Fundamental aspects of electronic properties of semiconductors
              are to  be studied in a set of experiments utilizing a powerful new 
              measurement technique. The focus of the measurements is electron-  electron
              interactions, which can be directly measured with the new  technique.
              Measurements will explore the influence of disorder on  electron systems in
              detail. The goal is to isolate for the first time  a central physical element
              of disorder induced effects: correlations  between electrons. Other fundamental
              issues to be addressed include  electron screening, examined through direct
              experimental measurement  of corrections to random phase approximation
              screening calculations.  The relevance of the issues explored in these
              measurements extends to  virtually all electronic systems, from conventional
              semiconductors to  new reduced dimensionality systems.  %%%  The  properties 
              of  metals and semiconductors  can  be  fundamentally  altered by interaction
              between the electrons present in these systems.  A  new  measurement technique,
              which provides direct  and  unambiguous  measurement  of  these  otherwise
              elusive  interactions,  permits  new  approaches to important questions in
              these materials. The influence of  disorder  on  electronic  properties is one
              area  to  be  explored  in  detail. Another area is the degree to which the
              electrons collectively  shield  themselves  from  external  forces  and 
              voltages,  a  complex  phenomena  notoriously difficult to calculate directly.
              The  relevance  of  the issues explored in these measurements extends to
              virtually all  electronic   systems,   from  conventional   semiconductors   to
                new  nanostructured materials.  ***
