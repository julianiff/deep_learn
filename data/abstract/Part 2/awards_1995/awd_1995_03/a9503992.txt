Abstract    :
              9503992  Hollis    The objectives of this project are: (1) providing the
              postdoctoral research associate with a rich environment for extending previous
              work in distributed real-time control of dynamic systems to the problem domain
              principally of manufacturing automation; (2) to contribute in the area of
              distributed control to the developing project in miniature factories, and (3)
              to provide a means for the associate to broaden the exposure to a wide variety
              of research topics within several units of the university.    Given the
              relatively constant cost of mechanical actuators and mechanisms in contrast to
              the continuing advances in price, size, and performance of computers it is
              inevitable that computational processes become as pervasive and distributed as
              their mechanical counterparts. The intent of this research project is to `egin
              exploration of scientifically grounded approaches to the construction of such
              systems. Specifically, distributed real-time control systems will be
              constructed primarily to support a highly modular (in mechanical hardware,
              computational hardware, and software) miniature assembly  system. The proposed
              controller architecture makes use of an event driven model for parallel
              processing to afford the necessarily high levels of software and hardware
              modularity, both of which will allow for rapid and efficient system development
              and reconfiguration without risking catastrophic failure due to unforeseen
              computational hardware or software interactions.  ***
