Abstract    :
               This project covers the following four activities in the area of  restructuring
              compilers and the application of the technology to  applications.  (1) The
              previous work of the PI on data alignment will be extended to  include  data
              distribution. This will permit data and computations to be  mapped to  physical
              processors of a MIMD machine in such a way that  parallelism is  exploited
              while minimizing communication overhead.    (2) Loop transformation  technology
              for imperfectly nested loops will be  developed. Current technology  can handle
              only `perfectly nested loops`  where assignments occur only in the  innermost
              loops. However, many  practical applications have imperfectly nested  loops. In
              this project  techniques for performing linear loop transformations  and tiling
               imperfectly nested loops will be developed.   (3) The project will  develop
              methods for producing parallel code for  applications involving sparse 
              matrices.    (4)  Above techniques will be applied to logic simulation 
              applications.
