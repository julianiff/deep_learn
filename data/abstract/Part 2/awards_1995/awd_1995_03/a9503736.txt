Abstract    :
              9503736  Swann    This project connects the Midwest Research Institute to the 
              Internet over a 56,000 bits per second line.  The institute is  installing a
              server to allow Internet access to its research  results.  Researchers at the
              Institute benefit from access to the  resources of the Internet, including
              libraries and supercomputers.   In addition, they are able to communicate and
              collaborate with  colleagues ar other institutions in pursuit of research and 
              educational projects.  The award provides partial support of the  project for
              two years.
