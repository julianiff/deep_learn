Abstract    :
              9503747  Neumann College    This proposal requests funds for Neumann College to 
              establish a connection to the Internet using a developmental model  which
              includes four stages:       * Institutional cabling and wiring       * Library
              and multicampus network       * Integrating technology with teaching-learning  
                  * Outreach with underserved urban school (Chester, PA) for           
              teacher development and student learning.    These connections will rovide
              operations management and information  services and it will give the college a
              56 thousand bits per second  connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45
              million bits per  second) National Backbone network.    The benefits of this
              NSFNET connection include e-mail between local  and remote researchers and
              educators, file transfer capability and  the ability to use remote computer
              resources.  Also the college  will have the ability to investigate innovation
              in educational  resources and incorporate them into their curricula.
