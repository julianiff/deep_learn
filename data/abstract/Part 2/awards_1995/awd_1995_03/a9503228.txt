Abstract    :
              9503228  Morford   Microsoft is having success distributing a graphic based
              operating system called Windows NT which runs on larger style personal
              computers.  This operating system is currently being used in  many universities
              and businesses and is inaccessible  to visually impaired people.  This lack of
              access will hinder the educational and business opportunities for visually
              impaired people.  In this Small  Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              Automated Functions, Inc. (AFI) is designing and developing software that uses
              an innovative multiple task approach to attempt to accurately convert the
              graphic based Windows NT two-dimensional screen data to the one-dimensional 
              medium of speech or Braille.  AFI will use new data exchange functions in
              Windows NT to try to increase the accuracy of the graphic to text conversion. 
              Graphic Access New Technology (GANT) will also be designed to be quickly
              updated for different foreign languages.   This Small Business Innovation
              Research Phase II project is to make Windows NT accessible to visually impaired
              people. AFI is expert in the design and development of adaptive aids to assist
              visually impaired people.  The  GANT team is familiar with graphic based
              operating systems and understands the needs of visually impaired people.  A
              successful GANT system will enable visually impaired people to  use the same
              Windows NT system as their sighted peers.
