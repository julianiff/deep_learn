Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT   We study complex systems modeled by interacting  particles, or, more
              generally, by Markov Processes with a high  dimensional state space. In the
              presence of conservation laws,  the Markov Process will have several invariant
              measures. If the  interaction is local then the evolution will take the system 
              quickly to a local equilibrium  parametrized by the local  averages of the
              conserved quantities. These parameters that are  functions of space and time
              will evolve according to some  evolution law after suitable rescaling. There
              are  several  examples of this phenomenon, known as hydrodynamic scaling:  the 
              transition from Hamiltonian Equations for particles to Euler  Equations  for a
              fluid, Nonlinear diffusion equations for the  bulk diffusion of various
              interacting particle systems etc. The  project investigates rigorously this
              transition for several  classes of models.     One of the central problems in
              the use of  mathematical models in the physical as well as social sciences,  is
              the problem of scaling.  One has a complex system consisting  of a large number
              of interacting components which is evolving in  time. Its properties are
              specified at the level of individual  components. However one is interested in
              how certain small number  of measurements made on the large or global scale
              evolve in time.  The aim of this research is to make a  mathematically valid
              link  between the two in certain specific physical models.
