Abstract    :
              The PI proposes to investigate three areas of theoretical and  experimental
              high-frequency (HF) heater-induced plasma turbulence  in the ionosphere. 
              First, he will study the evolution of the  electron velocity distribution
              following heater turn-on.  Next, he  will observe the relationship of
              short-scale, field-aligned density  striations, or ducts, to the HF-induced
              turbulence.  Last, he will  study the generation of ionospheric Langmuir
              turbulence by the  excitation of the two-plasmon decay (TPD) instability and by
               stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), which occur near one quarter of  the
              reflection density.***
