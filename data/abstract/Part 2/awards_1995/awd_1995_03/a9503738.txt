Abstract    :
              With this award, the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic   Chemistry
              Program supports continued research on transition metal   complexes as
              catalysts for organic oxidation reactions by Dr. Thomas J.   Meyer of the
              Chemistry Department, University of North Carolina at Chapel   Hill. 
              Electrochemical and photochemical methods will be used to effect   and to
              investigate the mechanism of the reactions.  The goal of the   project is to
              design selective catalytic reagents using oxo polypyridyl   complexes of
              ruthenium or osmium.  New dioxo and ligand-bridged systems   will be
              synthesized and tested for stereospecificity.  Nitrido and imido   analogues of
              the oxo complexes will also be prepared and investigated for   oxidation
              activity.  Thin polymeric films of promising materials will be   adhered to
              electrodes to test their potential as sensors.  Aldehydes and aromatic
              hydrocarbons undergo oxidation when an oxygen atom   is added to them directly
              to form acids and alcohols, respectively.     Such reactions are important in
              making new organic compounds.  In order   to develop reagents that will effect
              these reactions in a manner in which   the products desired can be obtained, it
              is important to understand the   details of the reactions.  In this
              investigation, the exact pathway of   reactions in which metal complexes
              provide an oxygen atom will be   determined.
