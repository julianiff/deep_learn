Abstract    :
              9503118  Wolf    This U.S.-Argentina Joint Workshop will support travel 
              expenses related to the participation of  Dr. Joseph A.  Wolf, UC at Berkeley
              and nine other U.S. scientists in a  Workshop in Lie Groups and Quantum Groups,
              to be held in  Cordoba, Argentina in August, 1995.  Dr. Wolf is the U.S. 
              organizer, the Argentine co-organizers are Drs.  Juan Tirao  and Roberto
              Miatello, of FAMAF, the Faculty of Mathematics,  Astronomy and Physics of  the
              University of Cordoba,  Argentina.  Some publication expenses will also be 
              supported.    Lie theory is one of the central areas of mathematics, with  a
              wide range of applications in harmonic analysis,  differential geometry, number
              theory and physics, and  also  plays an important role in applied mathematics.
              In South  America there are several excellent centers of activity in  this
              area, notably in Argentina and Chile.  The workshop  will bring together
              internationally known U.S. and Argentine  researchers, who will discuss recent
              developments in the  field, and  will set the stage for a number of joint 
              research projects between U.S. and Latin American  scientists.  The program
              will include specialist  and  topical lectures, as well as formal and informal
              discussions  among the participants. In addition to senior researchers,  young
              scientists and graduate students from the U.S.,  Argentina, Brazil and Chile
              will participate.  Training and  development of these students will be another 
              major aspect  of the workshop.  U.S. as well as Latin American scientists  and
              students will benefit from this interaction, in an  important area of
              mathematics.  ***
