Abstract    :
              9503665 Einmahl  Abstract      This proposal addresses questions from three
              different areas: (1) Universal Results on the Behavior of Sums of Independent
              Random Variables (2) Local Empirical Processes (3) A General Law of the
              Iterated Logarithm in Banach space. The work in area (1) is motivated by some
              recent universal results on the almost sure behavior of sums of independent
              random variables. Contrary to the classical results in this direction, these
              results do not require moment type conditions. The main difficulty is to find
              suitable norming and centering sequences which are specific to the particular
              situations under investigation. Among other things, quantile transformations
              will be used. The work from area (2) is mainly devoted to the limit behavior of
              local empirical processes which have useful applications in density and
              regression function estimation. The third part of this proposal finally
              addresses a number of questions in connection with a recent general law of the
              iterated logarithm in Banach space.    This proposal addresses a number of
              questions on limit theorems in probability and empirical processes. Limit
              theorems in probability such as the central limit theorem, and laws of large
              numbers provide the basis for many widely used statistical techniques to handle
              large data sets. Some of these  results, however, can only be applied under
              relatively restrictive conditions. Over the last decade, powerful methods have
              been developed in probability. It is proposed to use these new techniques to
              further extend the applicability of the basic limit theorems, and, at the same
              time, to gain some insight into situations, where the classical techniques have
              failed. Some applications to statistical estimation theory will be considered
              as well, where the main emphasis will be on so-called empirical processes.
