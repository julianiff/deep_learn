Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to achieve robust parsing and disambiguation of
              purposeful, spoken  dialogs, where ordinary phrase and sentence structure may
              be disrupted by acknowledgements, self-  editing, correction and clarification
              subdialogs, etc. The primary means for achieving robustness and  on-line
              disambiguation will be (1) an incremental `dialog chart parser` that fully
              integrates all  levels of analysis from the level of words and prosody to the
              level of dialog segment structure; and  (2) a `preference trade-off` technique
              for selecting preferred analyses on-line, using lexical,  syntatic, semantic,
              and discourse structure preferences encoded as numerical potentials. Potentials
               will be statistically `tuned` using available text corpora and the TRAINS
              planning dialog corpus  collected at the University of Rochester. The
              significance of the research lies in the fact that  dealing simultaneously with
              phrase structure and dialog structure, and coping with rampant ambiguity,  are
              two of the most important challenges still facing natural human-machine
              communication. The advent  of robust, preference-seekin g dialog parsers will
              provide a basis for genuine, practical dialog  understanding in a wide variety
              of intelligent agents offering interactive assistance in planning,  problem
              solving, crisis management, and information retrieval
