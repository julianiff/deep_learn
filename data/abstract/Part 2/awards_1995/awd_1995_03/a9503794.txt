Abstract    :
              9503794  Isaac        This proposal requests funds for Lourdes College to
              connect to  NSFNET through OARnet.  This connection will provide operations 
              management and information services and it will give the college a  56 thousand
              bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed  (1.5 - 45 million bits
              per second) National Backbone network.    The benefits of this NSFNET
              connection include e-mail between local  and remote researchers and educators,
              file transfer capability and  the ability to use remote computer resources. 
              Also the college  will have the ability to investigate innovation in
              educational  resources and incorporate them into their curricula.
