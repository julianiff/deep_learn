Abstract    :
              9503572  Swager    This research program will address the synthesis and 
              characterization of achiral ferroelectric liquid crystals,  with an emphasis on
              the electrical characterization  (dielectric, triangular wave polarization and
              piezoelectric  measurements) of materials which form hexagonal columnar 
              phases.  In addition, new research themes centered around  the use of
              self-assembled monolayers to align the liquid  crystals and create polar films
              will be initiated.  %%%  Scientific interest in liquid crystal research is
              receiving  considerable emphasis.  The inherent scientific interest in  new,
              highly optimized liquid crystal systems is high  because of their uses in flat
              panel displays, light  shutters, optical signs, and even (possibly) optical 
              computers.  ***
