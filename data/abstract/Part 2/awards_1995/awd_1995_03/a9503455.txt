Abstract    :
              9503455  Eglinton    The molecular-level characterization of particulate organic
              matter  (POM) in the marine environment has remained technically unfeasible 
              until recently. The investigator in this study will be taking  advantage of
              recent developments in the field of direct temperature  resolved mass
              spectrometry (DT-MS) to study compositional details  of suspended POM collected
              from inshore will involve the use of  flow cytometry  to separate suspended POM
              into sub-classes defined  on the particle size) followed by DT-MS analysis of
              the class  separates.  The approach will make possible the determination of 
              the composition and relative importance of different classes of  organic
              compounds (polysaccharides, proteins, phenols, etc.) as  well as establish
              chemical signatures for the planktonic sources of  the POM.
