Abstract    :
              9503488  Flowers  In this project analytical and experimental techniques are 
              developed for the active control of disk and blade  vibrations using magnetic
              bearings. Vibration of bladed-disk  assemblies is a significant problem in
              turbomachinery.  Fatigue failures induced by excessive vibration is a major 
              cause of turbomachine failures. The noise that results from  flow-induced blade
              vibration is a significant factor in the  environmental impact of aircraft
              engines. In view of these  concerns, strategies are developed to alleviate
              blade  fatigue and vibration induced noise. Influences of  nonlinearities
              arising from aeroelastic effects, from rotor  support structure, and from
              magnetic bearings are  considered, and nonstationary excitations due to
              variations  in rotor speeds are examined. The research results are also 
              applicable to vibration control of high speed machining.***
