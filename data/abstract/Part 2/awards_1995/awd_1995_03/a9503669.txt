Abstract    :
              9503669   Loubere    Detailed quantitative analysis of surface ocean
              productivity and bottom water oxygen contend over the past 400,000 years       
                                  is proposed using two cores from the eastern equatorial
              Pacific. Paleoproductivity estimates will be based on a new quantitative,
              benthic Foraminiferal transfer function constrained by qualitative proxies
              extracted from statistical analysis of combined planktonic and benthic
              Foraminiferal assemblages, accumulation rates of sedimentary components and
              accumulation rates of benthic Foraminifera.  The deep water paleo-oxygen
              estimates will be based on a quantitative benthic Foraminiferal transfer
              function tested at this stage by seeking a coherent signal at coring locations
              positioned under different biological productivity regimes.  The main objective
              of the paleoproductivity work will be generate quantitative estimates over a
              time period long enough to test the relationship of eastern equatorial Pacific
              productivity to global climate change.  Also, the data can be used to examine a
              model of equatorial paleoproductivity in which changes along the equator are
              antithetical to those in the 5 to 10 degree latitude belts  on either side of
              the equator.  Finally, the data, combined with accumulation rates of
              terrigenous components, can be used to examine the 'iron hypothesis' for
              productivity enhancement.  The main objective of the paleo-oxygen  work will 
              be to test for signal coherence at different coring locations and to test
              initial results showing paleo-oxygen minima  corresponding to North Atlantic
              melt water pulses and to Heinrich events.
