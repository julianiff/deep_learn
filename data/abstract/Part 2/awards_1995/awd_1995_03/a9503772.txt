Abstract    :
              9503772  Altabet       The authors propose to explore the potential of stable 
              nitrogen isotopes in marine sediments as tracers of past  nitrate utilization,
              and hence of primary production.  They  will examine the difference between
              water-column and surface  sediment ratios, explore the feasibility of analyzing
               organic material in the matrices of individual microfossils,  and will examine
              a typical sediment record from the  equatorial Pacific to determine whether the
              changes seen  from glacial to interglacial periods might be only an  artifact
              of differential preservation.  ***
