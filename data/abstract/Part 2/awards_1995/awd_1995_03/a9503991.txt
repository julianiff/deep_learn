Abstract    :
              9503991  Bielak  This proposal is concerned with the development of efficient
              parallel algorithms for the numerical study of wave phenomena that arise when
              waves propagating within an infinite or semi-infinite medium encounter
              obstacles in their path.  The focus of this proposal is to successfully
              integrate absorbing boundary techniques, which primarily aim at the reduction
              of computational domains, with parallel numerical algorithms that exploit
              distributed memory multiprocessor systems.  The ultimate objective is the
              physical understanding of the modeled system: in this proposal the primary
              application target is the elastic wave propagation arising in the simulation of
              the ground motion of large basins.
