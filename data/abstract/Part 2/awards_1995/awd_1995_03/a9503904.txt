Abstract    :
                9503904  Menendez    This specialized high resolution double monochromater
              will  benefit several research groups conducting fundamental  materials
              research that is technologically important.  The  instrument will be used to
              develop new semiconductor  characterization techniques such as stress-induced
              optical-  phonon energy splitting in silicon-based devices, the study  of
              damage in gallium arsenide structures, the  characterization of semiconductor
              materials for visible  light emissio, the measurement of acoustic-phonon
              energies,  and studies of isotopic and crystal field phonon splittings  in
              fullerene solids.  This work is expected to provide a  detailed picture of
              phase transitions in these materials and  will make a substantial contribution
              to the investigations  of fundamental problems in solid-state physics such as 
              localization.
