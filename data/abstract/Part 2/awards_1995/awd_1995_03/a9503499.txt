Abstract    :
              9503499  Taylor    As shown by recent ODP drilling, the early evolution of the
              Lau  Basin involved rifting of a former volcanic arc.  It is not known  why
              some fast spreading segments are opening obliquely and my  represent a
              different accretionary process at backarc compared to  mid-ocean ridge
              spreading A major land-sea seismicity experiment in  1994-95 provided a
              tomographic image of seismic velocity and  attenuation structure beneath the
              basin and surrounding areas. This  study will test whether Lau spreading center
              and Peggy Ridge  transform fault are linked by an extensional transform zone.
              It  will also constrain dynamic models and provide a regional survey  for OBS
              transect study of mantle melting process.
