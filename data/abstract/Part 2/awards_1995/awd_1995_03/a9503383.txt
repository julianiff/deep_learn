Abstract    :
                Polymorphism is a key feature of modern, strongly-typed  programming languages
              including Ada, C++, and ML. This research  program  investigates a new approach
              to implementing  polymorphism, based on associating  type information with each
               activation of a polymorphic function, rather than  with data.  This approach
              permits type information to be utilized  effectively  at runtime or link-time,
              not just at compile-time.  It enables compilers to  generate polymorphic object
              code from  parametrically polymorphic source code,  while still using 
              specialized, space-efficient data formats that can be shared  with other
              software components.  The approach also supports a  large variety of  powerful
              non-parametric features in the source  language and in the development  and
              runtime environments. The  focus of the research will be on generating 
              prototype compiler  implementations and language extensions, that can be 
              evaluated  using performance benchmarks. The underlying aim of the  research is
               to make polymorphic programs easier to develop and  to integrate into existing
               systems, thereby, hastening the  acceptance of modern languages by industrial 
              and commercial  users as well as by academics.
