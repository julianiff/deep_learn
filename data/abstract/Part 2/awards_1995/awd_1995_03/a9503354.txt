Abstract    :
                  With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Gutsche shall
              extend his  investigation into the preparation of novel calixarenes and the
              mechanisms of reaction.  Further,  his investigation will include studies of
              molecular conformation and enzyme mimics of several  new calixarene systems.   
              Calixarene molecular systems represent a laboratory prepared complex system
              which has  potential to facilitate/catalyze chemical reactions.  The molecular
              recognition units function  uniquely and are useful to industry as well as
              academia.  They now rival other molecular  systems as cyclodextrins with regard
              to usefulness as molecular recognition systems.
