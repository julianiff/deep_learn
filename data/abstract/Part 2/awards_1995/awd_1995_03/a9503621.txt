Abstract    :
                  9503621  Li  This Research Planning Grant is made in order to develop a
              quasi-  nondestructive method for residual stress evaluation.  The  technique
              is based on measuring changes in the separation distances  between three
              closely placed microindentations on the surface of an  object.  This method can
              be used in hostile environments and at  elevated temperatures.  ***
