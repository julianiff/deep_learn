Abstract    :
              9503761  Shoureshi  This supplement is to provide further financial support to 
              the project "Development and Performance Evaluation of Low  Power Intelligent
              Structural Control Systems."  The project  will develop a neural-based control
              scheme, with emphasis on  learning of structural parameter variations, and
              design and  construction of a new low-powered adaptive actuation system  for
              structures.  The control system will have a fuzzy based  uncertainty
              compensator.  A small scale cable bridge  structure has been constructed for
              implementation of the  proposed control scheme.  The supplementary funds will
              be  used in this experimental investigation and to support a  graduate student.
