Abstract    :
              9503850  Echeverria    This U.S.- Argentina Joint Workshop supports travel
              expenses  for U.S. scientists and  graduate students, who will attend  the
              First International Symposium on Sucrose Metabolism, to  be held at Mar del
              Plata, Argentina. The U.S. organizer is  Dr. Ed Echeverria, U.of Florida ,
              Gainesville, FL, and the  Argentine co-organizer is Dr. Horacio Pontis,
              Fundacion para  Investigaciones Biologicas Aplicadas, Mar del Plata, 
              Argentina.  Sucrose is the major product of photosynthesis,  and the main form
              of carbon translocation, as well as the  principal form of carbohydrate storage
              in  plant cells. In  brief, the growth, vigor and productivity of plants are 
              directly dependent on an effective sucrose metabolic system.  The advent of 
              new techniques and instrumentation since the  discovery of the enzymes of
              sucrose metabolism in 1955 has  brought about an outburst of information in
              every aspect of  sucrose metabolism in plants.    The present symposium was
              organized in response to the  growing  need to assemble the  enormous amount of
              relevant basic data on all aspects of  sucrose metabolism, in order to
              construct a comprehensive  and integrated view of this system in plants.  The 
              discussions and formulations of the symposium will assist in  setting the
              direction for the future  of  sucrose research,  and will allow U.S. and
              Argentine scientists to  plan future  collaborations, and will provide a
              rewarding international  experience to the U.S. graduate students.  Several of
              the  U.S. scientists attending are leaders in the field, which is  also an
              extremely strong area of research in Argentina.  In  fact, the symposium is
              held in commemoration of the 40th  anniversary of the discovery of the enzymes
              of sucrose  metabolism in the laboratory of Dr. Leloir (the same  laboratory
              which is co-hosting the meeting in  Argentina),  who received the Nobel Prize
              for this discovery.  It is  expected that a follow up symposium will be held in
              the  U.S.A.  ***
