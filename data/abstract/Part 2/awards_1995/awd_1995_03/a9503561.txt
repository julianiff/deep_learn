Abstract    :
              OCE-9503561    This project will conduct an off-axis geophysical survey out to 
              about 28 million year old crust on the eastern flank of the Mid-  Atlantic
              Ridge near 26 degrees north.  The survey will cover crust  that is conjugate to
              a similar, detailed survey that already has  been completed on the west flank. 
              Together, the conjugate data  sets will provide a uniquely detailed and
              long-term record of ocean  crustal structure that will provide fundamental new
              insights into  the origin, structure, and evolution of slowly spreading ocean 
              crust.
