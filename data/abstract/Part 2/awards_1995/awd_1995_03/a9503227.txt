Abstract    :
              9503227  Yarmush  This project is on research to study the use of hydrostatic 
              pressure as a mild and effective means of dissociating  antigen-antibody
              complexes, thus providing a rational basis for  the design of strategies which
              utilize this pressure sensitivity  in separation and/or sensing applications. 
              The proposed studies  include three aspects: (1) fundamental solution-phase 
              thermodynamic and kinetic characterization of the  pressure-induced phenomena
              for a panel of antibodies using high  pressure fluorescence spectroscopy; (2)
              protein engineering  studies directed at understanding the molecular mechanisms
               mediating pressure effects; and (3) thermodynamic, kinetic and  pressure
              cycling studies with immobilized antibodies to develop  operational strategies
              for practical pressure elution on a large  scale.  In addition to providing the
              rational framework for the  development of strategies for engineering and
              utilizing pressure  sensitive antibodies, this research could also result in
              advances  in the fundamental understanding of pressure effects on protein 
              structure and function.  ***
