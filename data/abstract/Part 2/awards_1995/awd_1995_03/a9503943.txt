Abstract    :
                    9503943  Doherty  The long range objectives of this program are to develop
              a deeper  understanding of the evolution of the microstructure in metallic 
              alloys during processing.  Such understanding will provide  important clues for
              developing new alloys and processing methods  with improved properties.  The
              specific objective of this project  is to develop a better understanding of the
              thermo-mechanical  deformation behavior of a class of metals typified by
              Multiphase  (MP) Alloys of which MP35N (35 % Co, 35 % Ni, 10 % Mo, 20 % Cr)  is
              an example.  This materials has high strength, high ductility,  high fracture
              toughness, high corrosion resistance, and retains  its room temperature
              strength to 6000C.  ***
