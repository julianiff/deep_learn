Abstract    :
              9503536  Leaman  In this project, the PIs will continue and complete the
              analysis of  these data an array of subsurface drifting floats which were 
              deployed for several years in different components of the Deep  Western
              Boundary Current east of Abaco Island in the Bahamas.  The  motivation for this
              experiment arose from previous observations  that high-velocity cores are not
              coincident with high (or low)  concentrations of tracers (particularly freons).
               Focus will be on  hypothesized reasons for this discrepancy, particularly on 
              recirculation gyres and topographic effects.  ***
