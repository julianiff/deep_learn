Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry   Division,
              Prof. Bruce S. Hudson of the University of Oregon will continue   and extend a
              series of investigations on the ultravilolet resonance Raman   spectroscopy of
              excited electronic states and dynamics of small   polyatomic molecules.   Both
              gas and liquid phase systems will be   investigated.  New investigations will
              be conducted on molecules in   solution.  These include  studies of  structural
              solvation effects on   hydrogen bonding and dielectric properties, static and
              dynamic   modifications attributed to fluctional solvent effects, and
              excitation   driven solvent effects.  The feasibility of using liquid xenon,
              sulphur   hexafluoride, and carbon tetrafluoride as solvents will also be  
              investigated.  Resonance Raman spectroscopy provides a `snapshot` view of the
              very early   time dynamics of atomic motions following electronic excitation. 
              This   instantaneous response is of interest from the point of view  of  
              molecular structure theory.  The overall goal of these studies is to test   and
              refine theoretical descriptions of excited electronic states.
