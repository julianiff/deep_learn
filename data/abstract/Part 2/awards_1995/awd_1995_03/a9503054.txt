Abstract    :
              9503054  Williams    This grant provides $33,287 as one-half support for
              upgrades to  the Cameca SX-50 electron microprobe facility at the University 
              of Massachusetts.  This facility has become an essential research  and teaching
              tool for a diverse group of researchers from western  New England.  One
              particular focus of many studies is the  integration of high-resolution
              compositional mapping (x-ray  mapping) with high-precision quantitative
              analysis.  In the five  years since the microprobe was installed, Cameca has
              made several  improvements to the hardware and software of the SX-50, and the 
              new SX-100, that significantly improve the quality and efficiency  of the
              instrument.  Specifically, upgrades will be made to four  essential subsystems
              of the SX-50: (1) autofocusing (2) fast  image acquisition, (3) frame
              buffering, and (4) replacement of a  SUN 3 computer with a SPARC 5.  The first
              two items will allow  users to collect high-resolution qualitative and
              quantitative  data much more quickly and efficiently.  Frame buffering offers a
               much improved method for viewing electron images and for  integrating these
              images with other compositional or optical data  sets.  The upgraded computer
              is required for running the new and  dramatically improved version of the
              Cameca software.  The  proposed upgrades are essential for the laboratory to
              remain a  state-of-the-art research facility and to keep its position as  one
              cornerstone of the analytical community of western New  England.    ***
