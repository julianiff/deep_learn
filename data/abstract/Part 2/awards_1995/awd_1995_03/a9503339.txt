Abstract    :
              Binary Decision Diagrams (BDD's) have found widespread use in   synthesis,
              formal verification and testing of digital circuits.   This success in the EDA
              research area has spawned research efforts  on a number of fronts, including
              theoretical studies of algorithms  and complexity, applications to such areas
              as artificial  intelligence and logic programming, and extensions beyond
              Boolean  functions to represent matrices, Markov systems, and multi-variate 
              polynomials.  This workshop (February 13-17, 1995) is the first  ever held
              specifically on this important technology.
