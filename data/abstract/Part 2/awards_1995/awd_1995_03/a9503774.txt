Abstract    :
              9503774  Mecartney    The University of California at Irvine (UCI) will acquire
              a field  emission gun  scanning electron microscope (FEG-SEM) with energy 
              dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) capabilities, dedicated to support 
              interdisciplinary materials research in engineering and science.  Participating
              faculty from the Departments of Chemical and  Biochemical  Engineering,
              Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering,  Electrical and Computer Engineering, and
              Chemistry have joined  together and agreed that this instrument is the number
              one  priority for these faculty involved in the synthesis and  characterization
              of materials.  The equipment will be used  primarily for the education of
              graduate students in the  interdisciplinary Materials Science & Engineering
              graduate program  and for research projects focusing on (1) the fabrication of 
              nanocrystalline alloys (2) composite materials synthesis and  deformation (3)
              chemical synthesis mf new materials (4) materials  issues in microelectronic
              devices and (5) superplasticity.  The  acquisition of this analytical FEG-SEM
              is an essential next step  in building the microstructural characterization of
              materials  facility at UCI which currently contains state-of-the-art 
              analytical TEM and XRD instrumentation.  %%%
