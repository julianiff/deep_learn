Abstract    :
              DMS-9503114 Santosa  Our approach is to pose the imaging problem  as an
              optimization problem with constraints and penalty terms.  The constraints would
              represent a priori information, while the  penalty terms are added to achieve
              certain quality in the image.  One of the main difficulties in this approach is
              development of  specialized optimization methods. The optimization methods must
               be capable of (1) solving large problems, (2) dealing with  constraints, (3)
              dealing with nondifferentiability of the cost  function. To this end, we will
              explore the use of interior point  methods. While this imaging technique has
              several attractive  features such as low-cost and portability, it suffers from
              the  ability to resolve fine features in the image. We propose to  overcome
              this difficulty by incorporating known side information  as well as applying
              enhancement techniques in the reconstruction  process.   This research concerns
              the use of recent techniques in  image enhancement and computer vision in
              overcoming the blurring  effects of an imaging method known as electrical
              impedance  tomography. Electrical impedance tomography is a technique for 
              imaging the interior of a specimen using DC electrical  measurements collected
              on the boundary of the specimen. It has  found use in clinical applications,
              geophysical prospecting, and  nondestructive evaluations. It is anticipated
              that we will be  able to develop software, that when used with electrical 
              impedance tomographic devices, would deliver images with high  resolution.
