Abstract    :
              This award supports the research of Professor D. Abramovich in the field of
              algebraic geometry. Abramovich will continue his study of the Gieseker-Morrison
              compactification of the moduli space of vector bundles of rank 2 on semistable
              curves, with the goals of identifying the vector bundles corresponding to
              points on the boundary, extending the construction to higher ranks and
              comparing with other compactifications. He will also continue his work on
              Lang's conjecture in characteristic p, and will study integral and torsion
              points on elliptic curves and integral points on algebraic stacks.    Algebraic
              geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics. In the past ten
              years, it has blossomed to the point where it has solved problems that have
              stood for centuries. Originally, it treated figures in the plane defined by the
              simplest of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the field utilizes methods
              not only from algebra, but also from analysis and topology; conversely, it is
              extensively used in those fields. Moreover, it has proved itself useful in
              fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography,
              coding theory and robotics.
