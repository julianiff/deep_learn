Abstract    :
              9503399  Ratner    This U.S.-Venezuela Cooperative Science Program award will 
              fund a collaboration between Dr. Mark A. Ratner,  Northwestern University,
              Evanston, and Dr. Vadimiro Mujica,  Universidad Central de Venezuela, on
              theoretical approaches  to interfacial electron transfers.  The research will
              be on  formal and numerical investigations of the scanning  tunneling
              microscope (STM) currents in systems comprising  metal substrate, adsorbed
              molecule, and STM tip.  The  approach considers the time-dependent behavior of
              the  system, with the electron moving from metal through molecule  to tip.  The
              study will include electro/vibration  interactions, electron/electron
              repulsion, and complex  molecular geometry coupling, and will focus on the
              overall  dynamics of the process, and the calculation of the  conductance and
              its variations.    The research is timely and  important, both from the 
              fundamental knowledge and the technological point of view.  The expertise and
              resources of the collaborators are  complementary.  Studies will be carried out
              with  sufficiently realistic molecular detail allowing meaningful  comparison
              with experimental data, thus  providing valuable  perspectives about the
              interrelationship of conductance,  conductivity, and super-exchange-mediated
              donor-acceptance.    ***
