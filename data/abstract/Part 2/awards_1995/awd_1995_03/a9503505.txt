Abstract    :
              9503505  Taylor    Understanding the processes that lead to continental
              extension and  crustal failure, and subsequent sea-floor spreading are primary 
              questions being addressed by the marine geological community. The  present
              project is examining these processes in the Woodlark Basin  in the western
              Pacific. Primary data for this study was collected  on a field program under
              previous support and includes side-scan  data, detailed bathymetry, seismic
              reflection, gravity and magnetic  measurements. Initial analyses of these data
              are highly promising.  The present award will support completion of analyses,
              publication,  and student theses. These additional analyses will also provide 
              fundamental data for planning drilling in the region by the Ocean  Drilling
              Program.
