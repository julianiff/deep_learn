Abstract    :
              9503916  Gee       Gee, in collaboration Kent, will measure the magnetization 
              of 500 samples of basalt from the Ocean Drilling Program and Deep  Sea Drilling
              Project.  They will also measure the magnetite  chemistry on 100 samples by
              electron microprobe.  The combined  data will be used to evaluate several
              hypotheses about the  variation of the intensity of magnetization of the ocean
              crust  with the age of the crust.  This variation may be related to  magnetite
              originally present in the basalts or it may be the  result of alteration.  This
              has been a long-standing enigma and  these researchers may have found the
              solution.  ***
