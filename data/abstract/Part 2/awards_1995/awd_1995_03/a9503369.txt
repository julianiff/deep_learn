Abstract    :
                  9503369  Hanagan  Excessive floor vibrations are not uncommon in many types
              of  building structures.  Previous research conducted at Virginia  Polytechnic
              Institute & State University has utilized active  control to improve the
              dynamic characteristics of an objectional  floor system.  In this research,
              control forces were imparted on  the structure, by means of an electromagnetic
              proof-mass actuator.   A collocated velocity feedback algorithm with a simple
              command  limiter was implemented digitally.  Due to the significant 
              improvements that were observed, continued research is planned for  this
              solution for repairing floor systems will unacceptable levels  of occupant
              induced floor vibrations.     Three main objectives:    1.  Improved Actuators
              and Algorithms for Floor Vibration Control.    2.  Simulation of Floor Behavior
              Subject to Occupant Activities.    3.  Experimental Implementation of Active
              Control Using Multiple         Actuators.
