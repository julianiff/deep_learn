Abstract    :
              9503370  Balas  The project will examine two approaches to control design  for
              structures subjected to environmental as well as small-  to-moderate dynamic
              loads.  The first approach is to use  "hard-bounds" or norms to describe the
              possible models for a  structure and its corresponding set of possible
              prediction  errors with a goal of maximizing the robust performance of  the
              controller for a given set of possible excitations.  In  the second approach
              probability distributions are placed  over the sets of possible models as well
              as over the  possible excitations.  This probable-model approach to  control
              design introduces an extra dimension to the first  approach that will yield
              additional information about the  possible performance of the controller, such
              as the  probability of achieving various levels of performance.  Experimental
              data will be used to update and refine the  control design models to improve
              the close-loop performance.  The use of shape memory alloy actuators also will
              be  investigated.  Improvements in active and passive structural  control can
              save lives and reduce structural damage and  economic losses.  ***
