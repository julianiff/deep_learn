Abstract    :
              9503045  Leckband  This project is on research to elucidate the fundamental 
              interactions governing cell attachment to substrata and to other  cells by
              direct measurements of the fundamental forces and  mechanisms controlling these
              events.  This includes three  objectives: (1) to investigate the role of
              glycolipids in  protein-mediated cell adhesion; (2) to investigate the impact
              of  glycosphingolipid interactions on cell adhesion; and (3) to  develop a
              novel instrument for simultaneous spectral and force  measurements for
              approaching surfaces.  In addition to this  research activity, the Principal
              Investigator (PI) will enhance  education by establishing two new courses in
              biosensors and in  colloids, and by introducing computer-aided instructional
              tools  into the transport series.  ***
