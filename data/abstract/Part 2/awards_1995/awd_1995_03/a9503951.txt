Abstract    :
              9503951  Kempf    This award supports a 14 month postdoctoral fellowship  for
              Dr. Carl Kempf.  This fellowship opportunity will  enable Dr. Kempf to
              undertake a collaborative research  effort with Dr. Tadao Inomata of NSK, Ltd. 
              The  investigators intend to develop and implement control  algorithms for high
              speed, high precision mechanical  systems.  Objectives include development of 
              compensators for systems utilizing variable-reluctance,  direct-drive electric
              motors that will reduce step and  settle times, increase tracking accuracy, and
              reduce  the effects of friction.  Advanced power amplifiers and  drive
              electronics will also be investigated.  Results  of this research will be
              applied to high speed,  automated wire-bonding equipment and will be relevant 
              for similar devices employed in precision  manufacturing.    As a postdoctoral
              fellow, Dr. Kempf will have the  opportunity to become familiar with research
              techniques and  equipment at NSF, Ltd. while contributing to the overall 
              research effort.  Therefore, this proposal fulfills the  objectives of the
              Program in its exchange and transfer of  scientific knowledge through an
              international collaboration.  ***
