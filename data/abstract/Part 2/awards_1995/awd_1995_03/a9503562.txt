Abstract    :
              9503562  MARTIN    Benthic fluxes and pore water concentrations of carbon and
              related  solutes will be determined on a depth transect of the continental 
              margin in the northwest Atlantic ocean. The proposed study area is  the depth
              interval from 100-2000m at 71 W, a region that is  physically representative of
              much of the margin.  A complete depth  transect in this region will
              significantly advance our ability to  incorporate margin processes in
              quantitative models of global  chemical cycles.  The proposed measurements will
              differ from  previous flux determinations on margins in several respects.  (1) 
              Flux chamber deployments will be 4 days long, 2-3 times longer than  most
              deployments in rapidly accumulating, high-flux sediments. This  increased
              length will define several processes important in  sediments of this type.  In
              situ measurements will be made of  solute transport by macroninfaunal
              irrigation in offshore margin  sediments.  Significant improvements in the
              signal-to-noise ratio  in alkalinity, dell-13C (totalCO2), and dissolved
              organic carbon  fluxes will be achieved thus providing new information on the 
              contributions of DOC and above-saturation horizon dissolution of  CaCO3 to the
              benthic carbon cycle. (2) Flux experiments will be  carried out in duplicate at
              each of 8 sites, and will be  accompanied by extensive, in situ microelectrode
              profiling and both  high-resolution and "standard" pore water sampling.  Flux
              chamber  and coring operations will be carried out via submersible, allowing 
              the combination of measurements to be made in a relatively small,  visually
              homogeneous area.  The number an combination of  measurements will allow
              improved evaluation of intra-site  variability over what has been possible in
              past experiments,  increasing confidence in trends of flux vs. water column
              depth.   (3) At shallower sites (100-1000m), the increased length of flux 
              chamber deployments would lead to extensive depletion of O2 in  chamber water. 
              To counteract this effect (with its potentia l  undesirable consequences are
              designed to maintain the O2 in  chambers are designed to maintain the O2 level
              close to that of  ambient bottom water.
