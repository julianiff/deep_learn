Abstract    :
              9503301  Farhat  The accurate prediction of aeroelastic phenomena is essential
              to the design of safe high performance aircraft.  This prediction requires
              solving simultaneously the appropriately coupled fluid and structural equations
              of motion.  Therefore, numerical aeroelastic simulations are in general
              resource intensive. We propose to develop high performance methodologies for
              the parallel simulation of three-dimensional transient aeroelastic problems on
              advanced homogenous and heterogeneous hardware architectures. More
              specifically, we intend to develop mixed partitioning procedures for the
              parallel space and time integration of the governing coupled nonlinear partial
              differential equations, and investigate their merits in terms of accuracy,
              stability, heterogeneous computing, I/O transfers, subcycling, and parallel
              processing.  This research is multidisciplinary and includes four components:
              computational structural mechanics, computational fluid dynamics, applied
              mathematics and numerical analysis and, computer sciences and parallel
              processing.  The first two components involve the development of discrete
              mathematical models based on finite elements and finite volumes for
              representing aerospace structures as assemblies of beams, plates, and shells,
              and modeling high speed flows around them.  The third component addresses the
              design of staggered and efficient time-integrators for advancing the solution
              of the governing coupled semi-discrete equations.  The last research component
              aims at exploiting the capabilities of homogeneous and heterogeneous parallel
              systems to significantly reduce the overall simulation time of these very
              compute-intensive engineering applications.
