Abstract    :
              9503818  Pillsbury  In this project, the PIs will measure near-bottom velocities
              across  the Argentine continental slope near 42   deg S. during 1996 and 1997. 
              Nine moorings at nine different  depths, ranging from 200m to 5200m will   be
              deployed, using a newly-developed expendable vector-averaging  current meter,
              with temperature and   pressure sensors at a height of 50m from the bottom on
              each  mooring.  Data will be retrieved by an   ARGOS transmitter released after
              one year's deployment.  A second  set of instruments will be deployed   after
              the first year.  Ship support will be provided by Dr. A.  Piola and the
              Argentine Naval Hydrographic   Service, and hydrographic surveys will be
              conducted during each  deployment cruise. This is a   collaborative study, and
              in this award the PI, who has been the  primary PI involved in the development
              of   the expendable current meters will have primary responsibility for 
              fabricating and deploying the   expendable current meters and mooring
