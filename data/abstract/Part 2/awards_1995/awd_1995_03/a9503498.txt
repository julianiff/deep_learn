Abstract    :
                 This project focuses on a number of   topics related to on-line problems. 
              On-line algorithms work with only partial   information about the input data. 
              At each time step, such an algorithm    receives one unit of data, and has to
              produce partial results    before seeing the remaining data.  On-line
              competitive algorithms    are algorithms which return a solution that is not
              worse  than a  constant times the optimal one.  One of the goals is to solve
              the  k-server problem.  An optimal  algorithm for k servers has already been 
              developed:  the  algorithm is 2-competitive for two servers.  A closed form 
              function, which is a good candidate for the potential function  for k = 3, is 
              examined.    A second goal is to attack a number of other on-line problems for 
              which optimal competitiveness in unknown, including:  randomized  list update, 
              multi-processor scheduling, and page migration; and  to develop a general
              theory  of on-line problems solutions.    A third goal is to show hoe the
              techniques,  developed for the  solution of the k-server problem can be applied
              to other  on-line  problems.  In particular, applications of work functions, 
              forgiveness  and stable distributions to general on-line problems  are
              developed. Note:  This is a companion award to CCR-9503441 (PI: Larmore) of
