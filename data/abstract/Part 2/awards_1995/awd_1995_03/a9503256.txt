Abstract    :
              9503256  Taylor    This project will collaborate with French scientists to 
              drill coral terraces in the western tropical  Pacific. Three  sites will span
              the center and southern margins of the  Western Pacific Warm Pool, and will be
              drilled to about  30,000 yr BP.  Samples will be analyzed for stable isotopes, 
              U, Sr and radiocarbon.  The project will address two  objectives; (1) a record
              of warm pool thermal stability at  several scales of climate change ( with
              implications for  circum-Pacific climate) and (2) calibration of the 
              radiocarbon age scale (relevant to all science which depends  on radiocarbon
              dating).
