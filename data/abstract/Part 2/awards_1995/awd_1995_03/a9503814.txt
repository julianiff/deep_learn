Abstract    :
              9503814  Fertig    The PI will investigate theoretically two-dimensional 
              electron systems, specifically the Wigner crystal and  layered systems in the
              quantum Hall regime.  The effects of  a disorder potential on the static and
              dynamic properties of  classical crystals, as well as crystals in very strong 
              magnetic fields, will be studied, including correlation  functions in the
              ground state, noise spectra, and AC  conductivity.  He will also theoretically
              study  photoluminescence (an experimental probe), quantum effects,  double
              layer quantum Hall systems, excited states, and  impurity effects.  %%%  The PI
              will conduct theoretical research on two-dimensional  electron systems, as
              found on the surface of helium and in  semiconducting systems in strong
              magnetic fields.  Such  systems are of special interest because they cannot be 
              completely explained by traditional theoretical methods.  This PI plays an
              important part in contributing to the new  methods that must be developed to
              understand such systems.  He is known for the breadth of his research and the
              variety  of methods he uses.  Parts of his work will be especially  helpful in
              interpreting several recent experiments on these  systems.  ***
