Abstract    :
              Since the discovery in 1953 of the double helix by Watson  and Crick, a great
              deal of effort has gone into the  determination of RNA, DNA, and protein
              sequences.  Today,  over 150 million letters of DNA sequence have been 
              determined in segments averaging 1000  in length from a  large variety of
              organisms.  This impetus is typified by the  human genome project which has
              received a great deal of  press and discussion.    This information explosion
              is stimulating a natural  symbiosis between molecular biology and computer
              science.  New computational methods are required to obtain, organize,  compare
              and interpret the vast amounts of macromolecular  sequence information now
              being collected.  Efforts in this  direction are being made in many parts of
              the world; there  is a continuing need for a comprehensive international 
              conference to bring together leading researchers who use a  variety of
              disparate approaches and techniques.  The  Dagstuhl seminar on molecular
              bioinformatics is designed to  address this continuing need.  The first
              Dagstuhl Seminar on  molecular bioinformatics was held.  The second seminar
              will  be held July 10-14, 1995.
