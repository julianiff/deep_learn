Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the problem of power dissipation, primarily  on the
              fundamental issues of what are the real sources of power  dissipation in CMOS
              microprocessors, and what can be done to  minimize it at a more global level. 
              The goal is development and  demonstration of techniques that would support
              Power-efficient  Instruction Set Architectures (PISA).  For this, there are
              four  major tasks:    1.     Developing technology independ models and metrics
              for power         dissipation in CMOS logic.    2.     Analyzing current day
              designs to benchmark the stat of the art         and to indentify processor
              subsystems that are potential power         hogs.    3.     Development of new
              techniques that will reduce these metrics.    4.     Demonstration of these
              techniques in a prototype CMOS PISA CPU         chip.    These new techniqujes
              will indlude gate disign level approaches,  but will focus primarily on
              organizaitonal and instruction set  architectural appropaches that inherently
              have a lower power  requirement.  The end goal of this research is to develop a
              deeper  scientific understanding of the relationship between power and 
              computation, and develop techniques that minimize the ratio of the  two in ways
              that can broadly impact the continuing evolution of  VLSI technology and its
              successful use in computing.
