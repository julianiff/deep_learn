Abstract    :
              9503481  Kevrekidis    This Americas Program award will support a collaborative 
              research project between Dr. Yannis Kevrekidis, Princeton  University, and Dr.
              Ramiro Rico-Martinez,  Instituto  Tecnologico de Celaya, Mexico,  on  the
              long-term dynamical  properties of neural network-based models .  They will
              study  the qualitative properties of the long-term predictions of  the
              constructed models and propose to explore another  intrinsic model feature ,
              noninvertibility, to clarify its  role in the loss of model predictive
              capability and its  impact in adaptive identification and control applications.
               In addition, they plan to develop, implement, and test new  approaches , and
              study the properties of phase-space  reconstruction procedures.   Special
              emphasis will be placed  on the development  of computer tools for the parallel
               implementation and analysis of the models.    The proposed research will
              benefit from the combined skills  of  Dr. Kevrekidis on non-linear dynamics,
              and Dr. Rico-  Martinez in neural networks.  ***
