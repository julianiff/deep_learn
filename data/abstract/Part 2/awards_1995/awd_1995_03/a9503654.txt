Abstract    :
              9503654  Fairall    Research supported by this grant is under the auspices of
              the  Arctic Systems Science (ARCSS) Global    Change Research Program and  is
              jointly sponsored by the Division of Ocean Sciences and the  Office of Polar
              Programs.  Work to be performed represents  preliminary steps towards a major
              5-year research project named  SHEBA, which is envisioned to study the heat
              budget of the Arctic  Ocean and its impact on global change.  The primary goals
              of SHEBA  are: (1) to develop, test and implement models of arctic  
              ocean-atmosphere-ice processes that demonstrably improve  simulations of the
              present day arctic climate, including its  variability, using General
              Circulation Models (GCMs), and (2) to  improve the interpretation of satellite
              remote sensing data in the  Arctic for analysis of the arctic climate system
              and provide  reliable data for model input, model validation and climate
              monitoring.     This work will develop, construct, and prepare for deployment
              two  new instruments that will be built  specifically for autonomous  operation
              at the main SHEBA ice camp.  These are a wind profiler  to provide wind and
              temperature profiles continuously to 2.5 km  altitude; and a lidar for cloud
              and aerosol  monitoring which will  measure optical depth and provide ice/water
              determinations.  The  instruments will be designed to optimize performance
              under Arctic  conditions.  This instrumentation will be useful in addressing an
               identified critical issue of SHEBA, the sea arctic cloud- radiation feedback
              mechanism.
