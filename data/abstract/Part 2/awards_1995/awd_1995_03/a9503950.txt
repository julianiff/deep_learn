Abstract    :
              9503950  Vaughan    This award supports a three-month postdoctoral  fellowship
              for Dr. Brian Vaughan of the California  Institute of Technology.  This
              fellowship opportunity  will enable Dr. Vaughan to begin a collaborative 
              research effort with Dr. Fumiyoshi Makino of the  Institute of Space and
              Astronautical Science (ISAS.)  The investigators propose to perform spectral
              and  timing analyses of X-ray bursts using Japanese  satellites.  The proposed
              project provides a means to  "unlock" data collected from two Japanese
              satellites  and the three-month visit by Vaughan will help him to  establish a
              personal and professional link with a  leading researcher in Japan.    As a
              postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Vaughan will have the  opportunity to become familiar
              with research techniques and  equipment at ISAS while contributing to the
              overall research  effort.  Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of 
              the Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific  knowledge through an
              international collaboration.  ***
