Abstract    :
              Research supported by this grant is under the auspices of the Arctic Systems
              Science (ARCSS) Global Change Research Program and is jointly sponsored by the
              Division of Ocean Sciences and the Office of Polar Programs.  Work to be
              performed represents preliminary steps towards a major 5-year research project
              named SHEBA, which is envisioned to study the heat budget of the Arctic Ocean
              and its impact on global change.  The primary goals of SHEBA are: (1) to
              develop, test and implement models of arctic ocean-atmosphere-ice processes
              that demonstrably improve simulations of the present day arctic climate,
              including its variability, using General Circulation Models (GCMs), and (2) to
              improve the interpretation of satellite remote sensing data in the Arctic for
              analysis of the arctic climate system and provide reliable data for model
              input, model validation and climate monitoring. This project will determine
              which physical parameters have the greatest impact on the adsorption of heat by
              the ice and ocean in areas where melt ponds and leads in the pack ice are
              common.  This information is important because present climate models cannot
              account for the effect of greater heat absorption by leads and melt  ponds on
              the mass balance of pack ice in the summer.  The results will lead to better
              climate models to simulate the interaction of climate and sea ice in the
              Arctic.
