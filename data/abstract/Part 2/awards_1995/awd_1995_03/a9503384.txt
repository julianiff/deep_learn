Abstract    :
              9503384  Fuller       The objective of this proposal is to examine several 
              outstanding issues in the fundamental nuclear, particle and  neutrino physics
              of stellar collapse, the supernova  phenomenon, and the early universe.  In
              particular,  continued investigations of weak interaction physics  associated
              with the supernova problem are proposed.  in  another project, primordial
              nucleosynthesis in the context  of large mass-scale entropy fluctuations will
              be examined  and utilized to probe the physics of the early universe.  ***
