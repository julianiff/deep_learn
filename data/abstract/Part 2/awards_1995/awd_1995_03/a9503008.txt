Abstract    :
              9503008  Suki  The research proposed in this application is concerned with 
              exploring fundamental phenomena in physiological tree structures  that are
              known to exist in many different guises in physiological  systems.  Closing and
              opening phenomena are abundant in  physiological tree structures, with examples
              including the  respiratory tree or different parts of the circulatory system. 
              This project proposes to: 1) develop experimental techniques to  measure
              spatial correlations on the lung surface during opening,  2) monitor the
              opening process in response to various stimuli, 3)  develop new models of how
              avalanches propagate in tree  structures, 4) introduce novel statistical
              approaches to reveal  power law distributions and long-range correlations and
              apply  them to measured and simulated data, 5) provide, through  intensive
              simulations, substantial new insight into a variety of  physiological phenomena
              encountered in the respiratory and  circulatory trees.  A long term goal is to
              understand how the  high level of organization implied by the power law
              distributions  and long-range correlations govern the statistical and 
              physiological behavior of closing and opening process in tree  structures that
              are fundamental to their natural function.    The work carried out as described
              is expected to produce  fundamental knowledge in the field of physiological
              modeling, and  lead to new discoveries.  ***
