Abstract    :
              9503273  Ratiu     The proposed research lies in the area of dynamical systems
              and geometric mechanics. Specifically, the following four topics are proposed:
              convexity and invariants, approximation in Hamiltonian dynamics, symmetry and
              bifurcations, and conserving numerical algorithms on nonlinear manifolds.    
              The proposed research is in part motivated by large scale fluid flow problems
              arising in ocean dynamics. For example, the Euler equations in thin domains can
              be used to model shallow water waves. Also, numerical simulations of
              conservative systems may lead to a more accurate modeling of various weather
              phenomena.
