Abstract    :
              9503130  Evans       This project will analyze magnetometric resistivity data 
              collected on the Juan de Fuca Ridge, in order to determine the  best algorithms
              for processing such data and to assess its  potential as a remote-sensing
              technique for 3D mapping of the  thickness and structure of oceanic crust.  ***
