Abstract    :
              9503755  Taylor    This U.S.-Argentina Collaborative Research grant will 
              support the research of Alan Taylor, National Bureau of  Economic Research to
              work with Gerardo Della Paolera,  Universidad Di Tella in the preparation of a
              new economic  history of Argentina for the interwar period, with  particular
              attention to the effects of the Great Depression.  Existing economic works of
              this scope lack quantitative  support and have not used the modern cliometric
              techniques.  This project will make use of more and better data than 
              previously used as well as apply a number of theoretical and  econometric
              techniques to provide a sounder basis for the  analysis of the origins,
              experience, and long-run impact of  the era in question.    There is great
              potential for new insights stemming from the  proposed work, since there have
              been no studies of the  Argentine economy using the modern methods proposed. 
              Although there are theories about why the economically  strong and growing
              Argentina of the early 20th century  became and remained a faltering economy
              after the Great  Depression, they do not have the quantitative and analytic 
              support which modern techniques can offer.  Results of the  proposed study can
              shed light on the failure of some  resource-rich developing countries to
              achieve sustained  economic growth.  ***
