Abstract    :
              9503178  Jech    This proposal supports the collaboration of Dr. Thomas Jech,
              Department  of Mathematics, the Pennsylvania State University and three 
              mathematicians from the Nagoya University: Drs. Yuzura Kakuda, Kanji  Namba,
              and Shizuo Kamo. Project funding will enable Dr. Jech to spend  three months in
              Japan, resident at the University of Nagoya, in order  to study set theory and
              applications of set theory in algebra. The  major topics of research will
              include left-distributive algebras,  elementary embeddings, stationary sets,
              the theory of large cardinals,  applications of forcing, the singular cardinals
              problem and the theory  of possible cofinalities, countably complete filters
              and ideals,  infinitary combinatorics, and problems in Boolean algebras.   
              This proposal brings together research scientists from two countries  working
              in the area of modern set theory. The U. S. scientist will have  the
              opportunity to become familiar with research techniques and  facilities at the
              University of Nagoya while contributing to the  overall research effort.
              Therefore, this proposal fulfills the  objectives of the Program in its
              exchange and transfer of scientific  knowledge through an international
              collaboration.  * *  *
