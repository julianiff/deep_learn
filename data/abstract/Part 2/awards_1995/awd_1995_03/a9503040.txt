Abstract    :
              9503040  Garvine  In this project, the PI will continue his studies of the
              discharge  of water from estuaries into shallow water over the continental 
              shelf. A 3-Dimensional model developed by Blumberg and Mellor will  be used to
              study generic processes in an idealized setting.   Following this, a wide range
              of specific processes will be studied  in the setting of the Delaware Coastal
              Current, and the results  would be compared with ongoing field observations,
              those of both  the PI and others.  ***
