Abstract    :
              9503079  Edwards  This is an award to provide the support this investigator 
              requested in response to NSF 94-101, the National Science  Foundation Faculty
              Early Career Development (CAREER) Program  which has the intent of encouraging
              the early development of  academic faculty as educators and researchers.  The
              research this  investigator plans to conduct is directed toward improving our 
              fundamental understanding of factors that result in corrosive  behavior of
              materials used in distribution systems for water.  The investigator's education
              plan involves exploring changes in  basic course structure that include active
              learning, development  of supportive learning environments in the classroom and
               implementation of a reward structure that encourages development  of
              non-traditional target skills such as teamwork, class  motivation and interest
              in learning outside the classroom.    Materials used in constructing water
              distribution systems are  subject to corrosion over long periods of time which
              reduces the  effective life of the system's components and has a potentially 
              degrading effect on the quality of water delivered to users  through the
              distribution system.  Procedures to adequately  determine the effect of
              corrosion can be useful in the improving  the engineering design of water
              distribution systems.  The  teaching plan this investigator plans to pursue
              seeks to  implement and evaluate new approaches to learning in the 
              undergraduate engineering classroom environment that will improve  the way in
              which undergraduate engineering courses are taught.  ***
