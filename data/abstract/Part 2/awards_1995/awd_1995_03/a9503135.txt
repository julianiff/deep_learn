Abstract    :
                  The project will test a hypothesis as to the role of North Atlantic  Deep
              Water in ititiating glaciation via transport of heat between  northern and
              southern hemispheres.  The hypothesis is derived from  limited data with
              several weaknesses.  This project will use long  sediment records collected
              from the Ceara Rise, which intersects  the flow paths of the relevant water
              masses, measuring the stable  carbon and oxygen isotopes in benthic
              foraminifera over a 1 million  year interval.
