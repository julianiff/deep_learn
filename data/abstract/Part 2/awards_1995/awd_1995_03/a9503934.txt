Abstract    :
              9503934  Motta    This U.S.-Brazil Collaborative Research grant will support 
              the research of Livio Amaral of Brazil (Universidade Federal  do Rio Grande do
              Sul) and Arthur Motta of the U.S.  (Pennsylvania State University, University
              Park) in  cooperation with Nghi Lam of Argonne National Laboratories  and Gary
              Catchen of Penn State to study the defect  energetics and configurations of
              point defects in the  intermetallic compounds of the Zr-Fe-* system.  Three 
              methods will be used in the study: Moessbauer spectroscopy,  atomistic
              simulation of defects, and charged particle  irradiation.  The mix of skills
              and equipment will uniquely  support these methods.    Livio Amaral is an
              experimental physicist with published  work on iron-zirconium compounds, while
              Arthur Motta has  done irradiation studies of related compounds--one of the 
              methods proposed.  The two other U.S. collaborators bring  relevant skills and
              equipment to the project as well. The  cooperation established by the proposed
              activities should  lead to in-depth scientific knowledge made possible by the 
              assembled expertise of the participants.  ***
