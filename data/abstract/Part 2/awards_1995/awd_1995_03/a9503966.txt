Abstract    :
              9503966  Gannon     The focus of this work is to apply the concept of program
              archetypes to the design of an Internet based electronic textbook on parallel
              programming techniques.  An archetype is an abstraction that captures the
              common structural, computation, and communication features of a set of
              algorithms.  This concept, when embedded in an interactive hypertext
              environment, provides a new approach to teaching about parallel programming as
              well as a software engineering foundation for deriving new parallel programs
              from existing applications.    The archetypes work will be expanded to include
              new areas of application study, including sparse matrix computation in adaptive
              finite element problems as well as parallel algorithms in computational
              cosmology.  A second aspect of this project is to help integrate the work of
              these application scientists and of the Indiana MetaText research team that is
              building electronic textbook software.  The goal is to build a MetaText
              archetype encyclopedia for parallel programming.  ***
