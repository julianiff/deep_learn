Abstract    :
                    9503396  Kyriadides  This award is part of a combined
              theoretical-experimental program  to study shape memory alloys, a class of
              materials that have  qualities of "memory" and "Trainability".  This program
              will  involve cyclic and biaxial loads and temperatures from -70 to 1500  C as
              well as higher strain rates.  The main goals of the research  are to study the
              dependence on the transformation stress, and the  resistance of martenqite
              detwinning to multiaxial states of stress.   Special emphasis will be given to
              biaxial states of stress where  inhomogeneous deformations, which are
              inherently associated with  the instability, occur.  ***
