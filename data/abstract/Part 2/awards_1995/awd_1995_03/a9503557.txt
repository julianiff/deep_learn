Abstract    :
              9503557  Corliss       This project will use chemistry of stable isotopes and
              trace  metals in pore waters and in shells of benthic foraminifera to  examine
              the effects of (1) organic matter and 92) metal  remobilization upon the
              biogeochemical record in the shells.  Carbon isotopes and trace metals (Cd,Ba)
              are widely used as  tracers of past ocean production and deep water
              circulation; the  Pis have preliminary evidence that both are affected by early
               diagenesis.  The project will examine this effect in a range of  environments
              differing in surface water production (hence, carbon  flux to the sediment) and
              in sediment oxidation state.  ***
