Abstract    :
              9503009  Gruner  This project investigates the surface electrodynamic response
              of  metallic systems referred to as charged quantum liquids. The  experiments
              are unique in that they probe a broad frequency range, at  low temperatures,
              where deviations from conventional Fermi liquid  behavior can be pronounced.
              The experiments will provide important  tests of theories of non-Fermi liquids.
              The project involves low  temperatures, to 0.35 Kelvin, and high magnetic
              fields, to 9 Tesla.  The materials to be investigated include UPt3, a
              conventional Fermi  liquid, and suspected non-Fermi liquid alloys,
              cerium-copper-gold and  uranium-yttrium-palladium, as well as two-dimensional
              organic metals.  The work is of fundamental interest, but the results may also
              bear on  other important non-Fermi liquid materials such as the high 
              temperature superconductors.  %%%  This project looks at the response of
              unusual metallic systems,  including so-called organic metals, to a broad range
              of  electromagnetic radiation (light). The response to the radiation is 
              measured at very low temperatures and at very high magnetic fields.  The
              motivation of the work is to understand differences in the  response of these
              materials as compared to ordinary metals, whose  electrical properties are much
              better understood. The experiments are  technically complex and can only be
              carried out in a few laboratories  in the world. The materials to be
              investigated include UPt3, a  conventional metallic material, the suspected
              non-conventional metal  alloys: cerium-copper-gold and
              uranium-yttrium-palladium, as well as  two-dimensional "organic" metals. The
              work is of fundamental interest,  but the results may also bear on other
              important non-Fermi liquid  materials such as the high temperature
              superconductors.  ***
