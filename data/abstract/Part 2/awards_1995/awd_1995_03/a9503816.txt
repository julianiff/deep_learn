Abstract    :
              9503816  Nof  In this project, the PIs will conduct an analytic study of 
              oceanographic processes that occur within the Indonesian  Archipelago. 
              Particular focus will be on nonlinear dynamics of  flow across a boundary
              containing multiple gaps, wave transmission  through networks of basins,
              equatorial crossing, and baroclinic  effects in the lee of sills.  Simple
              experiments will be attempted  to supplement the analytical calculations.  ***
