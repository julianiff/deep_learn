Abstract    :
              9503783  Rubin       This grant supports research under the NSF program to 
              promote Research at Undergraduate Institutions.  The  Principal Investigator
              and students participate in a group  continuing an experiment at the Brookhaven
              National  Laboratory.  They are collecting data on rare decays of long-  lived
              neutral K mesons.  The results will provide a test of  predictions of the
              Standard Model of electroweak  interactions.  ***
