Abstract    :
              9503509  Pang    This award will provide partial support for the International
              Conference on   Complementarity Problems: Engineering and Economic Applications
              and   Computational Methods to be held at Johns Hopkins University from  
              November 1-4, 1995.  The goal of the conference is two-fold: (1) to have  
              engineers and economists explain to the complementarity community the  
              applications and needs in their fields and (2) to introduce to engineers and  
              economists the latest computational tools for solving complementarity  
              problems.  There are three major themes of the conference: engineering  
              applications, economic equilibria, and computational methods.  Major   topics
              to be covered include the relationship of complementarity to the   following
              problems or areas:  contact mechanics problems, structural   mechanics
              problems, nonlinear obstacle problems, elastohydrodynamic   problems,
              game-theoretic models, computational methods, and software   development.  The
              conference will bring together leading researchers in this   field from the
              international community and participants will include both   junior researchers
              and senior experts.
