Abstract    :
              9503756  Bluhm       The proposed project focuses on the behavior and properties
               of Rydberg wave packets.  Of particular interest is the behavior  of these
              packets in external fields such as those produced by a  short laser pulse. 
              Recurrent behavior is observed under this set  of conditions and resembles that
              of squeezed states.  Finally,  the role of supersymmetry in Rydberg wave
              packets will be used to  provide a description of these states which in
              complementary to  that of quantum defect theory.  ***
