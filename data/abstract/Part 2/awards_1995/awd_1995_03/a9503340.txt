Abstract    :
              9503340  Kabamba         Digital computers are now routinely used in situations
              where  they interact in real time with the otherwise analog world, such  as in
              digital feedback control or digital filtering.  The  resulting combination is
              in general no longer analog nor  discrete-time, but is sampled-data in the
              sense that some state  variables evolve in continuous time whereas other evolve
              in  discrete time.  There are currently well developed system  theories for
              analog and discrete-time systems.  However, several  authors have recently
              reported that sample sampled-data systems  exhibit phenomena which make the
              study of their interesting  behavior necessary.  The purpose of the work
              proposed herein is  the development of a comprehensive theory of sampled-data 
              systems, with a specific emphasis on intersample behavior, and  the
              investigation into its application to control engineering.  ***
