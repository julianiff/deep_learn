Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT      9503226  LANGE, Andrew E.      The Cosmic Microwave Background
              (CMB) radiation provides an extremely uniform back light to the observable
              universe. Through photon-electron (Compton) scattering of the CMB photons with
              the hot, ionized plasma that is gravitationally bound in clusters of galaxies a
              distortion known as the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect alters the spectrum of
              the CMB when viewed through a cluster. The thermal and bulk velocities of the
              electrons in the intra-cluster medium produce distinct spectral distortions
              that can be distinguished from one another by multifrequency observations in
              the 100 to 300 GHz range. Separation of these two components allows the direct
              determination of the peculiar velocity of the cluster relative to the
              quasi-inertial CMB rest frame. The invariance of the surface brightness of the
              SZ effect with red shift allows this technique to be extended to red shifts
              limited only by the existence of rich clusters. Also, measurements of the
              thermal component of the intra-cluster medium combined with measurements of the
              X-ray surface brightness of the cluster yields a value of the very fundamental
              Hubble constant, Ho.  The PI will construct a new, multi-frequency array (SuZIE
              II) which employs frequency correlation and an increased number of pixels to
              greatly increase the sensitivity of observations to the SZ effect and to CMB
              anisotropy on arcminute scales. SuZIE II will measure the peculiar velocity
              field of many high red shift clusters, measure the arcminute scale anisotropy
              of the CMB with high precision, and determine a value for Ho based on a large
              and carefully selected sample of clusters.  ***
