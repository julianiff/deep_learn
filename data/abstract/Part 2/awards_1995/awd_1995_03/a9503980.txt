Abstract    :
                9403980  McMahon  This award is made to support experimental and analytical
              research  in the mechanistic understanding of the phenomena of quasi-static 
              brittle fracture caused by stress assisted diffusion of surface-  absorbed
              oxygen into two polycrystalline high-strength alloys and  to explore methods to
              inhibit the embrittlement.  A model with  coupled creep and diffusion in the
              nonlinear crack-tip region will  be used to predict the dependence of
              initiation and crack growth on  loading, environment, and material properties. 
              Predicted crack  growth-rates will be compared with measured rates in order to 
              evaluate the model.  ***
