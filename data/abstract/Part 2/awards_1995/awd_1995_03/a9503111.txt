Abstract    :
              The Committe on Human Factors was established by the National Research Council
              in 1980 as a standing  committee of the Commission on Behavkioral and Social
              Sciences and Education.  The 1994-1995 program includes the completion of a
              study on human error and error management.  The committee is also finalizing
              its report on emerging needs and opportunities in human factors research.  The
              Committee on Human Factors is a multidisciplinary group of experts from the
              fields of psychology, sociology,  engineering, computer science and the
              specialties that have dveloped in the areas of human factors.  The committee
              provides a unique forum for the exchange of information between its sponsors
              and the  scientific and technical communities.  It is responsive to sponsor
              inquiries and its major efforts are  of interest to all sponsors.  Most of the
              studies of the committee result in reports made available to  a regularly
              updated distribution list
