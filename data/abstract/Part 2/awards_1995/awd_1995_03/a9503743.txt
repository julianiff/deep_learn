Abstract    :
              9503743  Schwartz, Steven    The award will allow the purchase of a replacement
              for a  data acquisition and imaging system for a secondary ion mass 
              spectrometry/Auger electron spectroscopy (SINS/Auger)  instrument.  This new
              data system will provide three  dimensional imaging capability for the first
              time, so that  spatial maps of elemental concentrations at the parts per 
              million level can be produced.  The data system will  significantly enhance the
              machine sensitivity by storing  large volumes of data for post-analysis.  The
              new system  will replace outdated counting-electronics modules and will 
              incorporate specialized software for simultaneous SIMS/Auger  data acquisition.
                 The SIMS/Auger unit at Queens College is one of the most  prolific SIMS
              instruments employed for materials research.  Approximately 100 publications
              have utilized data from this  instrument since 1985.  These publications
              address a wide  range of materials issues, including segregation and  ordering
              in polymer blends, interdiffusion and metallic  contacts in compound
              semiconductor devices, characterization  of crystal growth, and fundamentals of
              ion-solid  interactions.  The machine is currently in round-the-clock  use, in
              support of several research contracts and projects,  and involving faculty from
              several universities, as well as  researchers in industry.
