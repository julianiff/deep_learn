Abstract    :
              9503087  Hsu    This award supports collaboration between Shaw Ling Hsu, 
              University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and Yang Xiaozhen,  Institute of
              Chemistry, Academia Sinica, and Wu Dacheng,  Chengdu University of Science and
              Technology, on  characterization of the structures and the deformation 
              behaviors of heterophase polymers via molecular simulation.  This is an area of
              great interest in polymer science, with  potential applications for improved
              understanding of the  phase separated structures of various polyurethanes.   
              Simulation studies will be conducted directed toward  characterization of phase
              separated structures involving  semi-rigid polymers used as hard segments;
              improved  understanding of the mechanical properties of these  materials; and
              interpretation of factors governing molecular  miscibility. This collaborative
              effort will pursue a better  understanding of the properties of polyurethane
              and various  other advanced heterophase materials.
