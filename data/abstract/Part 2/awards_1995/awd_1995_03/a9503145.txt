Abstract    :
                This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois in the
              purchase of a modern single-crystal  diffraction system.  This new
              instrumentation will enhance greatly research in a number of  areas, including
              the following:  (1)  The Structure of Reactive Intermediates of Synthetic 
              Utility; (2)  Homogeneous Models of Ziegler-Natta Catalysts; (3)  Structural
              Studies on  Metal Sulfides; and (4)  Rationally Designed Channel Clathrates.   
              The X-ray diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise measurements of
              the full three-  dimensional structure of a molecule.  The information obtained
              gives the precise values of all  the bond distances and bond angles of a given
              molecule and it gives accurate information about  the spatial arrangement of
              that molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.
