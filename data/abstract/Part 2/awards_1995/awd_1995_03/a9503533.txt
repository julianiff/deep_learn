Abstract    :
                  9503533  Hu  The research project aims at investigating the response
              statistics  and structural reliability of nonlinear dynamic systems subjected 
              to non-Gaussian excitations.  Many physical phenomena can be more 
              realistically modelled as nonlinear systems subjected to non-  Gaussian
              excitation including earthquake loadings.
