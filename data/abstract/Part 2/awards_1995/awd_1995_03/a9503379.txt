Abstract    :
              9503379  McCreary  Five cells of the meridional circulation (the tropical cell,
              the  subtropical cell, the pacific interocean cell, the intermediate 
              convective cell, and the deep thermohaline cell) of the general  ocean
              circulation will be simulated with suite of numerical models  to understand
              their dynamics and thermodynamics and to determine  their effect on the
              tropical ocean heat budget.
