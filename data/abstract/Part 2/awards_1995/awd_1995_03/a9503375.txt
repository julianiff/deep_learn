              9503375 T.P.Hill  Abstract   This research project involves  several topics
              related to the mathematical  theory  of  probability including: optimal
              stopping theory -- the study of   stopping a stochastic process to achieve some
              goal such as  maximizing  the expected value of the process at the time of 
              stopping,  with emphasis on finding good stop rules based on  incomplete
              information; partitioning problems -- the study of  bisection (e.g.,
              ham-sandwich theorems),  fair-division  (cake-cutting inequalities) or general
              partitioning (Lyapounov   convexity) of an object as well as applications to
              hypothesis  testing  and game theory; empirical distribution theory -- the 
              study of estimating an  unknown distribution based on random  samples from that
              distribution,  with emphasis on new alternative  weight functions; convergence
              and  invariance principles -- the  study of representations of measures and
              their relationships to  limit laws; and the significant-digit  problem -- the
              study of  non-uniformity in significant digits of empirical data,  and its 
              applications to mathematical modelling and computer design.    This project is
              mostly  theoretical, but has potential  applications in  statistics, economics
              and computer science,  as  well as in other areas of pure mathematics such as
              measure,  integration and function theory.    This research project  involves
              several topics in mathematics related to  the theory of  probability.  These
              topics include: the theoretical aspects  of  controlling or stopping a random
              process such as pollution-level   fluctuations or inflation rates; the theory
              and application of  fair-division problems in which an object  such as a parcel
              of  land or other assets must be divided and distributed  among  several
              parties;  the study of estimating the distribution of an  unknown population
              based on  random samples and observations; and  general theories about
              long-range  behavior of random processes  such as population growth or global 
              temperature fluctuations.   This pro ject is primarily theoretical,  with
              direct applications  to statistics and other areas of mathematics, and
              potential  applications to other areas of science  such as economics, 
              operations research, and computer technology.
