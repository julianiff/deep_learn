Abstract    :
              9503247  Buss       Buss will investigate axiomatics and conditional separations
              of  bounded arithmetic theories; relative proof complexity of propositional  
              proof systems including Frege, extended Frege, constant-depth Frege,   Hilbert
              Nullstellensatz and cutting plane proof systems;  problems in designing
              computerized theorem provers based on extensions   of the sequent calculus; and
              various problems in low-level computational   complexity.       Buss' research
              concerns (i) formal systems of mathematical logic  and the complexity of proofs
              in such systems and (ii) computational   complexity and feasible complexity.  A
              central goal for this research is to   relate the strength of proof systems to
              the complexity or difficulty of   computations.  Buss' work centers on proof
              systems corresponding to   functions which are feasibly computable, especially
              on proof systems for   polynomial time computation.  Buss will also investigate
              the relative   effectiveness of various proof systems for propositional and
              first-order   logic.  This research is fundamental to understanding the power
              of   computation in mathematics.  ***
