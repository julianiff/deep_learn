              Abstract  ATM-9503823  Anderson, Roger Y.   University of New Mexico  Title:
              Science Coordinating Meeting for Western North America          Segment of
              Polar-Equator-Pole Transect for Past Global          Changes    This award
              supports a workshop and coordinating meeting for a  segment of the PEP 1
              (Pole-Equator-Pole) transect in order to  facilitate efforts by the science
              community to meet objectives of  Past Global Changes (PAGES).  The segment
              selected for coordination  is Western North America (WNA), including the marine
              continental  margin.  Invitees and participants will be asked to follow an 
              agenda that seeks to identify climate-related problems and sites  amenable to
              investigation in WNA, to encourage cross-disciplinary  collaborative research,
              and to provide a framework for  communicating results and coordinating efforts
              to provide  quantitative information about past climate change and responses to
               climate changes in WNA.  The three-day meeting will be held on 19-  21
              January, 1995 in Albuquerque, NM.
