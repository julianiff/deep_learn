Abstract    :
              9503204  Vasile  The purpose of this project is the development of a
              mathematical model of  Focused Ion Beam (FIB) etch processes, enabling the
              fabrication of unique microstructures.   Three-dimensional test objects will be
              designed and fabricated using the model, such as probe microscope tips and
              cavities with pre-specified geometeries.  The activities will provide a link
              between object design FIB control, and microstructure fabrication.  ***
