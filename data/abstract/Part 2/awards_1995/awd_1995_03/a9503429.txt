Abstract    :
              9503429  Akbar    The proposed research aimed to develop a systematic 
              understanding of the electrical behavior of ceramic sensors  in terms of their
              microscopic constituents.  Two model  systems will be chosen for this study: 
              (i) TiO2 (anatase)-  based gas sensor and (ii) Y2O3-based thermistor.  The 
              electrical measurement will involve both the dc and ac  techniques,
              deep-level-transient spectroscopy (DLTS) and  thermally stimulated current
              (TSC).  Microstructural and  surface characterizations will involve scanning
              and  tunneling electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), X-ray  photoelectron
              spectroscopy (XPS) and vibrational  spectroscopy.  This comprehensive approach
              is expected to  lead to a level of understanding that would make a major 
              impact on research in other areas of electronic ceramics as  well.  %%%  The
              proposed research aimed to develop the high sensitivity  and reliable sensors
              capable of continuous operation in high  temperature environments for extended
              periods and cycles.
