Abstract    :
              9503997  Weare  The purpose of this proposal is to develop adaptive numerical
              methods and the accompanying software infrastructure for the solution of the
              LDA equations in materials science.  Current solution methods, based on Fast
              Fourier Transform techniques, cannot accurately resolve the short length scales
              present in many materials of technological importance.  Our adaptive numerical
              methods will integrate adaptive mesh refinement techniques with advanced
              multilevel numerical eigenvalue algorithms.  The implementation of adaptive
              numerical methods on high performance parallel platforms is difficult because
              the programmer must manage irregularly distributed, dynamically changing data. 
              The use of adaptive numerical techniques will enable theoretical material
              scientists to model complex materials which cannot be treated using existing
              methods. Furthermore, because adaptive methods can be applied to a number of
              scientific and engineering disciplines, this research will impact other fields,
              including computational fluid dynamics, semiconductor modeling, and geophysical
              modeling.
