Abstract    :
              ***  9503656  Simpson         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              project focuses on the development of broad bandwidth sonar methods for
              identifying, in real time, fish populations in open ocean environments.  The
              approach uses sonar technology, developed in defense-related contexts over many
              years, that hold promise for application to fishery management.   Topics that
              will be developed in the research involve  broadband acoustics, spectral
              decomposition of returns, and nonlinear fuzzy neural network classifiers for
              characterizing and distinguishing different fish populations.  In Phase I of
              the research, a successful application of several concepts was carried out
              using freshwater fish populations.  Phase II research will extend the work to
              development of an engineering prototype for broadband fish identification in a
              marine environment, with both commercial and scientific-research implications  
                  Fisheries are becoming an increasingly significant food source.  Currently,
              30% of the protein consumed by Americans comes from the sea and this percentage
              is growing.  Over the past decade fisheries have experienced more regulation
              because of bycatch, overcapitalization, and marine mammal endangerment. 
              Because of increased regulation, the scrutiny on commercial fishing and
              fisheries management has become intense.  As a result of these changes,
              techniques that can automatically and non-intrusively detect, classify, and
              quantify fish populations are of commercial interest to all segments of the
              fisheries.  ***
