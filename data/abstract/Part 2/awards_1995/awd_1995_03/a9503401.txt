Abstract    :
              9503401  Wells       There has been no systematic study of the phenomena of 
              subsurface cementation of beach sand and its subsequent subaerial  exposure as
              beachrock in intertidal environments.  This may have  important implications
              for sedimentological, wave and current  processes in the littoral zone.  The PI
              will carry out a pilot  project in Puerto Rice to study beachrock and coastal
              stability.  16 beach profiles will be measured and instruments deployed to 
              study lateral variations and processes.  USGS and University of  Puerto Rico
              scientists will also collaborate.  ***
