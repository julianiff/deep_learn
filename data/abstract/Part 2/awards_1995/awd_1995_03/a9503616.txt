Abstract    :
              Libgober  9503616     The proposed research lies in the interface of complex
              differential geometry and algebraic geometry. The investigator poses a number
              of problems on the phenomenon of mirror symmetry. This includes a study of the
              hypergeometric differential equations that are satisfied by the periods of
              families of Calabi-Yau manifolds. The mirror symmetry conjecture, first
              observed by physicists, asserts that each Calabi-Yau 3-fold has a 'mirror'
              (also a Calabi-Yau 3-fold) and that certain structures of a Calabi-Yau manifold
              are tightly related to seemingly very different structures of its mirror
              manifold.    The phenomenon of mirror symmetry relates qualitatively different
              structures arising in theoretical physics, geometry and algebra. The rough idea
              is that there are structures in theoretical physics which are mirrored in
              structures in pure mathematics. This entire phenomenon, verified in special
              cases, remains an intriguing mathematical puzzle.
