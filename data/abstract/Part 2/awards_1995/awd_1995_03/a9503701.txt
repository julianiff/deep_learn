Abstract    :
              9503701  Xiao    A packaged commercial dilution refrigerator will be  acquired
              and its usage will be divided among four  research  projects requiring
              experiments at millikelvin  temperatures. One project  studies  quantum  phase-
               coherent transport in normal-superconducting metal  mesoscopic structures. The
              new quantum transport  phenomenom reveals itself in the low temperature range.
              A  second project investigates semiconductor devices  exhibiting quantum
              transport effects such as resonant  tunneling, ballistic transport over
              macroscopic  distances, and Coulomb blockade.  Low temperature  transport
              measurements will be performed on semiconductor  nanostructures of adjustable
              dimensionality and lateral  extent. A third project will  use the dilution 
              refrigerator to test ultra-sensitive millimeter-wave  detectors developed to
              study the background radiation of  the universe. To achieve the required
              sensitivity, these  detectors have to be operated at millikelvin  temperatures.
              The fourth project studies phonon  propagation  in layered compounds and the
              effects of  disorder on the scattering of phonons in crystalline  solids at
              very low temperatures.  %%%  The acquisition of a single instrument for
              experiments  impacting a wide range of fields is very cost effective.  Quantum
              transport phenomena play an important role in  small structures that are the
              result of the ever-  decreasing dimensions of microelectronic devices.  ***
