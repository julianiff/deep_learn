Abstract    :
              9503532  Zitter       This proposal requests funds for NevadaNet to fund six
              NSFnet  connections to serve five remote community college instruction  sites
              and one remote instruction site for the University of Nevada  Medical Scool. 
              On behalf of these institutions NevadaNet request  NSF support to connect these
              sites to the Internet throught  NevadaNet and our cooperating network service
              provider, SprintLink.   The six connections sites are:         Western Nevada
              Community College            - Hawthorn Campus            - Minden Campus      
              Community College of Southern Nevada            - Tonopah Campus            -
              Caliente Campus       University of Nevada Medical School, Boulder City
              Hospital     The six connections would provide these sites with access ot 
              important state, regional and national computing information  resources, and
              enhancing instruction and research opportunities for  their respective students
              and faculty.      The benefits of this Internet connection include e-mail
              between  local and remote researcheps and educators, file transfer  capability
              and the ability to use remote computer resources.  Also  the college will have
              the ability to investigate innovation in  educational resources and incorporate
              them into their curricula.
