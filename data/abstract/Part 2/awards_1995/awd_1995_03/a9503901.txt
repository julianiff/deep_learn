Abstract    :
              9503901  Vargas      This award is under the North American Research Fellows 
              Program, which enables U.S. scientists and engineers from  the United States,
              Canada and Mexico, to visit research  establishments in one or both of the
              other two countries for  periods of three to twelve months. The program's
              awards  provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of  unique or
              complementary facilities, expertise and  experimental conditions abroad.   
              This award will support a two-month research visit by Dr.  Juan E. Vargas to
              work with Drs. Francisco Cantu and Jose  Manuel Sanchez at the Center for
              Artificial Intelligence at  the Instituto Tecnologico y de Estudios Superiores
              de  Monterrey (ITESM) in Mexico.    This award will support research into
              methods for designing  knowledge-based systems that integrate
              statistically-sound  techniques, probabilistic inference (using Bayesian belief
               networks) and case-based reasoning.  Dr. Vargas will also  conduct research
              into knowledge representation models that  can employ Bayesian belief networks
              as templates from which  cases may be generated for case-based reasoning.  He
              will  lay out conceptual designs for computer systems capable of  using the
              integration of these concepts for automated  reasoning under uncertainty.  ***
