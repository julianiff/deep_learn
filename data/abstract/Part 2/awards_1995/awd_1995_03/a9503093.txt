Abstract    :
              While hardware issues are important, it is ultimately the software that will
              determine the success of  virtual environment applications.  One important new
              area of virtual environment software research is  in 3D interaction: how should
              such applications behave interactively and what software architectures  should
              they use? Since user input is relatively low-bandwidth, future solutions to
              these problems will  have enormous processing power to draw upon.  Recently,
              several developments have emerged in various  fields which hold great promise
              for advancing 3D interaction research. Examples are: object-oriented 
              frameworks, incremental hierarchical constraint solvers, automatic recognition
              of hand gestures,  inverse kinematics algorithms, and physically-based models
              of rigid or deformable objects.  Because of  the complexity of developing 3D
              interaction software, reusable software libraries are clearly needed.  While
              some virtual environment software libraries are currently available, there are
              no higher-level  toolkits available which incorporate these newer ideas, are
              publicly available and written in a  standar d object-oriented language. This
              research project will investigate what form of software  architecture a modern,
              high-level 3D interaction toolkit should take, build an implementation of one 
              in C++, and make a documented version publicly available for researchers and
              developers of virtual  environment applications. Such a high-level software
              framework would serve as a catalyst for  researchers developing highly
              interactive virtual environments in the sciences, medicine, engineering  and
              industry.
