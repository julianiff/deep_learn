Abstract    :
                    9503393  Leo   This project will study the lattice structure of
              crystal-crystal  interfaces which are important i semiconductor devices and 
              elsewhere.  It will examine one of the pivotal issued in such  materials -- the
              loss of coherence at an interface and the  subsequent development of defect
              patterns.  The research will  yield specific predictions of the interfacial
              structures in  multiphase systems.  If successful, this improved understanding 
              will lead to new strategies to prevent or postpone the loss of  coherence.  ***
