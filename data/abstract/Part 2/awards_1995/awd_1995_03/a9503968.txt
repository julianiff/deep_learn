Abstract    :
              9503968  Moody     In this project robust artificial neural network (ANN)
              learning algorithms and tools for forecasting time series, with specific
              applications to financial and economic time series will be developed.  These
              algorithms and tools are difficult to predict due to the non-normal
              distribution of the noise and the presence of outliers, as well as the
              nonstationarity of both noise and signals.  They thus make excellent benchmark
              problems for robust nonlinear modeling techniques.    In robust models, robust
              error measures for gracefully handling outliers in the data will be
              incorporated.  Also, a new method for automatically regularizing (constraining)
              the ANN model during training by using second order statistics of the cost
              function gradient.  This prevents the network from adapting to noise and thus
              produces robust models.    In the area of learning algorithms, the application
              of a new simulated annealing type learning algorithm to recurrent networks will
              be investigated.  It is believed that, based upon past experience with
              feedforward networks with many hidden layers, this algorithm will improve the
              performance of recurrent networks.      In variable selection, a novel use of
              genetic algorithms (GA) in combination with ANN models to select optimal
              subsets of variables for solving a problem will be pursued.  Combining GAs with
              a newly developed statistical test, the so-called delta-test, into a more
              powerful tool for determining the optimal variable subset will also be done.
