Abstract    :
              This research is on techniques for testing VLSI circuits directly  at functional
              levels, while ensuring that standard testing quality  goals are met.  A
              high-level fault model called the induced  functional fault (IF) model is being
              investigated.  With this  model, an IF fault class can be coupled to a physical
              fault class  so that detection of IF faults ensures detection of physical 
              faults.  Advantages of this approach are easy derivation of near-  minimal test
              sets, and reuse of tests in other circuits.  The  construction, use and reuse
              of precomputed tests for sequential  circuits are being explored.  In this
              regard, the application of  balance and functional properties to simplifying
              test generation  and improving fault coverage are being studied.  Built-in
              self-  testing methods that facilitate the implementation of functional 
              testing methods and the detection and elimination of design errors  are also
              being explored.
