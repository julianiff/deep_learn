Abstract    :
                This project focuses on a number of topics related to on-line  problems. 
              On-line algorithms work with only partial information  about the  input data. 
              At each time step, such an algorithm  receives one unit of data,  and has to
              produce partial results  before seeing the remaining data.  On-line 
              competitive algorithms  are algorithms which return a solution that is not
              worse  than a  constant times the optimal one.    One of the goals is to solve
              the  k-server problem.  An optimal  algorithm for k servers has already been 
              developed:  the  algorithm is 2-competitive for two servers.  A closed form 
              function, which is a good candidate for the potential function  for k = 3, is 
              examined.    A second goal is to attack a number of other on-line problems for 
              which optimal competitiveness is unknown, including:  randomized  list update, 
              multi-processor scheduling, and page migration; and  to develop a general
              theory  of on-line problem solutions.    A third goal is to show how the
              techniques,  developed for the  solution of the k-server problem, can be
              applied to other  on-line  problems.  In particular, applications of work
              functions,  forgiveness  and stable distributions to general on-line problems 
              are developed.    Note:  This is a companion award to CCR-9503498 (PI: Chrobak)
