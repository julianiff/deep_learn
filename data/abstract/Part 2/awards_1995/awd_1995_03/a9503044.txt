Abstract    :
              Ripon College  This CAREER award is made in the Organic Dynamics Program in
              support of   the research and teaching activities of Dr. Colleen Byron. The
              research   plan involves the characterization of the electron transfer
              properties of    the enzyme glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (GCD) by
              electrochemical,    spectroscopic and synthetic organic techniques. The
              research will focus   on the role of substrate and/or product complexation on
              the electron   transfer properties of GCD, and the effect of alterations of the
              GCD   aminoacid sequence, particularly near the active site, on the electron  
              transfer properties of GCD.  Dr. Byron's teaching plan will focus on  
              development of the analytical, organic and biochemistry courses. She will  
              update these courses  to include topics and laboratory experiments of  
              societal and environmental  relevance and emphasize interdisciplinary  
              science.  She will also coordinate a chemistry seminar series and   continue
              activities in undergraduate advising and mentoring.  Apart from the inherent
              advancement of  our understanding of electron   transfer in enzymatic systems,
              this research will address specific issues   relevant to  the metabolism of
              certain aminoacids by GCD at a molecular   level  and the role of mutations in
              GCD  deficiency. The involvement of   undergraduate students in the
              implementation of the research will have a   significant educational value.
