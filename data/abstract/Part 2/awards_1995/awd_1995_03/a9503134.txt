Abstract    :
              9503134  Holbrook       This project will process and interpret seismic data 
              collected along the margin of Virginia, concentrating on tying 
              previously-studied marine data to a corresponding dataset on  land.  This will
              produce new images of the transition between  continental and ocean crust,
              permitting better constraints on the  processes that occur during continental
              breakup.  A surprising  finding from the existing data is the presence of very
              thick  igneous units, suggesting far more  ***
