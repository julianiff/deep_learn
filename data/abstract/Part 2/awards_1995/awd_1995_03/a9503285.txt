Abstract    :
               This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
              Program.  The study will examine the relations between attributions about
              exchange partners and behavior in exchange relations.   It ties together
              attribution theory with social exchange theory in new and previously unexamined
              ways.  The research uses existing experimental data to test the effects of
              structure and behavior on attributions and designs a fresh experiment to test
              the effects of attributions on exchange behavior.  %%%   This research
              contributes to the sociological understanding of social psychology by linking
              the subfields of cognition, concerned with how people develop beliefs about
              behavior,   with social exchange, concerned with how people use resources to
              obtain the behavioral outcomes they desire.  In addition to the scientific
              gains to be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a
              highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation. 
              Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower of the nation and the
              thorough training of the next generation of social scientists.
