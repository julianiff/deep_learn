Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, John   Moore and
              John Tossell of the University of Maryland will investigate the   processes
              involved in electron-molecule collisions.  Such processes   include:
              dissociative electron attachment, yielding a radical and a   negative ion;
              direct dissociation, resulting in two radicals; dipolar   dissociation,
              resulting in the simultaneous production of a positive and   a negative ion;
              and dissociative ionization, yielding an ion and a   radical.  The project
              involves both experimental and theoretical   characterization of such processes
              as they occur in the gas phase as well   as on surfaces.  Systems chosen for
              study include halocarbons,   halosilanes, halogenated alkenes, and
              halofluorocarbons.  These   precursors and their products are thought to be
              crucial in understanding   the chemistry involved in plasma reactors such as
              those used for plasma   etching and in the fabrication of semiconductor
              devices.  An electrical discharge in a gas creates an electron-rich environment
                which induces chemical changes in normally unreactive gases.  This highly  
              charged mixture is known as a plasma, and the chemical reactions taking   place
              are termed plasma chemistry.  Such reactors have found widespread   use in the
              semiconductor industry for fabrication of both materials and   devices.  This
              research will provide detailed information on the nature   of the species
              involved in such reactions, as well as fundamental   knowledge of their
              reactions.
