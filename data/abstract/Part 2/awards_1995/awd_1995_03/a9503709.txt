Abstract    :
              Research supported by this grant is under the auspices of the Arctic Systems
              Science (ARCSS) Global Change Research Program and is jointly sponsored by the
              Division of Ocean Sciences and the Office of Polar Programs.  Work to be
              performed represents preliminary steps towards a major 5-year research project
              named SHEBA, which is envisioned to study the heat budget of the Arctic Ocean
              and its impact on global change.  The primary goals of SHEBA are:  (1) to
              develop, test and implement models of arctic ocean-atmosphere-ice processes
              that demonstrably improve simulations of the present day arctic climate,
              including its variability, using General Circulation Models (GCMs), and (2) to
              improve the interpre- tation of satellite remote sensing data in the Arctic for
              analysis of the arctic climate system and provide reliable data for model
              input, model validation and climate monitoring.     The investigators will
              examine the scale at which physical processes affect the atmospheric boundary
              layer (ABL) as a result of the presence of leads in the Arctic pack ice.  The
              opening of leads produces increased cloudiness and has a major impact on the
              heat budget of the Arctic.  The results of this research will be used to select
              the best measurements to be made in the SHEBA field experiment and to modify
              Global Climate Models so that better simulations of Arctic heat flux may be
              accomplished.
