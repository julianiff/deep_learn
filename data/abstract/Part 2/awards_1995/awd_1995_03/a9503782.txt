Abstract    :
              9503782  Nielsen       This project will explore a new technique in which 
              inclusions of primitive magma within individual crystals are  analyzed. 
              Previous work has found great variability within a  single crystal, implying
              that the magmas produced in a small area  are far more variable than believed. 
              The project will examine a  suite of rock samples from along the axis of the
              Juan de Fuca  Ridge (to see how magmas of the same age change latepally) and 
              across the axis (to see how a single magma chamber changes over  time).  ***
