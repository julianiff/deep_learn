Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9503000  Thomas Hanratty  Univ. of Illinois      Advances in the
              analysis of turbulent heat transfer have been limited because of the need for
              more detailed information about the statistics of the fluctuating temperature
              and velocity fields than is obtained in laboratory studies.  The proposed
              research responds to this need by using supercomputers to calculate the
              time-dependent, three-dimensional temperature and velocity fields.   It is
              novel in three ways:  It supplies results over a wide range of Prandtl numbers.
               I relates (for the first time) Eulerian and Lagrangian results.  It explores
              the use of Lagrangian methods to describe sediment transport.    The usual
              approach to transport problems is to use an Eulerian framework in which a
              differential equation is written to describe the concentration changes in a
              fixed volume in space.  A viewpoint to be explored in this research is that
              physical understanding emerges in a more natural way by using a Lagrangian
              frame work, which considers concentration fields of a transported species
              (thermal markers or sediment) as resulting from the contributions of a number
              of sources and sinks.  For the problems considered, the fundamental building
              block is dispersion from and infinitesimal source at the boundary.    The head
              transfer system is turbulent flow through a channel in which the bottom wall is
              heated and the top wall is cooled.  Direct numerical sumulations will be
              carried out for Pr=0.05-40.  Lagrangian methods will be used to extend these to
              Prandtl numbers as high as 2000.  Turbulent transport of sediment in a
              horizontal rectangular channel will be considered.
