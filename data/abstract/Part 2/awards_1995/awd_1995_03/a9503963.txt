Abstract    :
              9503963  Bodenchatz  The objective of this proposal is to study numerical and
              analytically the microscopic equations describing certain experimental systems.
               This research will take three directions,  it will make quantitative
              comparisons between simulations experiments, study lengthscale and order
              parameters in experimental systems, and examine the appearance and role of
              topological defects.  A specific goal of this proposal is to use the powerful
              parallel computing facilities to explore new physical regimes which are
              described by the Boussinesq equations.  Although the equations have been
              simulated before, the simulations have been limited to small systems, short
              integration times, limited fixed resolution, or particular boundary conditions.
               By comparing a code using spectral methods to one based on iterative methods,
              such as multigrid or conjugate-gradient-like methods, we will develop a general
              scalable Boussinesq solver optimized for parallel computers that will allow
              long integrations of large systems with aspect ratios greater than 100 and with
              adjustable resolution in all directions.  This next generation convection code
              will allow this research to perform exhaustive explorations of spatiotemporal
              chaos in extended convection systems, and, hopefully, these explorations will
              constitute a significant step toward a formalism similar to equilibrium
              thermodynamics.
