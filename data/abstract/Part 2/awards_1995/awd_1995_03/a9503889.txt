Abstract    :
              9503889  Tindall    This award supports a one year Japan Society for the 
              Promotion of Science postdoctoral fellowship for Dr. Craig  Tindall.  The
              research work conducted for this fellowship  will be performed in Professor
              Toshio Sakurai's laboratory  at the Institute for Materials Research (IMR) at
              Tohoku  University.  The proposed work consists of fundamental  studies of
              copper compounds on silicon and silicon dioxide  surfaces.  These materials are
              of interest because more  knowledge of their chemistry will help to create
              processes  which may be used to make faster integrated circuits.    As a
              postdoctoral fellow at IMR, Dr. Tindall will have the  opportunity to become
              familiar with some very powerful  experimental apparatus which has been
              developed by Professor  Sakurai's group.  Since this equipment is not readily 
              available in other laboratories, Professor Sakurai's  laboratory will provide
              an excellent environment in which to  perform this research.  In addition, the
              Electro-  Communication Institute at Tohoku University is also a very  highly
              regarded facility, and may provide an opportunity in  the second year of this
              fellowship to carry out some studies  of deposition of copper layers on silicon
              and silicon  dioxide.  ***
