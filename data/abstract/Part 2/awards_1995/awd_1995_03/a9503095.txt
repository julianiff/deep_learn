Abstract    :
              ***  9503095  Barrett    This Americas Program award will support a research 
              collaboration between Dr. Bruce R. Barrett, University of  Arizona, and Dr.
              Abdoulaye Foula Diallo, Universidad de  Panama.  They will investigate the
              nuclear structure of  medium-to-heavy-mass nuclei using the 1/A-Boson-expansion
               method for the Interacting Boson Model (IBM).  The Boson  expansion method is
              a powerful technique for investigating  massive nuclear systems too large to
              handle, even within the  ordinary simplification of the IBM.  The study will be
              done  in two stages, using two extensions of the 1/a-boson  expansion method. 
              Both extensions will provide a large  number of applications of the approach to
              the study of  existing and newly measured results in the rare-earth and 
              actinide regions.For the last two decades there has been  an  increased
              application of algebraic methods to the  calculation of nuclear properties. 
              Such an approach not  only highlights the underlying structure of nuclear 
              behavior, but also facilitates its systematic study over  entire regions of the
              periodic table.  Dr. Barrett  experience regarding the application, extension
              and  microscopic interpretation of the Interacting Boson Model  complements Dr.
              Diallo's expertise on the 1/A-boson-  expansion method which the latter  helped
              to develop.      ***
