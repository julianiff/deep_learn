Abstract    :
              9503723  Gupta    A laser spallation technique for the measurement of 
              interfacial strength is modified for in-situ measurements  at elevated
              temperatures.  To establish the basic  principles and the experimental
              procedures to facilitate  future studies, planar interfaces between 1 to 3
              micron  thick coatings of Nb and substrates of sapphire are used as  model
              systems.  The tensile strength of interfaces is  measured up to 1300C and the
              interface chemistry and atomic  structure determined by using a high resolution
               transmission electron microscope.  Transmission microscopy  observations at
              ambient temperature relate the influence of  interface interdiffusion, void
              formation, coating grain  size, new phases, thickness of the amorphous layer,
              etc. to  the measured interface strength at elevated temperatures,  since the
              microstructure is likely to be retained when the  samples are cooled in air. 
              The tensile strengths of some  representative systems chosen from the tribology
              are  determined up to 1300C.  %%%  The work is not only interdisciplinary in
              its approach but  also in its impact as it serves a particular need in the 
              composites, tribology, thermal spray, microelectronics and  other thin film
              industries.  ***
