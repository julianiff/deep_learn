Abstract    :
              9503064  Hollan    This award provides support for visualization facilities,
              servers to support distributed simulation, and a high-speed cluster network. 
              In addition the University of New Mexico will establish a National Information
              Infrastructure (NII) Experimental Laboratory in the Science and Engineering
              Library to serve as a shared research testbed, as well as to facilitate efforts
              in distributed simulation and research collaborations in Biology, with the
              Santa Fe Institute and the National Laboratories.  The Laboratory equipment
              will include graphics workstations connected via a high-performance local area
              network to high-end symmetric multiprocessing systems, an SGI Power Onyx and
              Power Challenge, and to remote high-performance facilities at the Maui High
              Performance Computing Center's IBM SP-2, the Sandia National Laboratory's Intel
              Paragon, and the Los Alamos National Laboratory's CM-5.    The University will
              build on its existing strengths in adaptive computation, human computer
              interaction, information analysis, and simulation to focus on adaptive
              multiscale interfaces; distributed computation, communication, and security for
              network-based applications; data mining and filtering; and improved access to
              distributed simulation.
