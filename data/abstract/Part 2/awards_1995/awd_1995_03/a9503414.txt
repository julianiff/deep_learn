Abstract    :
              Abstact/Breidenthal            Laboratory experiments are proposed to measure
              the entrainment  and mixing characteristics of buoyant flows involving shear
              and  buoyance reversal.  Experiments will be performed in water tanks,  using
              pH indicators in conjunction with acid-base reactions to  determine optically
              the location and amount of mixing.
