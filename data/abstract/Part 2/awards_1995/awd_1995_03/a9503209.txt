Abstract    :
              9503209  Ghaboussi  This project continues and extends  the development of an
              active  structural control method using  neural networks by the  investigators
              at the University of  Illinois in 1992 under the NSF's  structural control
              program.  The  main controller in the new method  of structural control is a
              trained  neural network, referred to as the  neuro-controller.  The training of
               the neuro-controller is  accomplished with the aid of an  emulator neural
              network, which is  first trained to learn the  structural behavior.  Results
              from  the numerical simulations showed  that the new structural control  method
              performs well compared to  other control methods and is far  more robust as
              well as being an  inherently adaptive controller.    In this project research
              on neural  network based methods of structural  control will be continued to 
              consist  of (1) experimental  verification of the new structural  control
              method; and (2) the  extension into nonlinear control  problems.  The
              experimental work  will be done in two stages.  In the  initial  stage,
              extensive trial and  error, adjustment and the online  training of the emulator
              neural  network and the neuro-controller  will be done.  Verification tests 
              will be conducted on the shaking  table at the University of Illinois 
              Structural Engineering Laboratory,  using a three story, one bay  structural
              model, similar to those  used in numerical simulations.  The  next stage of
              experimental work  will be conducted at the NCEER  facilities, on a larger
              structural  model.  Finally, the new method of  structural control must be
              extended  to address the problem of nonlinear  control of structures sustaining
               unpredictable damage and develop a  feasible and practical method of 
              nonlinear structural control.  ***
