Abstract    :
              9503458 Li  Abstract      This research involves work in three closely related
              areas of probability, namely, Gaussian isoperimetric inequalities, small ball
              probabilities, and limit theorems for Gaussian processes. Gaussian
              isoperimetric inequalities are studied for restricted sets. This leads to sharp
              estimates and extends the domain of applicability of the isoperimetric tool in
              a variety of settings. Small ball probabilities provide sharp estimates for
              rare events and so far there are only a few general methods available. The
              recent discovery of the connection between small ball probabilities and metric
              entropy problems sheds some light in this area and suggests many fupther
              questions, in particular, the applications to approximation theory. Many of the
              probability estimates are motivated by the study of strong limit theorems. The
              research in limit theorems is centered around the limiting behaviors of
              Gaussian processes.  The primary focus of this research is a better
              understanding of rare random phenomena related to Gaussian processes which
              serve as models in many applications. These types of problems often arise in
              estimating the chances for rare events to occur in areas where such events are
              of fundamental importance, such as weather, economic indices, epidemics etc. 
              This research can lead to significant new knowledge in probability and  provide
              basic tools for the study of our random environment.
