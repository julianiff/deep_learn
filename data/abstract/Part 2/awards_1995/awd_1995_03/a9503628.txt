Abstract    :
              9503628  Dolan       The Pis will carry out a sidescan bathymetry and 
              geophysical survey of the Puerto Rico Trench (PRT) and  northern slope to map
              the zone of active collision at the N.  American/Carribean Plate boundary.  Key
              questions to be  addressed include: Does the main ridge form a boundary 
              between more deformed and less deformed seafloor?  Is it a  subducting feature
              and how much of it is subducted?  What's  the relationship of thrust and
              strike-slip faults?  The  study will provide a better understanding of the
              seismogenic  potential of this submarine deformation zone that lies  within 150
              km of the island of Puerto Rico.  ***
