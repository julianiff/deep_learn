Abstract    :
              The proposal calls for the study of atoms in optical lattices,  which are
              periodic potentials formed by the light shift in  specific laser interference
              patterns.  The proposal is concerned  with experimental studies of the quantum
              motion of Cs atoms in  optical lattices.  This proposal will use ground state
              atoms as a  starting point for the generation and study of new quantum states 
              of atomic center-of-mass motion.  It will study the propagation  of atoms by
              tunneling through the lattice in the presence of  gravity, in obvious analogy
              to the propagation of electrons  through solids in the presence of an electric
              field.  ***
