Abstract    :
              9503626  Ford  Polymers filled with glass fibers and silica particles have  many
              commercial applications due to increased hardness,  abrasion resistance,
              tensile modulus, compressive strength,  and heat distortion temperature, and to
              a lower coefficient  of thermal expansion.  The silica fibers or particles are 
              irregularly dispersed and agglomerated, and the fibers may  be oriented by
              shear.  Nothing is known yet about how three-  dimensional order of dispersed
              silica influences the  mechanical properties of a composite.  We have
              synthesized  the first composites having the dispersed phase ordered as 
              colloidal crystals.  During the next grant period we will  (1) characterize the
              crystal structures of the colloidal  silica-polymer composites more completely
              to answer a number  of puzzling aspects of the optical diffraction of the
              films,  (2) prepare optical diffraction filters having smaller  dispersed
              particles and a wider range of diffraction  wavelengths, (3) prepare tunable
              filters using elastomeric  matrices, (4) prepare blends of colloidal crystals
              of  polystyrene latexes in acrylic matrices as diffraction  filters, (5) extend
              our studies of the optical properties of  the colloidal crystalline films to
              thermal and mechanical  properties, (6) characterize the silica-PMMA composites
              by  solid state NMR spectroscopy, and (7) synthesize a new  family of colloidal
              crystalline dispersions in which  derivatives of C60 are trapped in polystyrene
              and  and PMMA latexes.  %%%  This research could lead to the development of 
              several  types of novel optical filters and improved elastomers.  ***
