Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9503208    An approach for the direct numerical flow simulation of
              systems consisting of several bubbles or drops at finite Reynolds numbers will
              be investigated using a front tracking technique at the interface between the
              continuous and dispersed phase.  Complex multi-body collisions and deformable
              interfaces can effectively be described in simulations by parallelizing the
              computer code.  Several case studies will examine the behavior of many bubbles
              and drops moving freely in a rectangular domain due to gravity, pressure
              gradient, and/or shear flow.  The results will include lift and drag force as a
              function of the void, fraction, Reynolds number, and deformations, and averaged
              momentum, flux, Reynolds stresses, and particle dispersion.    The improved
              simulation capabilities have  relevance to various multiphase engineering and
              environmental processes.  ***
