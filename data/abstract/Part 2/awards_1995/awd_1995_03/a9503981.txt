Abstract    :
              9503981  Ingraffea  The purpose of this project is to contribute to the
              development of a simulator for predicting initiation and near-wellbore
              propagation from cased, perforated, deviated wellbores.  This simulator will
              function on both the IBM SP2 and on a distributed-workstation parallel
              computing environment, and will use state-of-the-art computational and
              representational methods and correctly propagate fluid-coupled fractures of
              arbitrary geometries. Hydraulic fracturing, widely used for stimulating oil and
              gas production is often unsuccessful for deviated (non-vertical) wellbores. 
              However, the economical and environmental advantages of drilling inclined
              wellbores are overwhelming: thus, it is imperative that the stimulation
              techniques be improved.  This includes detailed simulations of the
              hydrofracturing process. With an efficient simulator, the causes of
              hydrofracturing treatment failures can be analyzed, and new approaches can be
              investigated.   The computational resources for modeling the geometrical and
              physical complexities presented by deviated wellbores have not been readily
              available to the field engineer, so there has been little motivation to create
              such a simulator. This situation is rapidly changing, and now a useful
              simulator must be able to model the multiple, non-planar, propagating cracks
              which interact and possibly intersect, as well as the highly non-linear
              coupling between the fluid flow in the fracture and the elastic response of the
              fractured rock.  Current "three-dimensional" fracturing simulators are severely
              restricted in these areas.
