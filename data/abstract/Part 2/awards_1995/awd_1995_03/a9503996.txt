Abstract    :
              9503996  Brown    In this project the effort will be concentrated on (1)
              building an active vision system that uses PUMA or SARCOS manipulators to
              control the camera's position, and (2) using and extending existing techniques
              for recovering shape from images of a curved object's occluding contour. 
              Because the camera moves around the object in a continuous fashion, camera
              position control and model-building will be modeled as two continuous,
              interdependent processes that occur simultaneously and operate in real-time.   
              The work on camera position control will focus on controlling the camera's
              position in real-time, and on imposing as few camera and manipulator
              calibration requirements as possible.  The work on model-building will focus on
              developing real-time curve tracking methods that can handle the connectivity
              changes of occluding contour curves, and on implementing and evaluating
              existing shape-from-contour techniques.    This research will provide a better
              understanding of the practical issues in moving a camera to build models of
              curved objects with complex surface geometry.  ***
