Abstract    :
              This   research  project  will  develop  a   quasistatic   motion  planning 
              paradigm that is a significant extension  of  classical  robotic motion
              planning paradigms. The quasistatic problem arises  when significant reaction
              forces between the robot mechanism  and  its  environment  are required to
              generate and/or  stabilize  the  robot's  motion.   The planning paradigm is 
              based  on  the  PI's  recently  developed  configuration  space  mobility 
              theory.   To  demonstrate  the practical utility of this work, algorithms  will
               be  developed  and  implemented for  two  important  quasi-static  application
              examples: a novel workpiece fixturing algorithms that  incorporates  the 
              curvature of the fixtures  into  the  planning  phase;  and a proof-of-concept
              2-dimensional quasistatic planning  system  for  a  highly articulated robot.
              This  planner  will  be  tested on an actual robot prototype in the laboratory.
