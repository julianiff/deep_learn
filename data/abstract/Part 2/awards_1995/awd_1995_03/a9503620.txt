Abstract    :
                  9503620  Wu  This research consist of theoretical and experimental studies
              to  determine the mechanism of natural hazards due to extreme winds and  ocean
              currents and to develop methods for significant reduction of  such hazards
              inflicting on tall buildings, offshore structures and  highway infrastructures.
               The main goals of this program are:    -    to achieve significant reduction
              of vortex-induced or side       sway of the structures transversal to the flow
              stream;  -    to invent vortex-generating control devices for executing the    
                required active or passive control functions; and  -    to find effective
              methods for reducing streamwise drag.    Both active and passive modes of
              control will be considered so as  to cover structures of various scales and
              diversified geometric  configurations.  Empirical approach will be followed to
              pursue a  heuristic yet creative development of the vortex-generating devices 
              for executing the required control functions.
