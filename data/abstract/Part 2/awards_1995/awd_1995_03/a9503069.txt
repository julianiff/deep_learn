Abstract    :
              9503069  Hain       Hain intends to continue his study of the topology of moduli
               spaces of curves using Hodge theory.  In particular, he is very  interested in
              computing the second homology of the Torelli group,  and understanding the
              subgroup of the Torelli group, which is the  kernel of the Johnson
              homomorphism.  With Jun Yang, he intends to  try to construct a locally
              integrable cocycle on GL_4(C), using the  fourth classical polylogarithm, which
              represents the fourth Borel  regulator.  Finally, he intends to extend certain
              constructions in  the theory of Vassiliev invariants from genus 0 to positive
              genus.       Symmetry is an important and central theme in twentieth  century
              mathematics.  One of the most natural sets of symmetries is  the set of
              symmeteries of the surface of a donut with g holes.  Although such groups of
              symmeteries have been studied for almost  100 years, there are a large number
              of central unresolved problems.  Hain intends to work on several of these
              during the next three  years.  His results have potential applications to
              modern particle  physics and to certain branches of number theory and algebraic
               geometry, the study of solutions of polynomial equations.  Hain has  a second
              major project.  This is the study of classical  polylogarithms.  These
              functions were defined 200 years ago by  Spence, an English mathematician, and
              are generalizations of the  well-known logarithm function so important
              throughout the sciences  and economics.  Polylogarithms have started to appear
              recently in  physics and number theory. It is important to establish their
              basic  properties.  ***
