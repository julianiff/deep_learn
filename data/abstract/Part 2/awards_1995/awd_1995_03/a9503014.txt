Abstract    :
              9503014  Rogerson    This project consists of an investigation of  the dynamics 
              of Natal Pulses and their influence on ring formation and  retroflection with a
              high resolution isopycnal numerical  model.  The study consists of  two parts:
              (1) the dynamics  of growth and propagation of the Natal Pulse will be studied 
              in a limited-area domain; and, (2) the influence of Natal  Pulses on ring
              formation and retroflection will be studied  in a two-basin domain that allows
              explicit representation of  the retroflection region.    ***
