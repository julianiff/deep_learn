Abstract    :
              9503352  Wilkens    This award will support a detailed study of the fine-scale 
              properties of marine sediments and their relation to sediment  physical
              properties. Basic objective is to understand primary  chemical and grain size
              characteristics that control  characteristics such as porosity, density and
              acoustic velocity.  Project will use Ocean Drilling Program samples and data, 
              laboratory measurements of physical properties and modelling to  relate
              physical properties.  ***
