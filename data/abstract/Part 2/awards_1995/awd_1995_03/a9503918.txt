Abstract    :
              9503918  Ritchie       Research will be carried out leading to photo-production
              of  eta mesons at the CEBAF electron accelerator.  The data will be  used to
              test quark models of mesons and nucleons.  In addition,  measurement of the
              pi-meson beta-decay will be carried out at the  Paul Scherrer Institute in
              Switzerland with significant  improvement in precision over previous
              measurements.  The latter  measurement will permit important tests of
              quark-lepton  universality to be carried out, as well as resolving 
              discrepancies relating to unitarity of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-  Masakawa matrix
              describing weak quark decays and transitions.  Both experiments are high
              priority activities in contemporary  nuclear physics and studies of fundamental
              symmetries.  Development, construction, and utilization of major state-of-the- 
              art equipment is integral to this activity.  Education of  graduate students is
               a strong component in every aspect of this  grant.  ***
