Abstract    :
              9503779  Kareem  One objective of the project concerns the design and 
              development of control systems to maintain optimal dumping  levels in sloshing
              dampers (TSD) and in tuned liquid column  dampers (TLCD) under varied loading
              conditions.  Presently  installed systems are not operating at an optimal level
              of  damping at all times thus, this project will develop semi-  active systems
              involving variable opening screen or baffles  for TSDs and variable orifices
              for TLCDs for maintaining  optimal damping values.  Analysis of these designs
              will  include single dampers as well as multiple slightly detuned  damper
              configurations to benefit from their favorable  dynamic characteristics.  The
              other objective addresses the  shortcomings of current passive liquid dampers,
              i.e., their  sluggishness in responding to sudden loads.  Initial liquid 
              oscillations will be introduced experimentally to make the  inertial damping
              system more effective.  Numerical models  and physical scale models will be
              used to evaluate the  performance of the next generation of liquid dampers. 
              Advances in the design and development of these systems will  result in
              increased safety and decreased structural and  economic losses.  ***
