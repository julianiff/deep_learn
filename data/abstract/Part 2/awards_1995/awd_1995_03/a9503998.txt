Abstract    :
              Brooks  9503998  The objective of this proposal is the development novel and
              efficient computational approaches to free energy perturbation (FEP)
              calculations.  FEP  calculations, carried out extensively on high performance
              parallel computing systems, hold a great potential for assisting the unraveling
              of questions regarding structure, dynamics and thermodynamics of biological
              macromolecules.  In this project they will (a) explore the development of new
              extended sytem methods for chemical FEP calculations which allow the
              conventional variables associated with "progress" in the chemical coordinates
              to evolve dynamically; (b) systematically determine an umbrella or biasing
              potential used in sampling, (c) develop new techiques to further extend and
              automate the processing methods and advance the error analysis capabilities of
              weighted histogram analysis method.
