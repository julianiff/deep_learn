Abstract    :
              This award provides support for a three-day conference on  computational number
              theory to be held in honor of Professor  A.O.L. Atkin.  The conference, which
              will take place on September  14-16, 1995, at the University of Illinois at
              Chicago, will focus  on two fundamental aspects of computation in number
              theory.  The  first of these concerns development of computational techniques 
              to conduct experimentation and support conjectures in the pure  theory of
              numbers, especially in areas related to modular forms;  the second deals with
              applications of techniques from the pure  theory to algorithmic problems such
              as those arising in  factoring, primality testing, and counting points on
              algebraic  varieties.    This research is in the field of number theory.  This
              subject  area has its historical roots in the study of the whole numbers, 
              addressing such questions as the divisibility of one whole number  by another. 
              It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and  was pursued for many
              centuries for mainly aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century
              it has become an  indispensable tool in diverse applications in areas such as
              data  transmission and processing, and the design of communication  systems.
