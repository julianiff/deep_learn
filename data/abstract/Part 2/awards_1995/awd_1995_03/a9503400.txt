Abstract    :
              This award supports the collaboration of Dr. Dale Webster, Department of
              Biology, Illinois Institute of Technology and Professor Tsutomu Unemoto,
              Laboratory of Membrane Biochemistry, Chiba University.  Project funding will
              enable Dr. Webster to spend ten months in Japan, resident at Chiba University,
              in order to study the sodium pump of aerobic bacteria and to investigate this
              pumps involvement in oxidative metabolism. The growing field of the
              biotechnological use of microorganisms necessitates the accumulation of
              knowledge concerning their metabolism in general and in particular, of their
              respiratory chain and its connection to ion transport across cell membranes. 
              This project brings together research scientists from two countries working in
              the area of cell physiology. The U.S. scientist will have the opportunity to
              become familiar with research techniques, equipment, and facilities at Chiba
              University while contributing to the overall research effort. Additionally, the
              extended visit by Webster will help him to establish a personal and
              professional link with a leading research er in Japan. Therefore, this proposal
              fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of
              scientific knowledge through an international collaboration.
