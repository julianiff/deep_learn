Abstract    :
              Analysis, interpretation and publication of oceanographic observations in the
              Gulf Stream and its deep western boundary current off North Carolina will be
              completed to understand conductivity effects on motionally induced electric
              fields and to determine how the deep flow on the Blake-Bahamas Ridge is
              structured and maintained and how future monitoring of this undercurrent could
              be used as an indicator of climate change.
