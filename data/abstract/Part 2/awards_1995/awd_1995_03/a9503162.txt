Abstract    :
              Mitchell  9503162  This postdoctoral research will be on developing novel
              techniques for the automatic programming of decentralized parallel
              architectures such as cellular automata.  Preliminary research performed has
              shown that genetic algorithms (GAs) are promising techniques for designing
              one-dimensional cellular automata to perform computations.  The major effort
              will be in extending the work from one- to two-dimensional systems, which will
              allow the design techniques to apply to real-world parallel computation
              problems such as image processing, pattern recognition, and image compression. 
              This extension will require a number of advances in the theory of spatial
              parallel computation as well as in the theory and application of genetic
              algorithms.
