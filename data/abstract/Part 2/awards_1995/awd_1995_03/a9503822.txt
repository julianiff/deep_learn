Abstract    :
              The value of many important applications of survey data in academic research and
              public   policy-making hinges on the accuracy of the assessments provided. 
              This Small Grant for   Exploratory Research (SGER) will collect data from the
              1994 state-wide elections in Ohio   as part of a field experiment to examine
              the impact of questionnaire format on the   predictive value of mail surveys
              versus telephone interview methods for forecasting   election results. 
              Previous analyses of statewide elections in Ohio have demonstrated that  
              self-administered mail surveys provide more accurate forecasts than telephone
              surveys.    One possible explanation for this surprising result is that the
              mail surveys employed a   different questionnaire format than the telephone
              surveys.  This research will examine the   impact of questionnaire format on
              accuracy by manipulating the form of the questionnaire   administered by both
              mail and telephone modes immediately prior to the 1994 Ohio   elections.  In
              addition, this research will explore the impact of enhanced call-backs to  
              telephone respondents on accuracy.  This research effort should both advance
              basic survey   measurement theory and provide a set of practical
              recommendations to analysts interested   in maximizing measurement accuracy.
