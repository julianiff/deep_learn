Abstract    :
              9503449  Masur     This proposal concerns the geometry of Teichmuller space and
              the mapping class group. The proposer will use methods from complex geometry,
              probability, and dynamical systems to study Teichmuller metrics. In particular,
              the proposer wishes to consider random walks on Teichmuller space to study
              rigidity problems about the mapping class group.    Teichmuller space
              represents the totality of pretzel-like surfaces with a fixed topological type;
              these surfaces, so called Riemann surfaces of a fixed genus, are crucial in the
              study of complex-valued functions as they generalize the complex number field.
              And the proposed research seeks to understand  Teichmuller space from a
              geometric and metric point of view.
