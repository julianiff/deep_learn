Abstract    :
              9503613  Devine    This Americas Program award will support a research 
              collaboration between Dr. Joseph Devine, Brown University,  Providence, Rhode
              Island, and Dr. William Ambeh, Seismic  Research Unit, University of the West
              Indies, St. Augustine,  Trinidad.  The objective of the proposed research is to
               apply recently developed petrologic methods of volcanic  hazard assessment to
              active volcanoes on the islands of  Montserrat and Nevis, located in the Lesser
              Antilles  volcanic arc.    The researchers aim to identify mechanisms 
              influencing past eruptions  by using  new methods to  calculate the ascent
              times of volcanic eruptive products  from magma reservoirs to the surface.  
              Estimates of past  magma rise times, combined with present-day seismic and 
              ground deformation data, could shed light on past volcano  kinetics and could
              provide some potentially valuable  information about past eruptions.  
              Additionally  the  project offers the opportunity for  U.S. scientists to test 
              the feasibility of applying models developed during the Mt.  St. Helens
              eruption.    Besides improving our knowledge of magma flows inside  volcanoes,
              this project is likely to have an impact on  volcano hazard assessment for the
              islands of the Lesser  Antilles.    ***
