Abstract    :
              9503827  Pan    This award supports the collaboration of Dr. Austin Pan,  School
              of Civil Engineering, Purdue University and Mr.  Mitsuo Miyazaki, Sumitomo
              Construction Company, Tokyo,  Japan.  Project funding will enable Dr. Pan to
              spend six  months in Japan, resident at the Sumitomo Construction  Company, in
              order to learn about viscous-damping walls from  the inventor of this
              technology, Mr. Miyazaki.  Working  together, they will share their knowledge
              and experience to  expedite the development of viscous-damping walls and its 
              application for earthquake resistant construction.    This project brings
              together research scientists from two  countries working in the area of
              earthquake engineering. The  U. S. scientist will have the opportunity to
              become familiar  with research techniques, equipment, and facilities at 
              Sumitomo Construction Company while contributing to the  overall research
              effort. This collaboration will not only be  mutually beneficial to the U.S.
              and Japan, it will also  benefit all countries where earthquakes offer a
              prevailing  threat.  Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of  the
              Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific  knowledge through an
              international collaboration.  ***
