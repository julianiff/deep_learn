Abstract    :
              9503062  Weiss       A principal goal of this project is to determine the
              Hochschild and cyclic cohomology groups for the full algebra of bounded Hilbert
              space operators relative to an arbitrary 2-sided ideal. These computations have
              been recently linked to characterizing commutator ideals. Trace extensions and
              the structure of commutators and commutator spaces will be investigated and
              exploited to yield information on the homology, determinants and K-theory of
              operator ideals.       This project lies at the interface of two mathematical
              areas. On one side, the project concerns delicate explicit computations of 
              commutators of operators. Operator theory evolved as an abstraction of the
              equations of mathematical physics. A commutator corresponds to the difference
              between ordered observations. In another direction, a collection of operators
              can often be considered as an algebraic structure called an operator algebra.
              Certain invariants of such algebras play an important role in several
              disciplines including mathematical physics and geometry. The purpose of this
              project is to realize these invariants by performing delicate commutator
              computations.  ***
