Abstract    :
                9503764  Loretz    This award supports the collaboration of Dr. Christopher 
              Loretz, Department of Biological Sciences, the State  University of New York at
              Buffalo and Drs. Tetsuya Hirano  and Yoshio Takei at the Ocean Research
              Institute of the  University of Tokyo.  Project funding will enable Dr. Loretz 
              to spend four months in Japan, resident at the Ocean  Research Institute, in
              order to study the structure/activity  and evolutionary relationships of a
              hormone family, the  natriuretic peptides.    This proposal brings together
              research scientists from two  countries working in the area of fish
              endocrinology and  physiology.  The project provides a unique opportunity to 
              bring together the electrophysiological expertise of Dr.  Loretz with the
              biochemical and endocrinological expertise  of Drs. Hirano and Takei on the
              characterization of  natriuretic peptides(s) from a fish, the euryhaline goby 
              Gillichthys mirabilis.  The U. S. scientist will have the  opportunity to
              become familiar with research techniques,  data, equipment, and facilities at
              the Ocean Research  Institute while contributing to the overall research
              effort.  Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of the  Program in
              its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge  through an international
              collaboration.  ***
