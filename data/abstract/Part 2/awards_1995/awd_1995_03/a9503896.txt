Abstract    :
              9503896  Nystuen    This technology development project is to test and improve
              an  acoustic inversion algorithm to measure rain from the ambient sound  field
              within the ocean.  The underwater sound field produced by  rain upon the
              surface contains information about drop size  distribution within the rain. 
              Rainfall is an important mechanism  for exchanging heat and certain chemicals
              such as carbon between  the oceans and atmosphere, but measurements are sparse
              and  difficult to make.  The technique to be developed will allow  estimation
              of rainfall over a broad area by using remote ocean  drifters and buoys. 
              Rainfall upon the ocean surface can be  detected by underwater sensors and the
              type and relative intensity  of rainfall may be determined by examining the
              acoustic  characteristics.  The acoustic technique to be validated will  be
              able to differentiate between rain types (stratiform vs.  convective) by
              drop-size analysis and provide a rapid temporal  response for accurate
              estimates of rainfall over large spatial  scales.  This project involves the
              placement of acoustic receivers  offshore from two locations where there is
              doppler weather radar  coverage.  Acoustic signals received and isolated from
              the ambient  sound field in the ocean will be compared with radar images of 
              overlying rainfall so that quantitative estimates of rain can be  associated
              with specific acoustic signatures.  If successful,  acoustic sensors can then
              be placed in remote areas of the oceans  to greatly expand available data on
              rainfall amounts that are  important to studies of climate variability.
