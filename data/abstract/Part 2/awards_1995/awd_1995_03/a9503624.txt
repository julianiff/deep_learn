Abstract    :
              9503624  Hey  This renewal will support continued analysis of data collected to 
              examine the structure of a section of the mid-ocean ridge system  which is
              spreading at the fastest rates known.  The results will  provide insight into
              the formation of microplates and deformation  of ocean crust, and the
              space-time evolution of ridge segments.  ***
