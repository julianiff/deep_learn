Abstract    :
                    9503956  Triantafyllidis  The proposed study is a combined experimental
              and modeling effort  to provide a consistent, time-efficient general purpose
              formulation  for the design against springback, due to external load removal
              and  trimming, of stamped aluminum panels with arbitrary geometries.   The
              basic idea in this work is the efficient use of the membrane  solution of the
              sheet at the end of the punching phase in order to  predict its final
              elastically relaxed shape.  An initial  experimental/analytical feasibility
              study which used the proposed  idea has been completed for axisymmetric
              stampings.  In the present  investigation the plan is to generalize the results
              of the  axisymmetric study to stampings with arbitrary geometry.  A general 
              asymptotic modeling technique is proposed to formulate the problem  in question
              and a set of automotive production dies is also  planned.  The results of the
              modeling work will be incorporated  into a general purpose FEM code which will
              be used for design  purposes by GM and ALCOA as part of an Industry-University 
              Collaborative Project under the GOALI Initiative.  ***
