Abstract    :
              9503895  A study of key aspects of the hydrodynamics and thermodynamics of the
              large scale ocean circulation will be conducted in the theoretical framework
              provided by the flux form of the potential vorticity (PV) equation and the
              associated theorems of 'invertibility' and 'impermeability'. The geographical
              distribution of PV and PV flux lines will be mapped, to the extent that models
              and climatological data allow it, and the resulting patterns studied and
              interpreted. Using a hierarchy of models and theory, the physics of, and the
              global connections between, the 'entry' and 'exit' points of potential
              vorticity will be exposed and their dependence on the interplay of mechanical
              and thermodynamical forcing at the boundary of the ocean elucidated.
