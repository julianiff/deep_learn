Abstract    :
              9503308  Fouke  This proposal supports part of a conference on Engineering  in
              Medicine and Biology, namely that part that deals with  "Tissue Engineering".  
               This support will bring together leading researchers in this  area, provide a
              forum for discussion of developments and  future work, and at the same time
              provide an opportunity for  interested parties to gain a wider knowledge of
              this new and  important sub-field in bioengineering.  ***
