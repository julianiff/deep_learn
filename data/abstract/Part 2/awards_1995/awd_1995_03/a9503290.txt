Abstract    :
              9503290 Khoshnevisan  Abstract    The N-parameter Brownian sheet is a mean zero
              Gaussian process which is obtained by integrating standard white noise on
              N-dimensional rectangles with two sides on the axes.  The investigator and his
              colleagues propose to investigate some of the probabilistic and analytical
              properties of this process. This process locally exhibits many features of the
              solutions to a class of stochastic partial differential equations. As such, our
              proposed analysis would have ramifications in the study of hyperbolic
              stochastic partial differential equations. Also considered will be the
              properties of the graph of the Brownian sheet viewed as a non-smooth random
              surface.  The problems of interest include certain questions involving
              transport problems on some random erratic fractures and surfaces. Idealized
              versions of such objects appear in recent investigations in the engineering and
               physics literature.    The proposed research involves a systematic study of a
              class of random processes which arise in several areas of mathematics as well
              as in physics and engineering. Such problems include but are not limited to
              transport problems, wave phenomena and turbulence. The underlying common theme
              in many such problems is a mathematical object called the Brownian sheet.  With
              only a few exceptions, the geometry of the Brownian sheet is a largely
              unexplored area; primarily due to the fact that there are not many general
              methods for its study. Among other works, it is the goal of this proposal to
              make some attempts at remedying this situation.
