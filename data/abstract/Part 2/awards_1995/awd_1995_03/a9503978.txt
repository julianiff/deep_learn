Abstract    :
              9503978  Seidel  The cross fertilization across different disciplines that has
              been the hallmark of many successful fields of computational science has been
              slow to occur in Numerical relativity.  The proposal is designed to bring
              maturity to a promising new approach for solving Einstein's equations, based on
              a new formulation that casts them in an explicitly first order,
              flux-conservative, hyperbolic form.  This approach opens the door to borrowing
              powerful modern algorithms from other fields.  Building on this the PI's  plan
              to incorporate appropriate mathematical formalisms, scaleable computers,
              sophisticated parallel and numerical algorithms (including advanced methods for
              hyperbolic systems and optimized linear solvers) and experimental scientific
              visualization techniques (such as virtual reality) into a single code.  A
              preliminary version has already been developed with this global approach,
              running with outstanding performance on fundamentally different parallel
              architectures.   The PI's propose the construction of a general controller that
              distributes computation, visualization, and data analysis across the
              metacenter.  The physical applications will include: a general 3D gravitational
              wave laboratory, 3D black hole simulations, bosonic stars as a testbed for
              colliding objects, and fully general relativistic hydrodynamics. A single, very
              general and powerful research tool can be developed, and the resulting
              experience can be applied into other fields of computational science, making
              this proposal a truly multidisciplinary effort.
