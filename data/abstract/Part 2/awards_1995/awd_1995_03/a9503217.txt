Abstract    :
              9503217  Connell  The objectives of this project are to measure the effects of
              ground-dwelling vertebrates and mycorrhizal fungi on the seedlings and saplings
              in the shaded understory of an Australian tropical rainforest. The
              investigators will use field enclosure experiments, greenhouse growth
              experiments, and quantitative surveys in the field to determine the role of
              animals and fungi in the maintenance of species diversity in tropical forests.
              These effects have rarely been studied outside the new world tropics, and
              seldom tested experimentally anywhere. Second, these effects will be studies
              with controlled field experiments to test the suggestions from other studies
              that these animals help maintain plant diversity in rainforests. This is
              important for wildlife management and the conservation of biodiversity, because
              large vertebrates are vulnerable to hunting and poaching in parks, and their
              numbers have been reduced in many tropical rainforests, which could then lead
              to a decrease in the diversity of trees, among other species, in these tropical
              forests.
