Abstract    :
              Kucharz  DMS 95-03138    This award supports the research of Professors W.
              Kucharz to work  in real algebraic geometry. In particular he will study real 
              algebraic morphisms and vector bundles on real algebraic varieties.  There will
              be particular emphasis on methods to explicitly  calculate invariants using
              techniques from intersection theory and  K-theory.    This research is in the
              field of algebraic geometry, one of the  oldest parts of modern mathematics,
              but one which blossomed to the  point where it has, in the past 10 years,
              solved problems that have  stood for centuries. Originally, it treated figures
              defined in the  plane by the simplest of equations, namely polynomials. Today,
              the  field uses methods not only from algebpa, but also from analysis  and
              topology, and conversely it is extensively used in those  fields.  Moreover it
              has proved itself useful in fields as diverse  as physics, theoretical computer
              science, cryptography, coding  theory and robotics.
