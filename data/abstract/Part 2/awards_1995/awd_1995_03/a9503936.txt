Abstract    :
              9503936  Beckham  The Georgia Institute of Technology will acquire a
              multinuclear  solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer.  The 
              instrument will support and significantly enhance the research  efforts of five
              promary investigators in the fields of  polymers, fibers, ceramics, and
              inorganic materials.  Four of  the investigators (Abhiraman, Beckham, Rees, and
              Tolbert)  represent four separate academic units within Georgia Tech  (Chemical
              Engineering, Textile & Fiber Engineering, Materials  Science & Engineering,
              Chemistry & Biochemistry), while the  fifth (Mariam) is from Clark-Atlanta
              University, an institution  closely allied with Georgia Tech both
              professionally and  geographically.  The common thread connecting all five 
              investigators is the production of macromolecular solids:  Such  materials are
              being either improved or prepared de novo.  Advanced experimental NMR applied
              to relevant problems of  materials improvement and development represents the
              major  theme of these interdisciplinary groups.  The purchase of this  400-Mhz
              solid-state NMR spectrometer with 9.4-Telsa wide-bore  magnet, will have
              significant impact on materials research and  education programs at Georgia
              Tech and Clark-Atlanta  University.  ***
