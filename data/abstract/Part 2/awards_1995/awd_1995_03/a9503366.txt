               Comparisons and Applications of Local and Global Search         This is first
              year finding for a three year continuing grant.   Scientists and engineers
              seeking practical ways to solve difficult  combinatorial optimization problems
              are increasingly turning to  local search and genetic algorithms.  In addition,
              the past five  years has seen a dramatic increase in researchers proposing new 
              variants on these techniques, especially genetic algorithms.   Recent work on
              genetic algorithms has strongly suggested the best  algorithms interweave local
              search and genetic search techniques.   This research has four main objectives:
               1) produce a suite of  local search methods and stochastic hill-climbing
              algorithms to  test the difficulty of optimization problems, 2) produce a new
              test  suite of complex problems which are resistant to local search and 
              stochastic hill-climbing, 3) produce new hybridized genetic  algorithms that
              can be sued to produce state-of-the-art results for  applications in computer
              vision and geophysics, 4) conduct  comparative studies of the major genetic
              algorithm search  paradigms, including hybrids which utilize local search.  In 
              pursuit of this fourth objective, it will be necessary to compare  different
              genetic algorithms, local search algorithms, and hybrids  on both the
              controlled test suite of problems as well as large  problems of practical
              importance.
