Abstract    :
              9503398  Jockusch       This project concerns mathematical logic and its
              connections  with other areas of mathematics, especially algebra and analysis. 
               Carl Jockusch will work in computability theory (recursion theory)   and its
              connections with other areas.  In particular, he will   study degrees of
              unsolvability, both in their own right and  in connection with effective
              combinatorics, group theory, and   algebra.  L. van den Dries will investigate
              expansions of the   real field by quasi-analytic classes of functions that are 
               familiar from analysis.  The goal is to prove o-minimality and   polynomial
              boundedness of such expansions.  This is part of an   effort to create a
              framework for solving Hilbert's 16th problem   on limit cycles and similar
              problems.       Mathematical logic provides a precise framework for
              mathematical  assertions and deductive systems.  It also provides a precise
              concept of   computability by abstract computers, i.e. ones without limitations
              of   running time or memory space.  Jockusch will study the theory of 
              computability and its connections with other branches of mathematics. 
              Theoretical limitations on what can be computed and the possibility of 
              computing information given access to other information are of central 
              interest for this research.  In particular, he will analyze questions  related
              to computability in algebra and number theory.  Lou van den Dries  will work in
              analytic geometry, using tools from mathematical logic,  especially model
              theory.  These investigations are expected to shed new  light on questions
              about analytic vector fields.  Information gained in  current research on real
              numbers is presently being applied to many areas,  including robotics and
              neural networks.  ***
