Abstract    :
              This award will continue support to Professor Moncrief to  carry out
              mathematical physics studies related to  theoretical gravitation.  The work to
              be carried out  includes studies of cosmological singularities, the  constraint
              equations for gravitation; and the study of phase  space for general
              relativity.    Professor Moncrief is one of the few investigators capable  of
              making progress on the hard mathematical questions which  arise from Einstein's
              theory of gravitation.  This research  will have important consequences for
              both theoretical  physics and pure mathematics.
