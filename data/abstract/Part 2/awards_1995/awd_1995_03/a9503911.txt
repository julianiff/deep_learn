Abstract    :
              9503911  McNamara  This project connects Fremont Newark Community College
              District to  the Internet.  This connection provides faculty and staff  access
              to the resources available on the Internet (including, but  not limited to
              e-mail and educational LISTSERV discussion groups)  and provide students access
              to the resources available on the  Internet.  These connections provide
              operations management and  information services and give the college a 56
              thousand  bits per second connection to the Internet.    The benefits of this
              connection include e-mail between local  and remote researchers and educators,
              file transfer capability and  the ability to use remote computer resources. 
              Also the college  obtains the ability to investigate innovation in educational 
              resources and incorporate them into their curricula.
