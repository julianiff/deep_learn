Abstract    :
              9503785  Magill    This U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Science Program award, which 
              has been approved by Argentina, supports travel expenses for  the P.I., Dr. R.
              Magill, Missouri Botanical Gardens (MBG),  St. Louis, Missouri to Buenos Aires,
              Argentina.  Dr. Magill  will supervise the installation of an INTERNET
              connection  between MBG and  the Instituto Darwinion (ID), San  Isidro, 
              Argentina, and  train personnel on  INTERNET, TELNET and  TROPICOS operations. 
              Support is also included for the  purchase of  permanent computer equipment,
              some programming  and  computer time, and one year maintenance of a dedicated 
              line, required to establish the connection.  The ID is  committed to supporting
              the dedicated line after the first  year of operations.    The Catalogue of the
              Vascular plants of Argentina is a  collaborative research effort between  MBG
              in the U.S. and  the ID in Argentina.  Its objective is to produce an  updated,
              computerized inventory of the flora of Argentina as  both a published document
              and as an electronic database.  Most of the information for the catalog is
              captured at the  ID, utilizing a personal computer version of  TROPICOS, the 
              software developed  by MBG. Every six month, the data is sent to MBG, and
              merged  with the TROPICOS database.  This process is cumbersome and  expensive,
              and will be eliminated by the direct INTERNET  connection.  The INTERNET link
              will provide project  personnel at the ID with direct access to all the
              resources  of  the INTERNET, and in particular to the TROPICOS  database. At
              the same time, MBG and the U.S. scientific  community will benefit directly
              from the information on  Argentine plants that will be added to the  TROPICOS
              database and to MBG's Gopher and World Wide Web  servers.  The connection will
              also be available to  scientists from a number of other institutions in
              Argentina,  such as the Instituto Miguel Lillo, INTI and Instituto de  Botanica
              del Noroeste, and will thus prove a  link to these  institutions.       ***
