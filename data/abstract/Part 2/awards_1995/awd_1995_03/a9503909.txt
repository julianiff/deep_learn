Abstract    :
              9503909  Martin    This spectrometer will be used by six research groups in the 
              departments of Materials Science and Engineering, Chemical  Engineering, and
              Chemistry at Iowa State University, and in  the Physics Department at Coe
              College.  Currently supported  research projects on chalcogenide and oxide
              glasses,  amorphous and polycrystalline thin films, polycrystals,  crystals,
              and photosynthetic systems will benefit from  increased speed in data
              acquisition, dependability,  reliability, and ease of use with this new system.
