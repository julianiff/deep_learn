Abstract    :
              9503222  Garcia       A three-year plan is proposed for the collection and study
               of rocks from the southwest rift zone of Mauna Loa volcano,  Hawaii.  Many
              rocks from this area are picrites and it is  possible that the deep eruptions
              are a result of density  filtering of the magmas due to pooling of dense magmas
              deep  within the conduit system.  The alternative is that the lavas  exposed on
              the proposed slump surface are older than subaerial  lavas and therefore show a
              temporal variation of chemistry of  lavas.  These lavas are particularly
              interesting because they are  the most Mg-rich lavas ever found on Hawaii or
              other similar  island and these glasses can tell us much about how the mantle 
              melts and how the melts are transported to the surface.  ***
