Abstract    :
                 Problems in propositional logic, such as Boolean  satisfiability,  are
              studied from the point of view of   developing practical  algorithms, although
              the problems are often NP-complete or   co-NP-complete.  Such problems are of
              practical importance in VLSI  design   verification, test  generation, related
              CAD applications,  as well as automated   verification.  Many other 
              applications also occur naturally.    E.g., higher  order theorem  provers
              require a satisfiability checker as a   module.  Recent  hardware advances
              bring solution of some of these problems    within reach.  Algorithms are being
              implemented and tested for  performance   in typical  applications, such as
              test pattern  generation, sequential   circuit verification,  and program 
              verification.    Model search (usually called   the Davis-Putnam  method) and 
              resolution are two well known, but somewhat   conflicting,  strategies for
              solving propositional satisfiability.  Model    search ``succeeds''  by
              discovering a satisfying assignment,  whereas resolution   ``succeeds'' by 
              detecting that no such  assignment exists.  Some work on   combining the two
              ideas  in one  algorithm has recently appeared.  This project   investigates
              more  powerful combinations of these methods.  Besides resolution,   
              recognition can be valuable.  The goal is to identify    contexts in which 
              resolution, equality recognition, and other  inferences can   be beneficial in 
              reducing the search space.  Equally important is to find   implementations,
              usually  requiring advanced data structures.      Another goal is  the
              development of application-independent  methods.    Heuristics described in 
              the literature for particular  applications are examined to   determine whether
               the application  content can be abstracted away, making the   heuristic
              applicable  to a logic problem without knowing its origin.
