Abstract    :
              9503257  HATCHER      Although dissolved organic carbon (DOM) in the oceans
              plays a major  role in the global biogeochemical cycling of carbon, we know
              little  of its known composition and origin. Terrestrial contribution to  the
              DOM has traditionally been estimated from analytically  determined amounts of
              lignin-derived materials produced from  oxidative degradation by CuO. Recently,
              a new thermal degradative  technique has emerged as a powerful tool to examine
              the chemical  components of lignin. This proposed study seeks to develop and 
              evaluate this technique for the characterization of lignin in DOM  from marine
              and riverine systems. Aside from showing greater  specificity for
              lignin-derived material, the method  (thermolysis/gas) chromatography with
              teramethyl ammonium  hydroxide) is easily implemented in most modern
              laboratories, in  contrast to the traditional CuO oxidation. Similar lignin
              phenol  parameters are obtained and the technique is believed to recover  the
              lignin signature from samples which have been extensively  degraded, unlike the
              CuO method. If this method is tested to  compare well with the CuO procedure,
              it would provide a rapid and  more easily applied method of evaluating the
              terrestrial  composition of marine and riverine DOM.
