Abstract    :
              Abstract   Schofield   CTS-9503660      The PI proposes to investigate the
              combustion chemistries of As, Sb, Se, and Hg, four toxic metals, whose presence
              can be of concern in coal combustion and incinerator effluents.  From the
              measured profiles of the atoms, oxides, and chlorides of these metals obtained
              from seeded H2/O2/N2 or H2/O2/Ar flat premixed flames using laser induced
              fluorescence and emission spectroscopic techniques, he plans to deduce their
              distributions and those of other possible unidentified species containing these
              metals as a function of temperature.  This information can lead to relevant
              thermochemical data such as bond energies and heats of formation for these
              species fop which no reliable data presently exists and to mechanistic insights
              involving the kinetics of these species.
