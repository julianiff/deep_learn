Abstract    :
              9503610  Zhu    This proposal supports the collaboration of Dr. Da-Ming Zhu, 
              Department of Physics, University of Missouri at Kansas City and  Dr. Hiroshi
              Kawazoe of the Research Laboratory of Engineering  Materials of the Tokyo
              Institute of Technology.   Project funding will enable Dr. Zhu to spend three
              months in  Japan, resident at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, in order to 
              participate in on-going research projects on ionic glasses, and  learn the
              techniques and methods used in synthesizing advanced  materials in Dr.
              Kawazoe's group.    This proposal brings together research scientists from two 
              countries working in the area of condensed matter physics and  materials
              research.  The U. S. scientist will have the  opportunity to become familiar
              with research techniques, data,  equipment, and facilities at the Tokyo
              Institute of Technology  while contributing to the overall research effort. 
              Therefore,  this proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in its 
              exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through an  international
              collaboration.  ***
