Abstract    :
              Abstract  950323  Long    The Gordon Research Conference on the Physics and
              Chemistry of Laser Diagnostics in Combustion has been held biennially since
              1981.  The 1995 meeting will be held in July, 1995 at Plymouth State College in
              New Hampshire.  The purpose of this conference is to examine closely and to
              discuss freely the chemical and physical foundations of the various laser
              diagnostic techniques, including issues such as quenching, energy transfer,
              quantitative species concentration measurements, line spacings, line shapes,
              widths and convolutions, and measurement biases.  New themes of the 1995 Gordon
              Conference will include laser diagnostics of resonant wave-mixing techniques,
              the interaction between modeling of chemical flame structure and laser
              diagnostics, and the metrology of particle diagnostics.  The emphasis of the
              conference is directed toward the science of the measurement approaches, not
              upon the meaning of the measurements to combustion per se.  The invited
              speakers and discussion leaders include both researchers specializing in the
              development and application of laser diagnostics in combustion as well as
              investigators from basic areas not directly involved in laser diagnostics.   
              The major products of this conference will be the exchange of information
              between researchers on the cutting edge of this technology area, hopefully
              leading to synergism which will result in further advances, and a final report
              which will summarize the activities of the conference.
