Abstract    :
              This research addresses computation of reachable states for VLSI  designs
              described in high-level languages and the application of  these results to
              automatic test pattern generation (ATPG).  Methods  to compute symbolically the
              set of states reachable from an initial  state are being explored.  An extended
              finite state machine (ESFM)  model, which can represent communication protocols
              and hardware  behavior, is being used.  A key idea is that the model allows use
               of arbitrary state variables, such as boolean and arithmetic, which  will
              provide efficiency in computation.  Methods and prototype  tools to convert
              automatically a design in VHDL to an ESFM are  being developed.  These methods
              and  techniques are being applied  to ATPG for sequential circuit test.
