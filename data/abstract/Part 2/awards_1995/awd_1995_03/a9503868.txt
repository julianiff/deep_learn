Abstract    :
              The objective of this award is to compile data on the  thermodynamic
              characteristics of lipids, with a view to providing  ready access to the data
              itself and to the appropriate  literature. An intact, selectively permeable
              membrane or system  of membranes is an essential feature of the living cell.
              The  membrane is in essence a bimolecular lipid leaflet in and on  which are
              situated a variety of proteins and other molecules.  There exists a wealth of
              information on lipid phase behavior much  of which is scattered throughout the
              literature in a variety of  journals, books and proceedings both foreign and
              domestic. The  intention is to compile the data in a single, continuously 
              revised relational database. The database will be accessed on-  line. Disk,
              CD-ROM as well as hard copies of the data will be  released periodically. The
              compilation will include a tabulation  of all known mesomorphic and polymorphic
              phase transition  temperatures and enthalpies for synthetic and biologically- 
              derived lipids in the dry and in the partially and fully hydrated  states.
