Abstract    :
              Quantitative models of the human speech production system are needed for a
              better understanding of our  cognitive abilities and for the development of
              high-quality speech synthesizers and automatic speech  recognition systems.  In
              the proposed research, production models for fricative consonants are 
              developed. Modeling fricative consonants has always been a challenging problem
              because of the complex  production mechanisms and the lack of sufficient
              articulatory and aerodynamic data for these sounds.  In this study,
              articulatory data are obtained from Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) and Dynamic
               Electropalatography (EPG), and aerodynamic data, from flow and pressure
              measurements. MRI reveals the 3D geometry of the vocal tract while EPG is
              important for studying articulatory dynamics. Aerodynamic data are crucial for
              studying turbulence generation during fricative production. The modeling
              approach is based on estimation theory, acoustics, and signal-processing
              techniques and uses the data obtained from the unified set of measurements
              described above.  Although the study focuses on fricatives, the proposed  novel
              approach can be used to study all speech sounds.  In addition, the study
              fosters cross-disciplinary activities in Electrical Engineering, Radiology, and
              Linguistics.  By developing  parametric speech production models and by
              inferring articulatory dynamics from the acoustic waveform,  better performance
              of speech synthesizers and speech recognition systems can be achieved.
