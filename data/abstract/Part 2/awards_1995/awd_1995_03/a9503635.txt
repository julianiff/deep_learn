Abstract    :
              9503635  Wentworth     This project lies in the area of smooth four-manifolds,
              more specifically, Donaldson theory. The investigator wants to find necessary
              and sufficient conditions for the existence of symplectic structures on smooth
              four-manifolds; to find the Donaldson series for the complex projective plane;
              to understand how the Donaldson series is affected under certain birational
              transformations.    The modern study of smooth four-dimensional spaces was
              initiated, in large measure, by the work of Simon Donaldson in the early
              eighties; Donaldson used ideas from theoretical physics - Yang-Mills equations
              and gauge theories - in an ingenious way to help classify smooth
              four-manifolds. It is worth mentioning that Nathan Seiberg and Edward Witten
              have recently come up with an easier and more direct theory of smooth
              four-manifolds, again motivated by ideas from theoretical physics, namely
              monopoles and string theory.
