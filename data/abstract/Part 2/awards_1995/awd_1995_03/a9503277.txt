              emissions can potentially change the regional and global  climate through their
              greenhouse interaction with reaction with  radiation and though their
              photochemical interaction with ambient  atmospheric species such as ozone. 
              Supersonic aircraft exhaust  adds water vapor, NOx, CO2, sulfur, soot, and
              cloud condensation  nuclei to high altitudes (20 km) in the stratosphere. 
              Current  atmospheric forcing by aircraft emission will no doubt be amplified 
              by the increased supersonic fleet planned by 2015.  A microwave  radiative
              transfer model can be enhanced to work with Global  Climate-Middle Atmosphere
              Model (GCMAM) experiments.  These GCMAM  experiments predicted the atmospheric
              impacts of water vapor and  ozone perturbations from supersonic aircraft
              emission.  The  signature of the supersonic ozone and water vapor perturbations
              can  be sought in NOAA satellites'  Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) data  based
              on the GCMAM microwave maps produced by microwave radiative  transfer model. 
              The GCMAM microwave maps can also assess the  progression of changes at
              different altitudes during the GCMAM's  time integration as compared with
              actual satellite data.  Finally,  this would lead into future research
              investigating the importance  of the emission signal relevant to other
              anthropogenic signals and  to natural variability given current and future
              satellite  resolution and sensitivity.    This is a Research Planning Grant.
