Abstract    :
                  9503766  Spanos  This project conducts a research investigation featuring
              improved  models which accurately describe the seismic response of equipment 
              and of some other block-like structural systems.  The approach  undertaken in
              this study considers the impact of the block with the  foundation as a
              continuous process of time.  This impact model  represents the influence of
              most of the important geometrical,  mechanical, and material quantities such as
              material stiffness,  block aspect ratio, value of the coefficient of friction,
              and the  plastic behavior of the structure.  Further, new numerical methods 
              for analysis and design of multi-block systems based on versatile  discrete
              element method will be developed.  Stochastic analysis of  block-like
              structures under earthquake excitations will also be  carried out.  Upon
              developing the theoretical and numerical aspects  of the proposed methods,
              these models and the analyses will be  applied to investigate the design
              problems of a variety of  practical equipment and historical monuments
              structures.  ***
