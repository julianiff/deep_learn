Abstract    :
              An analytical and numerical study to examine the role of shear and irrotational
              waves on the formation of Langmuir cells will be conducted. The instability
              mechanism giving rise to the vortices has as its basis the Craik-Leibovich type
              2 mechanism, because oceanographic observations bring to light limitations with
              these equations, they will not be used to describe the flow. Instead the
              generalized Lagrangian mean equations of Andrews and McIntyre will employed to
              define when the C-L equation is not applicable to the ocean surface mixed
              layer. Actual mean currents from ocean and laboratory observations will be used
              to estimate heat mass and momentum transport within the mixed layer. This work
              is important because Langmuir circulations appear to be an important mixing
              mechanism at the air-sea interface.
