Abstract    :
              9503170  McDonald    The goal of this planning study is to obtain a preliminary
              set of  field measurements that can be used to estimate the algal  consumption
              rate of zebra mussels in a large lake. The proposed  measurements will be
              performed above a bed of zebra mussels during  a period from mid-June to late
              August at a site in the western  basin of Lake Erie that is thermally
              homogenous and, therefore, not  complicated by the effects of stratification.
              Measurements will  include vertical profiles of horizmntal velocities at 25 cm 
              intervals from the mussel bed up to a distance of approximately 3  m above the
              bottom. Concurrent sampling, at the same vertical  resolution, will provide
              profiles of the phytoplankton  concentrations above the bed. These
              distributions will then be used  as input to a one-dimensional equation of
              phytoplankton  concentration that mathematically represents the balance between
               settling, turbulent mixing, and consumption (by zebra mussels) of 
              phytoplankton at the mussel bed. The velocity profiles will be used  to
              estimate values of the vertical distribution of turbulent  diffusivity, which
              together with the phytoplankton concentration  profiles and estimates of
              settling rates obtained from the  literature, provide enough information to
              estimate zebra mussel  consumption directly.
