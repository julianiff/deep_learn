Abstract    :
              9503737  SUTER, ROBERT    This x-ray scattering equipment will be used to
              address a  wide variety of scientific and technological questions  including,
              but not limited to, a) the structure and thermal  behavior of biologically
              relevant lipid membranes, b) the  structure of complex fluid films, c) the
              quality of novel  crystalline semiconductor materials, d) the structure and 
              growth kinetics of thin solid films, e)  the structure of  organic and oxide
              coatings on solid substrates, f) the  structure of layered materials and their
              internal  interfaces, and g) the behavior of polymers and proteins  near
              surfaces.  The research is highly interdisciplinary,  involving ten Carnegie
              Mellon University faculty from five  departments and collaborations between
              university and  industrial researchers.    Funding of this proposal will
              1)accelerate and expand work  on Federally funded research already using
              scattering  techniques, 2) introduce modern scattering techniques into 
              Federally funded research not now using such measurements,  3) strengthen
              existing University-Industry collaborations,  and 4) expand the Pittsburgh area
              user and funding base for  synchrotron x-ray scattering measurements.
