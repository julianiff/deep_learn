Abstract    :
              9503420  McDuff    This grant provides support funding to purchase shipboard 
              instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research.  The instruments  will be
              used aboard the R/V THOMPSON, a 274 foot vessel, which is  owned by the Navy
              and operated by the University.  NSF-funded  scientists are the primary users
              of the ship.  Instrumentation to  be purchased includes PC's to replace aging
              shipboard models, a  color printer, a network upgrade, a mass storage device, a
              CD-ROM  reader, a fluorometer, and spare IMET sensors.  The instrumentation 
              requested is required for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard the  THOMPSON
              during 1995 and will enhance the scientific capability of  the vessel in the
              future.
