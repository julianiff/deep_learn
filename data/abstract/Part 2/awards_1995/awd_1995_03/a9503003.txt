Abstract    :
              This study will investigate mechanisms for scattering high-  frequency (HF)
              radio waves from the mesosphere.  The data to be  used were obtained by a radar
              facility near Midland, Texas, during  a seven-day campaign in March 1994.  The
              results will help answer  some long-standing questions regarding mesospheric
              scattering  processes and remote sensing in the HF band.  A new technique for 
              calculating momentum flux will be implemented and compared with  more
              established methods of momentum flux estimation.
