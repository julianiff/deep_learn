Abstract    :
              9503518  Jensen       The Midwest Geometry Conference is an annual meeting
              dedicated  to the dissemination of important recent advances in differential 
              geometry to the community of midwestern mathematicians.  Each  conference is
              devoted to a small number of topics, and the aim is  to create a focussed
              environment, conducive to a lively exchange of  ideas, in which this regional
              community of geometers can benefit  from contact with some of the leading
              contributors in those  selected fields.  Identifying themselves as active
              members of the  world community of differential geometers gives young 
              mathematicians, in particular, a sense of wider purpose and guides  them into
              more productive and relevant research paths.       A series of three annual
              meetings will be held, respectively,  at Washington University, St. Louis, MO,
              in 1995, at the University  of Oklahoma, Norman, OK, in 1996, and at the
              University of Kansas,  Lawrence, KS, in 1997.  The St. Louis meeting is
              centered on four  plenary addresses: Robert J. Zimmer, University of Chicago,
              on  Differential Geometry, Dynamics, and Rigidity of Group Actions;  Francis
              Bonahon, University of Southern California, on Three-  Manifolds, Hyperbolic
              Geometry, and Foliations; Chuu-Lian Terng,  Northeastern University, on
              Submanifold Theory; Claude Lebrun, SUNY  at Stony Brook, on Kaehler Geometry
              and Special Metrics.  Based on  the experience of previous years, the
              organizers expect the  participation of approximately 60 to 70 faculty
              mathematicians and  graduate students.  ***
