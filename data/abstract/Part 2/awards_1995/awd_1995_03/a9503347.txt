Abstract    :
              9503347  Jena  This grant provides support for speakers, young researchers, 
              postdoctoral associates and graduate students to attend the  "International
              Symposium on Atomically Engineered Materials"  to be held in Richmond,
              Virginia, from October 30 to  November 4, 1995.  This symposium will bring
              together  researchers from around the world and representing many  disciplines
              to discuss issues relating to designing  materials from their basic
              constituents at the atomic level.  The grant is jointly funded by the Divisions
              of Materials  Research and Chemistry.  %%%  ***
