Abstract    :
              95-03344    Bradley    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
              project will address a new capability for digital data acquisition and
              recording of high speed signals over an extended frequency range, from dc to 20
              GigaHertz.  A new instrument, called a transient digitizer, will be able to
              characterize high speed electronics (or any signature convertible to an
              electric signal) by recording these signals and storing them for analysis.   
              Phase I developed a comparator designed to be the basis of an ultra-high speed
              analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with an order-of-magnitude higher performance
              than is currently available.  Phase II goals are to design, fabricate, and test
              the full superconducting ADC system.  Superconducting electronics combine very
              low noise with the high switching speeds required in fast, high-sensitivity
              measurements.    An advantage of this approach is that magnetic flux
              quantitization permits many precise, equally spaced thresholds with a single
              comparator.  ADCs with this characteristic require much less complex circuitry
              and have no need for resistors with very precise values.    Improved digitizers
              would find extensive application in high speed electronics designed for optical
              fiber interfaces, switching networks, communication, and computers.
