Abstract    :
              P.I..  Kamykowski, Daniel   Proposal #:  9503253        PROJECT ABSTRACT      
              Research will examine how various internal cellular characteristics (e.g.,
              chloroplast position, DNA synthesis, lipid storage) correlate with marine
              dinoflagellate orientation during diel vertical migration in several
              environmental contexts.  An understanding of these relationships will lead to
              the development of models that predict how growth and survival of
              photosynthetic populations vary in space and time.  This variability will
              relate directly to the competitive capability of a species in a given water
              mass, to the development of patches at water convergences, and to the formation
              of dense layers within the water column.
