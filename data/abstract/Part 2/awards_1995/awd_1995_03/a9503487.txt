Abstract    :
              9503487  ARNOSTI    The rates at which organic macromolecules are mineralized,
              and  variations in degradation rates with location, depth, and season  are
              critical aspects in calculating the turnover rates of oceanic  organic carbon.
              Recent studies have suggested that large dissolved  polymers, particularly
              polysaccharides, may be rapidly cycled  within the upper ocean. There are
              currently few methods, however,  to directly measure the hydrolysis of organic
              macromolecules in  marine environments. The objective of this pilot project is
              to test  and apply a new method to measure hydrolysis rates of  polysaccharides
              in marine  environments.  The method is based on  synthesis of
              fluorescent-labeled polysaccharides (FLA-  polysaccharides) which can be added
              to seawater or sediments.  Enzymatic hydrolysis of FLA-polysaccharides yields
              labeled  fragments of lower molecular weight. The molecular weight changes  of
              FLA-polysaccharide are determined using gel permeation  chromatography. The end
              result is a profile showing changes in FLA-  polysaccharides molecular weight
              vs. time.
