Abstract    :
              9503538  Batiza       This area of the EPR has been extensively studied and
              Batiza  has collected an impressive set of samples from three transects  that
              cross the ridge axis.  These allow him to evaluate the  evolution of the magma
              chamber over a period of about 1 m.y.  Results to date indicate that one of the
              ridge transects, the one  with less magma, only erupted MORBs but the two other
              erupted a  mixture of N-MORBs and E-MORBs.  There are a number of  alternatives
              for these differences and Batiza wishes to do  additional analyses of the rocks
              in hand to evaluate these  alternatives.  ***
