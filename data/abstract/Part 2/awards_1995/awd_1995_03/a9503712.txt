Abstract    :
                This grant supports the continued development of the  Microbial Germplasm
              Database (MGD) which aids in the sharing  and preservation of microbial
              germplasm by providing needed  information resources. Microbial germplasm is
              used in  genetic engineering, ecology, medicine and biocontrol. No  single
              collection can be expected to maintain the diversity  and breadth of microbial
              germplasm found in nature.  Collections of microbial germplasm maintained by
              individual  researchers represent the largest untapped source of genetic 
              traits from which biotechnology can be used to glean  desirable
              characteristics. The MGD has identified multiple  collections containing over
              400,000 strains, and this is  estimated to be only a fraction of the total. The
              MGD  provides tools to  facilitate the documentation and exchange  of germplasm
              between researchers and collections. The MGD  will develop a
              "customer-centered" design using World Wide  Web technology to replace the
              existing text-based interface  and to increase the number of collections
              documented in the  MGD.
