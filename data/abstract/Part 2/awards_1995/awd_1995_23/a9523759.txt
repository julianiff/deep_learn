Abstract    :
              9523759  Javidi  Credit card fraud is a serious problem facing many banks, 
              businesses, and consumers.  In addition, counterfeit products such  as computer
              chips, compact discs, and designer fashions, are  arriving on our shores in
              great numbers.  With the rapid advances  in computers, CCD technology, image
              processing hardware and  software, printers, scanners, and copiers, it is
              becoming  increasingly easy to reproduce pictures, logos, symbols, paper 
              currency, or patterns.  Credit cards and passports currently use  holograms as
              a security measure to thwart copying.  But technology  has advanced to the
              point where the holographic image can be easily  acquired from a credit card -
              and a new hologram synthesized using  commercially available optical components
              or hologram-producing  equipment.    We propose a novel system for security
              verification of credit  cards, passports, and other IDs so that they cannot
              easily be  reproduced.  The system uses a new scheme of complex 
              phase/amplitude patterns that cannot be seen and cannot be copied  by an
              intensity-sensitive detector such as a CCD camera.  The basic  idea is to
              permanently and irretrievably bond a random phase mask  to a primary
              identification pattern such as a fingerprint, a  picture of a face, or a
              signature.  For additional security, the  primary pattern could also be phase
              encoded which results in a very  secure system.  Both the random phase mask and
              the primary pattern  are identifiable in an optical system.  ***
