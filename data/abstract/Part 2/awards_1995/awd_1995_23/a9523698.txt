Abstract    :
              9523698  Lander  A  history of the occurrence and effects of previous tsunamis 
              is  the  essential starting point in devising an effective mitigation  plan and
              a component of many research efforts.  This project will  produce  a  catalog 
              which  will  consist  of  descriptions   and  summaries  of  all tsunamis since
              the last one was  completed  in  1982,  and  include  selected marigrams,
              tables  of  heights  and  effects, location maps, photographs, descriptions and
              references.  It will be organized chronologically, but indexed geographically. 
              Data  will be sought from various published sources.  The catalog  will  have
              uses for planners, and add an important period to  the  cataloged history for
              those who need long histories, and  provide  a  easily  accessible  source of
              data and  references  for  other  scientific users.  ***
