Abstract    :
              9523169  Turner       This award provides partial support for the seventh and
              eighth annual SUNYA Topology and Group Theory conferences, October 13-15, 1995,
              and October 11-13, 1996, in Albany, New York.  The conferences concentrate on
              combinatorial group theory and low   dimensional topology.  The invited
              speakers in 1995 are Robert Bieri, Mikhael Gromov, Narain Gupta, William
              Menasco, Chuck Miller, Richard Schwartz, and Efim Zelmanov.  It is axiomatic
              that algebraic topology draws heavily upon group theory, but one charm  of the
              subject of these conferences is that the flow is substantially in the other
              direction, with topology repaying its debt in shedding light on the properties
              and structure of groups.    ***
