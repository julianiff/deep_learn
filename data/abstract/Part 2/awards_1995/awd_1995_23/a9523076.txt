Abstract    :
              9523076 Egami  This  grant  supports the Ninth International Conference on
              Liquid and Amorphous  Metals.   The conference provides a forum for bridging
              basic and applied aspects in a variety of materials ranging from composites and
              nano-materials to amorphous and liquid semiconductors.   About 300 participants
              from academic, industrial and government laboratories are expected. The
              Conference takes place in Chicago, Illinois, from August 27  to September 1,
              1995.  The conference highlights advances in liquid and  amorphous  metals, 
              encompassing noncrystalline semiconductors and molten salts and the conference 
              proceeding  will be  published.  The following topics will be covered in the
              conference:   liquid and amorphous metals and alloys; metal-nonmetal
              transitions; liquid and disordered semiconductors; clusters; composite
              materials; quasicrystals; metal/molten salt mixtures.  Atomic structure
              determined by x-ray, neutron and electron diffraction; dynamics, electrical
              transport and electronic, magnetic, optical and thermodynamic properties, are
              addressed, including theoretical and computational as well as experimental
              approaches.  Results  obtained from new techniques, taking full advantage of
              recently commissioned synchrotrons, pulsed neutron sources and high-flux
              reactors to explore domains and properties previously not accessible, are
              emphasized.   %%% Highlighted topics include new  structural materials and
              applications in energy conversion, electronics, optics/electro-optics, and
              waste storage. ***
