Abstract    :
              9523627  Converse  The  overall objective of this project is to use new
              experimental  techniques  to  study  the fall-off in  the  hydrolysis  rate  of
               cellulose as the hydrolysis proceeds.  Two new hypotheses are  to  be tested
              to partially explain this fall-off.  One is referred to  as the chain-end
              hypothesis, where production of excess cellulose  chain  ends  by pretreatment
              leads to a more rapid hydrolysis  of  these ends by cellobiohydrolase (CBH)
              than formation of new  ends  by  endogluconase.  The other hypothesis is called
              the  tethering  hypothesis,  where  once adsorbed, CBH has a  limited  number 
              of  cellulose  ends  available to it, and becomes inactive  until  it  desorbs
              and readsorbs at a fresh site.  ***
