Abstract    :
              9523264  Zoughi  The primary objective of this research is to investigate the 
              relationship between the compressive strength of concrete  and microwave
              reflection coefficient measured at the  aperture of an open-ended rectangular
              wave guide inspecting  the concrete in a contact or non-contact fashion. 
              Subsequently, the results of this study will be used to  develop a microwave,
              nondestructive, real-time, in-situ,  cost-effective and portable sensor for
              estimating concrete  compressive strength with a high degree of accuracy.  ***
