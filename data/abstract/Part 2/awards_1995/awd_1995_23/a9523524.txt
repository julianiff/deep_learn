Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9523524     The objective of this proposal is to determine the
              effect of the orientation and degree of randomness of the filter media fibers
              on particle capture efficiency and energy dissipation during cake formation. 
              An experimental facility will be constructed to measure both the microscopic
              (fiber orientation, individual particle penetration and capture, particle-fiber
              interactions) and macroscopic (medium pressure drop, flow rate, amount of
              particle penetration) filtration characteristics.  Basic understanding of
              mechanisms such as particle capture and evolution of cake structure will be
              sought.  A correlation between the retention efficiency and fiber orientation
              will be determined.    The  main applications are in petroleum industry, ground
              water hydrology, chemical processing, paper making and food processing.  ***
