Abstract    :
              9523361  Lee  The broad subject area of this project is the physics of  strong
              interactions and the effect of random disorder.  An  example of strong
              correlation is the physics of the  fractional quantum Hall effect, where an
              electron gas is  subject to a high magnetic field so that only the lowest 
              Landau level is partially occupied.  A key question is these  systems is
              whether the composite fermions can be described  by Fermi liquid theory.  The
              project proposes to continue  studying this important system and to explore new
               experiments which may provide further information on this  fascinating new
              state.  The tools being used include many-  body perturbation theory,
              renormalization group analysis,  and, at times, numerical analysis.  A
              successful completion  of this project will have significant impact on a broad
              area  of condensed matter physics, including other strongly  correlated
              materals, such as high temperature  superconductors and heavy fermion metals. 
              %%%  This project theoretically investigates systems of electrons  where their
              repulsion plays a crucial role in determining  their physical properties, and
              the effects of random  disorder on such systems.  An example that constitutes
              an  important focus is the physics of the fractional quantum  Hall effect, in
              which a magnetic field is applied to a gas  of electrons that forms at an
              interface in semiconductors.  The investigator is a distinguished leader in
              this area of  condensed-matter physics, using state-of-the art methods.  A
              successful completion of this project will have  significant impact on a broad
