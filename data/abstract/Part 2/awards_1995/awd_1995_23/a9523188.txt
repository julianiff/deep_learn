Abstract    :
              9523188  Weber   This research is to develop an automated biosensor-based
              Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) analysis system.  This system will contain a
              sampling module, a sensor module, and a control-data acquisition module.  The
              sampling will take place through flow injection, with the option of batch
              sampling.  Biosensors will be placed in this cell to detect a wide range of
              compounds.  Sensors to measure pH, conductivity, turbidity, and dissolved
              oxygen may also be included.  An embedded microcomputer will control these
              components and be designed to acquire, display, analyze, and store data.   The
              successful completion of this instrument will solve the current inability to do
              reliable measurement of BOD organics in real-time for water and waste
              treatment.  This will allow maximization of waste remediation and minimization
              of waste discharge to reduce pollution of waterways.
