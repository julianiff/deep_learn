Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                   9523469 
              Rebbi    As HPCC technologies, especially parallel computing and high
              performance networking, become available to much wider segments of the
              community through the emergence of the NII, there is an increased need for
              people who understand this technology and are capable of applying it in all
              sectors of education's, research and business.  It is more important than ever
              to find effective means to link efforts on a national scale to regional and
              local efforts in order to expand access to and involvement in HPCC for broad
              sectors of society.    The MARINER (Metacenter-Affiliated Resource In the New
              England Region) project by Boston University will serve as a focal point for
              HPCC/NII related activities in the New England area.  It will act as a catalyst
              for wide diffusion of technologies and as a channel to the Metacenter.  Mariner
              will draw on the University's advanced computing and communications facilities
              and build on its experience in computer science, computational science
              scaleable parallel computing and wide area networking to provide education and
              tra ining to a wide audience and reach out to institutions within the area that
              have hitherto not been part of the HPCC/NII community.    Key elements of
              MARINER are:  training, education and research programming, outreach programs
              and activities, and access to facilities at boston University.
