Abstract    :
              9523546  Altan   This award supports the, October 10-11, 1995,  "Advanced
              Technology for Die and Mold Manufacturing Conference" in Columbus, OH.  It will
              be co-sponsored by the NSF Engineering Research Center for Net Shape
              Manufacture.  It has the moral support of the International Institution for
              Production Research (CIRP), and Modern Machine Shop Magazine.  Several
              international speakers on die and mold manufacturing technologies from Europe
              and Asia are CIRP members and their travel will be supported by this grant.  
              Modern Machine Shop Magazine will promote the conference in its monthly
              publication.   Rapid and accurate die and mold making is a key to agile
              manufacturing and competitiveness, with many significant research opportunities
              such as: representation of contoured mold designs, machine tools with the
              controls and equipment to produce the designs, innovative finishing and surface
              treatment, and design and simulation applications that incorporate The
              thermo-mechanical models of the processes that use this type of tooling..  This
              conference provides a unique opportunity for the research community to focus on
              this technical problem and interact directly with the down stream users of the
              research developments.  ***
