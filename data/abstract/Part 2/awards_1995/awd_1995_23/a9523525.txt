Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9523525  Ronald So      The proposal is to partially support a
              conference on Turbulent Heat Transfer in March, 1996 in San Diego.  The
              conference centers on the investigation of the coupling between momentum and
              energy transfer in turbulent flows, in situations of practical interest.  The
              conference will bring together experimentalists, modelers, and numerical
              analysts to discuss various aspects of turbulent convective heat transfer.
