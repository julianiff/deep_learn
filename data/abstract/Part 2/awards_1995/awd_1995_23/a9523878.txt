Abstract    :
                       Receptor modeling is a cross-disciplinary research area  that finds
              chemical   fingerprints of pollution sources.  Receptor models use methods 
              from chemometrics,   chemistry, statistics, and image analysis, as well as many
              other  fields.  These models   commonly use principal component analysis, and
              factor methods as  their main ingredients.   Receptor modeling requires good
              scientific knowledge to  reasonably model observed data.   For example, knowing
              that  acetylene is a tracer for motor vehicle emissions is essential to  
              successful receptor modeling.  The methods that this research  develops will be
              used to  provide fingerprint identification of  pollution sources.  The
              research will also provide a  firm  mathematical basis for the methods.        
                 This research provides a firm chemometric and statistical  basis for
              receptor modeling  and is an important contribution to the Federal Strategic
              Area of   the Environment.  Receptor models will serve as unbiased  scientific
              evidence for identifying pollution sources. Receptor  models should be able to
              stand untarnished in legislative and  court proceedings.
