              Abstract  ATM-9523965  King, Teresa  University of Rhode Island  Title: The Role
              of Nonlinear Interactions in Major Glaciation    This award supports a study
              that will make use of a set of well-  documented time series of climate system
              proxies in order to  quantify the role of nonlinear climate system interactions
              in  glaciation cycles.  There are two related objectives: first, to  quantify
              the extent to which variations between surface and deep  ocean proxy data are
              spatially and temporally coherent during the  Pleistocene, independent of
              orbital forcing; second, to objectively  discriminate between linearly forced,
              nonlinearly coupled, and  free, or internal, unforced variations.  An
              additional benefit of  this research effort will be a data archive resulting
              from the  assembly of these many proxy time series.
