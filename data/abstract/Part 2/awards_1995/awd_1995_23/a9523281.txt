Abstract    :
              9523281  Pershan    This  project  employs x-ray scattering methods  to  measure
               the  interfacial structures of 3He, 4He and 3He - 4He mixtures over  a  range 
              of  temperatures and composition, and under a  variety  of  externally 
              controlled  geometries.  The  helium  interfaces  are  interesting  from a
              theoretical view because they  represent  the  relatively  rare  realization of
              a well-defined,  macroscopically  oriented,  inhomogeneous quantum fluid. The
              superfluid properties  of bulk helium are fundamentally dependent on the liquid
              density.  However,  it is extremely difficult to vary the bulk  density  by 
              significant  fraction.  In  contrast,  the  density  across   the  liquid/vapor
               interface varies from the  uniform  bulk  value  to  essentially  zero. The
              x-ray experiments are currently  the  only  test of extant theories of the
              structural changes anticipated for  mixture of the quantum fluids. In addition,
              it may be possible to  measure   the   in-plane  correlations  for  the 
              two-dimensional  electron  fluid  that can be stabilized on  the  surface  of 
              the  helium.  If successful, this would provide a tool to characterize  the 
              structure and positional correlations of the two-dimensional  Wigner  lattice
              formed by the layer of electrons trapped  in  the  image  potential  at the
              helium surface. The experiments  are  of  fundamental interest and will be of
              wider interest in  the  field  of surface physics and fluid dynamics.  %%% 
              This  project  employs x-ray scattering methods  to  measure  the  interfacial 
              structures of 3He, 4He and 3He - 4He fluid  mixtures  over a range of
              temperatures and composition, and under a variety  of  externally controlled
              geometries. These cryogenic fluids have  many  novel  properties  related to 
              their  "superfluidity".  The  arrangements  of  atoms  forming  the  surface 
              layers  will   be  determined  by  x-ray  methods using a  beam  of  x-rays 
              from  a  synchrotron light source. In another sub-project, it is  possible  to 
              trap  a  film of e lectrons on the surface of the helium.  The  arrangement  of
              electrons in this layer will also be sought.  The  experiments  are  of
              fundamental interest and will  be  of  wider  interest in the field of surface
              physics and fluid dynamics.  ***
