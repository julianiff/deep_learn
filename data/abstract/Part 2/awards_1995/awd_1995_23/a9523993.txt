Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Eric J. Beckman  Alan J. Russell  University of Pittsburgh 
              CTS-9523993    Purification of proteins from cell broth is usually a multi-step
              process involving filtration and chromatographic steps.  From a process
              standpoint, particularly with regards to throughput, it would be advantageous
              to apply liquid-liquid extraction to protein purification, yet lack of
              selectivity and product recovery difficulties preclude this on a large scale. 
              In a number of publications spanning the last ten years, Hatton and colleagues,
              as well as others, have shown that surfactants can be employed to extract
              proteins from buffer to an organic phase, generally through manipulation of the
              physicochemical properties of the aqueous phase (pH, ionic strength, etc.). 
              Previously, reverse micellar extraction of proteins has been demonstrated in
              only a few conventional liquid alkanes such as hexane and isooctane.
