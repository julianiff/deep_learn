Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC 9523574  Cheng    This is a "TIE" project between the Air
              Conditioning and Refrigeration Center (ACRC) at the University of Illinois at
              Urbana-Champaign and the Center for Engineering Tribology at Northwestern
              University. The objective of this research is to examine both analytically and
              experimentally the seizure process of an aluminum/steel tribocontact. The
              experimental portion of this research study will be conducted at the University
              of Illinois while the analytical portion of the study will be conducted
              Northwestern University. This "TIE" project between the ACRC at Illinois and
              the Tribology Center at Northwestern combines the strengths of these two
              centers to research a very relevant problem important to a number of
              industries: air conditioning and refrigeration, automotive, and aerospace.
              Additionally, this research may provide additional insight on the qualitative
              nature of the wear and material transfer process in the Aluminum/Steel contact.
