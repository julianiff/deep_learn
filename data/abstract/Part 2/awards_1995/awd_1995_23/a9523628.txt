Abstract    :
              9523628  Chung  International Deep Ocean Technology Symposium (1996) is 
              scheduled to be held tentatively in Los Angeles in the U.S.,  May 31-June 1,
              1996.  With the signing of the UN Law of the  Sea Treaty in 1994 by the U.S.
              and the continuing research  on deep ocean in many countries, this event will
              provide a  timely occasion for the colleagues to get together and  review the
              progress made in the last 5 years, and to discuss  and summarize what important
              technological problems for  further research are expected in the next 5 to 10
              years, and  promote further cooperation.  The primary institutions in  the
              countries, that are most active in deep-ocean technology  research, will
              participate in this Symposium.  ***
