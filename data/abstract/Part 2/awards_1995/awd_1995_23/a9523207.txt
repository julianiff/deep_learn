Abstract    :
              9523207  Bykovski   This research is to develop a holographic species analyzer
              for detecting chemical species.  This analyzer will operate through a
              holographic memory designed to recognize the whole light patterns from
              different species and generate a position-sensitive mapping of species in an
              output plane.  This technology is to replace a diffraction grating and will
              have many advantages:  1) it will be highly selective, 2) it will not include
              any wavelength scanning, 3) a master template can be computer generated once
              and then copied, 4) the output displays a peak for a species to be monitored,
              and 5) a compact "smart card" approach to a contact species analysis is
              possible.   The project, if successful, will lay foundation for a new, high
              performance method of chemical analysis and a new class of commercial analyzers
              for environmental, biomedical, process control, and food processing, and other
              applications.
