Abstract    :
              9523517  Hwang    Cardiovascular studies are important to the growing prosthetic
               heart implant and valve industry.  Research in this area can have  a major
              impact on improving artificial hearts and valves and at the  same time reducing
              health costs.  This planning study is  determining the potential to develop a
              research program that will  support an Industry/University Cooperative Research
              Center for  Cardiovascular Engineering.    The planned Center is to have two
              research sites, one at the  University of Miami and the other at the University
              of Memphis.    The Co-Principal Investigators and their colleagues are
              recognized  experts in their fields and are well qualified to run a planning 
              meeting for a Center.    This project has been coordinated with Dr. Gilbert
              Devey, Program  Director, Biomedical Engineering & Research to Aid Persons with
               Disabilities, Division of Bioengineering and Environmental Systems.    The
              Program Manager recommends the University of Miami be awarded  $15,000 for
              three months for this planning meeting.
