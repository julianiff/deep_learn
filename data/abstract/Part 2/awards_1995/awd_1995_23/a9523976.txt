Abstract    :
              9523976  Hoffman  This proposal requests partial support to continue a
              successfully  NSF funded project.  The seminar series, which is held on the
              third  Tuesday of each month discusses issues important and relevant to  the
              "information Superhighway" like privacy, advertising, crime,  regulatory
              agencies and others.    This project will allow the institution to continue
              this series of  seminars and will have the series recorded so persons, not able
              to  attend the session, will be able to view the seminar of choice at  a later
              time.  In addition compilation of information from the  series will be added to
              the electronic library of Seminar Series  documents and made available via the
              World Wide Web.
