Abstract    :
              The PI will install and operate an existing low light level imager in the
              vicinity of the Bear Lake Observatory, Utah, for two years.  Two primary tasks
              to be undertaken are:  (1) mapping energy sources into the upper atmosphere at
              mid-latitudes.  This will create the framework for interpreting upper
              atmosphere dynamics above mid-latitude regions, and (2) mapping presence,
              persistence, and extent of atmospheric gravity waves.  This will enhance the
              testing and interpretation of temperature mapping efforts from BLO.  The
              project's long range goals is to make measurements that improve understanding
              of the energy coupling within the atmosphere system, which will require
              extended observations of both mesospheric and thermospheric emissions relevant
              to the tasks identified above.
