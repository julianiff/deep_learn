Abstract    :
              9523528  Wang  US-PRC Earthquake Protocol Research  Exchange:  Delegation Visit 
                International cooperative research  with other countries has produced 
              cost-effective and fruitful  results to mitigate earthquake  hazards.  In the
              spirit and in  consideration of past involvement  of the US-China Earthquake 
              Engineering Program, meetings and  coordinated visits are organized  for an
              official Chinese Earthquake  Engineering Research Delegation in  August 1995. 
              The Chinese  delegation is assembled by the  Chinese Ministry of Construction, 
              NSF's counterpart in Annex III of  the US-PRC Earthquake Protocol,  which was
              just officially extended  for five more years until January  23, 2000.    This
              project is supported as a part  of the Agreement of Annex III to  the
              U.S./P.R.C. Protocol for  Scientific and Technical  Cooperative Research
              Earthquake  Studies on earthquake engineering  and hazards mitigation for the 
              purpose of international  cooperative  exchange.  ***
