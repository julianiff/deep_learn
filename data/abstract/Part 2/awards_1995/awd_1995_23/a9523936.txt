Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Kirk Schulz    This is  an investigation of the variations in
              reactivity for desulfurization of several alkyl and cyclic organosulfur
              compounds on model  molybdenum sulfide catalysts as a function of surface
              conductivity.  Among issues addressed are selectivity changes as a function of
              surface conductivity, the catalytic activity of sulfur vacancies, the
              correlation of surface conductivity with catalytic activity of sulfide
              materials, and the similarities and differences between sulfided single
              crystals and single crystals of sulfides.    The issues addressed in this study
              are important in extending the very successful empirical technology for
              desulfurizing crude oil to other systems such as flue gas and wastewater.   
              This is a Faculty Early Career Development award.  It includes an effort to
              introduce a "writing-across-the curriculum" (WAC)  program to improve
              presentation skills of chemical engineering undergraduates, the development of
              a tool to assess writing skills, and the application of this tool to assess the
              effectiveness of this approach.  ***
