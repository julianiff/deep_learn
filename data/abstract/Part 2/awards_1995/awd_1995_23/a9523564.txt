Abstract    :
              9523564  Rangan  Description:  This proposal will support the  participation of
              six US experts at the US-Indo  Seminar on Multimedia Science and Technology, 
              planned for September 1995 in New Delhi.  The  host is the Secretary, N.
              Vittal, of the  Department of Electronics, Government of India.   At the
              seminar, six leading experts from the US  will give talks and discuss the most 
              appropriate areas for joint collaboration.   Recent advances in
              computers/networking are  revolutionizing the process of information 
              acquisition, composition, publishing,  delivery,learning, and usage. 
              Large-capacity  storage disks and high-speed fiber-optic  networks are enabling
              the integration of  diverse media, such as text, audio, and video,  during
              storage and delivery.  These advances  are stimulating multimedia technologies
              that  allow several forms of information--journals,  lectures, historic
              documents, movies, and  newspapers--to be made available to users via 
              broadband networks. The multimedia sciences  have sparked a number of
              innovations such as  digital multimedia "libraries without walls"  and distance
              learning.   Scope:  As part of this activity, the DOE will  provide US
              participants with access to several  DOE laboratories scattered throughout
              India  where they will be able to investigate  important multimedia S&T
              research challenges  with their Indian colleagues.  These include  distance
              learning, computer supported  multimedia collaborative work, and digital 
              libraries.  This activity is highly beneficial  for the US as they will be
              interacting with  top-notch researchers in an area of great  importance and
              strength on the Indian side.              ***
