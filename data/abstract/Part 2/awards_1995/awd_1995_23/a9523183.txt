Abstract    :
              9523183  Koev   This research is to develop a Raman spectrometer based on
              small-diameter, long-path length, totally-internally reflecting sample cells. 
              The cells will be hollow fibers drawn from a transparent amorphous
              fluoropolymer with a refractive index less than water.  These fibers will act
              as optical fibers when filled with any transparent liquid.  This will confine
              the excitation and Raman-scattered radiation within the sample, increasing the
              Raman intensity by as much as 3 to 4 orders of magnitude.   Raman spectrometers
              are used extensively in analytical chemistry primarily to provide information
              on molecular vibrations.  The results of this research will make the Raman
              spectrometers even more useful to industry by increasing the intensity of
              conventional spectrometers and extending their use to essentially all
              transparent liquids.
