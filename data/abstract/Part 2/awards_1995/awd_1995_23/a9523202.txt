Abstract    :
              9523202  Wolf   This research is to develop a compact wavelength dispersive
              spectrometer (WDS) to install inside the specimen chamber of an electron
              microscope.  The WDS employs a crystal of known lattice spacing to separate
              collected x-rays by energy or wavelength.  This provides higher
              energy-resolution of x-ray peaks, higher peak-to-background ratios, and better
              elemental x-ray images.  Mounting the WDS units inside the microscope specimen
              chamber would significantly increase the x-ray collection angle and result in 
              accurate and in-depth chemical analysis.   A miniature WDS system would provide
              chemical analysis in situations where other spectrometer systems cannot.  This
              development would be commercially applicable to several thousand existing
              standard electron microscopes, and may be extended to analytical electron
              microscopes in the future.
