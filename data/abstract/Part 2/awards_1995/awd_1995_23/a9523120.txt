Abstract    :
              9523120   Anand  Continuous improvement of the quality and reliability of
              manufactured parts requires clear methods and guidelines for accurate, fast and
              consistent inspection of parts and interpretation   of inspection data.  This
              research aims to develop a technique for calculating size tolerances and the
              minimum zones for flatness and straightness based on  the Hough Transform
              method.  This technique for evaluating geometric tolerances of manufactured
              parts, unlike the methods currently used, is exact and is thus more appropriate
              for precision applications.  Data will be collected from actual industrial
              parts from three different manufacturers who will collaborate to compare the
              new technique with the methods they currently use for size, flatness,
              straightness, and orientation tolerances.  Most manufacturers currently us
              approximate methods to verify geometric tolerances.  This can result in errors
              that degrade product quality, especially for precision machining.  The results
              of this research could result in more accurate and efficient inspection of
              geometric tolerances.  Since the method is exact rather than approximate, it
              should be particularly  useful for precision manufacturing.    The proposed
              method has application to a broad range of manufacturing industries, if
              successful.
