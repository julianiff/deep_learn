Abstract    :
              9523757  Bernstein  The P.I. propose to create experiments designed to offer
              students at the middle and high school levels an exciting view of electronics
              principals.  Using oscilloscopes donated by the Department of Electrical
              Engineering, as well as microphones, speakers, and inexpensively built function
              generators and spectrum analyers, we will demonstrate at the appropriate
              educational level such skills and concepts as oscilloscope operation, wave
              behavior, frequency spectra, harmonics, distortion, and filtering.  These
              experiments will be written by undergraduates at the University of Notre Dame
              as well as presented by them at local schools.  In addition, where requested by
              the instructor, the lab setups will be donated to the schools for demonstration
              to a larger number of classes.  ***
