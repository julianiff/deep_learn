Abstract    :
                    9523050  Johnson  This Academic Research Infrastructure (Development)
              Award is made  to partially fund the development of a Microstructure Analysis 
              System using electron backscatter patterns (EBSP).  The new EBSP  system will
              be used for research in a variety of areas such as  fracture initiation,
              recrystallization and polyphase deformations.   This system will permit the
              complete determination of both the  microstructure and local grain the complete
              determination of both  the microstructure and local grain orientations of
              polycrystalline  materials with a resolution on the order of microns.  The
              basis of  the EBSP technique is to focus a narrow beam of electrons on a very 
              small sample of the material and probe this region to produce a  pattern of
              light and dark bands known as the Kikuchi pattern.  The  pattern can be
              identified and attributed to lattice plans in the  material.  From this
              identification, the local crystal orientation  is determined.  ***
