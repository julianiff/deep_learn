Abstract    :
              LINSKY    The objective of this award is to support all components of the review
              process of the Terrestrial Ecology and Global Change Program. This is a special
              interagency competition involving NSF, DOE, NASA, and USDA. The work to support
              all aspects of the review is needed as this special competition is in addition
              to the normal programs normally run in the Division of Environmental Biology. 
              The announcement generated 150 proposals, and the interagency review and
              decision making requires communication and coordination between representatives
              of the four primary agencies and additional agencies interested in global
              change research. Friday Services Systems is experienced in supporting such
              review efforts, and their cost-estimate for the work was deemed cost-effective
              and responsive to the statement of work provide by NSF. Their services will
              help insure a careful, thorough, and effective evaluation of the submitted
              proposals.
