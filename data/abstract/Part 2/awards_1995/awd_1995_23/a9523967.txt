Abstract    :
              This research consists of four major objectives:  (1) The development of
              powerful, rapid, hybrid acquisition schemes designed to operate in channels
              containing multiple-access interference, fading, and multipath.  These schemes
              will be designed to acquire signals rapidly and reliably even under severe
              channel conditions.  (2)  The creation of a new class of sequential
              multihypothesis tests based on pipelining, a paradigm akin to a parallel server
              queueing system.  (3)  The development of acquisition schemes that exploit the
              presence of multipath.  (4)  A determination of the acquisition-based capacity
              of direct sequence CDMA communications and the acquisition-limited throughput
              of packet-data CDMA in third generation cellular communications systems. 
              Significant advances in sequential decision theory are sought in the study, and
              the results will be applicable to systems ranging from multiple-resolution
              radar systems to PCS systems.
