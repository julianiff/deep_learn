Abstract    :
              The investigators will study the density and temperature structure of the middle
              atmosphere using a Rayleigh lidar facility using the Firepond Telescope in
              Massachusetts.  The lidar will be moved from its current location in Logan,
              Utah, and will be deployed and operated at its new site near the Millstone Hill
              incoherent scatter radar facility.  The coordinated observations with the radar
              and nearby optical instruments will allow studies of the dynamics of the middle
              atmosphere, including gravity waves, neutral winds, and mesospheric inversion
              layers.
