Abstract    :
              CTS-9523284  Conner  University of Massachusetts      The performance of
              hydrophobic molecular sieves (zeolites) in selectively removing Volatile
              Organic Compounds (VOCs) for recycle or resuse will be evaluated with
              industrial collaboration.  The removal of cyclohexane from a chemical process
              stream will adsorbents supplied by Philadelphia Quartz.  The energy necessary
              to desorb the solvent for recycle back into the process will be determined. 
              The desorption of cyclohexane will be done by microwave radiation and also by
              using a hot purge gas for comparison.  Fundamental studies will focus on
              competitive adsorption and transport of VOCs and water in a variety of
              inorganic molecular sieves.  KSE Corp. will participate in evaluating the
              economic and technological aspects of the process.  The SGER/GOALI project will
              explore a new strategy to use microwave radiation in solving environmental
              problems associated with chemical processing.
