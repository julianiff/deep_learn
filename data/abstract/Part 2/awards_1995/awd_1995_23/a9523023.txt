Abstract    :
              9523023  Colville  The objective of the research is to investigate the 
              enhancement of the flexural tensile bond strength of masonry  mortars by the
              use of latex additives in the mortar mix.    The research builds on a previous
              project which identified  several areas of potentially significant research. 
              These  include the effect of polymer content, effect of lime,  curing procedure
              and flow, type of plasticizer, and moisture  content of masonry.    This
              research will provide approximately 1000 test values on  brick masonry prisms
              constructed with a variety of latex  additives that have already been proven to
              have considerable  potential on increasing the tensile bond strength of clay 
              masonry construction.    The study will be directed into three phases.  Phase 1
              will  evaluate 9 polymer types in detail (588 tests).  Phases 2  and 3 (336
              tests) will focus on those 16 contributions from  the 36 mortar batches tested
              in Phase 1 that are shown to  provide the greatest enhancement in flexural bond
              strength.    The research will provide for the first time, a  comprehensive
              data base on the enhancement of the flexural  bond strength of polymer modified
              mortars.  This is in  itself significant since there is no current data
              available  that indicates whether or not the traditional weal link  masonry
              (i.e., the bond between mortar and masonry unit) can  be significantly improved
              through the use of such additives.  The recent enhancements in concrete
              strength and durability  through the use of various additives and
              superplasticizers  in the concrete mix, cannot be applied directly to masonry 
              mortars.    The potential impact of such bond strength enhancement on  the use
              of unreinforced masonry construction has important  implications both in
              retrofitting and strengthening existing  masonry construction and in the design
              of new construction.  ***
