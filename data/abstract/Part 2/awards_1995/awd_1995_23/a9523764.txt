Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Proposal Number:  CTS 95-23764  Ain A. Sonin    This project will be a
              study the problem of capillary driven motion of a molten material spreading
              over a solid that is below the meltOs fusion point.  Solidification takes place
              simultaneously with spreading, making the flow process much more complex than
              the isothermal moving contact line problem. The objective of this work is to
              develop a fundamental understanding of the dynamic processes that occur when a
              molten droplet touches a cold solid, spreads partly over it by capillary
              action, and freezes.  The focus will be on conditions where the moving contact
              line plays a strong role in the dynamics.  Research of this nature is of great
              importance to evolving methods of materials processing based on molten material
              deposition, such as the precise fabrication of objects from microdrop units. 
              The work will be both experimental and theoretical.
