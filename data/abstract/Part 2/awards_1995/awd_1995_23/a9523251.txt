Abstract    :
              9523251  Kadish    Funds are provided to the Electrochemical Society to assist 
              in the registration and travel cost of junior scientists  and students/postdocs
              in an international symposium devoted  to the recent development in fullerenes.
               This symposium is  a a part of the 187th Meeting of the Electrochemical 
              Society to be held in Reno, NV during May 21-26, 1995.  The  symposium is
              broken into a number of topical research areas  that have been supported
              strongly by the National Science  Foundation.  The purpose of this symposium is
              to provide a  forum for exchange of information about research on  fullerenes
              and related materials.  The  proceedings volume  will be published under the
              title:  Fullerenes: Recent  Advances in the Physics and Chemistry of Fullerenes
              and  Related Materials."  ***
