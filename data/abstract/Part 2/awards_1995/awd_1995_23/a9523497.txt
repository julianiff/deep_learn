Abstract    :
              9523497  Rieke    This grant funds the construction of IRIS, the Infrared 
              Radiometer, Imager, and Spectrometer, a facility instrument for  the upgraded
              6.5 meter Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT).  The  focal plane instrument will be
              a 256 x 256 pixel  camera/spectrometer based on a new generation of infrared
              arrays.  The instrument builds on the experience gained in the operation  of a
              smaller format thermal infrared camera.  IRIS will be  capable of a resolution
              of 13,500 and an imaging resolution of  0.35 arc seconds at a wavelength of 10
              micrometers.  It will  operate in the spectral region from 4 to 25 micrometers.
