Abstract    :
              The Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineering (IEEE) Computer Society
              and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) have formed a Joint Steering
              Committee for the Establishment of Software Engineering as a Profession
              (SEEEPP).  The Committee's Working Groups are beginning deliberations on
              electronic mail, and are scheduled to complete their work before November 1995.
               This project presents a rare opportunity to study a technical profession
              coming into being.  A research group of two ethics specialists and a computer
              science specialist have approval to monitor the activity of the Working Group
              on Reliability and Safety.    While joining in the Working Group's
              deliberations, the researchers will study the factors that two powerful
              professions (electrical engineering and computer science) bring to bear in
              discussing, examining and resolving questions concerning technical,
              educational, and ethical standards for the new profession.  The project will
              proceed by monitoring the e-mail of the Working Group, complemented with
              telephone interviews for further explanation and with participation in
              teleconferences or face-to-face meetings.  The research team will meet monthly
              to analyze the process.  The team expects to prepare two reports, one a
              research paper contributing to the understanding of professions and the
              development and uses of professional codes, and the other, a report assisting
              the Joint Steering Committee.  If warranted, a proposal for a larger research
              project may develop out of this work.
