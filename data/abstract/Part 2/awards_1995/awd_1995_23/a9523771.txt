Abstract    :
              9523771  Kesler  This proposal requests support for an evaluation of processes
              that could deposit gold in sediment-hosted micron gold (SHMG) deposits. 
              Despite their importance, we lack comprehensive models for gold deposition in
              these ores, largely because we do not understand the mineralogical form of gold
              in the ore and its relation to geologic features.  In order to evaluate the
              feasibility of the solid solution/adsorbtion/electrochemical depositional
              processes for SHMG deposits, we need to know:  1) the geologic setting of
              pyrite with different textures and gold contents; 2) the degree to which
              overgrowths on pyrite can be correlated; 3) the form of gold in pyrite. 
              Efforts to answer these questions will focus on deposit-scale studies at the
              large Twin Creeks deposit in Nevada, which contains widespread pyrite textures
              of the type described here.  Work will also include a reconnaissance survey of
              the distribution of pyrite in Paleozoic sedimentary rocks of northern Nevada to
              test the importance of pre-existing pyrite to gold deposition.  In addition to
              their obvious importance to genetic theories, results could aid exploration by
              forecasting grades and delimiting targets during early stages of drilling.
