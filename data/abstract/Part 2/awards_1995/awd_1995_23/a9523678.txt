Abstract    :
              9523678  Fergusson    This award supports a 24 month Science and Technology
              Agency  of Japan Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Neil Fergusson at  the
              Mechanical Engineering Laboratory (MEL), Tsukuba, Japan.  Dr. Fergusson will
              work with Dr. Nobuo Tanaka, senior  scientist in the Vibration Engineering
              Division, on a  research project entitled, "Active Control of Distributed 
              Parameter Systems."    The proposed research will entail the development of 
              innovative control theory techniques and mathematical  systems, which, when
              implemented, provide the engineer with  hardware used to achieve a desired
              output in a particular  dynamic environment.  With the recent invention of new 
              techniques for the design of controllers, a series of  questions need to be
              explored concerning the reaction of  mechanics and materials in unique and
              changing structural  conditions.  Therefore, in addition to theoretical
              research,  Dr. Fergusson plans to research applications of the new  techniques
              to practical industrial problems which are of  current interest to the
              international engineering community.  ***
