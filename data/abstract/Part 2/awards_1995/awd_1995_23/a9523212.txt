Abstract    :
              9523212  Newman   This research is for the development of an on-line Raman
              spectrometer for the pharmaceutical industry.  A variety of pharmaceutical
              materials will be examined to determine their suitability for analysis by Raman
              spectroscopy.  Software will also be developed for automated spectrum
              interpretation, and optical designs for conventional and fiber optic sampling
              will be tested.   The introduction of Raman spectroscopy into the
              pharmaceutical industry will have major impacts.  The rapid analysis of drug
              formulation will meet the increasing requirements for frequent examination of
              products and may be applied to the chemical, polymer, and food and beverage
              industries as well.
