Abstract    :
                      9523019  Shah  This is a joint research project between University of
              Maine and  Northwestern University.  The objective of the research is to 
              observe the three dimensional growth of internal microcracks in  small cement
              and mortar specimens loaded in uniaxial compression.  The microcracking will be
              measured using synchrotron x-ray  microtomography combined with a 3-D image
              analysis technique.  The  research work represents the first time that
              quantitative  measurements of internal cracking of cement-based materials have 
              been possible at micron resolution.  A clearer understanding of  fracture
              mechanisms are critical for the development of materials  which are both
              stronger and tougher.  Recently, using the concepts  of microfine particle
              packing in the range of submicron millimeter,  concrete with a compressive
              strength of up to 800 MPa has been  developed.  The influence of particle size
              distribution (reactive  and non-reactive particles) on fracture toughness is to
              be  investigated.
