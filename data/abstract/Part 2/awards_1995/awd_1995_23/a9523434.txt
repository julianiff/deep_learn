Abstract    :
              9523434  Marwitz        Winter storms are among the most costly and disruptive
              of meteorological  phenomena.  The factors that control the production of such
              weather as freezing rain,  heavy snowfalls and aircraft icing conditions are
              usually a complex interaction of  localized precipitation physics and the
              larger scale atmospheric dynamics, so called   microphysical/dynamical
              interactions.          Utilizing aircraft and other meteorological data
              collected during the Winter  Icing and Storms Project (WISP), under a previous
              award the Principal Investigator  has advanced our understanding of the
              precipitation formation processes in winter  storms including a new taxonomy
              for and insights into aircraft icing conditions.          Under this award the
              Principal Investigator will continue this research and  has three primary
              objectives:  1.  Diagnostic study of the dynamical/microphysical interactions
              within a blizzard;  2.  Diagnostic studies of a series of cases of freezing
              rain;  3.  Attempt to explain the observed relationship between supercooled
              drizzle drops and        vertical wind shear.  Successful completion of this
              research will advance our fundamental understanding of  the production of
              wintertime precipitation and potentially lead to improved forecasts.  ***
