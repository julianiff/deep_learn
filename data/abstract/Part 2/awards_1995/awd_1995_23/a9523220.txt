Abstract    :
              9523220  Peck   This research is to extend current models of nuclear magnetic
              resonance (NMR) detection cells to obtain a two order of magnitude improvement
              in sensitivity.  The current NMR spectroscope has limited application as a
              detector for microseparations because of its relatively poor sensitivity.  The
              new cells will employ specially designed RF microcoils that will be used in
              flowing analytical separation while retaining the full NMR capability for
              structural determination.  This enables the cells to analyze mass-limited and
              volume-limited samples of chemical species.   The overall goal of this research
              is to create a new generation of optimized nanoliter volume NMR detection cells
              for commercialization for liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis
              microseparation studies.
