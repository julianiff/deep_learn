Abstract    :
              The project aims at the development of an integrated assessment system for
              exploring interactions of  climate change and land use on the steppes of
              Mongolia and Inner Mongolia, northern China.   the methodology combines
              remote-sensed vegetation indices with simulation modeling and ground truth
              analysis.  Results will be interpreted from both scientific and policy
              perspectives.  The goal of the study is to provide a means (the integrated
              assessment system) for determining how regional patterns of climate and land
              use interact to influence ecosystem dynamics and human utilization potential. 
              The assessment system will be based on a spatially explicit GIS simulation
              model (SAVANNA).  Integration of NDVI data will provide for the generation of
              ecosystem stability and resilience indices, and will allow evaluation of
              climate-land use interactions and impacts.  The completed assessment system
              will be used to explore probable effects of future climate changes on ecosystem
              properties and human land use.  Alternative policies for responding to climate
              change will be assessed
