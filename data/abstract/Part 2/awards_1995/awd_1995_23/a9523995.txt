Abstract    :
              The Solar Wind 8 Conference, a major international space science  conference,
              will be held to discuss and learn about the solar and  stellar winds.  This
              proposal will partially support participant  costs for the meeting.  Topics to
              be discussed include:  (1) corona  and solar and stellar wind acceleration, (2)
              solar wind composition  and internal state, (3) solar wind structure, dynamics
              and  evolution, and (4) outer heliosphere, boundaries and interactions  with
              the local interstellar medium.***
