Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
              Department of Chemistry  at the University of California at San Diego to
              acquire a high performance 300 MHz NMR that will be  used in research
              investigations in the following areas of chemistry:  the chemistry of
              sponge-nudibranch  relationships; the role of symbionts in the production of
              marine natural products; marine natural products  that affect Golgi membranes
              and inhibit intracellular protein transport; the discovery of cytotoxic and 
              antibiotic marine natural products; anti-inflammatory agents from marine
              invertebrates; and, chemical  defense in marine organisms.    Nuclear Magnetic
              Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists
              for the  elucidation of the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify
              unknown substances, characterize specific  arrangements of atoms within
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules  in
              solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists
              who are carrying out  frontier research.  The results from these NMR studies
              are useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis,  and in biology.
