Abstract    :
              9523182  Wu   This research uill focus on the development of ultrahigh
              sensitivity chemical analysis of the surface and near-surface regions of solid
              materials.  It will determine the feasibility of developing innovative mass
              spectrometry techniques based on laser ablation and subsequent nonresonant
              laser photoionization processes above the surface, coupled with high
              performance time-of-flight mass spectrometry.  Two primary goals of this
              research are spatial resolution chemical imaging and sub-ppm sensitivity
              semiconductor surface impurity analysis.   The potential applications of this
              research include a highly improved surface analytical instrumentation and the
              establishment of a dedicated analytical facility for material
              characterizations.  Markets for this instrumentation include semiconductor
              manufacturers, environmental testing laboratories, and biological research
              institutions
