Abstract    :
              CTS-9523249    Fernando     This work will be a laboratory study, augmented by
              theoretical analysis, of turbulent flows that are of interest to environmental
              and climatic forecasting.  Specifically the proposed work addresses two
              processes that are vital for the understanding of small-scale phenomena in
              oceans and the atmosphere.  The processes identified for study are: a) the
              sinking of negatively buoyant fluid masses in the presence of background
              stratification and mean shear and b) the entrainment at the base of a turbulent
              mixing layer in the presence of vertical velocity gradients.      The first
              study has application to the generation of strong gusts and horizontal wind
              shears close to the ground.  A better understanding of these phenomena is
              paramount to aviation safety.  The second study is aimed at improving the
              mixing parameterizations of mixed layer models. These models are in use for
              short term forecasting.
