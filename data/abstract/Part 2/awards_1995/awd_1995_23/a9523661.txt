Abstract    :
              EEC-9523361  Heydt    This award provides funding for a multi-university 
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Energy and  Power Systems
              between Purdue University and Colorado School of  Mines with Wichita State
              University as an EPSCoR affiliate.    This multi-university operation will
              conduct research to address  problems associated with several types of
              industries:  electric  utility, heavy electric power consuming industries,
              electric  component industries, and environment condition control industries.  
               Therefore, a wide spectrum of projects will be conducted in the  following
              areas:  1) control system for energy efficiency, optimal  power genepation,
              transmission, distribution, and utilization; 2)  modeling and simulation for
              nonlinear time varying events,  intelligent monitoring, and diagnostics; and 3)
              system management  study to improve the energy efficiency for electric
              components,  equipment, and facilities.    Research activities will be
              coordinated between Purdue University,  Colorado School of Mines, and Wichita
              State University (as an  EPSCoR sponsored affiliate).    The U.S. Department of
              Energy is providing funding in this award to  augment the ongoing research
              program and to provide for a  membership in the Center.
