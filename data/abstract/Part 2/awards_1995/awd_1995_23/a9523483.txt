Abstract    :
              9523483  Greenberg    Recognizing that computer graphics and visualization have
              become an essential part of the mainstream computing environment, this MRA, in
              partnership with the Cornell Theory Center, will investigate one aspect of the
              technology, and provide a forum for the community to exchange
              information/ideas/studies.    Global illumination solutions, pioneered by the
              principal investigator will be further extended for parallel systems, and new
              more efficient algorithms developed.  These will be experimentally tested and
              validated in a light measurement laboratory.    A series of workshops will be
              held at Cornell University to bring together academic and industry experts to
              provide feedback and input to the project.   These workshops will help
              determine priorities and formats for providing data and documentation on the
              World Wide Web.
