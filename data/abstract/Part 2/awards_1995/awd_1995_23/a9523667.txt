Abstract    :
              9523667  Frank     The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is a major feature
              of the global atmospheric circulation with complex synoptic-scale structure. 
              Under this award, the principal investigator will examine the three dimensional
              structure of the northwestern Pacific ITCZ, its variability, and its role in
              tropical cyclogenesis.  A combination of diagnostic analyses and numerical
              simulations will be used to study these phenomena.     The diagnostic component
              will employ both composites and case studies of globally analyzed fields to
              determine the mean ITCZ structure and changes associated with cyclogenesis. 
              This will be supplemented by composites of rawinsonde data to further delineate
              the temperature, moisture, and divergence fields associated with the monsoon
              trough.     Numerical simulations will be performed with a non-hydrostatic
              version of  the Penn State/NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5).  This full-physics model
              will be used in a series of initial value experiments to assess the effects of
              external circulations on the structure of the ITCZ and on the formation of
              tropical cyclones within the monsoon trough.
