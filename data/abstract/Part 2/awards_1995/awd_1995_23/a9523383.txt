Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9523383  WATTS    Underground pipelines and storage tank systems
              can develop leaks over time and cause significant environmental damage.  A
              number of Government agencies have jointly recognized this concern and are
              joining together to facilitate a research and development program to be
              undertaken jointly by the New Jersey Institute of Technology's
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Emission Reduction (ERRC)
              and Iowa State University's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
              Nondestructive Evaluation (CNDE).     This collaborative effort will address
              the envisaged broad scope of a multi-university, multi-agency project.    The
              Emission Reduction Research Center (ERRC) at New Jersey Institute of Technology
              will be responsible for the interface with the sponsoring agencies, EPA, DOE,
              DoD, and NSF.  ERRC is studying how to modify the pipeline systems at the EPA
              UST/Pipeline Test Apparatus in Edison, NJ utilizing the research results of a
              prior award, EEC-9420695.  Researchers in collaboration with instrument
              manufacturers will characterize the nature of acoustic emission leak signals in
              the large scale pipeline systems.  Working collaboratively with researchers
              from the Center for Nondestructive Evaluation at Iowa State University and
              utilizing the characterization data base, sensor placement and signal
              processing and analysis will be optimized for the range of leak size and
              location precision necessary to obtain a 95% reliability for leak location. 
              These results will provide another data base for the two Centers to test how
              effective the acoustic emission system will be in a number of "real world"
              operational sites.    The Center for Nondestructive Evaluation is studying the
              pipeline acoustics transmission characteristics to clarify interpretation of
              measured signals in this laboratory.  Tests will then be made on an outdoor
              buried, water filled pipeline using an artificial acoustic source and
              manufactured fluid leaks.  These results will be compared and  analyzed to
              develop transit time-based leak location algorithms.  The algorithms will be
              tested against the experimental and theoretical data to establish units,
              performance and accuracy as a function of location, leak rate, etc.  The CNDE
              researchers will then assist in implementing the acoustic emission system for
              "real world" field tests, at various sites coordinated by NJIT and the
              participating agencies.    The researchers are fully qualified to perform these
              studies.    Funding for year one of this collaborative award is being provided
              by EPA, DOE, DoD, and NSF.  Dr. Ken P. Chong, Program Director, Structural
              Systems and Construction Processes Program, is providing the NSF funds.
