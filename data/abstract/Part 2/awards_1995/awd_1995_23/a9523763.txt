Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9523763  WISE  Thomas J. Price    The concept of the WISE was
              proposed in 1978 in response to concerns of the engineering community that few
              engineering students have the opportunity to learn about public policy,
              legislative and regulatory processes, and their relationship to technological
              change.    The WISE program is designed to accommodate 15 to 16 students each
              summer.  Since 1983 the number of students selected for any given summer has
              depended on the level of support provided by the sponsoring engineering
              societies.  Those provided by the sponsoring engineering societies include: 
              AICHE, ANS, ASAE, ASCE, ASEE, ASHRAE, ASME, ASTM, IEEE, NSPE, ORSA, SAE, and
              SME.    Engineering students entering their last full year of engineering make
              up the eligible students population.  Students are drawn from a national pool
              and the competition is extremely tough.  For the summer of 1995, the WISE
              program has received more than 150 applications.  From these candidates, the
              sponsoring societies have selected 12 students to participate in this year's
              program.    During the 10 week program, WISE interns meet with government
              policy-makers, attend seminars and conventions, and visit agencies and
              corporations to learn how technological issues are legislated.  This year, the
              interns will visit the Office of Technology Assessment, the House Committee on
              Science, Space and Technology, the National Academy of Sciences, the National
              Science Foundation and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission - to name only a few.
