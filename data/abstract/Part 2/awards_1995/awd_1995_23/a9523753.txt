Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of Michigan in the
              purchase of an Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectrometer.  This
              equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the following:
              photo-induced charge transfer in intercalated lamellar solids, EPR studies of
              paramagnetic centers in low-dimensional crystalline lattices, characterization
              of the structure and mechanism of Mn catalase, supramolecules and
              site-differentiated redox isomers, elucidation of metalloenzyme active site
              structural and functional properties of the Mn sites in the photsynthetic
              oxygen evolving complex.  An Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectrometer
              is an instrument used to obtain information about the molecular and electronic
              structure of molecules.  It may also be used ot obtain information about the
              lifetimes of free radical which are often essential for the initiation of tumor
              growth and/or a variety of chemical reactions.  f8 Û-ª  þ                 +
