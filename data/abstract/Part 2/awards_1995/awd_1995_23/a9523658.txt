Abstract    :
              9523658  Yamamoto  This team of investigators from Woods Hole Oceanographic
              Institution (Massachusetts), Scripps Institution of Oceanography (University of
              California, San Diego, California) and Rosenstiel School of Marine and
              Atmospheric Sciences (University of Miami, Florida) will jointly develop and
              test three types of deep-ocean seismometers as a pilot experiment for a set of
              ocean sensors to expand the existing land-based "global" seismic network to one
              which has truly global coverage.  Global seismic coverage with broadband
              seismometers provides a capability to accurately define the interior structure
              of the earth with resolution presently not possible, and it provides a
              capability to significantly improve warnings for tsunamis.  The instruments to
              be used in the present project are all "broadband" sensors, and will be
              deployed respectively 1) lying on the seafloor, 2) buried slightly within
              marine sediments, and 3) within an existing seafloor drill hole.  All
              deployments will be carried out for the same 3-month period in early 1997. The
              borehole deployment will use a specially developed system (Scripps Institution)
              to place the instrument in the borehole; the buried sensors will be emplaced
              with a system developed at University of Miami.  Tests will take place near
              Hawaii, and results of all three systems will be compared with a permanent land
              seismometer on the island of Oahu as well as with each other.  This project is
              jointly supported by Ocean Sciences and Earth Sciences Divisions of the
              Geosciences Directorate at NSF, and follows earlier development and testing
              programs of component instruments.  It is expected that this test will allow
              decisions to be made about what types of deployments (surface, buried or in
              drillholes) will be optimum for future "ocean seismic network" deployments.
