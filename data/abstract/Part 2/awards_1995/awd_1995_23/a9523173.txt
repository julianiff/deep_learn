Abstract    :
              9523173  Jones  This  study  on casualties caused by the January 17,  1995 
              Kobe,  Japan  earthquake  is being funded through the Small  Grants  for 
              Exploratory Research program.  The investigator will visit  Japan  to  collect,
              consolidate and evaluate casualty data available  to  date and develop contacts
              for future research collaboration.  The  impacts  of such patterns as
              structural failures and the behavior  of  residents on casualty rates will be
              assessed, along with  the  implications  of the Kobe experience for at-risk 
              communities  in  the U.S.  ***
