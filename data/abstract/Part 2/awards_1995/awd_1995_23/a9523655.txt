Abstract    :
              9523655  Cavanagh    The  emergence  of new experimental and theoretical 
              capabilities  are having  a  major  impact on the ability to  understand the 
              mechanisms that  underlie  the dynamics of  chemical processes  at  surfaces 
              and interfaces. Current  research is focused on extending this insight  to the 
              atomic  level properties of systems undergoing chemical  change. The  Gordon
              Research Conference entitled Dynamics at  Surfaces provides a  unique
              opportunity for students to  interact with leaders  in  this active  field  and
              to delve  into frontier questions of  atomic  scale growth and energy 
              transfer. The Dynamics at Surfaces conference  will provide  a  unique 
              opportunity to bring  together  researchers  with  diverse  backgrounds and
              expertise in subspecialties  that  currently have  common  meeting venue. The
              availability of  one-on-one  contact time  is critical to foster the 
              development of rewarding interactions between  researchers  in areas of laser
              spectroscopy,  scanning  probe microscopy,  film  growth,  and other dynamical 
              aspects  of  surface  reactions.      %%%      The  Gordon Research Conference
              entitled Dynamics at  Surfaces provides a  unique opportunity for students to 
              interact with leaders  in  this active  field  and to delve  into frontier
              questions of  atomic  scale growth and energy  transfer.
