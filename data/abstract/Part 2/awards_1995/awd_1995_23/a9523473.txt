Abstract    :
              The University of Illinois Air Conditioning and Refrigeration NSF
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (ACRC) was established in 1989.
              The objective of the Center is to provide the technology base for a new
              generation of energy-efficient, quiet and reliable equipment that can use
              ozone-safe refrigerants. Presently the research is conducted by 40 graduate
              students, 14 faculty, 12 visiting scholars and 15 undergraduate students. The
              ACRC research program is vertically integrated, from the system level down to
              the underlying fundamental processes. The research projects fall into four
              major groups: Systems, Components, Processes and Properties. Over the past five
              years of the existence of the ACRC the number of industry sponsors has grown to
              eighteen.  Cumulative income and expenditures have totaled $5 million for the
              core research program. Major contributions in addition to the NSF funding and
              major sponsors have included generous support from the State of Illinois
              Governor s Science Advisory Committee and the University of Illinois  Richard
              W. Kritzer endowment.  A total of 49 M.S. and 3 Ph.D. theses have been
              supported by ACRC funds. Additional, scores of undergraduate research
              assistants have gained valuable experience on industry-sponsored research
              projects .
