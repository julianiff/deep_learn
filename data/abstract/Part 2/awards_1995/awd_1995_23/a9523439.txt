Abstract    :
                     This is an award under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER). 
               It is a study of  newspaper coverage of public protest during a democratic
              transition in Belarus.  Belarus has begun to allow public demonstrations of
              protest and the government now issues permits for peaceful demonstrations.  The
              study has the quality of a natural experiment, in which the researchers will be
              able to obtain data both before and after the permitting system.  The study
              will contribute to theories about the relation among protest, media coverage,
              and state activity and about the process of democratization.   Analysis is
              based on a systematic review of  police records and major newspapers from 1988
              to 1995.  %%%   This research will contribute to a sociological understanding
              of the efforts to control violent conflict through government permits allowing
              peaceful demonstrations and of newspaper bias in how such demonstations are
              reported.  An examination of these events in Belarus will demonstrate the
              conditions that contribute to the development of democratic institutions.  In
              addition to the scientific gains from this research,  it will develop
              scientific ties with researchers in Belarus.
