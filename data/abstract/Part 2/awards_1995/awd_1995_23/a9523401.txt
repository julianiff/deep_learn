Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   of
              the Chemistry Division, Farrar will continue to study the solvation of  
              selected cations by photodissociation in mass-selected solvated cluster   ions.
               Alkaline earth and early transition-metal cations will be solvated   with
              variable numbers of polar solvents such as NH3 or H2O.  The   solvation process
              will be assessed by determining energies of low-lying   electronic states and
              by vibronic analysis of isotopic clusters of   solvent.  Two-color and
              photochemical hole-burning experiments are   proposed to examine thornier
              issues dealing with these broad cluster   spectra.  Ab initio calculations will
              allow comparison of vibrational   frequencies in excited electronic states. 
              The goal of this research is to understand the steps involved when   isolated
              atomic ions in the gas phase acquire shells of solvent   molecules, such as
              water, ammonia, or alcohol, in liquid or solid phases.    Such information is
              important, because different solvents have varying   affinities for a given
              ion, and these solvent shells can alter the   chemical and physical properties
              of the ion substantially.  These studies   have application in understanding
              ion-molecules reactions which happen in   the upper atmosphere, for example, or
              during plasma deposition processes
