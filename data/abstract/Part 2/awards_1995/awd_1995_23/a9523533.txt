Abstract    :
                This is a Doctoral Dissertation Improvement award.  The project will
              investigate the relationships between socio-economic status, disease specific
              mortality, and mortality decline.  This will be accomplished through the
              comparison of demographic variables between the Erie and Niagara County
              Poorhouses and their respective general populations in western New York state. 
              The data available span nearly one hundred years, allowing for a complete study
              of mortality from the time these institutions opened in the late 1820's until
              they ceased to operate in the second decade of the twentieth century.  This
              study will contribute to the research on disease-specific mortality transition
              and mortality decline by providing insight into a population (the
              institutionalized poor), which has been largely overlooked in demographic
              studies.  Also, the historic poorhouse records of these two counties provide
              data to study mortality prior to 1850.  This is important because there are few
              state or nationwide data available to study mortality during the early decades
              of the nineteenth century.  This research is also an important contribution to
              anthropological demography in that it addresses the issue of socio-economic
              differences in patterns of disease specific mortality and mortality decline.
