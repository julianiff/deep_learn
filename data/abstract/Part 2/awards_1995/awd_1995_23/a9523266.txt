Abstract    :
              9523266  Lebowitz  This grant is supported by the Materials Theory Program in 
              the Division of Materials Research, the Mathematical Physics  Activity in the
              Physics Division and the Applied Mathematics  Program in the Division of
              Mathematical Sciences.  Research  will be conducted on a variety of problems in
              statistical  mechanics with the overall  objective of contributing to the 
              understanding of macroscopic matter from a microscopic  basis.  Problems to be
              considered include: properties of  macroscopic systems carrying steady state
              currents; kinetics  of phase segregation in alloys and fluids including elastic
               and hydrodynamical effects, respectively;  equilibrium  statistical mechanics
              of low temperature phases in quantum  systems; structure of energy levels in
              typical integrable  and chaotic systems; spatial structure of diffusion 
              dominated reacting systems; phase diagrams of classical  multicomponent models
              with vacancies and elastic effects;  and, fundamental problems in the quantum
              description of the  time evolution of macroscopic systems.  %%%  This grant is
              supported by the Materials Theory Program in  the Division of Materials
              Research, the Mathematical Physics  Activity in the Physics Division and the
              Applied Mathematics  Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences. 
              Research  will be done on a number of problems in statistical  mechanics which
              will lead to a better understanding of the  relationship between the
              large-scale behavior of matter,  e.g., fluids, and its underlying particulate
              nature, e.g.,  molecules.  This research is fundamental, although its  outcomes
              should contribute to a better understanding of many  problems of practical
              interest.  ***
