Abstract    :
              One of the biggest roadblocks preventing people from using natural language to
              interact with computers is that understanding language perfectly is difficult,
              even for people.  Recently, theories have been proposed explaining how
              interactors can behave appropriately---even if they differ about the meaning of
              some part of the discourse.  This project aims to extend these ideas so that
              their effectiveness can be tested and their insights put to use.  Extending
              earlier work comprises four tasks: elicitation and collection of examples;
              theoretical extensions; evaluation of the extended model within its logical
              framework; and the construction of applications supporting a user study. The
              planning activities are to include a review of the relevant literature;
              preliminary experimentation with candidate methods of data collection and
              validation;  discussions with researchers whose expertise bears on these
              issues; and the construction of two  prototype applications that discuss
              medical information with doctors and patients, respectively.  Upon  completion
              of these activities, a detailed plan for extending prior a pproaches to
              misunderstanding  will be developed.  If computers can be enabled to address
              misunderstanding, they will be better able  to understand natural language
              reliably and robustly, which is essential if they are to help those who  need
              them most, non-computer-experts.
