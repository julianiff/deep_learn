Abstract    :
              9523179  Henderson   This research is to develop BioTips, biologically
              functionalized force transducers for molecular detection.  The fundamentals for
              the development of the BioTip are derived from the atomic force microscope.  A
              BioTip is formed by covalently coupling biomolecules, in this case a
              protein/DNA pair, to cantilevers, a technology derived from the atomic force
              microscope.  Interactions between these molecules will cause the cantilever to
              bend and will be detected by a laser system.  Research will also be done to
              develop specialized molecular force detection devices by testing other
              molecular pairs.   BioTips have enormous potential for success in industry due
              to its molecular force detection capabilities.  When developed completely, this
              detection device will have a wide range of applications including chemical
              screening and clinical environmental diagnostics.
