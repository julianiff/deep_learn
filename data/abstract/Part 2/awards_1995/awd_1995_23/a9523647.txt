Abstract    :
              This project automatically detects discourse structure in digitally recorded
              lectures and uses this  structure to facilitate rapid browsing of the
              recording.  Discourse structure is the relationship  between topics, including
              sub-topics and embedded remarks.  Boundaries of the segments representing  the
              structure (but not content) are conveyed by pauses, pitch range variation, and
              cue phrases.  Discourse structure is hierarchical, with multiple levels of
              major and minor topics.  Analysis of a  corpus of lectures provides
              quantitative correlation between acoustic features and discourse  structure,
              and the basis of an automatic segmentation algorithm.  A unified approach
              merges hints from  these multiple acoustic cues to map hierarchical discourse
              structure to time offsets in the recording.  Derived discourse structure is
              used to browse the recording, at various levels of detail and  summarization. 
              Presentation is highly interactive, allowing the user to manipulate playback
              via a  physical interface which is the product of iterative design and
              evaluation.  Hand gestures control the  level of detail, speed, an d random
              access during playback.  More productive access to audio  recordings makes it
              possible to manage information from a wider variety of sources and in more 
              situations than conventional computer graphic displays.
