Abstract    :
                    9526411  Brown  Recent studies have shown that zirconium nitride can
              protect  stainless steel against seawater corrosion.  It appears that  the
              effcct is due to natural conversion of a thin layer of  the nitride to hydrated
              zirconium oxide.  Under an SGER  award a study will be made of various other
              refractory  nitrides for their potential use as corrosion protection  coatings.
               Pourbaix diagrams will be constructed and  candidate materials for testing
              will be chosen from those  that have stable oxides or hydrated oxides at the pH
              and  open potential levels of seawater.  The selected nitride  coatings will be
              deposited by plasma arc methods and tested  for corrosion resistance by
              electrochemical techniques.  The  results may make it possible to replace
              chromate conversion  coatings with the environmentally more benign nitride 
              coatings.  ***
