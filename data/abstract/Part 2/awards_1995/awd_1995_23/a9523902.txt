Abstract    :
              9523902  Stucki  This is an interdisciplinary study of the bacterial reduction
              of structural iron (Fe) in clay minerals.  Bacteria and alumino-silicate clay
              minerals are two of the most abundant and most chemically active constituents
              of soils and aquatic sediments.  Both have been independently identified as
              major players in determining the rates of degradation., accumulation, and
              transport of toxic metals and organic pollutants in the environment; but little
              is known about their interaction mechanism(s), how this affects their behavior,
              and the potential for exploiting bacterial-clay reactions to achieve optimal
              performance in natural environmental systems.  Oxidation and reduction (change
              of electrostatic charge) of Fe in the clay crystal structure is one type of
              interaction that potentially is of very great significance, but little
              attention has been given to it.  Studies using inorganic reducing agents in the
              laboratory revealed that changes in Fe oxidation state profoundly alter the
              chemical and physical behavior of the clay.  Does the same thing happen in the
              environment when clays and bacteria interact?  If so, to what extent and at
              what rate?  Does the bacteria alter other compounds, such as metals and organic
              acids, during the oxidation-reduction process with clays?  What are the optimum
              conditions?  The overall goals of this study will, therefore, be two-fold:  (1)
              to identify the optimum conditions under which bacteria reduction will occur in
              soils and sediments; and (2) to determine the effect of bacterial reduction on
              clay properties and on clay-organic and clay-metal interactions.
