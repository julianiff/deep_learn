Abstract    :
              9523065  Nerem  A Workshop on "Cellular Engineering" is to be held August 22-25,
               1995, in San Diego, California.  The purpose of the meeting is to  assess the
              current knowledge of the emerging field of cellular  engineering and future
              directions of research in this area.  An  equally important outcome will be the
              encouragement and possible  development of collaborative efforts in cellular
              engineering  between researchers in the U.S. and the U.K.  ***
