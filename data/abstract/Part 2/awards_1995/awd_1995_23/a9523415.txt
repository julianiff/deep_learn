Abstract    :
              With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Steven R. Kass of the
              University of Minnesota-Twin Cities will study organic ion-molecule reactons in
              the gas phase.  A unique variable temperature flowing afterglow-triple
              quadrupole aparatus forms the experimental basis for the work.  In some cases,
              solution studies will be performed on the same species.  Results will be
              supplemented with ab initio molecular orbital calculations.  Particular
              attention will be given to antiaromatic ions, unimolecular rearrangements, and
              the effect of (particularly remote) substituent effects on ion reactivity and
              stability.  These experiments will provide fundamental understanding of certain
              elusive and highly unstable reactive intermediates, including a class for which
              no previous experimental information has been available.  Experiments such as
              those which will be performed provide the hard-core data on which the rules of
              organic chemistry are built, and extrapolation of the basic results obtained in
              the gas phase to solution, where most preparative organic chemistry is done,
              will have substantial impact on theory and potentially on practice in organic
              chemistry.  f8 Û-ª  þ                 +                          Ûª? ÑOh ª'
