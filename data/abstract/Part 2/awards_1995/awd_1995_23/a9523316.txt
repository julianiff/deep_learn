Abstract    :
                  9523316  Rogers  The aim of the research effort is to develop an
              understanding of  the fundamental scientific aspects of a recently developed 
              qualitative non-destructive evaluation sensor systems.  I relies on  tracking
              the high-frequency(typically > 50 KHz) pointimpedance of  the structure to
              identify damange.  At such high frequencies, the  techniques such as comparable
              in sensitivity to the most  sophisticated traditional NDE techniques such as
              ultrasonics and is  capable of qualitiatively detecting incipient type damage
              by  looking at changes in structural impedance.  This technique  overcomes all
              of the critical limitations of model and "low  frequency" NDE approaches
