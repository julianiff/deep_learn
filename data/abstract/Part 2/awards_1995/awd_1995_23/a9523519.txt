Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9523519  Kostic  N. Ill. University    This proposal is to fund
              innovative exploratory research on the measurement of the thermal conductivity
              of polymers during shear flow.  It is known that the thermal conductivity
              measurement for certain polymers under no-flow conditions is different from
              that found during shear flow, and this work will attempt to measure thermal
              conductivity under actual shear flow conditions.    This work should help
              understanding of the fundamental conduction process during the shear flow of
              polymers, and the results may aid designers of equipment that involves heat
              transfer to a flowing polymer.
