Abstract    :
              EEC-9523373  McLaren    Packing of products must be controlled and reduced to
              minimize its  impact upon land fills.  Similarly resource recovery must be 
              improved for the same reason.  The nation's land fills are filling  up and the
              current operations are not feasible for the future.  A  new Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center for Packaging  and Resource Recovery at Rutgers
              University is being established to  address these problems.    Eleven companies
              have become members of the new Center.    The research of the new Center will
              address the following:  1)  Accelerated Shelf-Life Testing; 2) Micro-disperse,
              Immiscible  Polymer Mixtures in Post Consumer Commingled Plastics; and 3) 
              Gaseous Degredation of Polyolefins; 4) A Feasibility Study of  Recycled
              Commingled Plastics; 5) Resource Recovery Technologies;  and 6) Economic and
              Thermodynamic Viability of Refined Commingled  Plastics.    The Center has been
              coordinated with Farley Fisher in the Division  of Chemical and Thermal
              Systems.
