              Abstract  ATM-952385  Webb, III, Thompson  Brown University   Title: Testing
              Earth System Models with Paleoenvironmental         Observations (TEMPO)   
              This award supports a project under the Earth System History (ESH)  Program of
              the USGCRP.  The objective of this award is to improve  the ability of models
              to simulate large changes in the earth system  and to understand the
              interactions and feedbacks among components  of the system.  The earth's
              climate system with its vegetation,  lakes, wetlands, and oceans has changed
              dramatically in the past,  and the data about these large changes provide
              "ground truth" for  testing the accuracy of the earth system models.  The
              research team  will develop an integrated equilibrium biosphere model, a 
              lake/continental-hydrology model, and coupling procedures to link  these models
              off-line to atmospheric general circulation models and  an ocean general
              circulation model.  A regional fine-mesh climate  model will also be used for
              studying earth system changes in  regions of complex topography.  With these
              coupled models, it will  be possible to explore a wide variety of potential
              earth system  feedbacks including: a) atmosphere-biosphere interactions 
              associated with boreal forest replacing tundra, or tropical  savannah replacing
              desert; b) atmosphere/land-surface-hydrology  interactions associated with
              increases or decreases in the area  extend of lakes and wetlands;
              atmosphere/ocean/terrestrial-  vegetation interactions associated with changes
              in Arctic sea-ice,  the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation, and coastal
              and  equatorial upwelling.  Global paleovegetation and lake status data  sets
              will be compiled for 6000 and 21,000 years ago, and these data  sets will be
              used along with data for ocean circulation and from  the previous intergalcial
              to make comparisons with the coupled  earth system models.
