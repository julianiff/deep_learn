Abstract    :
              The investigators will upgrade recently installed lidars at Arecibo, Puerto
              Rico, and Juliusruh,  Germany, for temperature and radial wind measurements in
              the mesopause region using  atmospheric potassium atoms as tracers.  These
              lidars will then be operated along with a sodium  lidar in Fort Collins,
              Colorado, for at least five nights each season so that the seasonal variations 
              of thermal structures in the mesosphere can be studied.   The data will
              elucidate the global  climatology of the mesopause region, as well as other
              interesting phenomena in the middle  atmosphere, such as gravity waves and
              tides.  When the necessary technology for wind and  daytime measurements has
              been developed at Fort Collins, it will be transferred to Arecibo and 
              Juliusruh for the lidars operated at those places.***
