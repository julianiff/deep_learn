Abstract    :
              9504321  Noah  Modeling, analysis and characterization of the dynamic  behavior
              of multi-degree of freedom rotor systems with  strong nonlinearities is the
              thrust of this research  project. Analytical models of rotors and their
              nonlinear  supports and coupling components are developed. Local 
              nonlinearities in rotor systems are manifested in dampers,  clearances and
              fluid interactions. Linearized analysis of  industrial rotating machinery does
              not capture its full  dynamics, and designs based upon such analyses may lead
              to  severe malfunctions or catastrophic failures. In this  project
              analytical/computational methods are developed for  determining the nonlinear
              dynamic behavior of systems,  including their periodic, quasi-periodic and
              chaotic  response and bifurcation. These include the harmonic balance  method,
              fixed point method, and their combinations. The  results of this research
              advance the state of knowledge of  nonlinear rotordynamics and leads to the
              development of  reliable design techniques to mitigate the effects of 
              nonlinear dynamics and chaos.***
