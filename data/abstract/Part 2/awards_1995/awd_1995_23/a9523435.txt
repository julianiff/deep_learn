Abstract    :
              Abstract  Santiago  CTS-9523435    The PI proposes to carry out a preliminary
              experimental study of an opposed-flow diffusion flame (OFDF) between a downward
              directed jet of a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen and a pool of liquid methanol.
               Stable combustion products will be sampled and analyzed using quartz
              microprobes followed by gas chromatographic analysis.  Temperature profiles
              will be measured by means of thermocouples.  Non-intrusive techniques will be
              considered for future use.  This is a Minority Research Planning Grant
              Proposal.
