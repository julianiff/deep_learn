Abstract    :
              9523205  Rinard   This research is to produce a low field magnetic resonance
              spectrometer for localized spectroscopy of numerous large and/or lossy samples
              related to environmental, biological, and materials problems.  The spectrometer
              will function in the 150 to 300 MHz frequency region to provide deeper
              penetration into samples for accurate and efficient chemical analyses. An
              innovative new low-field, air-core magnet will be developed to create the
              magnetic fields and gradients for this spectrometer.   After completion of all
              phases of the project, the spectrometer system will be compact, light weight,
              and portable.  This spectrometer will find wide use in both research and
              testing applications in a wide range of areas that involve various aqueous,
              electrically conducting, and other lossy samples.
