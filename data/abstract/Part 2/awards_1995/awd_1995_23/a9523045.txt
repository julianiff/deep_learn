Abstract    :
              9523045  Gulliver  A study of cavitation will be undertaken in cooperation with 
              the German Versuchsanstalt fur Wasserbau in Obernach. The  goal of the study is
              to identify the major physical  characteristics of cavity detachment and to use
              these  results to improve existing models for cavitation erosion  damage. The
              formation of cloud cavitation at the trailing  edge of a cavity will be studied
              in two different water  tunnels with different characteristics, one in Germany
              and  the other at the PI's institution, in order to eliminate any  test
              rig-related scale effects.  Both 2-D and elliptic  hydrofoils will be studied
              to understand the relationship  between cloud cavitation and unsteady sheet
              cavitation.  The  hydrofoils will be instrumented with both ductile probes and 
              pressure sensitive piezoelectric film to obtain a direct  correlation between
              pitting rate and the statistics of  impulsive pressure events in cloud
              cavitation.  The results  will be correlated with similar studies in the
              conventional  vibratory cavitation apparatus.  ***
