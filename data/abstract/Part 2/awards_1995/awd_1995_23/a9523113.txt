Abstract    :
                    9523113  Espinosa  The proposed research deals with a combined
              experimental and  theoretical approach using impact loading to study the
              influence of  microstructural features on failure of ceramics.  The
              experimental  approach uses novel plate and impact experiments where the 
              magnitude and duration of stress pulses can be selected so that the  damage
              event is stable and its evolution can be monitored under  well defined
              deformation histories.  As a result, damage evolution  rather than final
              accumulated damage can be identified.  These  results will form the basis for
              comprehensive understanding of the  processes occurring during inelastic
              deformation and formulation of  physically based constitutive equations. 
              Interferometrically  measured velocity histories will be used in the
              examination of  formulated models.  Correlation between measured and
              numerically  computed velocity histories will be accomplished by performing 
              numerical simulations of the experiments with inelastic models  accounting for
              the observed failure mechanisms.  ***
