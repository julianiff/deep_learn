Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program   provides
              continued support for research by Dr. M. David Curtis of the   Chemistry
              Department, University of Michigan, on the reactivity of model   complexes for
              dehydrosulfurization (HDS) catalysts.  The specific   objectives of the project
              are to determine (1) how the composition,   physical and electronic structure,
              and redox properties of molybdenum or   tungsten sulfide clusters correlate
              with their reactivity toward organic   sulfur compounds; (2) the mechanisms of
              the desulfurization reactions   mediated by the metal cluster complexes; and
              (3) how the mechanisms of   desulfurizations on discrete clusters are related
              to the mechanisms of   desulfurization over the heterogeneous HDS catalysts
              used in the   petroleum industry for fuel upgrading.   The experimental
              approaches to   these objectives include the synthesis of new sulfide
              bimetallic   clusters, kinetic and structural studies of their reactions with
              organic   sulfur compounds, electrochemical studies, and comparative studies
              with   actual heterogeneous catalysts.  Of particular interest are those HDS  
              reactions catalyzed by molybdenum sulfide catalysts `promoted` with iron,  
              cobalt, or nickel and the role played by the promoter metal in increasing   the
              activity of the catalyst.  Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) is a commercial process
              used to remove sulfur   from organic materials and is therefore important in
              manufacturing and to   enhancing air quality in industrial areas.   In this
              project, compounds   which are models of the industrial catalyst will be
              prepared and their   reactivity investigated.   Knowledge of the mechanistic
              role of the   promoter in desulfurization catalysts can be applied to the
              design of   `second generation` hydrotreating catalysts that possess higher  
              activities and selectivities than those currently in use.
