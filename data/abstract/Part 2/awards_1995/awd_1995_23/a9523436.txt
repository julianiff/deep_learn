Abstract    :
              The integration of electronic and photonic devices on the same chip offers 
              performance advantages in terms of speed, bandwidth, immunity to interference, 
              power dissipation and interconnection density.  This research explores
              algorithms  and tools for simulation of optoelectronic Integrated Circuit
              (OEIC) designs.   The goal is to simulate equally accurately both optical and
              electronic devices  in the same circuit.  Both lumped and distributed-constant
              elements are included  in the model.  Existing models for optoelectronic
              devices such as light emitters,  detectors, and electro-optic modulators are
              being refined and incorporated in the  simulator.  New models are being
              developed for optical interconnect and for those  optoelectronic devices for
              which no models suitable for time-for domain  simulation currently exist.  A
              simulation environment, capable of handling  circuits with optical and
              electronic devices is being constructed.
