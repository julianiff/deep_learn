Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CMS9523236  PI:  Dowding and Finno, Northwestern University   
              Monitoring of slope movement in soils has been inhibited by  the level of 
              manual operation required for most monitoring equipment in  current use.  Time
              Domain Reflectometry (TDR) is an emerging technology in  the field of 
              Geotechnical instrumentation.  This research will develop a  TDR cable/grout 
              system that will deform in soil shear zones, in a manner  similar to that  now
              observed with shearing in rock joints.  These localized  shear zones  have been
              observed in soft clays.  Development of this  system will allow  direct
              transfer of TDR measurements for real time soil slope  monitoring,  and the
              necessary compliant cables will be developed in the  context of this  research.
               The TDR-based device will allow on-site or remote  access, and  can overcome
              many of the problems related to inclinometer  use.
