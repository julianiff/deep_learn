Abstract    :
              9523513  Wettlaufer         This project is a three-year experimental study of
              the  dynamics of liquid water existing at the boundaries of ice  crystal at
              temperatures below the freezing point of pure  water.  This process, called
              premelting, has significant  consequences in the redistributing of brine in sea
              ice, the  apparent migrating of contaminants through glacier ice, and  the rate
              of frost heave and weathering in soils and rocks.       Premelting is common to
              virtually all types of  materials, but has been most extensively studied in
              ice.  It may be caused by adsorption forces, wetting, size  effects, or
              substrate disorder, and involves many aspects  of surface physics and phase
              transition phenomena.  The  experimental and theoretical program will include
              studies  of ice crystal growth and unfrozen water transport between  crystals
              as functions of temperature and temperature  differences, as well as such
              studies between ice crystals  and various substrates.  An important objective
              will be the  development of useful models for ice growth and impurity 
              transport under natural conditions in order to assess how  grain interfaces may
              serve as chemical conduits.  ***
