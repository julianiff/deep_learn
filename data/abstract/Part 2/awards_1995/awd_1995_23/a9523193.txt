Abstract    :
              9523193  Stanton   This research is to improve infrared (IR) lasers to make them
              more reliable for field application and provide adequate wavelength coverage. 
              A compact, diode pumped wavelength modulatable mid-IR solid state laser will be
              developed, targeted toward development of rugged instruments for ultrasensitive
              detection of trace chemical species.  This fiber laser will operate in the 2.7
              micron region for trace species detection using wavelength modulation
              absorption spectroscopy.      The resulting IR laser will be applicable to a
              wide range of industrial processes.  These processes include process and stack
              gas monitoring, plasma process control, gas impurity monitoring, and real-time
              monitoring of tailpipe emissions.
