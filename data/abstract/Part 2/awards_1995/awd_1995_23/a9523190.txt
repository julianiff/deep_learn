Abstract    :
              9523190  Brown   An inexpensive, portable tungsten coil atomic absorption
              spectrometer will be designed, constructed, and evaluated.  This device will be
              a combination of a reliable tungsten coil atomizer, a miniature
              spectrometer/detector combination mounted on a PC card, and a near-line
              background correction method.  The instrument will be powered by a normal 12
              volt car battery connected through a car's cigarette lighter, and controlled
              with a laptop computer.   The detection of toxic chemicals in the environment
              is extremely important.  The proposed device will be attractive to a wide
              variety of laboratories that are dedicated to the detection of these chemicals
              and perform trace metal determinations regularly.
