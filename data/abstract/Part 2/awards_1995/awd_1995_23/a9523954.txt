Abstract    :
              Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) communications systems are limited by
              multiple access interference (MAI).  Multiuser detection accomplishes MAI
              cancellation by exploiting the knowledge of all users' signatures.  Due to the
              complexity of the optimum multiuser detector, various sub-optimum detector
              structures have been considered.  In this study a novel structure termed DC^3
              for adaptive multiuser detection of asynchronous users, which is simple in that
              it does not require duplication of the hardware, as optimum detectors require. 
              To handle errors in relative delay estimation, a special adaptive decorrelator
              called the 'bootstrap decorrelator' is utilized.  Performance of the bootstrap
              decorrelator under different fading environments with different unknown delays
              is analyzed and convergence and stability questions are treated.  Performance
              of the DC^3 receiver as a whole is also studied, in a realistic communications
              environment.
