Abstract    :
              9523509  Sheble    The Extended Brokerage System (EBS) is a multiple timed
              period,  multiple commodity implementation of previous research and 
              development of an electric market exchange.  The present  evaluation of
              transactions occurs only as a direct sale of  electric production beyond
              schedule capacity.  The EBS is  directed at evaluation of transactions beyond
              present schedule  techniques to increase the economic benefit of transactions  
              between utilities and independent power producers beyond electric  sale only. 
              The possibility of selling the raw materials is  included if a more economic
              solution can be found.  The bids for  potential transactions are not based on
              unit schedules but on a  market assessment of the price of electricity either
              in product  form or as a raw material (e.g.coal, oil, natural gas).  The net 
              result should b increased usage of the transmission grid across  the country
              and a decrease in the cost of electricity to the  consumer.    The EBS is
              appropriate if the industry is reorganized  horizontally or if some form of the
              present vertical integration  is maintained.  Since the focus of the on-going
              deregulation is  to price electricity as any other market commodity, the 
              development of an electric market place (EBS) is very timely  research and
              development activity to provide the foundation for  an efficient and comparably
              fair pricing mechanism.  Only through  open markets can a true price discovery
              process function to find  the optimal schedule given all constraints and all
              resources as  outlined in the proposal.   ***
