Abstract    :
              9523489  Rugh              Exploratory research is proposed to address new
              issues and  potential benefits in the use of World Wide Web facilities in 
              system and control engineering education.  The underlying  motivation is that
              appropriate use of this new technology will  have a major impact on engineering
              education in the United  States.  ***
