Abstract    :
              9523186  Jayne   This research is to develop an aerosol mass spectrometer for
              size and composition analysis of sub-micron size particles in the atmosphere.
              The technology for this device will build on a combination of proven technology
              for both aerosol sampling and mass spectrometry to develop a novel approach to
              particle composition analysis based on hot wire vaporization of size selected
              submicron particles.  This spectrometer will have the ability to determine the
              simultaneous chemical composition of the full range of aerosol particles,
              without the use of expensive and delicate laser systems.   The successful
              development of this spectrometer will be more cost effective than most
              competing systems now under development and will be useful in a wide variety of
              field applications.  These applications include environmental aerosol
              monitoring, laboratory aerosol physics, and other studies of aerosol formation
              and growth mechanics.
