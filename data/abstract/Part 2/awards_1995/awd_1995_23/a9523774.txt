Abstract    :
              The PI will use simultaneous ground-based measurements of the most  prominent
              features of nightglow to observe dynamical and  photochemical processes that
              control the mesopause region's thermal  structure and composition.  The PI will
              verify a detailed analysis  scheme to deduce the atomic oxygen density maximum
              and its centroid  height variation, compare these quantities for consistency
              with  simultaneous sodium lidar density and temperature profiles, and  verify
              tidal model predictions using the time variations of  intensities of visible
              and near IR airglow features and rotational  temperatures.  Such an analysis
              will enhance understanding of the  photochemistry of nightglow emissions and
              lead to an improved  theoretical framework for studying oxygen atom density
              variations  and atmospheric dynamics in the mesopause region.***
