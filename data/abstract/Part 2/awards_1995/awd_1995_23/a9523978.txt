              Title:  Reflection of ultrasonic lamb waves: theory and applications    In this
              research, theoretical and experimental research into ultrasonic Lamb waves,
              which are elastic waves propagating in plates of finite thickness, is proposed.
               Recently Lamb wave devices have been fabricated on plates that are thinner
              than one micron (including work by the PI).  Waves propagating in such thin
              structures have a number of attractive properties for use in physical, chemical
              and biological sensors.  Lamb waves also can provide a convenient tool for
              measuring the elastic properties of self-supporting thin films and
              microminiature mechanical structures.    In this work, Lamb wave reflections
              will be particularly investigated.  The reflection analysis will consider three
              types of discontinuities: thin conducting strips, mass loading strips and
              etched grooves.  The information obtained from this work will be used to
              develop Lamb wave resonators, unidirectional transducers and low loss delay
              lines. These devices will be designed and fabricated and their performance
              compared with the theoretical calculations.  The combined
              theoretical/experimental investigations are both fundamental and thorough and
              should result in advances applicable to the general field of elastic-wave
              microsensors.
