Abstract    :
              EEC-9523490  Ni    This award provides funding for one year to the University of
               Michigan, Ann Arbor's Industry/University Cooperative Research  Center for
              Dimensional Measurement and Control in Manufacturing.    The central theme of
              this Industry/University Cooperative Research  Center is "achieving
              manufacturing quality through measurement and  control."  The Center conducts
              research in: 1) Dimensional  Measurement Systems; 2) Dimensional Control for
              Formed Parts; and  3) Dimensional Control of Machine Parts.    The Center
              currently has nine industrial members.  In the past few  years, the Center has
              established a strong research program and has  achieved tremendous success in
              terms of research, technology  transfer, industrial collaboration, and spin-off
              activities.   Through the Center's activities the university faculty, students,
               and industrial members, have enjoyed a very close and mutual  beneficial
              working relationship.  This proposal requests a one year  renewal of the Center
              to capitalize on these successes and help  expand the impact onto other U.S.
              manufacturing industries.
