Abstract    :
              9523481  Lipson    This project will create a Metacenter Regional Alliance
              between the Cornell Theory Center and the Northeast Parallel Architectures
              Center (NPAC) and the Department of Physics at Syracuse University, to develop
              interactive multimedia educational modules incorporating advanced scientific
              simulations.  These will be integrated into undergraduate courses, and then
              into K-12 curricula, to enhance the teaching of general science courses.  The
              project will combine leading-edge technologies in high-performance computing
              and communications, a high-speed network serving as a testbed for the National
              Information Infrastructure, and advanced client/server technologies such as the
              World Wide Web, VRML and Java, to produce and deliver these simulations and
              educational modules.    An important aspect of this project is the conversion
              of computational science simulations into interactive educational modules. 
              Four simulations are proposed: fluctuating membranes, fluid dynamics, crack
              propagation and structural failure, and avalanches.  The researchers will
              utilize three different methods to provide these simulations in the classroom:
              annotated digital video on demand; partially interactive exploration using
              multiple video streams; and fully interactive simulations on demand. 
              Hypermedia navigation based on the concepts of the World Wide Web will be used
              to impose a coherent interface to these different simulations, and to provide
              educational information about the concepts illustrated by the simulations.
