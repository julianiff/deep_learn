Abstract    :
              9523349  Kundu  Ultrasonic techniques have been  found to be very effective in 
              detecting small defects in  comparatively small samples.  However, in big civil
               infrastructure type specimens such  as bridges, columns, poles and  pipelines
              use of ultrasonic  techniques has been limited  because of high absorption and 
              scattering of body waves  (longitudinal and shear waves  which are  used in
              ultrasonic  experiments) in such big objects.  In this project unconventional 
              Lamb waves at very low frequencies  (30 kHz - 200 kHz) will be used to  detect
              internal defects in civil  infrastructures. Initial  investigations have shown
              that for  detecting weak bonds and partially  damaged internal interfaces, Lamb
               waves are much  more efficient than body waves.  However, Lamb wave sensors
              have  not been developed yet to its full  potential because of the lack of 
              expertise in this field in sensor  industries.  In this research the  theory
              necessary to develop  efficient Lamb wave or guided wave  sensors will be
              developed first.  Then the new sensor will be  fabricated with the help of 
              transducer manufacturing  industries.  These sensors will be  tested at the
              Wright-Patterson  Material Laboratory and will be  used to detect internal
              damages in  concrete and metal slabs and  pipeline type civil  infrastructures.
                 Two companion projects are  supported to carry out the above  described
              research:  University of  Arizona which will develop the  basic lamb wave
              theory and conduct  initial sensor design and testing,  and University of
              Dayton/Wright  Patterson Laboratory which will  test the fabricated sensors and
               evaluate the results.  ***
