Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Lisa Xu  9523082       Heat transport between blood vessels and their
              surrounding tissues will be studied theoretically and experimentally.  The
              focus of the work is on matched pairs of blood vessels between 80 and 200
              microns in diameter, the model of which will be an exteriorized rat
              spinotrapezius muscle.  The experimental approach includes infrared imaging of
              the tissue preparation and Doppler velocimetry of the blood flow.  Exisitng
              analytical models will be evaluated and extended to support the experimental
              findings.  Applications include tissue freezing, cryopreservation, laser
              surgery and hypothermia protocols.
