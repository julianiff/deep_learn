Abstract    :
              9523470  Leuze    Currently few researchers from historically black colleges and
              universities (HBCU) are able to effectively incorporate high performance
              computing (HPC) technology into their research.  The Joint Institute for
              Computational Sciences (JICS), a consortium between the University of Tennessee
              (UT) and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), seeks to remedy this lack
              through training, hands-on experience, and long term collaborative relations
              between HBCU researchers, and computational scientists and applications
              researchers.  This goal will be met by the establishment of a Metacenter
              Regional Alliance (MRA) at UT to enable JICS to extend supercomputing support
              to HBCUs within the southeastern United States.    Initially, four HBCUs will
              participate in the MRA's planned activities:  Tennessee State University and
              Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee, Alabama A&M in Normal,
              Alabama, and Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  Approximately
              twelve individuals from these four institutions will be selected to participate
              in Summer Computational Workshops, with the goals: To provide basic instruction
              in the use of HPC resources, particularly parallel computers and clusters of
              workstations linked via PVM; to begin developing and porting application codes
              to HPC through one-on-one and small group consultations with JICS staff, and to
              initiate collaborations with researchers with common interests at UT, ORNL, and
              other institutions affiliated with JICS and the NSF Metacenter.  Equipment to
              facilitate remote collaboration and interaction with HBCUs will be used to
              maintain communications between participating researchers and MRA personnel.
