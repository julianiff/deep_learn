Abstract    :
                   The North Carolina Supercomputing Center (NCSC) will work with  the
              National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and with the  Lawrence
              Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) to prototype the use  of parallel-capable,
              self-describing data models in coupling the  components of a climate model. 
              This work would build on the  disciplinary expertise of NCAR and LLNL in
              climate modeling and  parallel computing, and on preliminary efforts at LLNL
              and NCSC  using object-oriented technologies to build interdisciplinary 
              modeling frameworks.       Using these approaches can be a very powerful means
              of  reducing simulation model complexity.  Coupling the atmospheric,  ocean,
              and ice components of a climate models is an excellent  application. Present
              coupling strategies are fairly complex and  somewhat ad hoc.  Using appropriate
              abstractions, one can separate  the science, the algorithms used for coupling, 
              and the parallel  data and task decompositions more cleanly, resulting in a
              more  portable, maintainable, extensible, and comprehensible model.  It  is
              believed this can be done without unduly sacrificing efficiency.       This
              award is made under the USGCRP Methods and Models for  Integrated Assessments.
