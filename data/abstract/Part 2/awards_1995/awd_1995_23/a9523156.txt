Abstract    :
              9523156  Hollis   Planar linear motors, often called forcers, provide low
              friction motion in a large workspace with few moving parts.  Because they
              operate as open loop steppers, they are: susceptible to losing steps,  affected
               by external disturbances, and cannot provide controlled forces or high
              stiffness.  Feedback control can compensate for these deficiencies if reliable
              and unobtrusive position sensors are available.  This project will investigate
              two unobtrusive sensing techniques for planar motor systems with 1 micrometer
              positioning resolution.  One proposed sensor uses the AC magnetic field drive
              flux to induce a field in a sensing tooth on the mounting platen.  The other
              approach also uses platen teeth, but is based on optics.  A when a tooth coated
              with a florescent dye material is illuminated by light of one wavelength, it
              emits light at a  longer wavelength; the intensity of this secondary wavelength
              is function of position.  Research issues for both sensors are spatial and
              temporal noise, cross talk, and sensor-forcer integration.  Using these
              sensors, a model based and a variable structure robust control scheme will be
              designed to deal with nonlinear magnetic fields, payload effects and model
              uncertainties.  This research will enable increases in speed and payload for
              planar linear motors, making them attractive as actuators for next generation
              machines and equipment that need one micrometer positioning over a large planar
              workspace.   ***
