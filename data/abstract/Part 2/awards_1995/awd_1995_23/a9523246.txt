Abstract    :
              9523246  Bienkiewicz  This award supports the participation of the principal 
              investigation in the United States-Japan Natural Resources  (UJNR) 27th Joint
              Panel Meeting on Wind & Seismic Effects  and the Technical Visit Program that
              will take place in  Japan, May 14-28, 1995.  He will present a paper on
              researah  accomplishments and research needs in wind engineering in  the United
              States, and on the possible United States-Japan  joint research opportunities. 
              This will be one of the few  wind engineering research papers presented at this
              meeting.  The P.I. will also participate in the Annual Meeting of the  Japanese
              Association for Wind Engineering which will be  followed by a meeting of the
              International Wind Engineering  Forum (IWEF).  He will represent well the wind
              engineering  community interests because he is a known expert in this  field
              and because he has had a long association with  Japanese researchers.  ***
