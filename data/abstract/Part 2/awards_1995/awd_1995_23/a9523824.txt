Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9523824    The overall goal is to understand the circumstances in
              which colloidal phases exist suspended in groundwater.  It is hypothesized that
              mobilization of colloids, pre-existing as part of diagenetically produced
              coating and matrix within the aquifer deposit, is the most common and important
              source of such microparticles and macromolecules to the groundwater from
              aquifer sands.  The particle-particle contacts present in aquifer sands that
              serve to immobilize colloids will be identified.  The responsiveness of such
              attached surfaces to changes in solution composition will be determined, and 
              the mobilization of colloids within intact in situ aquifer deposits when these
              are flushed by changed groundwater will be assessed.  High resolution
              transmission electron microscope will be used to examine aquifer grain contacts
              on the nanometer scale.  By exposing such well-characterized natural colloid
              reservoirs to defined aqueous solutions in the laboratory, the mechanisms by
              which the surface-surface attractive forces can be changed to repulsive
              interactions will be deduced.  Small scale field injection/withdrawal tests
              using modified groundwater compositions, chosen based on the laboratory
              results, will be performed to assess the ease with which the colloids are
              detached in the field.    Understanding the mechanisms by which colloid
              mobilization occur in groundwater is important for waste disposal activities
              and the movements of "pump-and-treat" type remediations.    ***
