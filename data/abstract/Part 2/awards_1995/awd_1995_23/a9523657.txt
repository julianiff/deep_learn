Abstract    :
              9523657  Thomas    This Americas Program award will support a research 
              collaboration between Dr. J. Kerry Thomas, University of  Notre Dame and Dr.
              Andres Olea, University of Chile, on a  kinetic and thermodynamic study of
              anionic polyelectrolytes.  The polymer systems to be studied are poly and
              copolymers of  maleic anhydride and styrene.  The P.I.'s intend to evaluate 
              the effect of hydrophobicity and charge density on the  microdomains generated
              in aqueous solutions of these  polymers.  The  goals of the study are to
              identify the  structural parameters which determine the formation and size  of
              the hydrophobic aggregates; to evaluate the  solubilization capacity of organic
              molecules by these  aggregates; and to investigate by stopped flow studies the 
              dynamic nature of both processes.    This  collaboration will benefit from the
              complementary  expertise of the two researchers as well as from the  facilities
              in both institutions.  The University of Notre  Dame has a variety of laser
              systems to  excite photosystems  with short pulses of light,  and the
              University of Chile has  a laboratory of polymer synthesis where both the
              synthesis  and identification of the copolymers will be made.  ***
