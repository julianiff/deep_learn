Abstract    :
              DMS 9523994  LUECKING     This proposal asks for participant support costs for
              graduate students and younger researchers to attend the 20th conference of the
              University of Arkansas Annual Lecture Series in the Mathematical Sciences. 
              This conference will bring together researchers in the areas of Banach space
              theory and harmonic analysis.   Both of these fields are funded by NSF and
              several of the main speakers are NSF grantees.  The University of Arkansas
              mathematics department is taking an active role with volunteer faculty support
              and financial support.
