Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9523579    A proof-of-concept study is proposed for a new approach
              to predict cavitation and outgassing in a moving fluid.  The previously used
              threshold criterion based on pressure is replaced by one considering the
              principal stresses in a flowing fluid.  Experiments and direct simulations will
              be conducted to verify the applicability of the proposed criterion in
              relatively simple devices.  The pertinent information from literature will be
              reviewed from the perspective of this criterion.    If successful, the new
              criterion will fundamentally change our understanding of cavitation and 
              outgassing in flowing fluid, as well as the design methods of turbomachinery,
              hydraulic circuits, and various fluid flow facilities in industry.  ***
