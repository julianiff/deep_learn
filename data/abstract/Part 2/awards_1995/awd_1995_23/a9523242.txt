               Due to the rapid economic development in China, a  number of new opportunities
              for joint cooperation emerged, and  these opportunities have caught attention
              of leaders of research  communities in both countries, in civil infrastructure

              cross-fertilization of ideas in civil  infrastructure research and technology
              development.
