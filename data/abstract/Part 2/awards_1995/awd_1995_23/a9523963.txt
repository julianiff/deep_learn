Abstract    :
              9523963  Vazquez      Birds must use muscles of the shoulder and back to
              maintain horizontal body posture during flight.  Otherwise, the body orients
              itself vertically relative to the extended horizontal wings.  Previous
              researchers have hypothesized about the muscles responsible for generating
              horizontal body attitude, but no experimental analyses have yet been conducted.
              The objective of this study is to experimentally determine the muscles involved
              in aligning the body of a bird in a horizontal attitude during level forward
              flight.  Through the minute electrode wires each muscle will receive electrical
              impulses that will induce contraction.  This protocol enables the investigator
              to determine which muscles are responsible for posturing the bird's body
              horizontally during flight.  The proposed research will attempt to add another
              piece to a puzzle that has engaged man for centuries; how does a bird fly? 
              Though the final answer to this question will no doubt be very complicated and
              multifaceted, it is possible to make a significant contribution to the
              elucidation of this phenomenon by understanding the adaptations in the shoulder
              that allow the body to attain an aerodynamic posture and work in unison.  ***
