Abstract    :
              9523180  Arnold   This research focuses on the improvement of Ion Mobility
              Spectrometry (IMS) with regard to sensitivity and dynamic range.  The
              construction of selective ion gating and ultra sensitive ion collection
              electrodes, and formulating a new dynamic dilution approach to control source
              analyze concentrations are the two methodq that will be used to improve upon
              the specified features.  These additions will yield an IMS instrument capable
              of 5 to 6 orders of magnitude of linear response with the additional benefit of
              ion source chemistry control for more reproducible spectrometry.   The IMS
              presently performs tasks such as environmental monitoring and the detection of
              chemical and biological agents.  When this research is completed, the new
              technologies will enhance the IMS performance, be integrated with other
              developments, and greatly expand its commercial use.
