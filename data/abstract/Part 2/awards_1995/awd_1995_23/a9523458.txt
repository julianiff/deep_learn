Abstract    :
              NSF and NASA will jointly sponsor a one-day workshop on the  interplanetary
              aspects of Space Weather.  The workshop is proposed  to fall between the Solar
              Wind Conference, GEM and CEDAR meetings  to take advantage of potential
              participants in transit.  Primary  topics to be included are the solar
              particle, photon and plasma  influences on space weather, their relative
              importance, their  causes, and their potential predictability through use of 
              observations and physical models.***
