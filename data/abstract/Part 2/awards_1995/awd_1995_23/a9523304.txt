Abstract    :
              9523304  Jones  The project will design and develop an integrated sensor  system
              coupled with a compatible design tool that will  enable real-time, interactive
              assessment of the structural  state of a complex mechanical or structural
              system.  The  components of this diagnostics tool are:  a Kalman-filter 
              identification model, an accelerometer-based sensor system  and a generalized
              partially observable Markov design process  model.  The broad applicability of
              the system includes  structural problems associated with extending the
              lifetimes  of power generating facilities; real-time monitoring and  assessment
              of complex power transmission and piping systems;  and modeling and control of
              signal and control of system  instability.  ***
