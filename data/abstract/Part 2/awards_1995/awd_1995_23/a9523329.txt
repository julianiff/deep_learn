Abstract    :
              The PI plans to investigate the linear/nonlinear character of the  geomagnetic
              variation response at high, middle and low latitudes on  the changing
              conditions in near-Earth space, and study their global  behavior within the
              20-22nd solar activity cycles.  Moreover, he  will obtain and study the global
              spatial distribution of  geomagnetic variations caused by the interplanetary
              magnetic field  (IMF) and solar wind changes.  Next, he will apply spherical 
              harmonic expansions to the results and create a primary set of  coefficients
              for the Global Geomagnetic Variation Reference Field  model.  Finally, this
              model and its global changes will be  exploited on a scale of three decades for
              implications into the  Earth's interacting physical, biological, and human
              system  models.***
