Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    Proposal Number:  CTS-9523291  PI:  Maxworthy     This is a
              comprehensive and carefully integrated computational and experimental
              investigation of the evolution of swirling jets.  These flows are of practical
              significance in a broad range of applications.  In spite of this practical
              significance, the mechanisms that govern their spatio-temporal dynamics of
              these flows are poorly understood.  Swirling jets are subjected to both shear
              and centrifugal instabilities and therefore exhibit a rich and varied set of
              disturbance modes.  The generation, existence, and interaction of these
              mechanisms has not been investigated in any detail.  It is expected that the
              identification, quantification, and eventual control of the governing
              structures by  means of vortex dynamics and direct Navier-Stokes simulations,
              as well as experimental DPIV measurements will significantly advance the state
              of the art in a variety of propulsion, combustion and mixing applications.
