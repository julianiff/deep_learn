Abstract    :
              y9523042  Thomas      This project is for support of travel expenses for
              students and  non-PSERC faculty to attend a two-day conference.  The Conference
               is sponsored by the newly formed Power Systems Engineering  Research
              Consortium (PSERC), EPRI and the USDOE and will be of  value to people from
              industry, government, and academia with  interests in the technical elements of
              the electric power  industry restructuring and of the associated public policy 
              issues.  Persons with technical backgrounds will find the  conference extremely
              informative about technical issues and  research frontiers.  Persons with
              non-technical background will  find opportunities in the conference to develop
              a better  understanding of power system technologies, and of operational  and
              planning issues associated with providing universal customer  choice.  ***
