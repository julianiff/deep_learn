Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9523968    The role of interparticle interactions in shear
              thickening of colloidal suspensions will be investigated.  Modeling work
              assumes that particle clustering is the main cause of the experimentally
              observed phenomenon.  Other assumptions will be tested.  Laboratory
              verification will be performed with three model colloidal suspensions:  a model
              hard-sphere silica suspension, a charge-stabilized latex and polydispersivity
              on shear thickening transition will be analyzed.  Microscopic probing of the
              flow microstructure and rheological measurements will be performed.  The
              numerical simulations will include relevant colloidal and hydrodynamic
              inter-particle interactions.    The results are expected to be used to design
              suspensions fro specific rheological performance criteria required systems with
              concentrated suspensions, such as in films, coatings, ink and ceramics.  ***
