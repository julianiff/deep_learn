Abstract    :
                        ABSTRACT  OPP-9523941      This Small Grant for Exploratory Research
              will support archaeological, geological and archaeological surveys of karst and
              sea cave sites in southeastern Alaska. Initial surveys have rendered
              spectacular cave paintings, well-preserved organic materials, and evidence that
              the region had deglaciated from ca 16,000 BP. This project will contribute to
              the knowledge of Quaternary sea/land relationships and geomorphology, marine
              and terrestrial biotic communities, and early human settlement along the
              northern coastal corridor of North America. Surveys will be conducted in
              conjunction with the U.S. Forest Service and the National Speleological
              Society.  ***  ??
