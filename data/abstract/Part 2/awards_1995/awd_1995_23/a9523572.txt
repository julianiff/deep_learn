Abstract    :
              9523572  Gluhovsky        The study of fundamental aspects of atmospheric
              systems is made difficult by  the fact that these systems are nonlinear and
              sometimes chaotic in nature.   Accordingly, numerical systems (known as low
              order models) that lend themselves  to relatively simple mathematical solutions
              while still maintaining the fundamental  characteristics of the atmospheric
              flows are valuable research tools for understanding  the underlying physics.   
                   Preliminary studies by the Principal Investigators indicate that low order
               models of atmospheric phenomena may be presented in the form of mathematical 
              systems known in classical mechanics as Volterra gyrostats.  In this project,
              low  order models for mesoscale cellular convection will be developed in the
              form of  systems of coupled gyrostats.  This will promote understanding of this
              complex  phenomenon as well as the demonstrating the fundamental role that
              coupled  gyrostats could play in the study of geophysical fluid dynamics.
