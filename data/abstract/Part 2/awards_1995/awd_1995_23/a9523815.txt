Abstract    :
              9523815  Camp       Flush communication channels generalize the more
              conventional  asynchronous one-to-one communication paradigms.  A flush channel
               offers the implementor of a distributed application the flexibility  of
              specifying a message delivery order apropos of the demands of  the application.
               This stands in marked contrast to the rigid FIFO  (first-in-first-out)
              delivery order of communication specified by  a virtual circuit in TCP/IP or
              specified by a virtual channel in  ATM communication.  The more restrictive the
              delivery order, the  less concurrency possible to exploit in message
              transmissions over  a multi-path system.  Flush channels allow the user to
              define the   delivery of a message to be after the delivery of all messages   
              previously transmitted, or before the delivery of all messages  subsequently
              transmitted, or both.  The delivery order between the  sending site and the
              destination site, created by the user, is a  partial order.       The results
              from previous work are encouraging.  Flush  communication channels can reduce
              the mean delivery time of  messages substantially, regardless of the underlying
              physical  structure of the network.  That is, an implementor of a distributed 
              application that uses an F-channel can reduce communication costs  whether the
              communication occurs on routes established for virtual  circuit or datagram in
              TCP/IP or UDP/IP or on routes established  for the connectionless service class
              D provided by the ATM  Adaptation Layer.  This possible reduction in mean
              delivery time of  messages may be critical in meeting real-time requirements of
              the  application.  However, all previous results only consider  interprocess
              communication (IPC) for one-to-one communication.  The  goal of this research
              is to investigate the implications of  implementation and performance when we
              extend F-channel  communication to many-to-many communication.  ***
