Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CMS9523141  PI:  Kaliakin, et al., University of Delaware    The
              problem of time-dependent response of geosynthetically  reinforced soil 
              structures requires study from the standpoint of fundamental  mechanics, and 
              attention is needed on current design procedures and for  future  applications.
               Standing in the way of a thorough  understanding of the  time-dependent
              behavior are the lack of stress relaxation  experimental  data, and the lack of
              a robust constitutive model for the  reinforcement  that will account for both
              creep and stress relaxation in a  rational  manner.    The major objectives of
              the research are:  1) to  experimentally study  stress relaxation of selected
              geosynthetic reinforcement, 2)  to develop a  simple constitutive model to
              realistically simulate the time  dependent  behavior of the reinforcement, 3)
              to implement this model  into an existing  FE computer code, and to verify the
              predictive capabilities  of the model,  and 4) to conduct an extensive
              numerical parametric study of  geosynthetically reinforced walls at working
              stress  conditions.  The  results will facilitate the understanding of time
              dependent  behavior of  geosynthetic reinforcement interactive with backfill
              soil  and will make the  design of such structures more rational.
