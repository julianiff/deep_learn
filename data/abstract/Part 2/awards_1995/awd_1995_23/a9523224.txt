Abstract    :
              9523224  Lee   This project will integrate two of the most significant devices
              for analytical separation and detection:  capillary electrophoresis (CE) and
              mass spectrometry (MS).  Other attempts to couple these two have had
              limitations because of insufficient sensitivity and scan speed.  This system
              will be based on an atmospheric pressure ionization (API) time-of-flight mass
              spectrometry (TOFMS) system.  A specially designed, CE/electrospray ion source
              will be added, as well as an ion mirror to increase the resolution of the
              instrument and minimize its limitations.     If successful, this device will
              meet the industry's expectation in situations where fast separations are
              desired or the number of samples to be analyzed increases.  This device will
              have applications in such fields as biochemical analysis, pharmaceutical
              analysis, environmental analysis, and process quality control.
