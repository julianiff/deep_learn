Abstract    :
              9523648  Padture    The objective of the proposed research is to understand the 
              aspects of microstructural evolution in in situ-reinforced  (ISR) silicon
              carbide (SiC).  This is a new class of tough  ceramics in which 
              elongated-grain reinforcements are grown  in situ within the microstructure
              during pressureless liquid-  phase sintering.  The proposed research consists
              of two sets  of critical experimental studies:  1) a systematic  study of 
              densification and grain--growth kinetics in polycrystalline  liquid-phase
              sintered SiC, and 2) a systematic study of  growth kinetics of isolated SiC
              grains grown in s  supersaturated Al-Y-O-C glass.  The results of the 
              experiments will be critically analyzed, with reference to  existing models
              whenever possible, to determine the rate-  controlling mechanisms for
              densification, normal grain  growth and anisotropic grain growth.  %%%  It is
              anticipated that the proposed study will provide a  comprehensive picture of
              the evolution of the  microstructures in ISR SiC an understanding vital to the 
              effective tailoring of mechanical properties.  In addition,  the research also
              has the potential to contribute toward a  broader goal of guiding general
              processing efforts for  creating the next generation of ISR ceramics with novel
               microstructures for superior mechanical properties.  ***
