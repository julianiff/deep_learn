Abstract    :
              9523977  Stuiver    They propose to begin exploring the potential of Lechuguilla
              Cave, New Mexico, for obtaining oxygen-isotope paleoclimate records extending
              throughout the Pleistocene.  At this time, the famous Devil Hole calcite
              speleothem is the only stable isotope record reaching back to the middle
              Pleistocene in the Southwestern US (Winograd et al, 1992). They have recovered
              a mammillary calcite speleothem from Lechuguilla Cave which is older than the
              Devils Hole calcite.  This sample the has the potential, through oxygen isotope
                          ( 18O) measurements, of providing a paleoclimate record comparable
              in resolution to that at Devils Hole.  One of the significant tasks in any such
              study is the development of a numerical age chronology.  They will use electron
              spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopic dating to accomplish this goal.
