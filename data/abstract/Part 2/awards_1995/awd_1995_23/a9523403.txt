Abstract    :
              9523403  Nowlin  This project wi1l address the need for a new approach to making
               current meter measurements in remote locations.  PIs at Oregon  State
              University have developed various components of an expendable  current meter
              mooring that will, at a present time, release its  mooring, rise to the ocean
              surface, and transmit data via the ARGOS  satellite system.  In this
              exploratory project, three of these  systems will be purchased, and three
              entire configurations will be  tested in an accessible location prior to
              committing to a purchase  of ten for deployment in the Antarctic.  If
              successful, ten systems  will be deployed in the Indian Ocean region of the
              Antarctic  Circumpolar Current during a WOCE cruise on the R/V Palmer in 1996. 
               The primary justification for this cruise has been determined in an 
              already-reviewed proposal that will be recommended for support in  FY96.  While
              the current meter arrays will add crucial information  to the WOCE Indian Ocean
              Survey, further testing is an essential  precursor to actual deployment.  ***
