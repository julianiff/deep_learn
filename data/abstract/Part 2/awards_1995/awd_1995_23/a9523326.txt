Abstract    :
              This proposal will study the effects of solar irradiance variations  associated
              with the solar cycle on global change, with the use of  a coupled
              climate/middle atmospheric model.  The PI will  investigate the potential
              impact that solar cycle variations may  have on the troposphere and the
              stratosphere and the physical  mechanisms by which any such impact occurs.  The
              main focus, due to  previously gained knowledge, will be determining the
              temperature  and wind gradients resulting from realistic solar insulation and 
              QBO changes, and their effect on the generation, propagation and  dissipation
              conditions for planetary and gravity waves in the  middle atmosphere and
              troposphere.  Additionally, they will assess  the potential climate impact of
              the solar cycling phenomena when  integrated over entire solar cycles.***
