Abstract    :
              DMS-9523804  Ercolani/Wojtkowski/Kennedy/Wehr    This award will support a
              workshop in Dynamical Systems to be held at the University of Arizona in March,
              1996.  Dynamical Systems is an important area that has seen significant recent
              developments, both as a subject unto itself as well as providing a unifying
              principle for nonlinear science.
