Abstract    :
                                                    With this GOALI award, the OMA and the
              Synthetic Organic Program support the research of  Dr. Douglas F. Taber of the
              Department of Chemistry at the University of Delaware.  Professor  Taber will
              spend a sabbatical year at Dupont Merck Pharmaceuticals learning to understand
              the  specific challenges currently faced in pharmaceutical manufacturing.  This
              knowledge will be  used, in turn, to guide the academic research carried out in
              Dr. Taber's group at Delaware.
