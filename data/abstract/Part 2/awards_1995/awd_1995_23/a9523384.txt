Abstract    :
              EEC-9523384  Howes    This award provides funding for a one year extension to
              the   Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Grinding at the 
              University of Connecticut.    The Center will continue to develop research
              activities and to  advance the state-of-the-art understandings on grinding
              through  several major core fundamental research activities:1.) Vibration, 
              Control, and Dynamics; 2.) Truing and Dressing; 3.) Grinding  Fluids;
              4.)Materials and Surfaces.  In addition, the Center will  continue to develop
              testbed research projects in cooperation with  its company members to conduct
              the proof-of-concept implementation  and prtotyping.    The Center currently
              has 13 industrial members.  In the past few  years, the Center has established
              a strong research program and has  achieved tremendous success in terms of
              research, technology  transfer, industrial collaboration, and spin-off
              activities.   Through the Center's activities, university faculty, and
              students,   industrial members have enjoyed a very close and mutual beneficial 
              working relationship.  This University of Connecticut requests a  one year
              renewal of the Center to capitalize on these success and  help expand the
              impact onto other U.S. manufacturing industries.
