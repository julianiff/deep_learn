Abstract    :
              9523456  Sirkis         This proposal describes the development of a sensor
              system  capable of remotely monitoring the progression of decay in wood 
              utility poles used to support overhead transmission lines in  power
              distribution networks.  This shall be done by detecting one  or more of the
              following chemical/biological metrics of decay:  (1) presence and/or
              concentration of decay causing fungi, (2)  end-products of metabolic growth of
              the decay causing fungi, (3)  decrease in critical nutrients required to
              support fungi  metabolic growth, (4) increase in enzymes, (5) decrease in the 
              ratio of carbon to nitrogen, and/or (6) decrease in pH. Detection  of these
              chemical metrics of decay shall be accomplished by  developing a
              multifunctional integrated optic-based sensor system  that utilizes Bragg
              gratings etched into planar waveguides.  Part  of the waveguide will utilize
              Bragg grating with an upper  cladding fabricated from chemical species.  As
              binding occurs,  the propagation constant of the waveguide changes, resulting
              in  corresponding changes in the Bragg wavelength.  Highly sensitive 
              interferometric-based demodulation schemes will be developed to  monitor the
              chemically-induced changes in the Bragg wavelength.   A higher order Bragg
              grating located on the same waveguide will  be used aid optically probe the
              cellular structure in order to  monitor pH and/or florescence indicative of the
              targeted  metabolic by-products of decay.  The sensor technology we propose 
              offers (1) high rejection of electromagnetic noise, (2)  compatibility with
              optical fiber telemetry so that sensor data  can be transmitted simultaneously
              with communications signals  thereby making possible remote pole inspection,
              (3)  multiplexibility so that many sensors can be fabricated into the  same
              planar waveguide, and many planar waveguides can be located  along the same
              optical fiber lead, and (4) manufacturing  processes similar to those used in
              the microelectrics industry  thereby making possible sensors amenable to l ow
              cost mass  production.  ***
