Abstract    :
              The PIs will test various data assimilation schemes on the January  20-30, 1993
              World Campaign CEDAR database.  This database contains  observations from
              ground-based instruments, which will be  supplemented with UARS satellite data
              and simulations produced by  the NCAR
              Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere-Electrodynamics General  Circulation Model
              (TIME-GCM).  The PI will:  (1) develop,  implement, and validate an optimal
              nudging data smoothing scheme;  (2) develop a direct optimization parameter
              estimation scheme; (3)  research the applicability of the adjoint model
              technique; (4)  develop and implement an adjoint model parameter estimation
              scheme;  and (5) apply assimilation schemes to the January 20-30, 1993 10-  day
              campaign data.***
