Abstract    :
              This award will continue the operation of the Alaska-Canada  meridian chain of
              magnetomers and riometers as a tool for the  continued investigation of high
              latitude geomagnetic phenomena and  as a remote sensing facilty for the space
              physics community.  The  chain has provided a virtually continuous data base
              for study since  the 1950's.  Data from the various sites are returned in near
              real  time to the NOAA Space Environment Laboratory where it is available  for
              public use and distribution.  The data are used to study  magnetospheric
              processes, including substorms, convection patterns,  ionospheric currents,
              geomagnetic pulsations and the polar cusp.   The data are also used to support
              rocket and satellite experiments  that require information about the overall
              conditions in the space  environment.  The investigators will continue to
              operate the chain,  provide data to the data center, and conduct scientific
              studies of  geomagnetic processes.  Three GOES radio transmitters will be 
              purchased to allow real-time transmission of data from the remote  sites to the
              Space Environment Center in Boulder, Colorado.
