Abstract    :
              9523232  Antonsson   This award provides funding to develop a set-based approach
              to formalizing negotiations and trade-offs in the engineering design process,
              particularly where many engineers and many groups are involved in
              decision-making.  This is commonly the case for large and/or complex
              engineering systems.  This work builds on the method of imprecision and a
              recently developed  set-based approach, and seeks to create a combined approach
              for preliminary engineering design that will permit formal negotiation among
              groups with conflicting goals.  The research approach will make use of the
              mathematics of fuzzy sets.   If successful, the results of this research could
              reduce engineering design time and increase design quality, particularly for
              large and/or complex engineering systems.  One outcome will be the increased
              level of concurrence or overlap of work that might otherwise be done
              sequentially in the engineering design process.  This could significantly
              decrease the time needed to create a successful design and thus improve the
              competitive ability of U.S. industry.  The informal use of set-based design
              methods has already demonstrated a shortening of the design cycle.
