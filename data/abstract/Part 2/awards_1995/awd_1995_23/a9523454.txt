Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a Small Grant for Exploratory  Research (SGER) to
              examine the feasibility of applying  conventional and interferometric synthetic
              aperture radar  techniques to map the basal portion of glaciers.  Conventional 
              imaging synthetic aperture radars (SARs) provide only a two-  dimensional view
              of the bottom of the ice, and limited  information on basal physical
              properties.  Three dimensional maps  of the bottom can be obtained with
              Interferometric Synthetic  Aperture Radar and would significantly enhance the
              utility of  radar data in the study of glacial dynamics.  This feasibility 
              study will examine the characteristics of electromagnetic  propagation through
              glacial ice, the optimum conditions for  synthetic aperture radar imaging and
              the scattering  characteristics of the bottom ice.  The result of this work
              will  be a determination of the optimum set of system parameters needed  for a
              synthetic aperture radar to map the basal characteristics  of glacial ice.
