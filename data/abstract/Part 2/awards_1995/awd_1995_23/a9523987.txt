Abstract    :
              MISETA (Multi-Instrumented Studies of Equatorial Thermosphere Aeronomy) is a 
              program to systematically study ionospheric and thermospheric properties in the
               equatorial regions, particularly spread-F, ionospheric irregularities, and the
               equatorial electrojet.  It is a joint program involving Clemson University, 
              Boston College, Dartmouth College, and Boston University.  The investigators
              will  continue to conduct coordinated measurements at Jicamarca, Ancon, and
              Arequipa,  Peru, using a variety of instruments, including coherent and
              incoherent scatter  radar, digisonde, spaced scintillation receiver,
              Fabry-Perot interferometer, and  all-sky imager.  Most of the instruments are
              designed to run continuously, but  the study also requires more intensive
              experimental campaigns in which additional  instruments are deployed on a
              temporary basis.  One campaign has been conducted  as part of the previous
              award, and one more campaign will be conducted as part  of the continuation. 
              The role of Clemson University in the program is to  organize the program,
              operate the Fabry-Perot interferometer, and conduct  scientific analysis of the
              data.***
