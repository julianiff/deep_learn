Abstract    :
              This project is part of a longer-term research effort to promote a firmer 
              understanding of the factors that control the transport and chemical fate of
              pollutants, substrates,  and electron acceptors at the Darcy scale, in practice
              the smallest scale for modeling the transport  and chemical fate of solutes in
              porous media.  At the Darcy scale, a complex medium consisting of  pores, a
              solid matrix with biofilm, etc. is replaced by a homogenized medium
              characterized by  constitutive relations and parameters.  The methodology of
              the project will be to model flow,  transport, and chemical transformations at
              the pore scale and then to scale up in order to derive  constitutive equations
              and parameters.  The constitutive equations and parameters to be obtained will 
              thus be consistent with the fundamental physico-chemical principles as well as
              the heterogeneity of  the medium.  The fundamental objective is to derive
              relations among quantities defined and measurable  at the Darcy scale.
