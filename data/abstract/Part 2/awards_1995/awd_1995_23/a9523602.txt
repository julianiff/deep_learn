Abstract    :
              This research program revolves around three different but  related projects in
              discrete choice modeling and estimation.  The common theme is the modeling of
              consumer choice  behavior, and the estimation of models of consumer behavior 
              on revealed preference data sets.  With the availability of  electronic scanner
              panel data, choice models have become  very important for understanding
              consumer behavior.  For  example, such models may be used to evaluate the
              impact of  the marketing mix on consumer purchasing behavior, and to  assess
              the patterns of competition in the market place.  The  three research projects
              in this study involve the use of  recently developed simulation estimation
              techniques.  In the  model of the first project, consumer choice probabilities 
              are high dimensional integrals over unobserved prices and  coupon values, as
              well as over stochastic preference shocks.  Thus, Monte-Carlo methods must be
              used to simulate the  likelihood function in the model.  In the second and
              third  projects, both solution of the dynamic programming problem  and
              construction of the likelihood function require high  dimensional integrations
              over stochastic process for prices,  preference shocks, etc.  In these projects
              we will use Monte-  Carlo methods both to solve consumers' dynamic programming 
              problems and to simulate the likelihood function.
