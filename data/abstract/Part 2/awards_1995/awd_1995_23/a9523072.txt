Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CMS9523072  PI:  Kemeny, University of Arizona    Coupling phenomena
              are extremely important in rocks and  include mechanical,  hydraulic, thermal,
              and chemical processes.  In this study,  crack-induced  coupling mechanisms
              will be investigated with both  experimental and  modeling studies.  The focus
              will be on investigation of how  mechanical  loading, thermal loading, and the
              chemistry of the fluid  environment in the  cracks influences the flow
              properties of the rock.    Experimental emphasis will be placed on a series of
              coupled  mechanical/flow  triaxial tests in which both axial and lateral 
              permeabilities are measured  while samples are subjected to triaxial stresses
              up to and  past peak  stress.  Laboratory tests will also involve thermal
              loading  (both uniform  and borehole heating) and tests to study crack growth
              under  different fluid  chemistries.    Modeling will be focused on development
              of a finite element  damage model.  Fracture mechanics-based relationships will
              be developed  between the  coupling mechanisms, and will include crack
              interaction  effects.  These  relationships will be implemented into a finite
              element  model to predict  coupled behavior under complex boundary conditions. 
              In  addition, a  discrete crack boundary element model will be developed to 
              study the  capability of crack growth due to thermal loading and under 
              different fluid  chemistries (via subcritical crack extension), and the 
              capability of  calculating the permeability through a generated crack 
              population will be  added.
