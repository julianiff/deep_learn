Abstract    :
              9523731   Hopke     The PIs have developed and tested a number of different
              mathematical techniques that can help extract information on source/receptor
              relationships in the atmospheric transport of airborne particulate matter from
              compositional data sets. These methods include techniques for projecting high
              dimensionality, multielemental composition data into two or three dimensions;
              and the integration of meteorological information in the form of back
              trajectory calculations into the analysis by creating a conditional probability
              field. For the interpretation of multivariate air quality data, the use of
              Neural Networks has been explored, as well as its combination with the minimal
              spanning tree technique.    In this project, the development, testing, and
              application of new multivariate statistical methods to atmospheric sample
              composition data, primarily particles and precipitation, will be continued.
              Extensive collaborations have been established with atmospheric scientists from
              all parts of the world who have initiated field studies, including measurements
              in the Great Lake area, upstate New York, the Chesapeake Bay, as well as
              Australia, Finland and Sweden. The PI's analysis methods will provide new tools
              for examining data, and help extract maximum useful information from these data
              bases. Among the development and testing projects that will be continued are
              Positive Matrix Factorization, and multimodal factor analysis for looking at
              several different types of 3-way data tables.
