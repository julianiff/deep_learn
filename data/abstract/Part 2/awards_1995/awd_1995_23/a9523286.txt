Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry   Division,
              Professor Patrick Vaccaro of Yale University will perform a   series of
              experiments which combine the methods of Degenerate   -Four-Wave-Mixing  and
              Stimulated-Emission-Pumping.  The chemistry of   isomerization will be studied
              on disulfur monoxide and  isocyanogen.  A   state-specific study of  the proton
              transfer in malonaldehyde will also   be carried out.  Emphasis will be placed
              upon the identification and   characterization of any vibrational mode
              selectivity that accompanies   intramolecular rearrangement of chemical bonds. 
              This research is in the broad area of molecular structure and dynamics.   Its
              purpose is to explore the underlying impetus for chemical   transformations. 
              Information obtained from these experiments on   vibrationally excited
              polyatomic species  will provide insight into   unimolecular processes  which
              play a critical role in chemistry,   including isomerization and hydrogen
              migration.
