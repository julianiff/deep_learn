Abstract    :
              9523278  Mattice  Current techniques for the simulation of the physical 
              properties of macromolecules fall into one of two groups:  (1) Fully atomistic
              simulations, and (2) Simulations on  simple lattices.  This project will
              develop a method that  retains the advantages of time and distance found in
              lattice  simulations, but with the retention of sufficient structural  detail
              so that the chains in the simulations can be  identified with real polymers
              used by experimentalists.  The  realistic description of the chains will be
              introduced via  the rotational isomeric state model.  Chains described by  the
              rotational isomeric state model will be mapped onto high  coordination lattices
              by general methods developed in this  work.  The simulation can then be
              performed on this high  coordination lattice.  %%%  This research will provide
              a hierarchy of trade-offs between  retention of local structural detail on the
              one hand, and  computational efficiency on the other hand.  This method  will
              expand the scope of systems that can be studied  simultaneously by experiment
              and simulation, because it will  permit simulations of larger systems and
              longer time scale  with chains that retain sufficient local structural detail 
              so that they can be identified with the real polymers used  in the experiments.
