Abstract    :
               Integrated assessment is increasingly used as a way to bridge the gap between  
              science and policy in environmental problems. Models of each aspect of a
              complex   problem are often too cumbersome to integrate directly. Instead, it
              is often more appealing   to develop reduced-form models for each component
              model that are small enough to be   comprehensible, flexible, and easily linked
              to one another. A reduced-form model provides   approximately the same behavior
              as the model from which it is extracted in a much more   compact and
              comprehensible form. The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate  
              techniques to help modellers analyze their models and construct reduce-form
              models.   The specific objectives are:  1. To design and prototype a modellers'
              workbench to facilitate specification and   documentation of the inputs,
              outputs, and assumptions of existing models of   various types and sizes;  2.
              To provide a range of existing and new sampling techniques to generate  
              scenarios to exercise these models;  3. To provide a range of existing and new
              model analysis techniques to identify   key inputs and parameters, identify
              nonmonotonic and regions of qualitatively   different behavior, and so help
              develop reduced-form models; and  4. To evaluate these techniques
              experimentally by application to the development   of reduced-form models and
              integrated assessment models, and so to provide   guidance on which techniques
              are most valuable and for what kinds of models.  This project is supported
              under the Methods and Models for Integrated Assessment   funding opportunity.
