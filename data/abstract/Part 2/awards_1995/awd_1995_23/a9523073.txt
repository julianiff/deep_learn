Abstract    :
                    9523073  Dunn  Interfacial failures pose a serious challenge in
              manufacturing  reliable piezoelectric actuators and transducers.  The proposed 
              research addresses this important problem by using a tightly  coupled
              theoretical and experimental program to study the singular  behavior of
              electric and mechanical fields at the free edges of  bonded piezoelectric
              materials.  The singularities are to be  estimated analytically using an
              asymptotic analysis and these  analytical results are to be then used within a
              finite element  analysis to predict the response of a practical piezoelectric 
              geometry.  Free edge stress intensity factors are then to be  determined.  The
              free edge stress intensity factors are functions  of geometry and the applied
              loading and will fully characterize the  electrical and mechanical fields at
              the interface corner in the  region dominated by the singular fields. 
              Experimental studies are  proposed to validate the use of stress intensity
              factors in  predicting failures.  ***
