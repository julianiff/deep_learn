Abstract    :
              9523735  Economy    A collaborative program between Boron Biological Inc. and 
              University of Illinois at Urbana is proposed to accelerate  the development of
              high performance ceramic structures based  on boron nitride(BN).  The work will
              be on pursued new low  cost synthetic routes to borazine monomer.  Studies will
              be  undertaken to understand and further optimize the unique  wear
              characteristics of the C/BN composites as compared to  C/C. Studies will also
              be carried out on preparation and  characterization of thin film dielectric
              insulators of BN  for use in advanced microelectronic devices.  The use of the 
              borazine oligomers as precursors for adhesives for highly  refractory systems
              will be pursued.  %%%  A collaborative program between Boron Biological Inc.
              and  the University of Illinois at Urbana will be carried out to  accelerate
              the development of high performance ceramic  structures based on boron nitride.
