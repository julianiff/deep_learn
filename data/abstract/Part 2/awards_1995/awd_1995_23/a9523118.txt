Abstract    :
              9523118  Drager       To stimulate interest and activity in mathematical
              research,  the National Science   Foundation each year supports a number of
              NSF-CBMS Regional  Research Conferences   in the Mathematical Sciences.  Each
              five-day conference features  a distinguished lecturer   who delivers ten
              lectures on a topic of important current  research in one sharply focused  
              area of the mathematical sciences.  The lecturer subsequently  prepares an
              expository   monograph based upon these lectures, which is normally published 
              by the American   Mathematical Society or the Society for Industrial and
              Applied  Mathematics, or jointly by   the American Statistical Association and
              the Institute of  Mathematical Statistics.  Certain   features differentiate
              these conferences from typical research  conferences.  These are: (1)   Focus
              on a single important and timely area of research by a  leading practitioner,
              (2)   Continued effect and local stimulation through regional emphasis,  (3)
              Panel review for   quality, breadth, and timeliness, and (4) Published
              monographs  for a wider audience.        This project will support an NSD-CBMS
              Regional Research  Conference in the   Mathematical Sciences on Advances in
              Spectral Geometry to be held  June 24-28, 1996 at   Texas Tech University. 
              Professor Carolyn Gordon of Dartmouth  College will be the   principal
              lecturer.
