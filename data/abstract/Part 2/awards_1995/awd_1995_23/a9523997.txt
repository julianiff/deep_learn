Abstract    :
              MISETA (Multi-Instrumented Studies of Equatorial Thermosphere Aeronomy) is a
              program to systematically study ionospheric and thermospheric properties in the
              equatorial regions, particularly spread-F, ionospheric irregularities, and the
              equatorial electrojet.  It is a joint program  involving Clemson University,
              Boston College, Dartmouth College, and Boston University.  The investigators
              will continue to conduct coordinated measurements at Jicamarca, Ancon, and
              Arequipa, Peru, using a variety of instruments, including coherent and
              incoherent scatter radar, digisonde, spaced scintillation receiver, Fabry-Perot
              interferometer, and all-sky imager.  Most of the instruments are designed to
              run continuously, but the study also requires more intensive experimental
              campaigns in which additional instruments are deployed on a temporary basis. 
              One campaign has been conducted as part of the previous award, and one more
              campaign will be conducted as part of the continuation.  The Boston University 
              role is to make observations with an all-sky imaging photometer and analyze the
              data to study the sources of equatorial Spread F.
