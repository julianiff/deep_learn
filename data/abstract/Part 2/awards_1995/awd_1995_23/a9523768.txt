Abstract    :
              9523768  Emert       The Department of Mathematics of Ball State University, 
              Muncie, Indiana, will host the Joint Spring Topology Conference and  Southeast
              Dynamical Systems Conference, March 7-9, 1996.  This will  be the 30th meeting
              of the former conference and the seventh  meeting of the latter conference. 
              There will be a mix of one-hour  and half-hour invited talks and contributed
              talks in areas ranging  from general/set theoretic topology through continuum
              theory and  dynamical systems to geometric topology.       The Spring Topology
              Conference has long established itself as  one of the largest and most
              successful annual topology conferences  in the U.S.  Over the years, this
              conference has managed to  maintain its traditional identity and at the same
              time to expand  its breadth.  In particular, the area of dynamical systems was 
              integrated into the conference in 1987, and its evolving link to  the more
              traditional areas of topology has become a central  emphasis of the conference.
