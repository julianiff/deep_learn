Abstract    :
                This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will help the   Department of Chemistry at the University of Colorado--Boulder
              acquire a 500 MHz NMR   Spectrometer.  The research activities to be supported
              include:  (1) development of  stereoselective  synthetic methods and sequential
              reactions schemes; (2) investigations of  adriamycin-mediated DNA  cross-links;
              (3) the development of stereoselective and catalytic  asymmetric methods for
              organic  synthesis; (4) synthetic and bioorganic studies of DNA and  RNA; (5)
              structure determination of proteins;  (6) the total synthesis and bioorganic
              studies  of natural products and complex carbohydrates.      Nuclear  Magnetic
              Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to  chemists
              for the  elucidation of the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify
              unknown  substances, characterize specific  arrangements of atoms within
              molecules, and to study the  dynamics of interactions between molecules  in
              solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR  spectrometry is essential to
              chemists who are carrying out  frontier research.  The results from  these NMR
              studies are useful in the areas such as polymers and  catalysis, and in
              biology.
