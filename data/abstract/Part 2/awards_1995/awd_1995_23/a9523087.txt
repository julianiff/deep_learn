Abstract    :
              9523087  Danai  This research project deals with the development of  innovative
              approaches for robust fault diagnosis in machines  such as automotive engines.
              The approach involves feedback  training and pattern classification. Pattern
              classification  is adopted from both residual transformation and fault 
              signature estimation. Fault signatures are estimated via the  multi-valued
              influence matrix (MVIM) method which also  provides measures of uniqueness and
              repeatability of fault  signatures. In residual transformation, a time-delay 
              connectionist net is trained iteratively on a batch of  measurement - fault
              data. The learning algorithm adjusts the  parameters of the time-delay  net
              such that the next set of  transformed residuals will have better detection and
               diagnostic performance within the range of training set. The  residual
              generation method is experimentally evaluated at  the center for Automotive
              Research of the Ohio State  University. The experiments include sensor and
              actuator  faults and are carried out over a broad range of engine  operating
              conditions.***
