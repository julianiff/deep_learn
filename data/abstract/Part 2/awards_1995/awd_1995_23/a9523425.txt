Abstract    :
              This postdoctoral award will (1) develop daytime measurement  capabilities for
              the sodium wind/temperature lidar, (2) operate the  improved sodium
              wind/temperature lidar simultaneously with UAO MF  radar for a minimum of four
              24-hour periods per month throughout  the year, and (3) analyze and interpret
              the data collected to study  dynamics, in particular, tides effects involved in
              the mesopause  region above Urbana, Illinois.  All the PI's observations will
              be  placed in the CEDAR database.
