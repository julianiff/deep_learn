Abstract    :
              9521346  Hopkins  Partial support is provided for a new activity at the 
              International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES).  The  United
              States is a treaty member of ICES which is a North  Atlantic regional fisheries
              and environmental advisory body.  Norway and the United States (via joint
              support from NSF and  NOAA) will contribute to the establishment of a Project
              Office at  the ICES Secretariat to coordinate activities of member nations  in
              producing science and implementation plans as part of the  international GLOBEC
              (Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics) Global  Change research program.  The
              project office will also coordinate  related ongoing working group and field
              program activities,  archive data, and establish new data bases within the ICES
              data  management system.  ***
