Abstract    :
              9523910  Moffett      Because the transport and reactivity of particulates in
              coastal  waters may be strongly affected by protozoans during feeding and 
              other manipulations, the cycling of chemical contaminants  associated with such
              particles may also be significantly impacted.  In this research, a team of
              scientists at the Woods Hole  Oceanographic Institution will study the role of
              protozoans in the  fate and transport of trace metal and organic contaminants
              in  coastal waters.  The suite of contaminants will include Cr,  Pb,Cd,PAHs,
              and PCBs. The focus will be on estuarine and open  coastal environments in
              which high concentrations of particle-  associated contaminants coincide with
              rich water column and benthic  microbial communities, because it is in such
              situations that  protozoans would be most likely to affect particle transport
              and  chemistry.  Effects of protozoan grazing will be compared with  bacterial
              and non-biological processes impacting the cycling of  contaminants.  Although
              the field work was originally planned for  both Boston Harbor and New Bedford
              Harbor; it has subsequently been  scaled back to involve only the latter. 
              Laboratory studies will  involve systems ranging from the very simple (one
              protist, one  bacterial species) to the complex (natural marine microbial 
              assemblages). The results should be extensible to contaminant  cycling by
              protozoans in other marine environments.
