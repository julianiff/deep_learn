Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9523484  Partial travel support will be provided to a group of
              young academic researchers to participate and  present papers at the
              International Congress of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (ICTAM), to be held
              in Kyoto Japan, 25-31 August 1996.  The Congress will cover the entire field of
              theoretical and applied mechanics, being a leading forum for dissemination of
              fluid and solid mechanics knowledge in the world.  Special symposia will be
              devoted for the following topics:  vorticity dynamics and turbulence,
              non-Newtonian fluid flow, aero- and hydroacoustics, mechanics of heterogeneous
              and composite solids, solid mechanics in manufacturing, and structural
              optimization.   Specialized sessions in a variety of areas, including,
              computational fluid mechanics, multiphase flow, contact and friction problems,
              fracture and crack mechanics, stability of structures, and earthquake
              engineering, will be included.  The U.S. National Committee  on Theoretical and
              Applied Mechanics has as members 14 national societies in engineering, science
              and  mathematics, and is representing U.S. in the International Union of
              Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM), the organizer of ICTAM.  The NSF
              grant will partially support travel to the meeting of 15 to 20 young
              investigators, who will present papers at ICTAM.  Their participation is
              essential for the advancement of the IUTAM objectives to younger academic
              generation and suitable representation of the U.S. mechanics community at the
              Congress.  ***
