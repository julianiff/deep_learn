Abstract    :
              9523327  Parker       The Colorado School of Mines and Public Service Company of
               Colorado propose to develop a passive emission sensor which can  accurately
              quantify nitric oxide concentrations and gas  temperature in power plant
              exhaust flows and demonstrate it's  utility as a feedback sensor in an NO
              control system.  The  technology developed for the NO sensor will also be used
              to  produce a sensor for ammonia.  Using an upstream monitor for NO 
              concentration coupled with a downstream monitor for ammonia, a  feedback
              control system for Thermal DeNOx will be demonstrated in  the laboratory.  In
              addition, we will work toward implementation  and validation of both sensors in
              a full scale powerplant.  The  overall measurement system will be
              non-extractive and will  provide accurate and reproducible measurements of both
              transient  and steady-state NO concentrations.  In addition, the system 
              concept is simple and robust; instruments that are suitable for  use in the
              field, and do not require frequent calibration or  highly trained operators
              will be the end result of this research  project.  The measurement technique is
              based on spectrally  resolved emission from nitric oxide and water at
              wavelengths near  5.2 microns.  Emission from nitric oxide will be used to
              quantify  NO concentration and water emission will be used to determine the 
              temperature of the flow.  A scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer  will be used
              within the device for wavelength selection; this  device can, in principle,
              operate over a large range of  wavelengths and can be adapted to become a field
              hardened  instrument.  Investigation on application of the proposed sensor 
              system principle for measuring other pollutant will be carried  out in this
              study.  ***
