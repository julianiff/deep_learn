Abstract    :
              The PIs will continue studying auroral arcs from Godhavn,  Greenland. 
              Simultaneously, incoherent scatter radar and optical  instruments at
              Sondrestrom will view the same aurora.  Overlapping  fields from these two
              sites will provide a database for two  dimensional measurement and tomographic
              description of auroral arcs  in the magnetic meridian.  The PI will also study
              auroral arcs and  their thermospheric effects.  The PI plans to operate a
              dedicated  'aeronomy' campaign each winter.  Finally, he will analyze and 
              publish results in the third year.***
