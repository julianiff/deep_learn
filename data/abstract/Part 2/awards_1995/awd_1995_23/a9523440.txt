Abstract    :
              9523440  Pershan    This project is concerned with the development of techniques
               and methods that will allow measurement of previously  unobserved phenomena at
              the surfaces of both bulk liquids  and thin liquid films. Some of the phenomena
              to be studied  include: (i) The relation between microscopic structure and 
              thermodynamic properties of two-dimensional (2D) order of  Langmuir monolayers
              (LM). One particularly interesting such  system will be LM of periodic
              amphipillic polypeptides  prepared by bacterial expression of artificial genes.
              (ii)  The 2D in plane order of Langmuir monolayers of fullerene  chemical
              derivatives on the surface of water. (iii) The  effects of chemical variations
              on the in-plane structure of  self assembled Langmuir monolayers of thiols on
              the surface  of liquid mercury and possibly gallium. (iv) The  compositional
              structure along the surface normal of wetting  layers of complex systems, such
              as binary liquids and  polymer brushes. These experiments can increase
              knowledge of  the properties of liquid surfaces dramatically, and have 
              potential commercial applications in the US and elsewhere.  %%%  The principal
              objective of this research program is to  explore the microscopic structure and
              associated statistical  properties of liquid surfaces. The project is concerned
              with  the development of techniques and methods that will allow  measurement of
              previously unobserved phenomena at the  surfaces of both bulk liquids and thin
              liquid films. In  contrast with the relatively comprehensive understanding of 
              the solid phases of matter, including their surfaces,  knowledge of the liquid
              phase is relatively modest. One  reason that this is true in spite of the vast
              literature on  liquid phases is that the lack of long-range order in bulk 
              liquids obviates much of the measurable phenomena that  contributed to the
              current understanding of the microscopic  structure of solids.  ***
