Abstract    :
              This project will lead to improved modeling of the ionosphere by  determining
              physical causes of anomalous nighttime variations in  density and temperature. 
              It will also further study the exchange  of particles and energy between the
              ionosphere and plasmasphere.   In particular, the project will lead to a
              quantification of the  plasmasphere's transparency to the passage of
              ionospheric  electrons.***
