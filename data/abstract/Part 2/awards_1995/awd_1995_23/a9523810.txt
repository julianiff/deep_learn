Abstract    :
              A new type of All-Sky Imaging Fabry-Perot spectrometer developed at  the
              Geophysical Institute performs ground-based imaging of upper  atmospheric wind
              and temperature fields.  The PI will use this  instrument to explore
              small-scale structures in thermospheric wind  and temperature, particularly
              near auroral arcs.  In addition, the  existing detector will be replaced with a
              CCD camera.  This will  improve the instrument's sensitivity, so data can be
              obtained with  shorter exposures, reducing uncertainty due to advective
              smearing  of the small-scale features this project will examine.***
