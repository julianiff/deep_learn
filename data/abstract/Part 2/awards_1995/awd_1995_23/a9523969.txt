Abstract    :
              9523969  Stuber       The proposed research will develop new algorithms for fast
               link quality evaluation and new algorithms for distributed link  control in
              microcellular mobile telephone systems.  Link quality  evaluation and control
              are essential elements of any cellular  system.  However, future microcellular
              systems will be  characterized by large numbers mobile customers, and many 
              (sometimes rapid) cell boundary crossings.  Limitations on the  speed of link
              monitoring and control essentially determine the  overall link quality, the
              cell sizes, and the ability of the  cellular system to react to traffic
              variations.  These factors in  turn determine the spectral efficiency and grade
              of service.  As a  result, fast link quality evaluation and distributed link
              control  will be essential for the successful deployment of microcellular 
              telephone systems.       The approaches to be employed in the study involve a
              mixture  of theoretical work in propagation modeling, signal processing, 
              teletraffic modeling, stochastic processes, and control theory, as  well as
              computation and simulation on workstations.  A software  simulation capability
              in presently available at Georgia Tech that  uses either recorded strips of
              actual channel measurements or  various theoretical and empirical models.  ***
