Abstract    :
                  9523536  Nogues-Paegle     The latent heat release associated with
              convective activity is an important source of atmospheric heating which drives
              atmospheric circulations.   Because clouds greatly reduce the earth's outgoing
              longwave radiation (OLR), satellite-derived OLR fields can be used, at least in
              tropical regions, to identify regions of vigorous convective activity, and
              atmospheric heating.  While the relationship between tropical convection and
              global circulation patterns has been established in observational studies, an
              assessment of the effectiveness of global models to simulate this connection
              has been hampered by the lack of model derived OLR fields that could be
              compared with observations.     As part of the reanalysis project underway at
              the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), OLR fields for the
              top of the atmosphere are being produced both as part of the data assimilation
              and for the forecast (to eight days) products.  Dr. Nogues-Paegle will examine
              the reanalysis products for 1985-1993, comparing the model simulations of OLR
              to satellite measured fields for the same periods.  She also will assess the
              NCEP model forecast skill by assessing the effect of uncertainties in initial
              tropical convection field on forecasts for the mid-latitudes.  These studies
              should provide for the broader atmospheric sciences community important
              insights into quality of the reanalysis products and the effectiveness of the
              NCEP model parameterizations.  ***
