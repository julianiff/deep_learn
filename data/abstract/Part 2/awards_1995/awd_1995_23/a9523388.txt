Abstract    :
                  9523388  Qi  The objective of this research is to develop a neural network
              model  which is characterized by: (1) simple conventional neural  operations,
              including the summation and the nonlinear activation  function, are involved in
              the neural model; (2) the dynamic  behavior of the structure is completely
              represented by the trained  neural model itself, namely, given the initial
              conditions and the  excitation force, the structural responses are predicted
              from only  the trained neural model.
