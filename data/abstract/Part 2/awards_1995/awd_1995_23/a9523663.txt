Abstract    :
              9523663  Molter  In current work on integrated photonic subsystems at EPSD, 
              researchers are studying a millimeter wave communication system.   In this
              scheme it is necessary to divide the signal into 256  channels, each of which
              has an analog amplitude and phase control.   In order to demonstrate the
              feasibility of such a system, a 1 x 16  waveguide splitter is proposed.    A
              study of waveguide bends, Y's, and curves is proposed in order to  predict the
              behavior of such structures.  The results of these  analyses would be compared
              to experimental results that would be  obtained using devices fabricated in the
              Electronic Power Sources  Directorate (EPSD) at the Fort Monmouth Army Research
              Laboratory,  in collaboration with Dr. Wei Min Zhou and Dr. Mitra Dutta. 
              Design  parameters would then be optimized based on considerations of loss, 
              device size, and ease of fabrication.  ***
