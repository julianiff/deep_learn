Abstract    :
                 9523553 Barnett  This research project investigates the kinetic processes and
              microstructure which occur as a result of glancing angle low energy ion
              irradiation during MBE growth. Studies of angle-dependent ion damage generation
              are used to develop new approaches to surface modification, and the use of
              in-situ ion scattering spectroscopy as a non-destructive analytic technique. 
              The research also includes efforts to modify surface morphology in island
              growth, and explores research ideas related to selective epitaxy.  Electrical,
              optical and structural characterization will be used throughout the research to
              evaluate the films. %%% The primary goal of this research project is to
              establish greater basic understanding of particular phenomena relevant to thin
              film synthesis and processing through the study of glancing angle low energy
              ion irradiation during molecular beam epitaxy, and to relate this understanding
              to the development of advanced microelectronics devices through modifications
              in processing methods.  Additionally, an important feature of the program is
              the training of graduate and undergraduate students in a fundamentally and
              technologically significant area.  The knowledge and understanding gained from
              this research project is expected to contribute generally to improving the
              performance of advanced devices used in computing, information processing, and
              telecommunications. ***
