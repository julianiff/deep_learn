Abstract    :
              9523260  This Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) project  will
              investigate the long-wave radiation environment of the  antarctic marine
              atmosphere in the austral winter.  Specifically, the sky radiance in the five
              to twenty micron  wavelength region will be observed in conjunction with  cloud
              and surface conditions, solar radiation, and the  atmospheric temperature and
              moisture profile, in order to  produce a high quality data set to validate
              radiative  transfer models that predict the total radiation field, and 
              quantify the partitioning of energy among the atmosphere,  sea ice, and ocean. 
              The observational phase of the project  will take place on the oceanographic
              research ship  Nathaniel B. Palmer, in July and August of 1995.  ***
