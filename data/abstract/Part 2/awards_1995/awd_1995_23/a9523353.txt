Abstract    :
              EEC-9523353  Kapoor    This award provides funding for a "TIE" project between
              the  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Dimensional 
              Measurement and Control in Manufacturing at the University of  Michigan and the
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center  for Machine-Tool Systems at
              the University of Illinois at Urbana-  Champaign.    Chatter limits the
              machining productivity and affects the surface  quality.  It also causes loss
              of dimensional accuracy of the  workpiece and accelerates the premature failure
              cutting failure.   The proposed research is to investigate the process behavior
              and  develop models to control chatters by using the Spindle Speed  Variation
              (SSV) method.    In the proposed work, the University of Illinois at Urbana - 
              Champaign will investigate the relationships among the variable  spindle speed
              trajectory parameters and the dynamics response of  the machining condition,
              and develop the speed selection criterion  based on the steady state vibration
              level.  The University of  Michigan will develop and validate chatter model
              using a  difference-differential equation to suppress chatter via spindle 
              speed variation.  This will be a two-year joint effort.  This  research aims to
              combine the individual strengths of each program,  integrated existing
              technologies, and develop new tools and methods  in a cooperative manner to
              solve critical problems in chatter  suppression.
