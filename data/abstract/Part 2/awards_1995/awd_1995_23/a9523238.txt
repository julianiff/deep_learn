Abstract    :
              CTS-9523238    Leal     This experimental study is aimed at understanding the
              fluid physics which control the microstructural features of suspensions
              containing either solid particles or drops in a viscoelastic or non-Newtonian
              suspended liquid.  This class of particle-liquid suspensions is a major source
              of new materials in the polymer processing industry.  Different experimental
              techniques will be used to study suspensions of non-colloidal solid particles
              in a viscoelastic suspending fluid and emulsions of viqcous or viscoelastic
              drops.  Optical techniques and two complimentary flow devices will be used to
              explore two critical features encountered in processing flows.  The class of
              suspensions under consideration have the tendency to develop strongly
              non-uniform particle concentration distributions, and, in some cases the
              particles spontaneously organize into long chains aligned in the flow
              direction.  A computer- controlled four-roll mill will be adapted to study
              deformation and breakup for Newtonian and viscoelastic drops in emulsions.
