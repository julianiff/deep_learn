Abstract    :
              9523318  Clements    The differences in the spectral energy distributions (SEDs)
              of the  various types of active galactic nuclei willbe analyzed.  The SEDs  of
              AGNS span a large portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.   Principal
              component analysis (PCA) will be performed on the SEDs of  a large sample of
              AGNs of various types.  This technique will be  used to find the normalized
              components of a multivariable data set  (the SEDs of the AGNs) in this case
              which give rise to most of the  variance in the data set.  The completed
              research will contribute  to an understanding of the mechanisms which power the
              various types  of AGNs and, in so doing, will help to determine what
              relationships  exist among them.    The SEDs of a larger sample of AGNs will be
              assembled and the types  of data will be examined.  In particular, the type of
              observations  (broad band photometry or spectrophotometer) will be considered. 
               Selection effects in the data and methods of controlling them will  be
              explored.  Models for the various AGN emission components will  be
              investigated.  The PCA's performance in decomposing the SEDs of  a sample of
              AGNs into physically meaningful principal components  will be evaluated. 
              Techniques for fitting the observed SEDs with  the principal components will
              also be evaluated.  Finally, plans  will be made for any additional
              observations that are deemed  necessary.
