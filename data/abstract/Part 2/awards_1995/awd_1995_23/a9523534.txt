Abstract    :
              This research project, supported jointly by the Analytical and   Surface
              Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division and the   Solid State Chemistry and
              Polymers Program of the Division of   Materials Research, explores the magnetic
              properties of   epitaxial monolayers and bilayers.  Spin resolved photoelectron
                spectroscopy is used to probe the creation of magnetism in   non-magnetic
              metallic overlayers deposited on the Fe(001)   surface with elemental
              specificity.  X-ray photoelectron   diffraction is used to determine overlayer
              geometric structure   in these systems.  In combination with theoretical  
              calculations, this information is used to comprehensively   examine the
              creation of magnetic interfaces using normally   non-magnetic materials.  The
              novel properties of these   materials are of fundamental interest, and are
              relevant to the   understanding of magnetic thin film recording materials.  %%%
               With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry   Program and the
              Solid State Chemistry and Polymers Program,   Professor Klebanoff of Lehigh
              University is investigating the   magnetic properties of monolayer and bilayer
              films of   non-magnetic metals deposited on magnetic iron substrates.   
              Magnetic information from spin dependent electron spectroscopy   coupled with
              geometrical information and theoretical   calculation, provide a detailed
              understanding of these   fundamentally important solid state systems.  A better
                understanding of the magnetic properties of thin film materials   is
              essential for the continued health and growth of the   magnetic recording
              materials industry.
