Abstract    :
              The PI will combine the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite and  radar data to
              gain information on circulations and momentum  sources/sinks in the mesosphere
              and lower thermosphere (MLT).  By  properly combining radar and Wind Imaging
              Interferometer  measurements with High Resolution Doppler Imager winds, the PI
              can  determine the MLT transport circulation directly from global wind 
              observations.  In addition, improved estimates of gravity-wave  driving will
              allow improved simulations of circulation systems in  the MLT region and at
              stratospheric levels.  Finally, results from  this research will be important
              for estimations of mesospheric  winds from thermal data.***
