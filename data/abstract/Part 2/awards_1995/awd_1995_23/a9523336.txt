Abstract    :
              9523336  Menzel         At present there is no quantitative test that will
              predict  the remaining life of a power cable or assess the extent of  damage an
              insulator has sustained.  We have developed a technique  using laser induced
              fluorescence which does predict  quantitatively the remaining life of power
              cable artificially  aged in a laboratory.  Tests on a few pieces of cable
              removed  from service indicate that this should also work on field aged 
              cables.  The laser fluorescence technique will be applied to  cables removed
              from service for which the power company can  specify cable type and length of
              service.  The goal is to produce  a reliable and quantitative method for
              predicting remaining cable  life.  We already have qualitative results that
              show this may be  feasible.  Success in this work will result in a method by
              which  sensors can be applied to power cables to determine the remaining 
              service life.  Cables could, therefore, be scheduled for  replacement before
              failure.   ***
