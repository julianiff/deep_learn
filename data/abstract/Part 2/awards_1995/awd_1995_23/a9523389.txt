Abstract    :
              9523389  Tubbesing  This project is to conduct a  workshop to assess the
              earthquake  testing facilities.  Section 2 of  PL 103-374 reauthorizing the 
              National Earthquake Hazards  Reduction Program (NEHRP), calls  for such an
              assessment of  the  Earthquake Engineering Research  Institute (EERI) will draw
              upon its  committee structure and membership  to survey existing testing 
              facilities.  EERI will commission a  set of papers and convene a  workshop to
              identify specific  needs, the potential for  cooperative efforts, both 
              internationally and between federal  and state agencies, and address  potential
              costs and funding  options.  The invited papers and  recommendations from the
              Workshop  will be compiled into a final  report to be submitted by NSF and 
              fellow NEHRP agencies to Congress  at the conclusion of the project.    This
              project is financially  supported by NSF and  NIST,  in a 2  to l ratio.  ***
