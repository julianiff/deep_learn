Abstract    :
              9523755  Fernandez-Rodriguez  The University of Texas at Austin (UT), College of
              Engineering, in  cooperation with the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico
              (UNAM)  propose to hold the "Sian Ka'an: First U.S. - Mexico Joint 
              International Conference in Neural Networks and Neurocontrol,"  September 5-15,
              1995, in Playa del Carmen, Quintana Roo, Mexico.   The ten-day conference will
              provide an opportunity for researchers  and industry of both the U.S. and
              Mexico and other invited guests  to exchange ideas and research results with
              the aim of enhancing  the overall research effort, reducing duplication, and
              encouraging  cooperation among the participants.  Speakers selected by the 
              organizing committee and NSF will set the stage for each day's  activities by
              making a presentation in which a group of related  topics are summarized and
              discussed.  Poster sessions of invited  and collaborating papers will follow
              summarizing the state of the  art in research and application of neurocontrol
              and answering  questions.  This will be followed by an informal discussion in
              the  form of a panel chaired by one of the invited speakers.  ***
