Abstract    :
              9523055  Tierman   This research is to develop a miniature, cost-effective,
              analytical chemistry device capable of identification of a wide range of low
              level, airborne chemical products.  The identification of these chemicals will
              be achieved using surface acoustic wave devices, innovative self-assembled
              monolayer surface chemistry, neural networks, and multichip module circuitry
              techniques.  The device will be able to analyze an air sample based on the
              response pattern of the sensor array, and the neural network software will
              allow the system to detect a variety of vapors in different environments.  
              This chemical identification device will have a wide range of applications and
              will provide a competitive alternate to the massive and expensive detection
              devices currently on the market.
