Abstract    :
              Abstract -  Bequette - 9523393    This grant is to permit the PI to spend a one-
              semester internship at an industrial research laboratory.  The objective of the
              collaborative research to be done by the PI and the industrial researchers is
              to develop techniques to rapidly reform batch chemical reactor modeling,
              scale-up and control.    The industrial researchers use reaction calorimetry
              for research, development and safety applications, treating the kinetics of a
              wide range of reactions from sulfite chemistry to chiral heterogeneous
              catalytic and homogeneous catalytic hydrogenations.  For the planned
              collaboration, reaction calorimetry will be used to understand kinetic and heat
              effects in chemical reactors.  Pilot scale tests will be performed to determine
              the heat transfer characteristics of pilot plant vessels.  Simulation and
              experimental control studies  will be performed using pilot plant reactors. 
              These results will be used to develop scale-up and control strategies for
              production-scale reactors.
