Abstract    :
              This research involves the development of a domain  independent approach to
              real-time, distributed coordination  of  multiple agents.  It is based on the
              GeneralizedPartial  Global Planning (GPGP) approach which views coordination as
               modulating local control, not replacing it.  This process  occurs via a set of
              domain-independent coordination  mechanisms associated with each agent that
              posts constraints to the local real-time scheduler about the importance of
              certain tasks and appropriate times for their initiation and  completion.  Each
              coordination mechanism is defined as a  response to certain features in the
              current task environment.  In order to construct a generic approach to
              coordination, it is necessary to have an underlying framework that can 
              represent the wide diversity of tasks, task properties, and task relationships
              in order to arrive at effective coordination among the activities of different
              agents in a  wide variety of domains.  The framework is called TAEMS (Task 
              Analysis, Environment Modeling, and Simulation).  It is a  framework with which
              to represent the important aspects of complex computational task environments
              that is compatible with both formal agent-centered approaches and experimental
              approaches.  The result of this research will lead to the development of a
              generic coordination module which can help desiginers of multiagent systems to
              build coordination strategies.
