Abstract    :
                Coming Broadband Integrated Services Digital Networks (B-ISDNs) will be 
              required to carry a broad range of traffic classes ranging from bursty, 
              variable-rate sources, such as voice and variable-rate coded video, to  smooth
              constant bit rate sources.  Moreover, these networks will have to do  so while
              providing a guaranteed quality-of-service (QoS) to these traffic  classes.  The
              problem of characterizing the performance of such networks is  thus
              particularly important since this must be done, not only during the  network
              design (in an off-line manner) but also for on-line control  purposes such as
              call admission control.  In this proposal we describe a  novel technique for
              evaluating network performance based on the use of  Global Rational
              Approximations (GRA) which has the potential of providing  accurate estimates
              for a variety of performance measures such as packet  loss probability in a
              wide variety of network settings.  We outline  research on GRAs whose aim is to
              develop a solid theoretical foundation on  which the proposed algorithms can
              rest and to develop practical techniques  for estimating network performance
              both during the design phase and in a  real-time setting.  Specifically, we
              propose to develop a complete  theoretical foundation on which to develop
              algorithms for obtaining  accurate global rational approximations for a variety
              of quality-of-service  (QoS) metrics such as packet loss probability and
              probability that packet  delay exceeds a particular value and to develop
              practical algorithms which  can be used to evaluate large B ISDNs.
