Abstract    :
              9523466  Smith    The coastal bays play a critical role in the transport and
              transformation of land runoff to the ocean.  Drs. Hollibaugh and Smith will
              consider the role of bays and estuaries in the net flux of carbon, nitrogen,
              and phosphorous between the land and ocean.  The system of interest (Tomales
              Bay, California) is hydrographically simple, has a long water residence time,
              is sufficiently compact that it can be studied as a single unit, and has low
              inorganic nutrient population.  The system functions metabolically like
              numerous other coastal marine ecosystems.  External sources of organic matter
              which support food chains in this system are simple to characterize and have
              strong seasonal and interannual signals.  These investigators will address the
              following questions by means of a multi-investigator field and laboratory
              program: 1) What is the relative importance of coastal upwelling versus
              terrigenous runoff in delivering oxidizable organic matter and nutrients to
              this system? 2) What are the responses of system metabolism and the metabolism
              of major system components to seasonal and interannual variations in these
              forcing functions?  3) What is the relationship between net system metabolism
              and non-conservative fluxes of nitrogen? 4) Can rates derived from
              stoichimetric arguments be validated by "direct" biochemical assays.  It is
              anticipated that the outcome of this research can be extrpolated to other
              systems which may be applicable to management of the nations resources.  This
              effort is being funded as a Land Margins Ecosystem Research project in a
              program which is jointly supported by the Directorates of Geosciences and
              Biotic Systems and Resources.
