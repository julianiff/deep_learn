Abstract    :
              9523010  Kovacevic   Abrasives in suspension in a  waterjet are used for
              cutting, hole making and duburring of titanium, ceramics, or other hard or
              difficult to machine materials.  These are one or two dimensional applications
              of this process, but there are opportunities for three dimensional processing
              as well.  Before a 3D process can be developed, a fundamental process model
              including the kinematics of the multiphase jet, the fluid-solid interaction at
              impact, and the fracture mechanics of the workpiece material is needed.  Before
              material is removed from the workpiece by fracture, the kinetic energies of
              many abrasives impact the surface.  As a result, a key part of this modeling
              work will be tracking the erosion history of the water jet on a section of the
              workpiece surface using a computational memory cell.  This process model will
              be able to predict the amount of material removed by many abrasives in the jet,
              and the geometry of the surface produced by the jet.  Like the cutter in
              conventional machining, the kinematics of the waterjet is guided by a
              controller.  Experiments to verify the process model, the coupling between the
              depth and particle velocity, and surfaces generated are part of the research. 
              To demonstrate 3D abrasive waterjet machining as a process, it will be used to
              produce a  sphere.     The impact of this research could be extremely high when
              fabricating complex shapes in high strength, high performance materials.    ***
