Abstract    :
              9523124  Donat    This study will examine the influence of various inputs on the
               complexation and speciation of copper and iron, and the  concentrations and
              complexation constants of their complexing  ligands in the western Atlantic. 
              The work will also determine the  vertical and horizontal distribution of
              dissolved platinum in these  waters, to help elucidate its "true" distribution.
               This research  is performed on the third Intergovernmental Oceanographic 
              Commission (IOC) Baseline Expedition for Trace Metals and Organic  Contaminants
              in the western South and equatorial Atlantic, for  1996. The cruise track
              provides opportunities to collect samples  from a detailed surface water
              transect across the western boundary  currents in the South Atlantic, the
              Amazon plume (high levels of  suspended sediment, terrestrial organic ligands,
              and colloidal  matter), the ITCZ (high wet deposition of Saharan dust), and the
               equatorial Atlantic upwelling zone (low levels of organic  ligands?). The
              study is consistent uith the goal of the IOC  expeditions which is to
              characterize the major water masses of the  world's oceans for as many
              contaminants as possible to allow future  changes in anthropogenic activities
              to be identified.
