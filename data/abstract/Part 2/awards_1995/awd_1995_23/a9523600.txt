Abstract    :
              This project supports the development of an  interdisciplinary modeling system
              that is designed to answer  three questions regarding the effects of climate
              changes on  US agriculture: (1) how do changes in the climate affect 
              production; (2) what options are available to mitigate the  effects of climate
              changes; and (3) what are the relative  cost-benefit ratios of strategies for
              adapting to or  mitigating the effects of climate change.  A new model is 
              needed because existing models, often guided by a single  disciplinary
              perspective, ignore the spatial heterogeneity  of forecasts generated by
              general circulation models, ignore  the simultaneous effects of the physical,
              economic, policy,  and demographic environment on yield, and ignore the effects
               of climate change on planting decisions.  This research  alleviates these
              limits by using artificial neural networks  to disaggregate spatially the
              forecasts of climate generated  by general circulation models and by estimating
              new models  that integrate the physical, economic, policy, and  demographic
              determinants of yield and planting decisions.  In addition to model validation,
              the research will include  scenario analysis to explore climate change
              implications for  uncertainty, planning, and policy.  This project is 
              supported under the Methods and Models for Integrated  Assessment funding
              opportunity.
