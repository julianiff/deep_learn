Abstract    :
              9523323  El-Sharkawi    Using twin signal signature sensing, we propose a method
              to  monitor, detect and localize shorted turns in power system  equipment with
              windings.  This equipment class includes  synchronous turbine-generators,
              rotors, transformers and motors.   There has, to date, been no effective way to
              do so.  When  implemented, the technology will be invaluable for enhancing 
              device performance through periodic on-line shorted winding  monitoring and
              diagnostics.  The technology will be especially  effective when applied to
              aging power equipment whose reliability  is uncertain. The proposed project
              will be undertaken with the  cooperation of Southern California Edison who will
              provide in-  kind support. Southern California Edison is particularly 
              interested in the monitoring of shorted turns of the field  circuit of
              turboalternators.  Successful deployment of the  proposed technology will save
              millions of dollars by decreasing  direct maintainability expense and (1) by
              saving the added cost  of alternate more expensive energy sources (e.g.
              nuclear)  required during the rotor's down time and (2) by increasing the 
              operational life of the machine, through, for example, avoidance  of damage due
              to buckling.  ***
