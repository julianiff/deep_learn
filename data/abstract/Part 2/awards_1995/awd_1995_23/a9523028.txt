Abstract    :
                        9523028  Wu  This project is to study the local heterogeneities in 
              polycrystalline materials and their effect on crack initiation.  In 
              particular, certain non-equilibrium grain boundary structures and  morphologies
              and their associated nucleation stresses and resulting  crack characteristics
              will be investigated.  There exists some  evidence that these non-equilibrium
              grain boundaries are found in  submicron-grained and nanocrystalline materials.
               The results will  be generally applicable to metallic systems and to certain
              ceramic  materials.  ***
