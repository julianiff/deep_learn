Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT  OPP-9523519  McGovern/Amorosi/Ogilvie      This proposal is for
              support of an interdisciplinary, international research group studying
              human/environmental interactions over the past 2000 years in the North Atlantic
              region. The North Atlantic Biocultural Organization (NABO) has developed a
              network of researchers from over 40 organizations and ten nations. Operating
              under the theoretical orientation of historical ecology, NABO workers are
              integrating historical, archaeological and ethnographic data with recent
              paleoenvironmental data derived from ice-cores, pollen analysis, bones, insects
              and other sources. The overarching goal is to develop an integrated analytical
              approach to complex problems of climate impact on humans, human impacts on the
              environment, and the environmental effects of humans' interactions with each
              other. Systematic working meetings are needed to advance US and international
              human dimensions of global change research.
