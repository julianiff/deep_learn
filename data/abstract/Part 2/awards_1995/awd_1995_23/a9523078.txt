Abstract    :
                    9523078  Yee  This project is to advance the development of
              fracture-resistant  engineering plastics and polymer-matrix composite
              materials.  It  will develop fundamental knowledge in the science of
              toughening,  and will provide guidance to the polymer industry in product 
              development and safety.  Shear-yielding toughening via rubber  particles and
              micro-cracking/crazing/bridging toughening via  thermoplastic particles are the
              two most important toughening  methods used to improve material performance.  A
              fundamental  connection between these two mechanisms is the intrinsic stress 
              state dependent deformation of polymers.  Identification of the  stress state
              near the reinforcing particles and characterizing the  deformation of the
              matrix in this stress state are critical issues.   These issues can only be
              resolved through experimental studies of  the polymer deformations and
              quantitative analyses of the details  of the toughening mechanisms.  ***
