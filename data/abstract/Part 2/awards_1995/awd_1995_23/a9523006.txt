Abstract    :
                    9523006  Somasundaran    This award is for the implementation of a MS
              level educational and training program  on pharmaceutical engineering in the
              Department of Chemical Engineering at  Columbia University.  It will provide
              tuition and stipend for three graduate students  for three years.  The
              pharmaceutical industry will provide similar support for  additional seven
              students.  This program is designed to meet the vital need of the 
              pharmaceutical industry for engineers specially trained in modern processing
              and  manufacturing techniques.  Five new graduate level courses in different
              aspects of  manufacturing of pharmaceuticals will be part of the curriculum. 
              The curriculum will  be developed with close cooperation between the Columbia
              University faculty and  industrial partners.  Adjunct faculty drawn from the
              pharmaceutical industry will  participate in instruction and mentoring.  A ten
              week industrial internship with faculty  oversight will be a requirement.  An
              advisory committee consisting of senior personnel  from the pharmaceutical
              industry and academe will provide guidance and evaluation.
