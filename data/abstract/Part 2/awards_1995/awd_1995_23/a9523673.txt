Abstract    :
              9552899  Auchincloss    This two year project  brings together 24 women each
              year who will be entering either the  10th or 11th grade in the fall. They will
              participate in hands-on, research experiences in physics in a non-residential
              five week summer program.  The women are chosen from the immediate surroundings
              of Rochester.   The morning portions of their experience is in laboratory
              experiences which are discovery based.  The afternoons is spent in touring of
              laboratories in the area and working on research projects.  During the project
              and academic year follow-up they learn more about women in physics and complete
              their projects including writing a paper about it and presenting it.
