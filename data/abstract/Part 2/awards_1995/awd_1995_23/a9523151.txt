Abstract    :
              9523151  Judd  Sophisticated software tools now exist for computer-aided design
              (CAD), computer-aided process planning (CAPP), and manufacturing resources
              planning (MRP) independently, as well as for many of the other functions of a
              manufacturing enterprise. Attaining significant improvements in the overall
              throughput of the manufacturing enterprise now depends on optimizing the flow
              of information from one application to another.  This research will apply and
              extend recently developed ideas integrating databases to industrial grade
              software.  Data representation, commonality, sychronization, and communication
              will be addressed.  The architecture for the integrated environment will be
              flexible enough so that it can easily be used with a variety of software
              solutions to these applications.  This research aims to create a theoretical
              foundation for the unification of existing manufacturing databases into common
              data model with methods to synchronize these databases.  The results of this
              research should enable the development of an integrated CAD, CAPP, and MRP
              system to model and evaluate the impact of product designs on an organization's
              production resources.  Feedback through the various systems will allow a
              manufacturer to reduce unproductive time in process planning and scheduling and
              thus to improve the quality, time-to-market and cost of new products.
