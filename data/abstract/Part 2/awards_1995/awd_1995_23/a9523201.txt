Abstract    :
              9523201  Schoen   Research into a method of molecular detection and
              identification for separation science that will provide high sensitivity,
              selectivity, and compatibility with all column separation methods will be
              conducted under this award. A prototype SupraMolecular Assembly for Raman
              Transduction (SMART) detector with a chromatographic cell will be designed and
              constructed to be used with Gas Chromatography (GC) and High Pressure Liquid
              chromatography (HPLC).  This detector will be designed for optimal sensitivity
              and will be universal with respect to the class of analytes.      The results
              of this research will fill the pressing need for a universal, sensitive, and
              selective on-line molecular detector.  The product will also be easily
              retrofitted into the already installed base of GC, HPLC, Capillary
              Electrophoresis, and Supercritical Fluid Chromatography instruments, increasing
              its applicability in industry.
