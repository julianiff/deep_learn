Abstract    :
              9523228  Hoffman    This research program is devoted to the synthesis and 
              characterization of novel conductive and magnetic materials,  both crystalline
              and polymeric, that are based on metal-  organic complexes. It is comprised of
              three components. The  first project is concerned with Porphyritic Molecular 
              Metals. Quasi one-dimensional metals based on  metallophthalocyanines and
              related macrocycles show  properties without parallel in other classes of
              molecular  metals. The new materials will be used to study the  fundamental
              question of electron localization associated  with a lD - 3D crossover
              transition, and a novel M-I-M  transition seen at low temperatures and high
              pressure. The  second project deals with Magnetically Ordered Charge-  Transfer
              Salts. The aim is to explore the mechanism for  interstack ferromagnetic
              exchange and to examine the  detailed character of the magnetically ordered
              state in  molecular magnets. The third project is connected to  Conductors and
              Magnets From Functionalized Porphyrazines.  Breakthroughs in the synthesis of
              functionalized  porphyrazines provide the foundation for a long-term program 
              to prepare new classes of crystalline molecular metals and  magnets derived
              from porphyrazine (tetraazaporphyrin)-based  multi-metallic complexes, and new
              types of highly  processable metal-linked ribbon polymers.  %%%  This research
              program is devoted to the synthesis and  characterization of novel conductive
              and magnetic materials,  both crystalline and polymeric, that are based on
              metal-  organic complexes. It is comprised of three components: 1)  studies of
              Porphyritic Molecular Metals; 2) examinations of  Magnetically Ordered
              Charge-Transfer Salts; and 3)  investigation of Conductors and Magnets From
              Functionalized  Porphyrazines. The successful completion of this research  will
              eventually result in the development of new conductors  and magnets.
