Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with the allocation of network resources, specifically
              buffer and bandwidth, to users and to virtual paths in an Asynchronous Transfer
              Mode network.  The research concentrates on developing a framework for analysis
              of this resource allocation probelm.  Users are assumed to receive benefit as a
              function of their quality of service. measured by cell loss probability and
              completion time for real-time services.  Network usage is measured using
              effective bandwidth and buffer occupancy.  The paradigm of price and demand is
              used to represent the minimal required information transfer between user and
              network.  These prices are considered purely as internal network indicators for
              the purpose of resource allocation; what users are actually charged by their
              service provider is a separate issue not considered here.    The goal is to
              allocate bandwidth and buffer so as to make as many users happy as possible,
              and to do so efficiently.  Furthermore, it is desirable that any such mechanism
              be distributed both hierarchically and geographically.  The P.I. proposes to
              develop this framework to jointly allocate buffer and bandwidth, to study the
              use of priorities to replace explicit reservation of resources, and to analyze
              the resulting network dynamics.
