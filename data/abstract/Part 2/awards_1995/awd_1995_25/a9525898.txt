Abstract    :
                   This project partially supports the core support for the work             
              of the Board on  Mathematical Sciences, Commission on Physical                 
               Sciences, Mathematics, and  Applications of the National Research             
                Council.  The Board activities include the  annual Department Chairs         
                 Colloquium for the mathematical sciences, the National  Science and         
                  Technology Week Symposium, specific reports, the initiation of             
                   reports, and the continuous oversight of all activities.  Other           
                   activities of the Board  include providing recommendations on             
                    research directions and reports on  education in the mathematical        
                     sciences, interaction of the mathematical sciences with  other areas    
                      of science, the health of the mathematical sciences, and emerging      
                       research directions in the mathematical sciences.  This award         
                       contains support from  the National Science Foundation and the Air    
                        Force Office of Scientific Research.   Other agencies supporting     
                         this project include the Army Research Office, the Office  of Naval 
                          Research, the Department of Energy, and the National Security
