Abstract    :
              9525767  McKinley  In this Research Planning Grant (RPG) the PI will develop new
               approaches for combining compile time analysis, program  transformation, and
              data transformation to generate programs that  achieve good cache memory
              performance. During the planning  period, the PI will explore and compare
              benefits of techniques  that improve locality within loop nests and techniques
              that  improve locality between loop nests in spite of large data sizes.  A
              successful completion will lead to a more ambitious research  plan to
              investigate compile time techniques to improve memory  performance of
              scientific applications on uniprocessors and  shared memory multiprocessors.
