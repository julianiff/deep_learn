Abstract    :
              This project will continue analysis of image data and perform in-  depth
              collaborative studies for investigating the intrinsic  properties and sources
              of short period gravity waves.  This work  takes advantage of the high
              linearity of CCD data for quantitative  measurements of the wave field using
              2-dimensional spectral  analysis techniques.  In addition, the PI will
              participate in two  campaigns to further knowledge of the abundance, geographic
               distribution and properties of short period gravity waves.  These  campaigns
              will gain novel data important for assessing the "global"  impact of gravity
              waves on the upper atmosphere meteorology.***
