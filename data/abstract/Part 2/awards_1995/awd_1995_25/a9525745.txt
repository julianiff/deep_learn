Abstract    :
              9525745  Abdel-Malek   In adopting flexible manufacturing technologies,
              companies must design new machines, processes, and systems that can produce
              different products in different volumes and mixes with shorter production
              leadtimes.  This project aims to develop a process to manage the design,
              justification, and implementation of affordable technological solutions that
              will enable flexible manufacturing.  Two industrial partners will collaborate
              in collecting organizational, technical, operational, and economic data;
              forming case studies of activity based costing in past technology projects; and
              validating the analytical approaches in the flexibility models that result from
              this research.  While the results should be generally applicable in many
              industry sectors, the emphasis will be on traditional manufacturers of
              electro-mechanical assemblies and products such as pumps, motors, aeronautical
              sub-systems, and farm equipment.   This project will result in a new process
              for designing effective and affordable flexible manufacturing solutions that
              individual firms can use to foster innovative design in their own factories. 
              The framework will be tested and fine-tuned in collaboration with industry, and
              simple software for managers will be developed.
