Abstract    :
              This award supports research centered on Iwasawa theory and special values of
              Hecke L-functions. This project involves work on three questions regarding
              these special values, the first two of which are concerned with the conjectures
              made by Beilinson and Bloch-Kato. These conjectures reveal an intrinsic
              connection between the special values of a motivic L-function and the
              arithmetic properties of the motive. The first part of this research deals with
              the Bloch-Kato conjecture at critical values of Hecke L-functions from CM
              elliptic curves. The second part addresses the Beilinson conjecture at the
              central critical values of Hecke L-functions. The third part explores a
              possible duality property in Iwasawa theory induced by the generalized Tate
              duality for p-adic Galois representations.     This project falls into the
              general area of arithmetic geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest
              areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination has proved
              extraordinarily fruitful, having recently solved problems that have withstood
              generations. Among its many consequences are new error-correcting codes. Such
              codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
