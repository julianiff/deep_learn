Abstract    :
              Altabet  9525937    This  proposal will address a fundamental  problem  in 
              biological  oceanography from the viewpoint that  vertically  migrating  algal
              mats in the open ocean are instrumental  in  redistributing  nitrogen within
              the surface  waters  of  the  North Pacific Ocean.  Using previously funded
              shiptime,  the  project will document Rhizosolenia mat vertical distribution 
              throughout the upper 100-300 m, the quantitative  N  inputs,  and potential for
              NO3- release in the surface layers by mats  in  the  central  North  Pacific
              gyre.   The  research  will  characterize  depth of origin, migration times and
               absolute  transport  rates  by  these  macroscopic  associations   and 
              determine if NO3- released by mat decay is taken up by other  ambient 
              phytoplankton.  In addition, the study will  survey  other  phytoplankton that
              may be vertical migrators such  as  Ethmodiscus,    Pyrocystis,   Halosphaera  
               and    solitary  Rhizosolenia  to  determine  if  they  are  also   important 
              components of this process.  At the conclusion of the study,  the  project will
              have examined waters of the central  North  Pacific gyre both east and west of
              Hawaii.  This should lead  to  a  broad  spatial  understanding of  the 
              importance  of  phytoplankton  vertical migration in the oceanic  waters  of 
              the North Pacific gyre.
