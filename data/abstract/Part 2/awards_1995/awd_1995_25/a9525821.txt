Abstract    :
              9525821  Lee  This proposal is on research to develop capillary immunophoresis 
              as an analytical technique to assess microheterogeneity in  pharmaceutical
              proteins, including variations in post-  translational modifications and
              degradation products.  The  technique consists of coupling a capillary
              electrophoresis system  with an immunoreagent reaction capillary post-system
              which  incorporates laser-induced fluorescence detection.  Specifically  it is
              proposed to study: (1) the relationship between separation  conditions and
              separation resolution of protein variants in  capillary zone electrophoresis
              and capillary isoelectric  focusing, (2) the quantitative dependence of applied
              electric  field strengths, capillary dimensions, and solution ionic  strengths
              on the effectiveness of protein transfer and mixing of  protein variants with
              antibodies in a post-capillary  immunoreactor, and (3) the direct sensing of
              the antigen (protein  variants)-antibody reaction by measuring the induced 
              electrostatic potentials and pH changes around the antigen-  antibody
              complexes.  ***
