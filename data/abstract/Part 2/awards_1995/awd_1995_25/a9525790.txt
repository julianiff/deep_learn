              Concept-based categorization and search on Internet:  a machine  learning,
              parallel  computing approach      The research is grounded on automatic textual
              analysis of  Internet documents and (homepages) attempts to address the 
              Internet search problem by first categorizing the content of  Internet
              documents and subsequently providing semantic search  capabilities based on a
              concept space and a genetic algorithm  spider (agent).  As a first step, a
              multi-layered neural  network clustering algorithm employing the Kohonen self- 
              organizing feature map categorizes the Internet homepages  according to their
              content.  The category hierarchies created  could serve to partition the vast
              Internet services into  subject-specific categories and databases.  After
              individual  subject categories have been created, domain-specific concept 
              spaces (graphs of terms and their weighted relationships) are  generated for
              each subject category.  The concept spaces can  then be used to support
              concept-based information retrieval, a  significant improvement over the
              existing keyword searching and  hypertext browsing options for Internet
              resource discovery.  Lastly, using homepages in each subject category, a
              genetic  algorithm client-based "spider" (agent) that can perform a  global,
              stochastic search on the Internet based on individual  searchers' preferences
              will be developed.  While focused on  Internet, the concepts and results of
              this research are  expected to be generally applicable in other networked 
              environments.
