Abstract    :
              9525960  Soong  The purpose of this project is to  continue the technical 
              coordination of projects funded  under the NSF Initiative on  Structural
              Control Research for  Performance, Safety and Hazard  Mitigation (NSF-91-62),
              which was  begun in 1992 when the first group  of proposals were funded. 
              During  the first two years of the  project, the co-coordinators have 
              organized meetings of the  principal investigators and  produced annual
              progress reports  which have been disseminated to  all interested parties.  In 
              addition, a number of technical  sessions at national and  international
              meetings have been  held to publicize the research  work.  It is proposed to
              continue  these coordination activities to  the conclusion of the five-year 
              program.  A major on-going  activity is to integrate all  research results and
              produce a  multi-volume document which  summarizes research  accomplishments in
              the areas of  basic research and implementation.  ***
