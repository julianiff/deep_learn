Abstract    :
                  9525959  Habibian  The workshop participants will assess the
              state-of-the-art and  develop a list of needed research topics on all aspects
              of  pipelines.  Such a list can best be developed through a workshop in  which
              researchers, planners, designers, operators, and regulators  of pipelines can
              get together and discuss research needs.  It is  also important that a forum be
              available for researchers in the  water and sewer industry to communicate with
              the researchers in the  oil and gas industry.      The findings of the workshop
              will be documented in a report which  will be made available to the public as
              an ASCE publication.
