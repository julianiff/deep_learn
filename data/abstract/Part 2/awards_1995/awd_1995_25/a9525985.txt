Abstract    :
              9525985  Anderson       A conference on "Frontiers in Topology" will be held at 
              Princeton University, October 25-28, 1995.  Speakers include Mladen  Bestvina
              (University of Utah), Gunnar E. Carlsson (Stanford  University), Ruth M.
              Charney (Ohio State University), F. Thomas  Farrell (SUNY at Binghamton),
              Thomas G. Goodwillie (Brown  University), Ian Hambleton (McMaster University),
              Lowell E. Jones  (SUNY at Stony Brook), Ronnie Lee (Yale University), Ib Madsen
               (Aarhus University), John McCarthy (University of Illinois), John  W. Morgan
              (Columbia University), Andrew J. Nicas (McMaster  University), Robert A. Oliver
              (University of Paris XIII), and Karen  Vogtmann (Cornell University).  Emphasis
              will be on some of the  most recent developments in topology, particularly
              those that  involve substantial interaction between topology and other areas of
               mathematics (including, for example, analysis and group theory) or  of
              physics.  Participation by graduate students is being  encouraged.  ***
