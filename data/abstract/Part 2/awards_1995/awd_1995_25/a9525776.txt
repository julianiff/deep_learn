Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to investigate the possibility of radar detection
              of atmospheric  changes resulting from red sprites.  Sprites are flashes of
              light extending upward from cloud tops  into the ionosphere.  They occur in
              association with large thunderstorm systems.  Current  theories suggest that
              sprites are produced by large electric fields in the upper atmosphere that 
              accelerate charged particles.  These particles produce ionization that may be
              detectable by  ground-based radar systems.  The investigators will deploy a
              portable radar in Colorado so that  the measurements can be made in
              coordination with optical observations as part of a campaign  to be conducted
              in the summer of 1995.  They also intend to make measurements of midlatitude 
              spread F echoes, a recently discovered phenomenon that only occurs during
              periods of low solar  activity.  These echoes were previously detected by a
              much larger radar in Japan, but it is  possible that they may also be
              detectable the portable radar to be used in this experiment.  If  successful,
              these experiments will lead to the development of new diagnostic techniques for
              these  two atmospheric phenomena.***
