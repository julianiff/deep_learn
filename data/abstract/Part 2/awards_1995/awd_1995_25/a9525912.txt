Abstract    :
              OCE-9525912  Weisberg    Analyses focusing on the observation within the TOGA
              COARE (Coupled  Ocean   Atmosphere Response Experiment) Enhanced Monitoring
              Array will be  conducted in   collabration with scientists from NOAA/PMEL who
              deploy the TAO  array. The   analyses will examine the oceanic variability
              observed over the  COARE region,   conduct heat, mass and momentum studies and
              examine the  realtionship between   the COARE domain and the far field in the
              context of understanding  the influence of   the western Pacific warm pool on
              seasonal to interannual climate  variability.
