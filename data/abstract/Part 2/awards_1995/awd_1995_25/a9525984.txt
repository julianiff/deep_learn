Abstract    :
              9525984  McMillan    The goal of this exploratory research is to examine the 
              experimental evidence for a new type of behavior in the  liquid state. A
              first-order phase transition between two  liquid phases has been observed that
              is driven by entropy  and density differences between the two liquids rather
              than  by compositional fluctuations in the system yttrium oxide-  aluminum
              oxide (Y2O3-Al2O3). The study of this liquid-liquid  phase transition is
              important in order to further develop a  fundamental understanding of the
              nature of the liquid state,  and for the advancement of new materials useful in
              the  construction of lasers.  %%%  Liquids in the Y2O3-Al2O3 system are of
              considerable  commercial importance, because they give rise to the YAG  family
              of laser host materials and other refractory  ceramics. It is likely that the
              existence of the structural  phase transformation in these liquids may be
              harnessed to  tune the properties of crystals around the garnet crystal.  The
              study of the new phenomena also has significant  intrinsic scientific
              interests.  ***
