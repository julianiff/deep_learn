Abstract    :
              ATM 95-25800    ABSTRACT    WILLIAM COLLINS    NCAR    TITLE:  "INVESTIGATION OF
              THE WARM POOL SURFACE HEAT BUDGET AND VALIDATION OF ATMOSPHERIC GCMS USING TOGA
              COARE DATA."    This is a three year project that seeks to establish
              relationships between SST, convection, moisture, and radiative forcing and to
              validate climate GCMs by the application of the results obtained.  The work
              proposed is thus not only highly relevant to COARE but also closely connected
              to climate issues that center on the maintenance of the warm pools and its
              global climate effects.    The investigators will 1) analyze the observed data
              for cloud radiative forcings, 2) analyze the surface heat budget on various
              time scales in different SST regimes, and 3) conduct GCM validation.
