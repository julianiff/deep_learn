Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Facilities Program will
              help the Department of Chemistry at University of Wyoming acquire a console for
              a 400mhz spectrometer.  The research activities to be supported include: 
              Reguation of Extracellular Proteases by NO/ONOO: Mechanistic Control by
              Cysteine Modification  Photoxidations of Disulfides  Reactive Geometries in
              Lewis Acid Mediated Reactions of Enones  Regioselectivity of Diels-Alder
              Reactions in Surfactant-Based Organized Media  NMR Investigation of
              Fluoroalkylphosphine Complexes  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
              is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the
              structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown substances,
              characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
              dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to
              state-of-the-art NMR spectrometery is essential to chemists who are carrying
              out frontier reset.  The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas
              such as polymers and cataysts, and in biology.  f8 Û-ª  þ                ;    +
