Abstract    :
              The investigators will study the density and temperature structure of the middle
              atmosphere using two lidars at Utah State University.  A Rayleigh scatter lidar
              will measure temperatures in the altitude range from 30 to 90 km, while a
              resonance lidar will probe the atmosphere between 80 and 105 km altitude.  The
              existing Rayleigh lidar will be repaired and operated for about 100 hours
              during the coming winter.  The alexandrite lidar, currently being developed,
              will be deployed and tested.  The coordinated observations with co-located
              optical instruments will allow studies of the dynamics of the middle
              atmosphere, including gravity waves, neutral winds, and mesospheric inversion
              layers.***
