Abstract    :
                 9525907 Aziz  This research project aims for fundamental understanding of
              solid phase processes related to nucleation and epitaxial growth, and pursues
              this goal using a high pressure methodology for studying atomic diffusion in
              semiconductors and the effects of non-hydrostatic stresses on solid phase
              epitaxial growth processes. The theme of the research is to use high pressure
              as a thermodynamic parameter in order to obtain information on the activation
              volume of crystal growth or diffusion processes.  The basic approach is to
              measure a growth rate or impurity diffusion rate as a function of pressure and
              to use this information to obtain the activation volume for the process.  The
              magnitude and sign of the activation volume provide constraints on the physical
              models used to describe growth or diffusion processes.  %%% The primary goal of
              this research project is to establish greater basic understanding of particular
              phenomena relevant to thin film synthesis and processing of two key electronic
              materials, silicon and germanium, and to relate this understanding to the
              development of advanced microelectronics devices through modifications in
              processing methods.  Additionally, an important feature of the program is the
              training of graduate and undergraduate students in a fundamentally and
              technologically significant area.  The knowledge and understanding gained from
              this research project is expected to contribute generally to improving the
              performance of advanced devices used in computing, information processing, and
              telecommunications. ***
