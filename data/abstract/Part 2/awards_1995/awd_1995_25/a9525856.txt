Abstract    :
              OCE-9525856  Siegel    The links between solar radiation penetration,
              near-surface radiant  heating, and the   thermal structure of the western
              Pacific warm pool mixed layer will  be investigated   using in-situ data and
              models. Several new aspects of solar  radiation penetration   and heating for
              the range of atmospheric and oceanic conditions  found in the   western Pacific
              warm pool during TOGA COARE (Tropical Ocean Global   Atmosphere, Coupled Ocean
              Atmosphere Response Experiment) will be  evaluated in   order to model the
              processes by which solar radiation regulated the  sea surface   temperature and
              the mixed layer heat content of the warm pool.
