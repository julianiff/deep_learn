Abstract    :
              The project studies techniques for performing efficient  communication in
              parallel computers that have faulty components.   Parallel computers with a
              large number of identical processors have  a great potential for
              fault-tolerance.  The main challenge that  must be overcome in order to exploit
              this potential for fault-  tolerance is the fact that faults also affect
              communications  between processors.  Hardware faults in processors, routers,
              and  communication links force messages to take new paths that avoid the 
              faulty components.  In addition, the mapping of computations from  faulty
              processors to nonfaulty ones changes the pattern of  communication.  As a
              result, faults can have a major impact on the  performance, and even
              correctness, of the communication subsystem  in a parallel computer. 
              Specifically, the project focuses on the  following two key issues; creating
              efficient, deadlock-free routing  algorithms for parallel computers with faulty
              components, and  developing efficient mappings of communication-intensive
              real-time  applications to parallel computers that contain faults.  This 
              research will result in more efficient use of parallel computers  and a better
              understanding of how their inherent potential for  fault-tolerance can be
              utilized.
