Abstract    :
              9525832  Spong  The Center for Artifical Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR) in 
              Bangalore, India is organizing the International Symposium on  Intelligent
              Robotic Systems to be held in Bangalore during the  last week of November,
              l995.  This is the third in a series of  very successful biennial symposia that
              began in l991.  The scope  of the Symposium encompasses intelligent systems of
              all types,  and includes learning theory, worst-case identification, AI,  fuzzy
              logic, and neural networks based control, etc.  A one day  pre-symposium
              tutorial, "Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic for  Intelligent Control," will be
              given by the conference  chairperson, M. Vidyasagar.  In addition, several
              keynote  addresses by renowned researchers in Intelligent Systems are  planned.
               This proposal is for travel funds to facilitate the  participation of U.S.
              researchers in the Symposium.  ***
