Abstract    :
              9525902  Lodge  Basidiomycetes (fungi) of the Greater Antilles, especially the
              Luquillo LTER site, PI's:  D. Jean Lodge, T.J. Baroni, K. Nakasone, and L.
              Ryvarden.    A large international team of mycologists and local cooperators
              has been assembled to survey basidiomycetes on the islands of Puerto Rico,
              Hispaniola, St. John, and Jamaica in the Grater Antilles.  Over 2,000 species
              of basidiomycets (excluding the rust fungi) in 12 orders, 36 families and 320
              genera are expected, including over 12% undescribed species.  Collection data
              and keys in both Spanish and English will be accessible on the Internet through
              the Luquillo LTER gopher under subdirectory <<fungi.survey.dat at
              sunceer.upr.clu.edu>> as they become available, and illustrated identification
              manuals will be produced.  Through comparisons with mycotas that are published
              or are underway in Venezuela, Costa Rica, and the Lesser Antilles, questions
              about island biogeography and evolution in basidiomycetes will be explored. 
              Fungi adapted to dry forests are hypothesized to be widespread, while species
              of wet forests are more likely to become isolated and differentiated on
              islands.  Effect of soil organic matter concentrations on abundance and
              diversity of decomposer agarics on soil, and diversity of canopy trees on leaf
              decomposer agarics at the Luquillo LTER site in Puerto Rico will also be
              studied.
