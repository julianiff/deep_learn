Abstract    :
                Alexander/Abstract           The objective of this research is the structure
              and propagation of  gravity waves between the (tropical) troposphere And the
              middle  atmosphere whose horizontal scales are less than100km and whose 
              periods are less than one hour.  A recently developed technique for  evaluating
              vertical fluxes of momentum will be applied to recent  observations taken by a
              NASA aircraft (ER-2) in the lower stratosphere.  A  particular emphasis will be
              convective sources of gravity waves.
