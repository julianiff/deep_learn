Abstract    :
              9525751   Currie     The goal of this project is to design a framework for an
              integrated management tool to quantify the costs associated with technological
              development at varying levels of complexity.  In addition to direct costs,
              these costs include the unmeasured costs of lead time, training, learning,
              resistance to change, created bottlenecks, and quality costs, as well as the
              lack of a system's view from researcher to product idea and then from supplier
              through post-sales support.  Specific cost data from previous design change
              experiences at three manufacturing companies will be analyzed.  These and other
              known case studies will be used to build a general model that includes the
              relationships of organizational functions of a firm to total product design
              life cycle costs.  The research should result in a preliminary Internet-based
              implementation for concurrent design and costing.     The significance of the
              work will offer a general approach to estimating and tracking costs in the
              product design phase.  The integrated cost model will be validated with
              empirical data to provide a firm basis upon which to develop management tools
              for determining appropriate design/cost tradeoffs.
