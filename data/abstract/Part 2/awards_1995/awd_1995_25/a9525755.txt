Abstract    :
                  9525755  Williams, Chang, and Peng     This project involves a study of the
              interactions between tropical disturbances over the western North Pacific and
              the easterly waves over the equatorial central Pacific during the Northern
              Hemisphere summer and is motivated by the results of some observational studies
              by the principal investigators and other researchers.  The zonal mean wind in
              the lower troposphere converges between the two regions of the tropical
              Pacific, causing a confluence zone which may be favorable for energy
              accumulation and, therefore, the enhancement of small disturbances.  Barotropic
              and baroclinic models will be used to investigate how these interactions might
              occur.  Specifically, the models will be used to study the effect of
              southeastward energy propagation from the western Pacific disturbances
              (including northwestward propagating waves, tropical cyclones, and the monsoon
              depression itself), and westward energy propagation from the synoptic scale
              central Pacific easterly waves.  Further, the principal investigators will
              investigate whether it is possible for disturbances to grow in this region and
              what the role of moisture/latent heat release might be in such growth.  A
              second objective, using the same barotropic and baroclinic models, is to study
              the formation and maintenance of the monsoon depression over the western North
              Pacific.  ***
