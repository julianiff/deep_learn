Abstract    :
                9525977  Lee     This project will explore important aspects of midlatitude
              storm track dynamics that heretofore have received relatively little attention.
               Understanding of the dynamics of storm tracks is critical to the improvement
              extended range forecasting and short-term climate.       Three characteristics
              of atmospheric flow that affect storm track formation and variability will be
              explored:  (1) the effects of background barotropic deformation, (2) the
              relevance of linear, barotropic Rossby wave guides, and (3) the role of wave
              breaking of midlatitude synoptic-scale waves.  The results of these studies
              will guide future parameterizations of transient eddy momentum fluxes.  The
              study will employed both observational analyses and a hierarchy of linear and
              non-linear models.  ??
