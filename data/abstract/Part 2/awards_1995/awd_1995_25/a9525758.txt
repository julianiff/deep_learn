Abstract    :
               9525758 Nathan  This research project follows a two-fold approach to achieve
              greater understanding and optimization of the transport properties of
              metal-semiconductor junctions: a)extend exploration of Schottky barrier height
              tuning with thin interlayers between the metal and semiconductor to consider
              different interlayers, semiconductors, and metals; b)examine the microscopic
              composition and structure of the interlayer, and the redistribution of
              interlayer atoms during junction fabrication and processing. The long-term
              practical outcome of this program may be the development of a new simple and
              reproducible method of tuning Schottky barriers, and the incorporation of
              engineered Schottky barriers in classes of prototype devices such as Schottky
              barrier photon detectors, metal/semiconductor/metal detectors, and MESFETs. 
              %%% The knowledge and understanding gained from this research project is
              expected to contribute generally to improving the performance of advanced
              devices used in computing, information processing, and telecommunications.  An
              important feature of the program is the integration of research and education
              through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically
              significant area. ***
