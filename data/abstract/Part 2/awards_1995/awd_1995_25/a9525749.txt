Abstract    :
              This project will continue studying descending tidal layers.  The  PI intends to
              study the composition of layers and how the  composition changes as the layer
              descends in altitude.  The layers  should also be information sources on the
              dominant tidal modes of  the lower thermosphere.  Specifically, he wishes to
              question:  (1)  conditions required for formation of the layers, (2) how and
              when,  during its descent, metallic ions enter a layer, and (3) how 
              climatological representations of descending layers compare with  the theory of
              tides in the lower thermosphere.***
