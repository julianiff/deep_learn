Abstract    :
              9525938  Crosby   The moss flora of China, with over 2500 species (about 25% of
              all the mosses in the world) is the richest and the most diverse in the
              Northern Temperate zone. Despite its size and diversity, there is little
              information Abu this flora outside of China.  This project is collaborative and
              international, and involves the Missouri Botanical Garden and the Chinese
              Academy of Sciences. Cooperative planning and participation of American
              bryologists and Chinese authors are major features of the research. The aim of
              the project is to publish basic, authoritative and up to date information, in
              English, on the names, relationships, characteristics and geographical
              distributions of all mosses that grow in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.
              The entire project will result in eight printed volumes, a Hypertext version on
              CD-ROM, and a variety of on-line computerized information services, including
              WWW and gopher servers at the Missouri Botanical Garden. This particular award
              covers the first four of the eight volumes of information.
