Abstract    :
              Lukas  OCE-9525986    Oceanographic data from hydrographic and upper ocean
              surveys   collected within   the TOGA COARE (Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response
              Experiment)  domain will   be combined with satellite data and simple models to
              study the role  upper ocean   processes play in modulating air-sea fluxes in
              the western tropical  Pacific. Of   particular interest is the contribution of
              mesoscale and  small-scale thermohaline   features the vertical fluxes of heat,
              moisture and momentum in the  upper ocean.   Heat and salinity budgets
              including estimation of local and remote  three-dimensional   circulation
              influences on vertical mixing will be computed. The  ultimate goal is to  
              improve air-sea coupling parametrization in three-dimensional  coupled climate 
               models.
