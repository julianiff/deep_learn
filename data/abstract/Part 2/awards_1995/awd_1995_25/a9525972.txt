Abstract    :
              9525972  Zia  A workshop on expected performance  of concrete buildings in
              high-risk  seismic areas is proposed by the  Concrete Research and Education 
              Foundation (ConREF) of the American  Concrete Institute (ACI).  The  objective
              of the workshop is to  provide an opportunity for the  leading researchers and 
              practitioners engaged in seismic  design and construction to exchange  ideas
              with a representative group  of owners/developers, insurers, and  financiers
              (lenders). Through the  dialogues between the technical and  nontechnical
              groups of the  construction industry, the workshop  will review the current
              knowledge  and practice with respect to  seismic design and construction of 
              conarete buildings, identify the  critical performance requirements  for
              high-risk seismic areas (in  addition to life-safety  considerations), and
              define  research needed in order to advance  design methodology and
              construction  practice.    The proposed workshop based on  experience gained
              after Northridge  would bring together technical and  non-technical groups to
              examine  critical issues related to  performance expectations versus  design
              and construction costs for  concrete buildings in highrisk  seismic areas.  It
              is expected that  the workshop will be conducted in  southern California in the
              fall of  1995. Major financial support of  the workshop will be provided by 
              the invited industrial participants  through appropriate registration  fees.  A
              research agenda on seismic  performance of concrete buildings  will be
              formulated.  ***
