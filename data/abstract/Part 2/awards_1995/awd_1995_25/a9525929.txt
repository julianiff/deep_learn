Abstract    :
              9525929  Spanos  The research program involves wavelet bases for addressing  the
              structural mechanics problem of simulating random  fields.  Wavelets exhibit a
              variety of useful properties and  they have become an essential part of modern
              engineering  analysis. It is expected that the study will lead to quite 
              efficient Monte Carlo simulation algorithms.  The results  will be applicable
              to a broad class of random fields  commonly encountered in engineering practice
              such as  earthquake, wind and construction engineering.  Preliminary  results
              obtained in this context are quite encouraging. All  related aspects of the
              problem of simulating random fields  using different kinds of wavelet bases
              will be carefully  investigated.  Upon completing the study of the theoretical 
              aspects of the problem, a user oriented computer program  will be developed for
              simulating one-and multi-dimensional  random fields.  Applications from civil
              and mechanical  engineering will be considered.
