Abstract    :
              9525775  Hedges   The biodiversity of the West Indies is the most fragile in the
              New World because of rapid deforestation, very low levels of forest cover, and
              a high human population density. In many areas, natural forests essentially
              have disappeared except for small patches of secondary forest in which numerous
              species, including some not yet named, still exist.  There is an urgent need to
              document the existing biological diversity on these islands befoer it
              disappears.  The information gained will be valuable in efforts to identify hot
              spots of high species diversity and set priorities for those areas in greatest
              need of protection.   This project involves surveys and inventories of
              amphibians, reptiles, ans some invertebrate groups in poorely known and remote
              regions of the Greater Antilles.  Host country scientists and students are
              involved in the survey and inventory work, including collaborative taxonomic
              studies.  Tissue samples are collected and maintained for genetic studies of
              relationships, new species are described, and checklists, keys, and field
              guides are produced.  A comprehensive electornic database is being developed
              for the internet that contains information on many aspects of West Indain
              amphibians and reptiles.
