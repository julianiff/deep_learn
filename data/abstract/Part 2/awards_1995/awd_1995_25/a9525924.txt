Abstract    :
              9525924  Painter  There are three major thrust areas that will be pursued 
              during the next three years.  (1)  Chain Connectivity  Affects.  This is an
              important topic and we propose to  perform a systematic study of chain
              connectivity affects  which can be measured experimentally by methodical
              studies  of low molecular analogues, polymer solutions, random  copolymers and
              polymer blends that hydrogen bond.  (2)  Design of Miscible Polymeric
              Additives.  Following our  successful design of a polymeric antioxidant for 
              polytetrahydrofuran we propose to extend our theoretical  concepts and
              experimental studies to the design, synthesis  and study of macromolecular
              additives.  (3)  Multiple  Interacting Sites.  We can control the balance of
              favorable  and unfavorable interactions by incoporating different types  of
              hydrogen bonding functional groups in the same chain  (i.e. multiple
              interacting sites).  We propose to  systematically explore these factors.  %%% 
              This study will provide new knowledge in the broad area of  compatibility and
              interactions between dissimilar polymeric  materials, which  has implications
              on processing, recycling,  and environmental issues.  ***
