Abstract    :
              9525786  Semazzi and Scroggs     Under their last award, the principal
              investigators developed a non-hydrostatic, semi-implicit, semi-Lagrangian
              global atmospheric model.  The two main objectives that will be pursued under
              this award are:  (1) to incorporate bottom topography in their non-hydrostatic
              model and test the model performance in the presence of topography at
              resolutions at which the hydrostatic approximation is valid and  (2) to study
              the sensitivity of the model solutions to resolution and to quantify the
              non-hydrostatic effects at regional and global scales using a high resolution
              version of the model. Because simulation of non-hydrostatic circulations can be
              realized only at very high resolution requiring access to extremely large
              amounts of computer memory, carrying out the latter task will require the
              development of a version of the model based on parallel processing.     As
              global atmospheric models move to ever higher resolutions in order to
              effectively capture the interactions of local circulations and the synoptic and
              planetary scale flows, it will be imperative to be able to adequately represent
              non-hydrostatic effects.  This research project will contribute significantly
              towards that goal.
