Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9525881  Persson    This award is to continue funding for the
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on Energetic Materials at the
              New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology.  The main research focus of the
              Center is on the safety of energetic materials.  The quantities of these
              materials being manufactured, transported, stored, and used in the United
              States poses particular risks for mass explosion or detonation.  Other current
              research efforts are directed towards reducing the environmental effects of
              large explosions, fire hazards, and increased safety of energetic materials. 
              Specific research topics include detonation and shock initiation, development
              of small-scale tests to determine the hazards during development, manufacture,
              transportation, storage, and use of energetic materials, thermal hazards of
              energetic materials, safety engineering of energetic materials, minimum burning
              rates and pressures, and ignition energies.    Additional funding is provided
              in this award to support one undergraduate female student to conduct research
              performed on Project 3, Small Scale Safety Test Methods, in the Center.  The
              student will evaluate the relationship between the level of response of
              explosives samples tested in 40 mg samples and the reaction violence observed
              in large charges.
