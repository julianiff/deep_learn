Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9525761    This project employs a molecular approach to
              characterize the kinetic details of catalytic processes relevant to the
              functioning of automotive catalytic converters for environmental control. 
              Modern ultrahigh-vacuum techniques are used in conjunction with
              atmospheric-pressure catalytic reactors.  The oxidation of carbon monoxide on
              platinum and the reduction of nitric oxide (by carbon monoxide or oxygen) on
              rhodium are studied by measuring sticking coefficients and reaction rates using
              the method of  King and Wells in which the partial pressures of the gases are
              recorded with a mass spectrometer while a collimated gas beam impinges directly
              on the surface.  The experiments emulate competitive adsorption either by
              exposing the substrate to a mixture of gas species or by preadsorbing one
              species before exposure to another.  Gaseous species studied are those in
              combustion exhaust, including water and carbon dioxide.  Experimental results
              are modeled using a Monte Carlo computer simulator algorithm.  The oxidation of
              methane over palladium is also studied.    This study is based on experimental
              models for the catalytic systems used in automotive exhaust control.  However,
              it is also relevant to pollution control of emissions from other (stationary)
              combustion systems including power plants, heating systems, incinerators, and
              steam plants.
