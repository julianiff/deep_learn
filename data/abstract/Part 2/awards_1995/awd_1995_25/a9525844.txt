Abstract    :
              This is a three-year project to synthesize and analyze the air-sea  interaction
              observations made during the IOP of TOGA COARE in order  to understand the
              response of the upper ocean to the atmospheric  events on different time
              scales.  The important specific tasks to  be achieved are the following:  (1)
              synthesis of in-situ air-sea  flux data incorporating other remotely sensed and
              model-generated  data and the production of gridded surface flux fields of high
               resolution near the center of the Intensive Flux Array (IFA) and of  low
              resolution over the IFA; (2) isolate the periods when the  processes of mixing
              are essentially one dimensional and try to  understand the detailed physics
              with the help of one dimensional  model; and (3) utilizing the gridded data
              that provides temporal  and spatial variation over the larger area, drive a
              three-  dimensional ocean model to understand the detailed response physics  of
              the upper ocean to such spatially and temporally varying surface  forcing.  The
              improved understanding of the flux parameterizations  and the processes that
              maintain the warm pool will improve our  ability to predict SST over the warm
              pool, and thus enhance our  climate prediction capabilities.***
