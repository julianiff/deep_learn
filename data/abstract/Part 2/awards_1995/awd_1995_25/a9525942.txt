Abstract    :
              9525942  Cahay  This is a collaborative research effort between University of
              Cincinnati and Hughes Research Laboratory to enhance the performance of 
              InP-based PNP Heterojunction component of the research will consist of
              establishing and developing an approaches, the first based on use of a
              drift-diffusion model using a commercial numerical simulator, and the second
              based on the development of an Ensemble Monte Carlo simulator which includes
              the effects of hole tunneling at the emitter-base junction and the effects of 
              band-mixing between heavy and light holes throughout the device.  Subsequently,
              the two approaches will be coupled to provide a comprehensive model of device
              operation.  Furthermore, the  thermophysics of device self-heating will be
              investigated through a   self-consistent solution of the equations describing
              heat flow through the structure and the physics of charge generation and flow
              during device operation.  To assure the accuracy of the device models,
              comparison of the device electrical characteristics and high frequency
              performance will be made with detailed measurements on devices fabricated in
              the laboratory and with results reported on commercially fabricated devices. 
              In collaboration with this effort the industrial partner Hughes Research
              Laboratory, will provide the starting multi-layer epitaxial substrates from
              which the PNP HBT devices will be fabricated and will provide technical
              guidance in the development of the HBT's fabrication process.  ***
