Abstract    :
              As  computer  Systems  become  ubiquitous  and  more  information  becomes 
              available  electronically, it is increasingly  important  for  computer systems
              to be able to collaborate with  each  other  and their users.  The develop ment
              of the underlying theories and  formalization needed to build collaborative
              systems will have far-  reaching  practical  import  as well  as  addressing 
              challenging  computer  science   problems.  The Shared Plan  formalization  of 
              collaboration  (Grosz  and Kraus, 1995; Grosz  and  Kraus,  1993)  provides  a 
              specification of the capabilities to act and  mental  attitudes  that agents
              must have to participate in  collaborative  activities with one another.  This
              formalization will be extended  developing strategies for elabmrating partial
              plans by specifying  axioms that treat more completely the attitude of
              intending  that  a  proposition  hold.  In addition a collaborative 
              communication  system  based on Shared Plans will be designed: this system 
              will  both  demonstrate  the value of a model of collaboration  to  the  design
                of  human-computer  interface  systems  and   test   the  formalization.  
              The  proposed research will  contribute  to  the  development of computer
              agents that are fully collaborative, with  each  other and their users; it will
              also enable the construction  of more flexible and user-friendly interfaces.
