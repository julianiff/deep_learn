Abstract    :
              This project collects U.S. data from a national probability sample of 1000
              households on the ownership of advanced household and communication
              technologies that could be directly compared to survey data being collected in
              more than 10 European common market countries.  More importantly, it examines
              how the presence of these new technologies seems to affect the daily lives of
              those who own them, by examining the daily time-use patterns of these owners
              with the time-use patterns of non-demographic and personal predictors of
              activity patterns.  The project builds on 1993-94 pilot surveys supported by a
              previous NSF grant.  It would also build on the 30 years of experience of
              collecting and analyzing time--diary data that provide national estimates of
              how time is spent -- and how time seems to be affected changes in demographic
              factors (like marriage, parenthood and work), by social trends and by ownership
              of technology.  The diary method has been found to generate not only reliable
              and valid time estimates, but new insights into the effects of earlier
              technologies, like television, washing machines and microwave ovens. 
              Supplemental questions shed light on how other aspects of daily life are
              affected by these new technologies.
