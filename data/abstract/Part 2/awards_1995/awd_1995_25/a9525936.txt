Abstract    :
              9525936  von der Lippe  This project connects four small higher education
              institutions over  56 kbps lines to the Internet.  It also will add a T1
              frame-relay  connection to NYNEX to support the new connections.  They are:    
                  Bunker Hill Community College       Cape Cod Community College      
              Roxbury Community College       Massachusetts College of Art    Faculty and
              students at the new sites will benefit from access to  the resources of the
              Internet, including libraries and  supercomputers.  In addition, they will be
              able to communicate and  collaborate with colleagues at other institutions in
              pursuit of  research and educational projects.  The award provides partial 
              support of the project for two years.
