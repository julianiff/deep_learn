Abstract    :
              This project will research the dependence of the spectrum of the  mesosphere's
              temperature and density fluctuations on the horizontal  scale size of
              disturbance.  In addition, the PI will investigate  longer-term and
              larger-scale phenomena, such as mesocools, tidal  phenomena and secular
              changes.  The PI will measure and analyze  emission rates and derived
              rotational temperatures using a  combination of optical instruments, with a new
              wide-aperture BOMEM  Fourier Transform Interferometer.  The information on wave
              activity  gained from this study is important to wave-heating processes in  the
              upper mesosphere.***
