Abstract    :
                  Rivera  9525983    The capacity to store new information in memory is one
              that changes dramatically over the life span.  However, little is known about
              the age-related changes in the brain that underlie these changes.  With this
              award, Dr. Rivera will begin setting up a research laboratory to investigate
              which genes are turned on or off at different ages that may affect learning and
              memory.  This work will provide crucial baseline information on the learning
              process, how it is constrained by age, and what some causes for learning
              dysfunction may be.    ***
