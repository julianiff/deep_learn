Abstract    :
              9525809  FLIERL    The Southern Ocean is a region of great importance in the
              global  carbon cycle, yet the biogeochemical cycling there is not well 
              understood. In part this lack of understanding is attributable to  paucity of
              observations, but it is also a consequence of the  multiplicity of spatial
              scales that control the biology and  chemistry of the Circumpolar Current--
              from mesoscale to global  scale.    This team of ocean modelers from the
              Massachusetts Institute of  Technology will focus on the biological, chemical,
              and physical  processes affecting the production, consumption, and transport of
               nutrients, inorganic and organic carbon at mesoscale and higher  spatial
              scales by modeling the mass balance of carbon and its  various pathways of
              transformation. Tracer studies will resolve  these processes down to the level
              of eddies. Then, the role of  eddies will be considered in the definition of
              the patchy  distributions of populations of marine organisms in the Southern 
              Ocean. Finally, the results of this modeling study will be combined  with other
              models of the global carbon cycle to better assess the  role of the Southern
              Ocean in the global carbon picture.
