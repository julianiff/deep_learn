Abstract    :
              The investigators will develop and apply the method of singular value
              decomposition to interpret  measurements made by a digital ionosonde.  Both the
              Doppler velocity and spatial location of  ionospheric echoes can be obtained by
              this method.  The technique is based on measurements  made in a few tens of
              seconds with a sweep-frequency sounding.  Existing data from the Utah  State
              University mid-latitude Bear Lake Observatory will be analyzed as well as data
              obtained  during an ionospheric heating campaign in Alaska during the Fall of
              1992.  The Doppler  velocities will be compared with measurements of the
              neutral wind from a Fabry-Perot  interferometer and with the meridional
              component of the neutral wind derived from model  calculations.***
