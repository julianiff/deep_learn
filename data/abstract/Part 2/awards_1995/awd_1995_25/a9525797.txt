Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9525797    This is a fundamental study of the role of radius of
              curvative in an oxide pore in catalytic interactions.  It has not been possible
              to study this effect systematically until now; the discovery of mesoporous
              aluminosilicate molecular sieves provides a means of preparing oxide supports
              with uniform pores of varying sizes.  The interactions of small platinum
              clusters with the walls of mesoporous (1.5-2.5 nm) molecular sieves (MCM-41
              materials) having silicon/aluminum ratios greater than 3 are investigated.  The
              principal tools are solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and
              X-ray absorption spectroscopy.  Chemisorption, physical adsorption, small-angle
              X-ray diffraction, and infrared, ultraviolet, and visible spectroscopies are
              also used.  Three catalytic test reactions are employed:   n - hexane
              aromatization to probe for small-particle stabilization against sintering and
              coke deactivation; neopentane hydrogenolysis and isomerization as a probe of
              metal-support interactions; and competitive hydrogenation of benzene and
              toluene to observe effects on adsorption.    Mesoporous molecular sieves offer
              a control of the surface environment not heretofore       available.  It has
              not yet been established that this control can be exploited for practical ends.
               This project will provide a basis for evaluating the possibilities.   ***
