Abstract    :
              Walsh  9525825  The emphasis of the coupled set of models is on the  population
              dynamics and predator-prey interactions of larval  krill over the first year of
              life.  Investigators will  explore how climatic changes in ice abundance may
              impact the  recruitment of juveniles to the adult krill stocks.  Specifically,
              they will examine changes in survival rate  with respect to the altered
              composition of the diverse  groups of their prey within different scenarios of
              seasonal  ice extent.  Of particular significance in this research is  the
              modular approach of the addition of separate existing  models of both prey
              dynamics and circulation to the proposed  one of the success of early life
              history stages of Euphausia  superba within open-water and ice nurseries around
              the  Antarctic Peninsula.  To construct and validate these  models, the
              extensive data sets of the past RACER, AMERIEZ,  and EPOS programs will be
              utilized.
