Abstract    :
              9632672  Humphries    The original NEODAT data base project was the first
              large-scale effort to build a centralized multi-institutional collection
              catalogue in ichthyology. This effort was aimed at improving the infrastructure
              for, and facilitating access to, computerized collections resources with a
              specific focus on Neotropical fishes. There are two primary emphases in this
              renewal proposal. The first is to continue the progress of the NEODAT project
              in accumulating and distributing catalogue-based specimen data, and associated
              literature and species descriptions. The second emphasis is to create a
              network-based infrastructure for Neotropical ichthyology, incorporating
              technological advances made in Internet access methods since the original grant
              was funded. Currently, there are nearly 300,000 catalogue records from over
              74,000 localities in the NEODAT system. The system receives approximately 800
              searches per month. Additional records are now available, and when entered the
              database will have over 450,000 catalogue records. The technological advances
              in Internet services allow for greater user-friendly service to those using the
              database. Thus, as part of the second goal, software and hardware modifications
              will be implemented to improve the utility of the database.   NEODAT is an
              important international, multi-institutional cooperative effort. All products
              of this effort are made available to the international scientific and lay
              communities through the Internet. In addition, this project, in particular, can
              serve as a model for other large-scale database development efforts.
