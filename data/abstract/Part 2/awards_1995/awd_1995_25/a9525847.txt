              Abstract  ATM-9525847      Webster, Peter J.  University of Colorado    Title:
              An Integrated Approach for Examining the Large -Scale  Interactions Between the
              Atmosphere and Oceans on Intraseasonal  Time Scales    This is a three year
              project to investigate the ocean-atmosphere  interaction occurring within the
              TOGA COARE (TC) domain and its  ramifications for the entire Pacific basin, by
              an integrated  approach utilizing data, models and theory.  Thus this topic in
              not  only highly relevant to TC objectives but also central to climate 
              understanding and prediction.    The specific goals to be achieved are 1)
              Assembly of atmospheric,  oceanic and surface flux data sets and conduct
              diagnostic studies  to do detailed budget studies. 2) conduct ocean modeling
              studies of  the response to different types and scales of surface forcing 
              especially during westerly wind bursts. 3)Analyze the wave  structure of the
              coupled atmosphere-ocean system by using the large  scale data of the ocean and
              the atmosphere obtained during TOGA  COARE IOP.
