Abstract    :
              9525858  Huyer    Oceanographic data from hydrographic survey collected within
              the  TOGA COARE   (Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment) domain will be
               combined with   data from stationary platforms (both ships and moorings) to
              study  advective and   mixing processes in the upper western tropical Pacific.
              Budgets of  potential and   turbulent kinetic energy will be conducted in order
              to (1)  determine rates and   magnitudes at which atmospheric forcing can
              supply potential energy  to the surface   layer of the Warm Pool; (2) identify
              the important processes  associated with the   dynamics of the surface layer
              under various forcing conditions; and  (3) parameterize   entrainment and
              mixing in the thermocline.
