Abstract    :
              9525993  Narayan  Formation of low resistivity ohmic contacts that exhibit high
              thermal stability, and planar interfaces has represented a major impediment to
              III-V device technology.  The primary thrust of this proposal is three-fold:
              (1) structure and intrinsic electrical properties of novel Cu-Ge alloys as a
              function of Ge concentration and ordering; (2) formation of low resistivity
              ohmic contacts and correlations with interface structure and chemical
              composition, substrate doping and anneal temperature; and (3) optimization of
              parameters to obtain low-resistivity ohmic contacts and fabrication of test
              device structures.  We  propose the formation of novel ohmic contacts with
              record low contact resistivity and high temperature stability based on Cu-Ge
              alloys to n- and p- type GaAs and related III-V compounds.  The contact scheme
              will be developed and optimized to fabricate advanced semiconductor test
              devices which are expected to exhibit superior device properties and
              performance.  ***
