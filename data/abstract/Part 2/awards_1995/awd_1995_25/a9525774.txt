Abstract    :
              This starter grant award to the University of Minnesota will support the  
              research of Professor Carl D. Frisbie.  The theme of the research is the   use
              of atomic force microscopy (AFM) for the direct measurement of the   binding
              forces between biological molecules.  The work will provide   quantitative and
              dynamic information on single biomolecular recognition   events such as occur
              in an antigen-antibody complex or between single   strands of complementary
              oligonucleotides.  The research will probe   forces between simple biomolecules
              such as peptides and oligonucleotides   by anchoring them to surfaces and AFM
              tips in oriented monolayers using   methods developed in Frisbie's postdoctoral
              work.  The chemically   modified AFM tips will be brought into contact with the
              sample surfaces   and the force needed to rupture the adhesive contact will be
              measured.    The studies provide a general methodology for obtaining direct  
              quantitative measures of the binding forces between a variety of  
              biomolecules.  Dynamic information such as binding force and bond rupture  
              length obtained in this work will enhance molecular level understanding   of
              biological molecular recognition and should ultimately be useful in   drug
              design and protein engineering.
