Abstract    :
              9525913  Langer  This project is to continue previously funded NSF work on a 
              new copolymer, poly (lactic acid-co-lysine) PLAL, which is  biodegradable,
              which is to be used as a matrix to hold  mammalian cells, and which may
              ultimately serve as an  artificial organ.  The Principal Investigators (PIs)
              propose  to modify this polymer to increase the density of attachment  sites
              for cells, to develop approaches to create  photopolymerized polymer systems
              which could lead to  injectable transplantation systems, and to characterize
              both  of these types of polymers.  ***
