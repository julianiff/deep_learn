Abstract    :
                 Survey instruments, ranging from those designed to elicit contingent
              valuations to those that collect attitudes and opinions about policy options,
              are used as information sources to determine environmental policy and program
              actions. However, the current survey methods do not accurately represent the
              multidimensional and nonmonetary nature of the resource values that must be
              considered in the policy process. Therefore, this project develops a research
              program on two promising new environmental survey approaches, which appear to
              offer distinct advantages in providing comprehensive and focused databases on
              public responses to the issues and concerns policy makers are expected to
              address. The decision pathways approach asks respondents a series of
              interrelated questions, each of which has several answers. The choice of
              answers creates a decision path for each respondent, which in turn reveals the
              preferred resource management options and the reasoning strategies. The value
              integration approach begins by identifying the components of value relevant to
              the issue and assists respondents in using this knowledge to make informed
              tradeoffs across alternative environmental policies. Both proposed survey
              approaches reflect the insights of behavioral decision theory and recognize the
              constructive nature of complex environmental values.  This project is supported
              by the EPA/NSF Valuation for Environmental Policy funding opportunity.
