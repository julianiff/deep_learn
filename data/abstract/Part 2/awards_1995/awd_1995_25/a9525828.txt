Abstract    :
              9525828  Bequette    This project seeks to sponsor engineering students to
              attend the  IEEE Control Systems Society Meetings.  The goal is to develop an 
              opportunity for students to be informed about the most recent  developments in
              research, engineering and operation in the  control and/or power engineering
              industry.  Opportunities for  student attendance will be advertised nationwide
              and women,  minorities and disabled students will be especially encouraged to 
              apply for sponsorship.  ***
