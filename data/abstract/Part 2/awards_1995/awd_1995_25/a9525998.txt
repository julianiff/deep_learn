Abstract    :
              9525998  West  This research will develop a flexible accounting system that
              integrates four alternative costing methodologies into the product life cycle
              framework.  Using virtual manufacturing equipment, the operational and
              financial impact of proposed technologies can be assessed.  Five industry
              collaborators will participate in developing and testing a modification to an
              existing virtual manufacturing cell environment that incorporates the new cost
              model.  The results of this work may be used to develop a practical tool for
              moving beyond traditional accounting methods in assessing the impact of
              proposed technology investments on an existing factory environment.   
              Fundamental issues in making process design decisions will be explored in this
              research that should enable the development of practical models for assessing
              operational and financial impact of new technologies.  Design tools based on
              these models would be used in accounting, process design, and technology
              management to estimate the cost of introducing new technologies.  ***
