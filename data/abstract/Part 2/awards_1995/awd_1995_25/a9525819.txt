Abstract    :
              Christopher Cramer is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
              Computational chemistry program  to begin theoretical calculations of singlet
              triplet splittings both in vacuo and in solution. The calculations  will be
              performed with both standard ab-initio methods as well as Density Functional
              methods. The  calculations will be combined with a solvation model in order to
              ascertain the effects of solvent on energy  gaps.     The bulk of experimental
              chemistry, and virtually all of biological chemistry, takes place in solution,
              or  in condensed phases. Most theoretical calculations apply to molecules that
              are in the gas phase, and which  do not interact. This project involves
              augmenting existing theoretical methods, at several levels of theory,  with a
              solvation model in order to address the properties of molecules in solution.
              The approach taken  in this work involves approximating the solvent, within the
              theoretical model. The proposed work will  develop and calibrate these new
              methods on a wide variety of molecules of chemical and biological  importance.
