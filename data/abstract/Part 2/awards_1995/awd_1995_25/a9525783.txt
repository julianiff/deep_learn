Abstract    :
              Abstract  CTS-9525783  Taylor      This proposal focuses on understanding the
              mechanism of formation of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD) from
              chlorinated acetylenes and the formation of chloacetylene from chlorinated
              hydrocarbons.  The claim of this proposal is that a better understanding of the
              formation kinetics of these precursors will lead to technology for their
              prevention.
