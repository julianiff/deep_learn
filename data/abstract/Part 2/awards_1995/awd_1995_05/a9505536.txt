Abstract    :
              9505536  Hallgren        Scientific advances in atmospheric sciences has
              historically been closely tied  with abilities to make accurate and detailed
              observations of the state of the  atmosphere.  Periodically, symposium are held
              that bring together scientists to discuss  the cutting edge in meteorological
              instrumentation and observations.  Under the  auspices of the American
              Meteorological Society, funds will be made available to  partially support
              travel costs to the Ninth American Meteorological Society s  Symposium on
              Meteorological Observations and Instrumentation to be held in  Charlotte, NC. 
              Support will be limited to students and key scientists from  disadvantaged
              foreign countries, who otherwise would not be able to attend.   Selection will
              be made on a competitive basis by a subcommittee of the American 
              Meteorological Society s Committee on Measurements.  ***
