Abstract    :
              The main objective of this research is to investigate the issures  related to
              hardware designs and performance evaluations of a number  of innovative cache
              design techniques.  These design techniques are  currently being developed for
              single-chip general purpose  processors and multiprocessors.  Specifically, the
              focus of the  research includes: 1) minimization of area cost of on-chip caches
               by CAT--caching address tags: 2) maximization of cache hit ratios  by evenly
              distributing data across cache sets with the help of a  few tag bits that
              change frequently during program executions; 3)  investigation of potential
              impacts of the new CAT cache designs for  various cache configurations as well
              as multiprocessor caches; and  4) devising analytical models, and performing
              trace-driven  simulations and execution-driven simulations for evaluating 
              implementation costs, performances, and design trade-offs of  various designs.
