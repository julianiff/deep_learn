Abstract    :
              Alvarez  9505451     This proposal builds on the recognition of the Chicxulub
              Crater in Yucatan as the probable site of a major impact at the
              Cretaceous-Tertiary (KT) boundary.  The first of two parts of the project will
              be a detailed study of the products of the KT impact and their mode of origin. 
              Field and laboratory studies of proximal ejecta and the transition from
              proximal to distal ejecta will be carried out, including inexpensive drilling
              of a potential KT site at the critical transition distance, and these materials
              will be tied to formation of the Chicxulub crater by calculations of ballistic
              trajectories.  A key question will be whether the impact was single or
              multiple, and whether it was steeply inclined or oblique at  a low angle.  A
              database of information on KT sites, already well underway, will be expanded
              and made available to the research community.  The second part deals with the
              environmental results of the KT impact, and will involve both stratigraphic
              study of the immediate post-impact record in pelagic sedimentary rocks and the
              preparation of environmental reconstructions of the world immediately before
              and shortly after the KT boundary impact.
