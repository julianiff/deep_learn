Abstract    :
              9505359  Beyette      This award is under the International Junior Investigator 
              and Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which enables U.S.  scientists and engineers
              to conduct three to twenty-four  months of research abroad. The program's
              awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or 
              complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.   
              This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Fred R.
              Beyette to work with Dr. Graham John Rees  at the University of Sheffield in
              the United Kingdom.    The proposed research involves the implementation of an
              NxN  crossbar switch using piezoelectric symmetric self electro-  optic
              (S-SEED) devices.  The main objectives are to  investigate the interface
              between device research and system  demonstration, to develop piezoelectric
              S-Seed device arrays  for a NxN crossbar switch, to utilize the crossbar switch
              as  a test bed for evaluation of S-SEED array uniformity, and to  isolate
              barriers to the development of practical systems  based on these devices.
