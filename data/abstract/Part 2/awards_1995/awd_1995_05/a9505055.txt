Abstract    :
              DMS-9505055  PI: Brylinski    Brylinski will continue her research on the
              quantization of nilpotent orbits.  The main thrust of the project is to
              investigate the symplectic and algebraic geometry of nilpotent orbits and to
              find ways to quantize these orbits within the broad scheme of geometric
              quantization.  The outcome will be the construction of geometric models of
              unitary representations.  This work will result in a better understanding of
              geometric quantization, quantization in general, and the geometry and invariant
              theory of nilpotent orbits.      The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of
              the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in
              twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the
              symmetries inherent in a system, the representation theory of Lie groups has
              had a profound impact upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and
              number theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and
              elementary particle physics.
