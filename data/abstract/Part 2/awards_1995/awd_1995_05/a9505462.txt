Abstract    :
              9505462  Feldstein    This award will provide partial support for the Second 
              International   Conference on the Numerical Solution of Volterra and Delay 
              Equations to   be held at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona from May 
              22-25,   1996.  The subject of Volterra equations includes functional 
              differential   equations (delay, advanced, and neutral), Volterra integral 
              equations, and   Volterra integro-differential equations.  These equatiols have
               found   applications as models in many areas of science and engineering  such
              as   biomathematics and medical science, control theory,  electrodynamics,  
              neutron transport, theory, oscillation theory, and  viscoelasticity.  Since the
                solutions to such equations can rarely be obtained in closed  form,  
              computational techniques must be used; hence the focus of the  conference  
              will be on computational methods.  The three main themes of the   conference
              will be convergence and order properties, stability  analysis, and  
              implementation problems.  The program will include invited  presentations   and
              contributed talks, as well as organized mini-symposia and  panel   discussions.
               The conference will bring together leading scholars  in this   field from the
              international community and participants will  include both   junior
              researchers and senior experts.
