Abstract    :
              9505595  Hautala  In this project, the PI will collaborate in the deployment of 
              shallow pressure gauges in three straits of the Indonesian  Archipelago,
              Lombok, Alor, and Timor, in order to measure the  throughflow transport, its
              temporal variability, and surface  temperature, and salinity.  Work will be
              carried out on an  Indonesian research vessel in collaboration with Indonesian 
              scientists.  In addition to the pressure gauges, a survey will be  carried out
              using a towed ADCP (Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler)  to level the pressure
              gauges and measure ocean currents along the  ship track.  The work will be done
              in collaboration with that to be  proposed under ARLINDO (Indonesian acronym
              for "Throughflow"), a  joint US/Indonesian study of the Indonesian Throughflow.
