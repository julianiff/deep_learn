Abstract    :
                      ABSTRACT    OPP-9505391            This dissertation project will
              examine the effects on local society and culture of community-based indigenous
              tourism development in a small community in southwest Greenland. The main goal
              of the project will be an assessment of the economic, social and cultural
              viability and sustainability of this form of tourism. The project employs
              anthropological theory and methods and serves as an important contribution to
              the study of sustainable development in the Arctic as well as advancing the
              development of arctic-based research within the wider concerns of social
              science.    ***
