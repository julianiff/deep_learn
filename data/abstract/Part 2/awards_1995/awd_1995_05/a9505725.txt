Abstract    :
              9505725  Bars        String theory has been proposed as a unifying theory of all
               interactions including gravity, and therefore as a synthesis in  our
              understanding of all forces.  Work in string theory in the  past decade has led
              to significant physical insights and the  development of many new techniques
              and insights in mathematics.       The proposed conference is the seventh in
              series of  international conferences on string theory which have been held 
              almost annually.  It is likely to lead to significant advances as  all the
              major figures in the field will come together.       The conference is being
              hosted this year by the University  of Southern California.  ***
