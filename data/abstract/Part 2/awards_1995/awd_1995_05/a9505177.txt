Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  9505177  Vafai    The proposal is for partial support of an
              "International Conference on Porous Media and their Applications in Science,
              Engineering, and Industry", to be held in June, 1996.  The meeting will be
              addressed by the major international researchers in the subject and will
              encompass broad aspects of porous media phenomena.  The conference proceedings
              will be published in book form.
