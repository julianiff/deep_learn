Abstract    :
                  9505813  Fischer    The ovule is a fundamental unit of plant reproduction
              that  generates the female gametophyte, mediates fertilization processes,  and
              support the development of the embryo. The long term goal of  this proposal is
              to understand the genetic circuits that control  the early development of the
              ovule by analyzing two Arabidopsis  genes, BELL1 (BEL1) and OVULE MUTATION2
              (OVM2), that were cloned in  Dr. Fischer's laboratory. The BEL1 gene product
              plays a role in the  specification of ovule identity. bel1 mutant ovules are
              often  transformed into carpel like structures, isolation and sequencing  of
              the BEL1 gene indicates that it encodes a homeodomain  transcription factor. It
              is thought that the BEL1 gene prevents the  carpel developmental program from
              over-riding ovule development by  negatively regulating expression of the
              floral homeotic gene,  AGAMOUS(AG). The OVM2 gene product is needed at distinct
              threshold  levels to control ovule and female gametophyte development, 
              respectively. With no active OVM2 protein, both ovule and female  gametophyte
              development are dramatically suppressed, whereas a low  level of OVM2 protein
              results in nonfunctional ovules that  specifically lack a female gametophyte.
              Isolation and sequencing of  the OVM2 gene indicates that it is related to the
              floral homeotic  gene APETALA2 (AP2). Thus, BEL1 and OVM2 genes are important 
              regulators of ovule and female gametophyte development, with  mutations
              resultilg in homeotic conversions and deletions of  organs. To understand their
              mechanism of action, the critical steps  that control early ovule development,
              and the relationship between  ovule and floral developmental programs,
              experiments will be  carried out to: 1) Determine the temporal and spatial
              localization  of BEL1 and OVM2 activity, 2) Determine the genetic relationships
               between ovule and floral regulatory genes, 3) Carry out a molecular  analysis
              of BEL1 and OVM2 function, and 4) Carry out a genetic  screen to identify new
              genes that control  megagametogenesis.  ***
