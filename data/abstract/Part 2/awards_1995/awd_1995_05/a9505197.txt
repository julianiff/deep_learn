Abstract    :
              INT 9505197  Lahiri  Technical Description:  This project provides partial
              support for  Partha-sarathi Lahiri, University of Nebraska, to conduct
              statistical  research in small-area estimation at the Indian Institute of 
              Management, Calcutta with collaborator Rahul Mukherjee.  Dr.  Lahiri will also
              work with T.J. Rao of the Indian Institute of  Statistics, Calcutta to explore
              new areas in survey sampling.   Estimators used in large scale national sample
              surveys perform  poorly at the sub-national level.  The P.I. proposes to
              explore the  use of empirical Bayes and hierarchical Bayes methods in 
              developing estimators to generate reliable small area statistics.  The 
              collaborators will  investigate whether this method which Lahiri has  shown to
              be superior to the best linear estimators for small area  means, holds for the
              general mixed model with random error  variance components.  They will extend
              the empirical Bayes and  hierarchical Bayes methods to find estimators of small
              area  characteristics for discrete data.         Scope:  Research in small area
              estimation is important for  generating  statistics at the state and county
              levels and for  subgroups of the population.  In India and the U.S., such
              statistics  are needed by various federal and local governments for policy 
              making and allocation of funds.  The foreign collaborator has done  outstanding
              work in the areas of Bayesian statistics, higher order  asymptotics and survey
              sampling.  Professor Mukherjee's recent  advances in the area of asymptotics
              will be very helpful in proving  difficult asymptotic results mentioned in the
              proposal.  Many  mutual benefits may be expected to result from this new 
              collaborative activity.       ***
