Abstract    :
              9505689  University of New Hampshire  Virendra Mathur      This workshop will
              bring together several scientists and engineers from   universities, industries
              and government laboratories to discuss sorption with chemical complex
              formation.  The focus of the workshop will be on the "Role of Thermal Swing
              Absorption in Air Separation."  Thermal Swing Absorption (TSA) is an emerging
              non-cryogenic technique that is specifically designed to use waste heat as the
              energy source.  An oxygen binding complex is used to selectively and reversibly
              bind oxygen, which can be released at a higher temperature.  The experience and
              knowledge transfer from this workshop may lead to research and development with
              significant impact on cost-effective production of oxygen for its use in
              pollution prevention or control and for energy savings.  The research needs in
              this topic will be documented in the form of proceedings.  There is potential
              of long term impact on the manufacturing of oxygen, a critical gas for
              industrial and biomedical applications, and on pollution control as well as
              energy savings.
