Abstract    :
              9505771  Wyllie  This project is aimed at understanding the origin and evolution
              of the siliceous magmas characteristics of batholiths in the roots of mountain
              ranges, and of orogenic volcanism, which involves the flux of materials through
              subduction zones and in other tectonic environments.  Major efforts will be
              devoted to three specific geological problems, with new experimental data and
              the synthesis of these with experimental data from the several investigations
              of recent years.  The three topics are:  (1) the origin of early continental
              crust, (2) the conditions for partial melting of subducted oceanic crust: 
              pelagic sediments and gabbro, and (3) the correlation of high resolution
              tomography in subduction zones with results from experimental petrology and
              thermal modeling.
