Abstract    :
              9505436  Johnson         A sulfonamide-based collection system for tropospheric
              active  chlorine will be developed.  Measurements of active chlorine  species
              (predominantly hypochlorous acid and mmlecular chlorine) is  a recent concern,
              as these species may have a significant impact on  marine boundary layer
              chemistry.  Advantages of the proposed  collection technique over current
              methods include the potential for  enhanced sensitivity, the possibility of
              speciation of active  chlorine compounds, and the possibility of detecting
              active  bromine.  The proposed work includes laboratory testing of 
              experimental implementations of sulfonamide-bonded media to  evaluate:  1)
              collection efficiency for chlorine and hypochlorous  acid, 2) ability to
              discriminate between the various chlorine and  bromine species collected
              (including possible artifacts), and 3)  possible interferences from other
              atmospheric species.  The final  stage of the proposed work will be preliminary
              field measurements  at a remote marine site in California.
