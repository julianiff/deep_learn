Abstract    :
              MCB 9505441  Terri Grodzicker     The purpose of this award is to sponsor a
              conference on programmed cell death.  Programmed cell death (apoptosis) is a
              genetically controlled cellular process wherein a cell will commit suicide or
              will be murdered by another cell in response to  specific physiological
              signals.  Interest in this field has exploded in the last two years in large
              part because gene products controlling apoptosis have been identified. 
              Investigators can now begin to elucidate the pathways and mechanisms involved
              in the cell death process.  The objective of the conference is to bring
              together researchers working on diverse aspects of apoptosis, and to create a
              meeting environment suitable for the exchange of information and ideas which
              will foster advancement in the field.  %%%  This meeting will provide exchange
              of information and new insights with regard to the field of programmed cell
              death by bringing together a group of scientists with diverse backgrounds and
              approaches for the study of cell death.  It is anticipated that the frontiers
              of science will be significantly advanced by support of this project.  ***
