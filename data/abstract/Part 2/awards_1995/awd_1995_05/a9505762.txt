Abstract    :
                    #9505762  COMBERIATE  With the installation of a special ground station at
              McMurdo  Station, Antarctica, it is now possible to collect real-time  ozone
              data from NASA spacecraft.  NASA and NSF will jointly  upgrade the station
              software to automatically produce ozone  images every orbit as the Total Ozone
              Mapping Spectrometer -  Earth Probe (TOMS-EP) satellite passes overhead, and
              make them  available to users worldwide, via the INTERNET.    Approximately
              $96,000 is required for the project.  NASA has  provided $66,000 for the
              prerequisite activities that need to be  accomplished at the NASA Goddard Space
              Center.  This award of  $30,000 will upgrade the NASA Antarctic Interactive
              Support  Launch Support (NAILS) system at McMurdo Station; develop,  install,
              and test real-time ozone image processing software on  the NAILS; and provide
              documentation and training for winter-over  operators at McMurdo.    The tasks
              funded by this award will be provided by a NASA Goddard  contractor and
              reimbursed by NSF/OPP.  It is recommended that  this award be funded in FY-1995
              at $30,000.
