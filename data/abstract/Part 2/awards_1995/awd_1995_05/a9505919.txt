Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed research is the study of the  design, analysis,
              and implementation of algorithms for  computing the global minima of a class of
              nonconvex energy  functions.    One of the most significant and challenging
              problems in  molecular biophysics and biochemistry is that of computing  the
              native 3-dimensional conformation (folded state) of a  globular protein given
              its amino acid sequence, possibly in  the presence of additional agents (e.g.
              drugs).  The  minimization of potential energy functions plays an  important
              role in the determination of ground states or  stable states of certain classes
              of molecular clusters and  proteins.  Since, in almost all the cases, the
              potential  energy function is nonconvex and therefore has been  made;  the
              primary impediment is the lack of adequate global  minimization methods for
              these large-dimensionality  problems.    Our research will focus on:  (a)
              determination of suitable  energy functions that can reliably model protein
              behaviour  and (b) global optimization methods that can find global  minima of
              nonconvex energy functions given the many degrees  of freedom available to
              protein structures.
