Abstract    :
              9505188  Caress       This project will maintain and improve MB-System which is
              a  software package in the public domain that supports manipulation, 
              processing, and display of multibeam bathymetric, beam intensity  and sidescan
              data.  Additional data file formats and processing  capabilities will be added,
              a point and click graphical user  interface will be added, and enhanced
              documentation will be  produced.  ***
