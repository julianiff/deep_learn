Abstract    :
              9505163  Sunde      Dr. Sunde will host the 1995 FASEB Summer Conference on
              Micronutrients:  Trace Elements, to be held on June 25-30, 1995 at Copper
              Mountain Resort in Colorado.  The conference will focus on recent developments
              related to the metabolism, function and molecular biology of iron, copper,
              zinc, and selenium.  It will consist of slide presentations, workshops, viewing
              of posters and informal discussions.  The purpose of the conference is to
              exchange ideas, define important areas of research, and develop novel schemes
              to solve basic questions of biology and the interaction of nutrition and genes
              in human health and disease.  ***
