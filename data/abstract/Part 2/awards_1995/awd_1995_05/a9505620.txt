Abstract    :
              9505620  Chiang       Despite its significant progress, the direct method still 
              suffers from several limitations which prevent it from both off-  line and
              on-line applications.  These limitations may be  classified into: modeling
              limitation, scenario limitation,  function limitation and accuracy limitation. 
              These limitations  must be removed or significantly improved before direct
              methods  can be actually used by power utilities.  A major limitation of 
              direct methods in the past has been the simplicity of the models  used in
              various direct method implementations in software  programs.  Much of this
              limitation will be overcome by the work  presented in this proposal.  The
              second limitation has been that  direct methods apply to first swing
              instability only.  The  proposed project will enhance direct methods in such a
              way to  provide useful information for identifying multi-swing unstable  cases.
               A third limitation has been the accuracy and reliability  of direct methods. 
              This limitation will be significantly  improved by the work (BCU method) to be
              developed in this  research for network-preserving power system models.  This 
              proposal seeks, from both computational and theoretical  viewpoints, to remove
              or improve much of the limitations in  direct methods and make them viable for
              on-line direct stability  analysis of practical large-scale power systems  ***
