Abstract    :
              9505615  Chandler       There is a long standing need for accurate calculations 
              of nuclear reaction probabilities for reactions resulting in  three or more
              final nuclear fragments (breakup reactions).  The authors propose analytical
              and numerical studies of  breakup reactions using, (1) their recently derived 
              equations, and (2) a proposed extension of the coupled-  reactions-channel
              method.  The Proposed research will also  be useful for other fields (such as
              atomic, molecular, and  surface physics) in which breakup reactions are
              important.  ***
