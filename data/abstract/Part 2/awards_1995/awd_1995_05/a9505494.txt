Abstract    :
              ***  9505494  Pilkey  This award supports a two year cooperative research
              project  on optimum dynamic studies for rotors and mechanisms between  Walter
              Pilkey, University of Virginia, and Jin Dewen,  Department of Precision
              Instruments, Tsinghua University,  Beijing, China.  The project combines
              analytical and computational expertise  from the US and state-of-the-art
              experimental facilities  from China.  It applies optimum system design
              techniques to  a variety of mechanical engineering mechanisms.  This  project
              continues work initiated under an earlier two year  award, through which
              methodology of limiting performance  analysis for rotors and mechanisms was
              developed.  Limiting  performance technology has had extensive development in
              the  US, but is in need of verification of the theories with  practical
              applications.  During this study, the University  of Virginia will provide the
              design process and analysis,  Tsinghua University will design and manufacture
              the test  protocol, and carry out the tests. Research results will be  used
              eventually in improved design of mechanical systems  involving the protection
              of the human body in impact  situations (helmet design, for example).  ***
