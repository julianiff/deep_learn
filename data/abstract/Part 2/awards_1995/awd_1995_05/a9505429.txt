Abstract    :
              9505429  Austin      This award is under the International Junior Investigator 
              and Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which enables U.S.  scientists and engineers
              to conduct three to twenty-four  months of research abroad at research centers
              of proven  excellence. The program's awards provide opportunities for  joint
              research, and the use of unique or complementary  facilities, expertise and
              experimental conditions abroad.  Financial support for this award is from the
              East Asia  Pacific Program.    This award will support a twenty-four-month
              postdoctoral  research visit by Dr. Christopher C. Austin to work with Dr. 
              Stephen Donnellan at the South Australian Museum in  Adelaide, South Australia.
                 Dr. Austin will collect genetic data to examine patterns of  colonization
              and genetic differentiation across the entire  geographic range of the skink
              Lipinia noctua.  This species  occurs from the Papuan region throughout Oceania
              to the  Hawaiian Islands in the north and the Pitcairn Islands to  the south. 
              These data will be used to address questions  about the association of
              molecular and morphological  evolutionary rates and the controlling factors in
              rates of  speciation. ***
