Abstract    :
              9505897  Gray       The Department of Mathematics at the University of Illinois
              at  Urbana-Champaign will purchase computer equipment which will be  dedicated
              to the support of research in the mathematical sciences. The  equipment will be
              used for several research projects, including in  particular:       i)
              Stephanie B. Alexander, Curvature, topology and interior size  of Euclidean
              hypersurfaces and Riemannian manifolds with boundary.       ii) Douglas C.
              Bowman, Algorithms for q-series identities.       iii) Nick B. Firoozye, Image
              Segmentation via Wiener's Theorem and  Wavelets       iv) John W. Gray,
              Object-Oriented Category Theory       v) Joseph Rosenblatt, Computational
              studies in phase retrieval.
