Abstract    :
                9505679  Grodzicker    Drosophila (fruit flies) provide a model system for the
              study of problems in brain organization, brain development, and behavior.  The
              power of this model system is increased because with this organism techniques
              are available to analyze both the genetic and biochemical substrates of brain
              and behavior.  This award will provide partial support for younger scientists
              (especially women and minorities) to attend an important core meeting on
              Drosophila neurobiology.  Thus the award will help stimulate neuroscience
              research, as well as the training and development of young scientists.  ***
