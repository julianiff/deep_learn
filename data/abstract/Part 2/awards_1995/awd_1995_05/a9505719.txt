Abstract    :
               This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Research Program.  
              This is a study of saving and retirement planning among working and middle
              class couples, particularly through the influence of gender and inequality. 
              Theoretical issues concern the influence of education, gender, and social class
              on decision-making in the family.  Data include interviews with 20 retired
              couples, interviewed together and separately, and survey data from the National
              Longitudinal Survey (concentrating on the "older men" cohort and their "mature"
              spouses) and from the Health and Retirement Study.  %%%   This research will
              contribute to sociological understanding of family relations, financial
              planning,  and social class differences.  It will be of help to policy makers
              concerned with family stability and the economic well-being of  the elderly.   
              In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award
              will materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for
              the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower
              of the nation and the thorough training of the next generation of social
              scientists.
