Abstract    :
              9505386  Carroll     The goal of this project is to obtain seasonal data on
              ozone and ozone precursors in order to determine (1) the climatology of these
              species, and (2) the photochemical and transport processes responsible for the
              formation and loss of ozone at a rural site in the midwest. Continuous
              measurements of ozone, carbon monoxide, temperature, relative humidity, wind
              speed, wind direction, and ultraviolet radiation, as well as measurements of
              nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, and total reactive nitrogen during four
              seasonal intensive periods will be conducted at the University of Michigan
              Biological station, located near the northern tip of Michigan's lower
              peninsula. The site chosen experiences continental polar and temperate
              continental and maritime air masses.   The following techniques will be
              employed: ultraviolet absorption for ozone, non-dispersive infrared analysis
              for carbon monoxide, photolysis of nitrogen dioxide and catalytic conversion of
              total reactive nitrogen to nitric oxide, and detection of NO via
              chemiluminescence. A photochemical box model will be used to quantify in situ
              ozone formation at the site, and modeling studies will investigate the current
              understanding of photochemistry of regional transport events.
