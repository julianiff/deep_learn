Abstract    :
              9505677  DAHLEN     This research is to study the propagation of fundamental and
               higher-mode surface waves in a laterally heterogeneous earth.   Previous
              results will be extended to focus on higher-frequency  surface waves, for which
              cross-branch coupling due to variations in  crustal thickness and shorter
              scale-length variations in the upper  mantle such as slabs, become more
              important.  Work will continue  with the development of a spline basis on the
              surface of a  tesselated sphere to replace the widely-used spherical-harmonic 
              representation of three-dimensional earth models.  Such a local  basis has a
              number of advantages, including the ability to vary the  node spacing depending
              upon the coverage, and a dramatic  improvement in the speed of surface-wave ray
              tracing due to the  reduction in the number of evaluations required at each
              step.  This  research is a component of the Cooperative Studies of the Earth's 
              Deep Interior program.  ***
