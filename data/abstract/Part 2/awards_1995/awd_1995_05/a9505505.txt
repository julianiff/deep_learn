Abstract    :
              9505505  Becker       Descriptive set theory is the study of definable sets and
              functions  in Polish spaces.  A Polish space (group) is a separable, completely
                metrizable topological space (group).  Becker's reqearch concerns the actions
                of Polish groups, in connection with -- or from the point of view of --  
              descriptive set theory.  The basic classes of definable sets are the classes 
              of Borel, analytic and coanalytic sets.  These constitute the main topic of 
              the project, although  other classes of definable sets are also considered.  A
              major theme of the project is discovery of dichotomies of the orbit  space,
              i.e. theorems stating that either the orbit space is "small" or else   it
              contains a copy of some specific "large" set.  The Vaught Conjecture, a  
              famous open problem in logic concerning the number of countable models of a  
              first order theory, asserts such a dichotomy (either this number is countable 
              or of size the continuum).  Much of the project is related to that conjecture. 
              Becker's project employs the standard methods of descriptive set theory 
              together with one new method, whereby the underlying topology is changed.  Some
              of the topics in this project are considered in the presence of strong  set
              theoretic axioms.       Becker's work relates to several branches of
              mathematical logic, as  well as to other fields of mathematics, particularly
              ergodic theory and   operator algebras.  This research, in the area called
              descriptive set   theory, is of a fundamental kind, and deepens the
              understanding of   exactly those sets which arise in natural ways throughout
              mathematics.  ***
