Abstract    :
              9505567  Goldstein      Body cells must maintain their volume constant in order
              to function properly.  Both humans and animal cells face constant threats to
              their volumes under both physiological and pathological conditions.  In this
              proposal, Dr. Goldstein will be examining the cellular and molecular mechanisms
              that permit cells to maintain constant volume in the face of osmotic
              disturbances in the environment surrounding cells.  The experimental model will
              be the red blood cell of the skate.  He has used this model successfully in the
              past to begin elucidating the physiological processes in the cell membrane that
              are involved in adjusting cell volume back to normal after extracellular
              disturbances.  He will continue with these studies as well as others that deal
              with the ways in which cell volume changes are signaled to volume-adjustilg
              mechanisms operating in the cell membrane.  The studies will lead to a better
              understanding of the physiological basis of the fundamethal phenomemon of cell
              volume regulation.  ***
