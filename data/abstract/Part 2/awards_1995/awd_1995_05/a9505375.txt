Abstract    :
              9505375  Bartoszynski       Bartoszynski and Scheepers' research is in set
              theory.  Some of  their problems are well-known, while others have arisen from
              more recent   work.  One common theme for many of these problems lies in
              establishing a   link between forcing and inductive constructions.  Another
              underlying goal   is to express various properties of sets in the language of
              infinite games.   It is expected that notions from model theory, forcing
              theory,   combinatorial set theory and game theory will play a significant role
              in   this research.       With its roots in the work of Cantor, Hausdorff,
              Godel and Cohen,  their projected research will deal with the notions of the
              infinite and some   subtle ways in which these notions manifest themselves in
              areas of modern   mathematics.  The questions they explore are specifically
              focused on that    area of mathematics known as "foundations," with answers
              that potentially   extend beyond its boundaries.  In essence, their approach
              will apply the   advanced methods of modern logic and game theory to problems
              that lie in the   intersection of foundations and real analysis.  ***
