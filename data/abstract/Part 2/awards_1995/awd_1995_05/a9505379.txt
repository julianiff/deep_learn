Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry  
              Program supports continued fundamental studies of coordination chemistry   by
              Dr. Henry Taube of the Chemistry Department, Stanford University.    Emphasis
              will be placed on investigations of the reactivity of metal   complexes,
              including substitution lability as a function of electronic   structure, inner
              and outer sphere electron transfer, mixed valence   behavior, linkage isomerism
              accompanying electron transfer, and acidity   of coordinated ligands. 
              Binuclear osmium complexes containing metals in   different oxidation states
              will be probed, as well as unusual osmium   species containing either a
              combination of aromatic and dihydrogen   ligands, or facially-bound macrocyclic
              ligands.   Understanding of the influence of structure and electron movement in
                metal-containing species is an essential underpinning for development of  
              molecular-level electronics, molecular switches and synthetic enzymes.    This
              research will provide new and important information on how to design  
              molecules to control the transfer of electrons and of small atoms or   groups
              of atoms.
