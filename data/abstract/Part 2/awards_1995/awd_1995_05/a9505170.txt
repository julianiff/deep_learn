Abstract    :
              Miller  9505170     The proposed research deals with various aspects of
              geometric partial differential equations. Linear elliptic differential
              operators, gauge field equations, and Yang-Mills-Higgs equations are among the
              topics to be pursued. Methods from topology, geometry and analysis are to be
              employed: variational techniques, moduli space techniques, and index theory are
              to be applied to tackle these partial differential equations. The proposed
              research may have consequences in smooth manifold theory by uncovering new
              topological invariants of manifolds.    Gauge fields arise naturally in
              theoretical physics as attempts to unify basic forces of nature.
              Yang-Mills-Higgs equations have applications in early universe physics and the
              theory of galactic formation.
