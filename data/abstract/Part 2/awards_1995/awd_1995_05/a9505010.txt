Abstract    :
              Close    With an Archaeology Program "High Risk Exploratory Grant" Dr.  Angela
              Close will conduct a survey in the Southern Sinai Desert  of Egypt. She will
              seek to identify sites to solve two particular  problems. The first is the
              apparent hiatus in occupation of the  region between ca 30,000 and 14,500 years
              ago. This interval  spans the coldest part of the last glaciation. She will
              also  search for Neolithic sites which mark the origins of food  production in
              the region. Although previous work has discovered a  number of grinding stone
              which suggest that domestic grains were  available, no such plant remainq have
              actually been found.  Surveying will be conducted on foot and concentrated in
              three  zones. The most detailed work will be in foothills where springs  and
              vegetation would always have been attractive to human  occupation. Secondly,
              effort will also be focussed on the coastal  region because marine shells were
              collected and widely traded  during Neolithic times. Finally dry river valleys
              and lake beds  will be examined.    The Sinai peninsula is potentially of great
              archaeological  significance yet relatively little work has been done there.
              The  Near East is an area in which both plants and animals were  domesticated
              and a settled village way of life developed.  Archaeologists wish to gain
              insight into this process and the  work which Dr. Close will conduct has the
              potential to contribute  to this goal. The Sinai also provides the only
              land-bridge out of  Africa and has the potential to shed light on early human 
              migrations out of this continent.  This work is important because  it will,
              hopefully, establish the basis for a longer term  project.  ***
