Abstract    :
                 In global parallel scheduling all processors cooperate to  schedule work. 
              This should be contrasted with dynamic scheduling  since it  generates a
              well-balanced load without incurring a large  overhead.  This  project will
              explore a new method, calling  Runtime Incremental Parallel  Scheduling (RIPS).
               In RIPS, the  system scheduling activity alternates with the  underlying 
              computation work.  Tasks are incrementally scheduled in parallel  by  the
              cooperating processors.    This project aims at a framework for study of 
              global parallel  scheduling and its related techniques.  The project includes 
              the  development of parallel scheduling algorithms, the control of  low 
              parallelism, the design and implementation of a preemptive  scheduling system, 
              and solutions to irregular applications.  The  objective is to show that 
              runtime global parallel  scheduling, as a new scheduling approach, can adapt to
               irregular  and dynamic problems and produce high-quality scheduling.
