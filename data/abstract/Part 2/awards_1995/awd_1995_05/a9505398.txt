Abstract    :
                   abstract  9505398  Early  This project involves a demographic
              anthropologist at Florida Atlantic University in a study of the population
              dynamics of a small group of Venezuelan Indians, the Yanomami.  The project
              will code and analyze a unique data set of over 20 small Indian communities
              covering periods of 20-50 years.   The researchers will develop demographic
              profiles for each community for the duration of its existence, estimating rates
              of fertility, mortality, migration.  The researchers will develop a population
              profile of this group as it developed from first contact with non-Indian
              societies through settlement at religious missions.  The data will be immensely
              valuable to demographic researcher to explore such questions as the relation
              between imbalanced sex ratios due to precontact warfare, small group size
              random variation, disease, female infanticide, and polygyny, and the overall
              fertility structure of the population.    This research is important because it
              will provide a valuable data resource for studies of small-group population
              dynamics.  Such studies can provide insight into the history of the human
              population in general.
