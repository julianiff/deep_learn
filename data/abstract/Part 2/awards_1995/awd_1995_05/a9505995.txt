Abstract    :
              9505995  Georgiou         The research proposed represents a continuation of our
              current  program in developing theoretical and computational tools for 
              modeling and control of dynamical systems.       Our approach relies on the
              concept of the graph.  Model  uncertainty is quantified using the gap metric
              which measures  potential graph perturbations, and suitable margins are
              developed  to ascertain performance and robustness of stability for the 
              uncertain system.  In our past research, we have developed  computational and
              theoretical tools for robust control of linear  systems with an energy-type
              (L2-norm) performance specification.   The use of these tools has been
              demonstrated via application  studies, and related software has become
              available within a  standard commercial package (u-tools).       Over the next
              three years, we propose an intensive program to  develop theoretical and
              computational tools for robust control of  nonlinear systems.  The robustness
              will be quantified using  suitable gap-like metrics.  In particular, we
              introduce a variety  of possible distance measures which may be appropriate in
              different  situations.  We propose to compute suitable robustness margins 
              which guarantee robustness of stability and performance.  These  margins can be
              tailored to a variety of Lo, L2, global, and semi-  local stability and
              performance requirements.  Further, we will  develop related tools for robust
              feedback design under such metric  uncertainty.  Emphasis will be placed on
              computational issues and  application studies.   ***
