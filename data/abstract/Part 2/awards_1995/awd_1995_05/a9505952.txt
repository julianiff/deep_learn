Abstract    :
              9505952  Raja       This grant partially supports the latest, the tenth, in  a
              series of international Workshops on Antiproton-Proton  Collider Physics held
              in 1995 at the Fermi National  Accelerator Laboratory.  At the five-day-long
              series of  sessions in May results presented and discussed are at the  very
              frontiers, both experimental and theoretical, of  particle physics.  a heady
              mix of active scientists at  various career levels provides a vital environment
              conducive  to stimulating productive interactions among the  participants.  ***
