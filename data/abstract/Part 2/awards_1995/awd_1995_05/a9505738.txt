Abstract    :
              This project involves the continuation of a long-term ethnographic study in
              Africa that is in its 39th year, having begun in 1956.  The project will
              continue updating demographic, economic and social time-series data dealing
              with residents and the Diaspora from 4 rural villages drawn from a rural &
              urban population of about 100,000 in the middle Zambezi Valley, Zambia.  The
              project began tracking the social and economic adjustments of 57,000 people
              displaced by a World Bank financed river basin development project based on a
              dam that backed up what was at the time the largest artificial reservoir in the
              world.  The study has gone on to document how the study population reacted to
              adverse government policies that bankrupted the national economy and created
              one of the five poorest rural populations in the world; how 10 years of endemic
              warfare leading to national independence in 1980 affected the population, and
              how environmental degradation arising from resettlement and drought, and social
              disruption arising from cholera and AIDS have impacted the population.  The
              project has so far produced results which have directly influenced the World
              Bank's policies on resettlement, by producing a theoretical framework for
              forecasting how communities respond to such relocation.  Hypotheses to be
              tested during the 1995-97 research period involve how poor people cope with
              inflation and the relation between fertility, employment and education.  The
              ongoing research of 3 young scholars who will continue the Gwembe study after
              the retirement of the two current PIs is also part of this project.  This
              project is important because it advances our understanding of how local rural
              communities respond to global processes of change such as forced resettlement
              due to internationally-financed hydroelectric projects, rural economic
              hardships caused by internationally-imposed financial `structural adjustment`
              policies, and social disruption caused by AIDS and other infectious diseases  
              Understanding of how traditional rural communities react over the long-term can
              help planners design policies which avoid slow-growing problems and which more
              effectively stimulate economic growth and social development.
