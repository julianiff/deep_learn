Abstract    :
              ***  9505961  Steegmann    This a planning meeting to develop a research
              protocol for  biocultural modeling of health and work output  proposed by Dr.
              Theodore Steegmann,  SUNY at Buffalo and  Professor Francisco Datar, the
              University of the  Philippines.  The goal  is to arrive at universal modes that
               fit  a  wide  range of  natural and cultural environments.  Specialists from
              the U.S., China,  the Philippines and  Indonesia will  participate in this
              meeting  to pool  their  field experience, research specialization and
              contrasting  cultural perspectives to arrive at broad, realistic  structures. 
              The meeting  will be held Banaue, Luzon, the  Philippines on  June  10-24,
              1995.  This is an important topic in cultural  anthropology.   The results can
              affect adaptive theory and  applications by community planners.  ***
