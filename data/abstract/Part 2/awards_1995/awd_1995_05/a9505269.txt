Abstract    :
              A computerized database of verified diatom names will be produced.  This
              database will integrate and make accessible to the general scientific community
              disparate references and resources that contain information on diatom
              nomenclature.  Names appearing in the major published catalogues of diatom
              names as well as the unpublished New Species File of the Academy of Natural
              Sciences will be entered during this 3-year project into database tables for
              diatom genus names and names within diatom genera.  Each entry into the
              database will be verified against the original reference in which the name was
              proposed.  The information will be searchable by name, authority, date of
              publication, individual or groups of references and status of the name.  The
              estimate 75,00 records will be made available to diatom collections, state and
              federal agencies and individual scientists by request as well as over World
              Wide Web and Gopher servers on the Internet.  The project will be part of the
              information infrastructure to support a wide range of research disciplines
              relation to biotic surveys and invent ories, including Taxonomy and
              Systematics, Ecology, and Paleontology, including pure and applied projects.
