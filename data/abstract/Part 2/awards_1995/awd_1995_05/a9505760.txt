                This represents a new approach to the understanding of occluded cell
              chemistry in localized corrosion.  An advanced solution analysis technique,
              capillary electrophoresis, is employed that is capable of detecting nanogram
              quantities of a wide variety of ions in small solution volumes.  The
              combination of this high sensitivity and the ability to determine the ionic
              speciation (e.g., sulfur as sulfide versus thiosulfate) makes capillary
              electrophoresis a valuable tool in understanding solution chemistry and
              electrochemistry which have impact on corrosion resistance.  By using this
              technique to probe the progression of the solution chemistry within occluded
              cells, new insights into the fundamental processes controlling corrosion pit
              initiation and propagation are possible. Ion sensitive field effect transistors
              (ISFETs), capable of measuring pH changes over a wide range, allow the
              spatiotemporal variations in pH inside occluded sites to be followed with
              sub-mm and sub-sec resolutions.  By combining these techniques, the local
              conditions inside occluded sites on stainless steels is measured in
              unprecedented detail.  The experimental work is coordinated with the
              development of an improved mathematical description of the development and
              maintenance of occluded site chemistry.  %%%  Such understanding will have a
              major impact on the development of strategies for the prevention and mitigation
              of pitting, crevice corrosion and stress-corrosion cracking.  This work has a
              wide variety of potential applications including aging aircraft and long-term
              storage of high-level nuclear waste.
