              9505844 Watson         This research project will investigate signal
              transduction in hair bundles of  sea anemones.  The hair bundles of these
              organisms are mechanoreceptors that participate in regulating discharge of
              nematocysts into moving targets including prey.  While little is known of the
              signal transduction in this process, models have been developed to explain
              signal transduction in vertebrate hair bundles.  This investigator has found
              that anemone hair bundles are structurally and functionally similar to hair
              bundles in vertebrates, so he now proposes to test a model for signal
              transduction in anemones that incorporates features of the tip-link model for
              vertebrate hair bundles.  Tip-links are filaments which open and close ion
              channel gates at the tips of stereocilia.  The  hypothesis to be tested is that
              the tip links mechanically couple the gate of the ion channel to an adjacent
              stereocilium of the bundle.  This will be tested using a fluorescent dyes and
              computer imaging to see if a deflection of the bundle will cause membrane
              depolarization and alter fluorescence.  Electrophys iological recording (by
              patch clamping) during  mechanical stimulation of hair bundles and
              morphological studies using field emission scanning microscopy  will also be
              done.   %%%  These studies on the basis of mechanosensitive signal transduction
              in anemones are important for studies of biodiversity and well as evolution.
              Moreover they will enhance understanding of how  hair bundles respond in other
              systems, including vertebrates. ***                         ;
