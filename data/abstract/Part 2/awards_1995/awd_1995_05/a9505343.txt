Abstract    :
              9505343  Hairston       Dr. Hairston requests funding for a Small Grant for 
              Exploratory Research (SGER) for a project which has great potential  to move
              research on chaos to a new arena: real experimental  validation of methods for
              detecting nonlinearity and chaos.  The  ultimate goal is the development of
              methods for determining whether  chaos underlies the dynamics of natural
              populations.  In this  project, real organisms will be used to create data sets
              that  demonstrably exhibit complex nonlinear dynamics (either chaos or 
              complicated periodic oscillations).   These data will be used to 
              experimentally test existing and new methods for characterizing  complex
              dynamics.        The experimental system is a single-state chemostat culturing 
              rotifers and their algal food with variable supply rate of the  nutrient
              limiting algal growth.  There is experimental evidence  that this system can
              exhibit predator-prey oscillation.   Mathematical theory suggests that such
              oscillations can be driven  into complex mode-locking oscillations, and
              eventually into chaos,  by pulsed or periodically varying nutrient supply rate.
                    SGER funding will be used for a one-year pilot study to  demonstrate the
              feasibility to:  construct and maintain the  experimental system; vary
              conditions to obtain useful population  dynamics; and conduct experiments. 
              These will be the first studies  in which statistical methods, intended for use
              on natural  populations, are validated through experiments on real organisms.  
              This represents a major step towards reality, compared with  conventional tests
              using simulated data.
