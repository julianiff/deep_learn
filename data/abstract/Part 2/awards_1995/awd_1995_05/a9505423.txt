Abstract    :
              This proposal will validate the NCAR  thermosphere/ionosphere/electrodynamic
              general circulation model  (TIEGCM) for a variety of geophysical conditions,
              including winter  solar minimum, summer solar maximum, and equinox for both
              solar  minimum and maximum, by extensive comparison of the model  predictions
              with all available observations and with predictions  from empirical models. 
              The PIs will emphasize the predicted  thermosphere/ionosphere coupling,
              particularly the representation  of the atmospheric dynamo.  Results of this
              study will (1)  demonstrate quantitatively the model improvement over previous 
              model versions, especially the TIGCM; (2) establish the geophysical  conditions
              for which the TIEGCM provides a good representation of  the
              thermosphere/ionosphere system; and (3) identify areas for  further model
              improvements, such as the representation of the  equatorial ionosphere.***
