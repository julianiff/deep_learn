Abstract    :
              9505332  KELLEY       Global change research has highlighted the need for 
              integrated analyses of the complex interactions among different  human and
              natural systems.  In order to examine these  interactions and to relate
              fundamental studies to the concept of  global sustainability, an intensive
              summer study will be  undertaken in 1996 by the Pacific Basin Study Center of
              San  Francisco State University.  The study will bring together  international
              experts in the social and natural sciences as well  as policy makers from a
              number of nations.  It will focus on the  concept of sustainability, seeking to
              clarify the nature of  interactions among different systems, through an
              evaluation of  rice production.  In addition to examining social and economic 
              aspects of rice production, related natural systems like soils  and water will
              be studies.  This study will receive major support  from the Environmental
              Protection Agency.  This award provides  modest support from NSF to assist in
              planning efforts.       This study should provide new insights into the complex
               dynamics of rice production in the Pacific Basin, thereby  advancing
              understanding of the ways through which environmental  and economic
              sustainability might simultaneously be pursued.  This project also provides a
              mechanism to enhance cooperation  between NSF and EPA in the joint pursuit of
              mutual goals.
