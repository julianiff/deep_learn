Abstract    :
              Abstract  CMS-9505339  Columbia University  Beti, Raimondo    This 
              international conference will give experts in the area  of  structural
              retrofitting the opportunity to gather and to  share  their professional
              experiences.  Practicing engineers  as   well   as   university   researchers  
              and   government  representatives will take the podium during the  three  days 
              of the conference to critically analyze the state of the art  and   to  define 
              future  directions  for  retrofitting   of  structures.   The  program  under
              the  general  umbrella  of  retrofitting, will cover a broad spectrum of
              research areas,  varying from risk assessment, bridge and building structures 
              under  wind and earthquake excitation, to effects  of  blast  loads  on 
              structures, to innovative retrofitting techniques  and  nondestructive
              evaluation.  This conference is  limited  to  invited  speakers  and attendees
              and  will  represent  a  unique   opportunity   for  knowledge/technology  
              transfer,  creating  an  intellectually  challenging  environment   for 
              exchanging  ideas  and techniques among various  sectors  of  engineering.
