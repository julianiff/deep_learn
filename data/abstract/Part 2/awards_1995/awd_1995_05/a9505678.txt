Abstract    :
              9505678  Dangl  A detailed understanding of the molecular events leading to
              plant disease resistance is of  both practical importance and basic interest.
              This proposal takes complementary genetic and cell biological approaches to
              dissect the structure and function of a particular resistance gene, called
              RPM1, from the model plant Arabidopsis. Continuing analysis will identify new
              genes required for the expression of RPM1-dependent disease resistance. The
              four target areas of research are: 1. structure-function analysis of the RPM1
              protein, 2. its subcellular localization and topology; 3. the number and nature
              of other plant proteins with which it interacts and ; 4. genetic identification
              of other loci required for its function.  %%%  It has long been recognized that
              plants contain genes whose function is triggered by the presence of specific
              and corresponding genes in particular isolates of infecting pathogens. This
              "gene for gene" interaction is responsible for activation of the array of
              biochemical and cellular events leading to a disease resistant state. In
              addition, the initial recognition event can induce a longer lasting, systemic
              and pathogen non-specific immunity" termed systemic acquired resistance. The
              recent cloning of several plant disease resistance genes, and the corresponding
              pathogen genes which trigger their action, presages fundamental breakthroughs
              in understanding the molecular and cellular responses of plant disease
              resistance. One such plant gene, RPM1, from the model plant, Arabidopsis, will
              be analyzed at the molecular and cellular level. The protein encoded in the
              gene will be analyzed for its structure-function, its subcellular localization
              and topology and the number and nature of other plant proteins with which it
              interacts. Other genetic loci required for its function will be sought.   ***
