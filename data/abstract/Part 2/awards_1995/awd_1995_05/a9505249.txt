Abstract    :
              9505249  Burckle  This collaborative field program in the sub-Antarctic ocean
              involves researchers from University of Florida, Georgia Tech, Scripps
              Institution of the University of California at San Diego and Lamont-Doherty
              Earth Observatory of Columbia University.  The objectives of the research
              cruise planned for early 1996 are to sample sediments deposited within various
              water masses of the Antarctic ocean for studies of climatic and oceanographic
              variations over the past few hundred thousand years.  The Antarctic region has
              a major influence on global oceanography, for it is here that many of the
              intermediate and bottom waters of the world ocean are formed, and thus the heat
              and chemical budgets of the ocean are dependent in a number of ways on changes
              in climate and oceanmgraphy here.  The record of these variations is recorded
              in microfossils preserved in the sediments, and this group of investigators
              will sample sediments from all of the major intermediate and deep water masses
              of the region.  Their research will include faunal, chemical and pore water
              analysis of the sediments recovered to construct chronologies of change in a
              large number of parameters throughout the last two or three glacial cycles (as
              far as their piston cores will reach).  In addition, the data they collect will
              be used to define suitable sites for drilling by JOIDES Resolution in 1997 or
              1998 at sites which have been highly ranked as part of the Ocean Drilling
              Program, the international program for scientific ocean drilling of which NSF
              is a major sponsor.  Though presently considered a high drilling priority,
              these Antarctic sites do not presently have sufficient site survey information
              to allow precise hole locations, and this project will provide those necessary
              geophysical and sedimentological data.  ***
