Abstract    :
              9505157  Stanley      The project involves continued work on class forcing and
              non-generic reals, some combinatorial questions regarding stationary sets that
              have application to unique generic objects, and other problems in forcing.     
              Set theory provides the popular way to lay the foundations for all of
              mathematics, the best known systematic attempt to do this being Russell and
              Whitehead's Principia Mathematica. Important foundational questions concern the
              independence and the consistency of the axioms used to establish set theory. 
              Zermelo and Fraenkel's  axioms (ZF for short) are one of the most convenient
              set of basic axioms. However, it has been known since the work of Kurt Goedel
              in the 1930's that no axioms for set theory can be consistent as well as
              complete. This means that no set of axioms can be powerful  enough to prove
              every possible proposition or else its negation, but not both. Upon this
              startling theorem has been erected a rich theory, treating possible
              propositions P such that either P or Not P can be added to ZF without resulting
              in a contradiction. Any such proposition is said to be independent of ZF and
              can be taken as an additional axiom of set theory. The principal technique for
              finding such independent axioms is Paul J. Cohen's so-called method of forcing
              and its offspring. This is the circle of ideas involved in and motivating the
              investigator's research.  ***
