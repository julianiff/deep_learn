Abstract    :
                  9505687  Sack    Stomata consist of two guard cells surrounding a pore that 
              regulates gas exchange through the aerial plant epidermis. Little  is known
              about the genes that regulate stomatal patterning,  determination and
              differentiation. Two recessive Arabidopsis  mutants have been isolated, too
              many mouths (tmm) and four lips  (flp), each with extra adjacent stomata. Both
              affect stomatal  production and determination more than patterning or 
              differentiation. ttm appears to affect both precursor cell  formation and
              activity and may be an important regulator of  stomatal production. The
              research proposed has three objectives  overall. First, to understand the
              phenotypes better, Dr. Sack will  attempt to: a) isolate new alleles, b)
              characterize the  distribution of the stomatal phenotypes throughout the plant,
              c)  determine whether tmm and flp induce ectopic expression of stomatal  genes,
              d) analyze the extent of pore development in mutants, e)  determine whether
              substomatal placement and size is affected, and  f) characterize cell lineages
              involved in the development of wild  type stomata and of stomatal clusters. A
              second objective is to  isolate new mutants and loci affecting stomatal
              development. The  third major objective is to do fine mapping to choose
              appropriate  cloning strategies. These mutants are likely to help answer basic 
              questions of plant cell development such as how cells are selected  for
              specific fates, as well as how differentiation is initiated and  executed. In
              the long term, knowledge of the genetics and molecular  biology of stomatal
              development would be quite valuable given the  importance of stomata for plant
              productivity.  ***
