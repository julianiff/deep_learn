              NCR-9505975  California Institute of Technology  Coding Theory and Applications
               Robert J. McEliece    Three topics in modern coding theory are studied: 
              Trellis complexity of  convolutional codes, subgroup subcodes of Reed Solomon
              codes, and  turbo-codes.  The first involves a novel way of reducing the
              Viterbi  decoding complexity of a large class of convolutional codes, including
              many  codes currently used in practice (e.g. punctured convolutional codes and 
              the unit memory convolutional codes).  This is a surprising spinoff of the 
              large body of recent work on the trellis complexity of block codes.  The 
              second considers a new class of algebraic block codes, the class of "SSRS" 
              codes, which promises to break the "bottleneck" of Reed-Solomon codes, i.e. 
              the restriction that the code length be no more that the size of the code 
              alphabet. Finally the new class of "turbo-codes", recently introduced in 
              France, will be studied.  Turbo codes represent the biggest single step 
              forward in many years in high gain low complexity coding.  It is hoped to 
              develop a credible theory to explain the remarkable experimental results  and
              enable the work to be pressed forward systematically.
