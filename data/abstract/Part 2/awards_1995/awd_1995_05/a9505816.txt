Abstract    :
              9505816  ZANDT      This research is a study of the lithospheric structure of
              the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex at the borders of Argentina, Bolivia, and
              Chile, in the central volcanic zone of south America.  This zone has been the
              site of voluminous ignimbrite eruptions within the past 10 Ma and is one of the
              largest active caldera complexes on Earth.  In addition to analyzing existing
              data for the region, the project will install PASCALL portable broadband
              instrumentation for one year in the area for recording local and teleseismic
              events.  The aim of this work is to answer important questions about the deep
              structure of a major silicic volcanic field with implications for lithospheric
              magmatic processes in continental subduction zones, crustal thickening and
              melting, and the evolution of continental crust.  ***  ??
