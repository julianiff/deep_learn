Abstract    :
                  9505733  Chamot  The Board in Infrastructure and the Constructed Environment
              BICE  oversees programs of study dealing with the broad areas of 
              infrastructure systems and services, and national policies related  to
              sustainable cities, development of new technologies for  construction and
              infrastructure renewal, management of  infrastructure services, and other
              issues in which there is much  interest in many parts of the federal
              government.  As the Board is  newly created, it needs to develop a strategic
              plan and a new  program of studies of interest to potential sponsors.  This 
              proposal provides for partial support to support and maintain Board 
              activities, promote interchange between the Board the potential  sponsors, and
              develop a program interchange between the Board and  potential sponsors, and
              develop a program of studies that will both  serve the needs of sponsors and
              permit the development of a robust  support structure.
