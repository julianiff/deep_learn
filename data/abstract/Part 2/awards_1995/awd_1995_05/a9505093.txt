Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT      OPP 9505093  Moritz    Research supported by this grant is under
              the auspices of the Arctic Systems Science (ARCSS) Global Change Research
              Program and is jointly sponsored by the Division of Ocean Sciences and the
              Office of Polar Programs.  Work to be performed represents preliminary steps
              towards a major 5-year research project named SHEBA, which is envisioned to
              study the heat budget of the Arctic Ocean and its impact on global change.  The
              primary goals of SHEBA are: (1) to develop, test and implement models of arctic
              ocean- atmosphere-ice processes that demonstrably improve simulations of the
              present day arctic climate, including its variability, using General
              Circulation Models (GCMs), and (2) to improve the interpre tation of satellite
              remote sensing data in the Arctic for analysis of the arctic climate system and
              provide reliable data for model input, model validation and climate monitoring.
                  This award to the University of Washington establishes a Science Project
              Office for the SHEBA Program.  The Office will coordidate the planning
              activities, data collection, and serve as the primary point of contact for the
              project.  The data generated by all of the Phase 1 investigators will be
              transmitted to the Office and made available to other investigators so that the
              planning effort for the field program will be efficiently conducted with the
              most recent data set available.  ??
