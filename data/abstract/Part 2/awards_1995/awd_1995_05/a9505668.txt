Abstract    :
              9505668  Ramesh       The operations scheduling problem concerns the scheduling
              of  generating units in the most economic manner subject to several 
              constraints.  The problem is to identify which units should be ON  (committed)
              in each our over a period of time ranging from a day  to a week, and to
              determine the generation level of each  committed unit in each hour.  The main
              difficulty in solving the  problem is that it is a large mixed-integer
              nonlinear programming  (MINLP) problem, and is compute-intensive.  Because of
              this, the  algorithmic techniques currently employed do not model many 
              relevant constraints, and use several approximations which lead  to suboptimal
              solutions.  The main objectives of this research  are: a) to investigate and
              develop a new population-based  optimization technique for MINLP problems, and
              b) to use a  comprehensive model encompassing most, if not all, relevant 
              constraints for the operations scheduling problem.  The new  combinatorial
              optimization technique that we will explore in this  research is a
              decomposition methodology that evaluates a  population of solutions, in
              parallel, for each subproblem of the  over-all problem.  The approach will be
              applied to solve a  comprehensive model of the operations scheduling problem. 
              We  will investigate the complexity and optimality of the proposed  technique.
