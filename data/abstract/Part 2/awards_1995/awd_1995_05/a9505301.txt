Abstract    :
              9505301  Randolph  This project is on research to better understand the
              mechanisms  for polymer-induced protein stabilization in solution during 
              freezing and drying.  The research will focus on the  thermodynamics and
              molecular interactions of polymeric additives  with proteins in aqueous
              solutions, frozen solutions, and dried  solids, and how these interactions
              dictate protein stability.  In  particular this includes: (1) solution
              thermodynamics which  involves phase behavior and protein/polymer preferential 
              interactions; and (2) experimental measurements which include  differential
              scanning calorimetry, electron paramagnetic  resonance spectroscopy (EPR) and
              resolution-enhanced Fourier  transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).  This will
              be used to  determine why polymers work and why they fail as protein 
              stabilizers.  ***
