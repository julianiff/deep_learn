Abstract    :
              9505040  Stern     The proposed research has to do with the Hodge theory of
              singular or noncompact varieties. The investigator proposes to realize the
              intersection cohomology of a projective variety as an explicit complex of
              differential forms equipped with a Hodge filtration. He also proposes to
              construct harmonic automorphic representatives of de Rham cohomology classes of
              locally symmetric spaces.    Varieties are a central object in geometry and
              algebra as they arise as solutions to polynomial equations in various
              dimensions. Intersection cohomology is a way to understand how these varieties
              are situated in space by looking at their various intersection properties.
