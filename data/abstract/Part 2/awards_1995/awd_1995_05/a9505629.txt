Abstract    :
              Sposito  9505629   Simulation methodologies developed recently by the Principal
              Investigator and his coworkers will be applied to perform Monte Carlo (MC) and
              molecular dynamics (MD) calculations of molecular configurations at the
              interface between 2:1 clay minerals and aqueous solution.  Quantum chemical
              calculations of clay mineral molecular structure also will be performed to
              examine the accuracy of the potential functions used in the simulations.  The
              project objectives are:  (1) to perform and evaluate MC and MD simulations of
              hydrated Li+, Na+, K+, Cs2+, and Mg2+-saturated 2:1 clay minerals to deduce the
              configurations, mobilities, and reactivities of adsorbed water molecules and
              counter-ions; (2) to perform ab initio quantum chemical calculations of the
              counter -ion-clay mineral potential energy surface for monovalent and bivalent
              cation-saturated 2:1 clay minerals to improve the accuracy of the MC/MD
              simulations.  The results will be compared with a variety of experimental data,
              and will provide general comparative insights as to the structure of the
              interface between 2:1 clay minerals and aqueous solutions that are relevant to
              low-temperature geochemical weathering processes.
