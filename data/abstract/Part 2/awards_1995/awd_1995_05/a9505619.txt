              last name is Feng    ABSTRACT    NCR-9505619  University of Southwestern
              Louisiana  Generalized Hamming Weights of Algebraic-Geometric Codes and 
              Asymptotically Good Algebraic-Geometric Codes  Gui-Liang Feng, and T.R.N. Rao  
               This research will explore the following problems: (1) to develop a simple 
              and efficient method to determine a lower bound of the generalized Hamming 
              weights of algebraic-geometric (AG) codes, such that the method can also be 
              used to determine the weight hierarchy of a special class of AG codes, for 
              example, Hermitian codes and generalized Hermitian codes, and (2) to 
              investigate the construction of asymptotically good improved AG codes, and 
              improved AG codes that exceed the Gilbert-Varshamov bound for some special 
              finite fields.  A more general approach will be developed to determine the 
              minimum distance bound, which is as good or better than the bound given by  the
              Reiman-Roch theorem (referred to here as the Goppa Bound) or by  counting the
              number of well behaving terms (known as the Feng-Rao bound).  The Feng-Rao
              bound was shown to be superior to the Goppa bound. Based on  this approach the
              principal investigators will develop a lower bound of the  generalized Hamming
              weights. For special classes of AG codes, this method  can be used to determine
              the weight hierarchy. Classes of AG codes with  true minimum distance greater
              than the Goppa and the Feng-Rao bounds will  be constructed which provide good
              code properties for length and minimum  distance.  An attempt will be made to
              prove that these codes are  asymptotica lly good codes.  The problem of finding
              a sequence of AG codes  exceeding the Gilbert-Varshamov bound will be the main
              feature of the  research.
