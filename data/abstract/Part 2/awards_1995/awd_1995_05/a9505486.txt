Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is the development of a general approach to explanation
              generation for  advice-giving systems that use mathematical or other
              quantitative problem-solving methods. Specific  objectives are:  (1)
              Development of a generalized methodology for this type of explanation;  (2) 
              Implementation of this methodology in a prototype system that can be used in
              different applications;  and  (3) Creation of systems for real-life
              environments.  In this approach to explanation generation,  the first task is
              determining the substance of the explanation, that is, discovering which 
              quantitative values contribute to the decision process.  The second task is
              translating the  quantitative values into concepts that are understood by the
              non-technical user.  The significance of  this research lies in the development
              of rigorous methods for performing these tasks: how to represent  the different
              conceptual ``worlds'' of the quantitative system and the lay user; how to
              determine  significant factors for explanation; and how to translate between
              the two worlds.  Practical  implications include the possibility of d eveloping
              explanation generators for `off-the-shelf'  decision support systems used by
              individuals who are not familiar with the formal models.  As a  result, these
              systems would be better accepted and more generally used.
