Abstract    :
              9505833  Milnor     The proposed research covers a wide array of problems in
              dynamical systems: real and complex 1- and 2-dimensional systems, Kleinian
              groups, Hamiltonian systems, and hyperbolic systems are among the topics to be
              pursued.    The field of dynamics is an enormous one, with major contributions
              having been made by scientists from many different disciplines. This reflects
              the fact that it is also a field with important applications to many fields. In
              particular, two-dimensional dynamical systems can be used to model ocean
              dynamics involving shallow water waves.
