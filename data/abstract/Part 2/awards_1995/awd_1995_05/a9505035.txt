Abstract    :
              9505035  Sheaff    This grant provides partial support for U.S. and Eastern
              European  participation in the 1995 International Committee for Future 
              Accelerators (ICFA) School on Instrumentation in Elementary  Particle Physics
              which will take place at the Jozef Stefan  Institute in Ljubljana, Slovenia,
              during July 3-17, 1995.  The  U.S. organizer, Dr. Marleigh Sheaff of the
              University of  Wisconsin-Madison, will work with Dr. Peter Krizan of the Jozef 
              Stefan Institute to prepare a workshop agenda that includes  lecture courses on
              state-of-the-art instrumentation techniques in  experimental elementary
              particle physics.  These lectures will be  augmented by six laboratory courses
              designed to demonstrate the  material presented.  Participants will include
              advanced graduate  level students and recent PHD researchers largely from the
              United  States, Eastern Europe, and Western Europe.  However,  representatives
              from the Americas, China, India and Taiwan will  also attend.  The overall goal
              of this activity is to foster new  links among the up-coming generation of
              world physicists in an  area that increasingly requires international
              cooperation.  ***
