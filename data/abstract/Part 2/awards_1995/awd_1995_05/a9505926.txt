Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at the University of Colorado--Boulder
              in the purchase of a modern  single-crystal diffraction system.  This new
              instrumentation will enhance greatly research in a  number of areas, including
              the following:  (1) transition metal complexes containing quinone  and radical
              semiquinone ligands; (2) role of metal sulfides in carbon-heteroatom and metal 
              sulfur bond cleavage; (3) intramolecular Lewis acids as stereochemical control
              elements; (4)  2,5-Dicarboxy-Stabilized 1,4-Dihydropyrazines as electron donors
              in the synthesis of organic  conductors and magnets; (5) extended skeletally
              stabilized cyclic and linear phosphazanes;  and (6) single crystal x-ray
              structures of molecular rods and connectors.    The x-ray diffractometer is
              used to make accurate and precise measurements of the full three-  dimensional
              structure of a molecule.  The information obtained gives the precise values of
              all  the bond distances and bond angles of a given molecule and it gives
              accurate information about  the spatial arrangement of that molecule relative
              to the neighboring molecules.
