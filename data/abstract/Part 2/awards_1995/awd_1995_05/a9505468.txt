Abstract    :
              This proposal is for equipment only for experiments  investigating interference
              effects in multiphoton ionization  and for (or six) wave mixing in rare gases. 
              It is relevant  to theories of self-induced transparency and to  understanding
              the range of adiabatic theory in short pulse  excitation.
