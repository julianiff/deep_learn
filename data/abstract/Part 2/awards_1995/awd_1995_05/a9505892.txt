Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, George   Ewing
              of Indiana University,  Bloomington, will study the spectroscopy,   dynamics,
              and reactivities of diatomic and polyatomic  molecules adsorbed   on ionic
              insulator surfaces.  Infrared spectroscopic techniques will be   used to 
              explore molecular structures and motions, energy transfer   mechanisms between
              the adlayer and the  substrate, and bonding within the   adlayer and between
              the adlayer and substrate.  Using pulsed  ultraviolet   laser excitation,
              photochemical reactions on the surface will be   initiated and  monitored by
              fluorescence.  Systems to be investigated   include hydrogen, sulfur dioxide,
              and methane  on lithium fluoride, sodium   chloride, and potassium bromide.  A
              major objective of this research is  to influence current theoretical models of
              monolayer photochemistry and   energy transfer, and to  observe and understand
              chemical reactions which   are unique to surface environments.    Surfaces can 
              influence chemical reactions in a variety of ways, including   energy transfer
              to or from the surface,  changing the strength of chemical   bonds, and
              altering the energetics of chemical reactions.  Professor   Ewing's work will
              clarify some of the issues involving energetics and   chemical reactions  on
              relatively inert substrates such as sodium chloride   and potassium bromide.
              The study of these  systems will also contribute to   our theoretical
              understanding of more complex systems.
