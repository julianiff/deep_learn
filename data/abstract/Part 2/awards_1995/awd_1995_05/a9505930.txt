Abstract    :
              9505930  Taylor  This is a comprehensive petrographic and geochemical study of
              eclogite xenoliths from the Siberian platform using a consortium of scientists,
              to establish the compositional and petrographical variation of eclogite
              xenoliths from Siberia.  Major- and trace-element data will be collected on
              minerals by electron and ion microprobe.  Bulk-rock compositions determined by
              x-ray fluorescence and instrumental neutron-activation analysis, and stable
              isotopic data (C and O) will be collected on mineral separates and bulk rocks
              (C isotopic compositions only on diamond).  Radiogenic isotopic data (Sr-Nd-Os)
              will be collected on ultra-pure mineral separates and bulk rocks to evaluate
              the sources from which these samples were derived (e.g., crustal or mantle) and
              the age of these sources by model ages.  Samarium-Nd isochrons from mantle
              xenoliths that are older than their host rock.  Finally, a unique opportunity
              has presented itself in the form of five pairs of garnet-clinopyroxene
              inclusions which are hosted by diamonds and which, in turn, are hosted by
              eclogite modules from the Mir and Udachnaya pipes.  A trace- and major -element
              study involving these paired inclusions and comparing them to the host
              eclogites is paramount to our understanding of eclogite and diamond formation
              and possible later metasomatism of the host.  This study will be the first
              comprehensive detailed study of eclogite xenoliths from a northern hemisphere
              Archean-aged crustal segment.
