Abstract    :
              9505425  Kane  This grant provides support for a theoretical research  program
              to investigate electronic transport in mesoscopic  systems.  The research will
              explore the interplay between  quantum confinement, electron-electron
              interactions and  transport in ultra-small electronic systems.  A deeper 
              understanding of these issues will lead to a better  appreciation of the
              limitations and opportunities available  in microstructure electronic devices. 
              In addition to  addressing fundamental issues of physics, the research is 
              important technologically, as the miniaturization of  electronic devices
              approaches the nanoscale level and  continues, perhaps, down to the molecular
              level.  The  specific objectives of the research will be (1) to  investigate
              the role of the Coulomb blockade for tunneling  through metal and semiconductor
              quantum dots in the regime  of strong coupling to leads; (2) to understand the
              effects  of disorder on interacting one-dimensional systems and edge  states in
              the quantum Hall effect; and (3) to study the  nature of electronic transport
              through molecules, which is  an issue of crucial importance to the emerging
              field of  molecular electronics as well as to the imaging of molecules  on
              surfaces using the scanning tunneling microscope.  %%%  Theoretical research
              will be conducted on the electronic  properties of very small systems in which
              the system size is  comparable to the scale of the electronic effects.  Besides
               being of fundamental importance in physics, these studies  are crucial to
              understanding the limits and opportunities in  reducing the size of
              microelectronic devices.  ***
