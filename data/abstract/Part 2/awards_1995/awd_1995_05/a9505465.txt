Abstract    :
                  The focus of this research is the application to organic synthesis of
              organosilicon compounds  which utilize more than one of the bonds to silicon,
              especially organosilicon compounds with  a protected internal nucleophile.  The
              scope, as well as the potential use of rearrangement and  cleavage reactions
              induced by a gamma-oxidopropyl group on silicon will be investigated, 
              especially possible applications to asymmetric synthesis.  The effect of
              silicon groups, compared  to hydrogen, on the reactivity of ring opening
              reactions of expoxides will be studied.    With this award, the Synthetic
              Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Paul F. and  Anne M. Hudrlick
              of the Department of Chemistry at Howard University.  The Hudrliks will  focus
              their work on the utility of organosilicon compounds as intermediates in
              organic synthesis  to develop new reactions of general applicability.
