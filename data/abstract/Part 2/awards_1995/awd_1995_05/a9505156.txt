Abstract    :
              To carry on effective, natural, spoken dialogue,computers will need to do more
              than recognize and interpret  spoken words -- they will also need to be
              sensitive to the prosodic information encoded in how the words are spoken.  To
              investigate the hypothesis that detecting and exploiting prosodic cues can help
              computers guide spoken dialogue, this case study focuses on an educational task
              that combines intrinsic national importance with compelling methodological
              advantages:  listening to a child read aloud, and providing spoken assistance. 
              The research focusses on improving four aspects of dialogue -- taking turns,
              handling speech repairs, preventing dialogue breakdown, and modelling the
              speaker.  In the reading task, these aspects include detecting a number of
              pedagogically significant events, such as when readers complete a passage,
              correct themselves, or encounter difficulty in identifying a word or
              comprehending a passage.  The goal is to use prosodic cues to help detect these
              events in order to make the dialogue between student and computer more
              effective in achieving its educational objectives .  Expected outcomes include
              improvements in the automated reading assistant, the discovery of robust
              prosodic  phenomena, methods for detecting them, and principles for using them
              to achieve graceful,  effective spoken dialogue  between humans and computers.
