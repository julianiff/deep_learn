Abstract    :
              9505416  Pierce      This proposal describes several experiments designed to
              understand the mechanism(s) that are used by the cells of the marine slug,
              Elysia chlorotica, to capture chloroplasts from the marine alga, Vaucheria
              litorea, and keep the plastids photosynthetically active within the animal cell
              for periods as long as 8 months after capture.  The photosynthesis requires
              that certain chloroplast proteins be continually replaced.  The genetic
              information for the synthesis of some of those proteins is contained within the
              chloroplast, but for other of the proteins is normally supplied by the plant
              nucleus.  The experiments, which will use radiolabelling and gel
              electrophoresis techniques, will indicate which of the chloroplast proteins are
              synthesized while the plastid is within the animal cell.  Using pharmacological
              agents, the site (chloroplast or animal nucleus) of the genetic information for
              the synthesized proteins will be determined.  Antibody labelling will be used
              to identify the synthesized proteins.  The results will begin to provide
              information leading to understanding how the animal cell maintains within it a
              completely foreign structure (chloroplast) in a functional condition.  ***
