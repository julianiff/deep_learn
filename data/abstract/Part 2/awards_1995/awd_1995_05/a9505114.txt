              of Markov Chain Monte Carlo             for Bayesian Inference       Abstract: 
                The proposed research develops flexible prior distributions  for Bayesian
              inference for spatial systems.  From the modeling  standpoint, spatial priors
              that are mixtures over simple  Markov random fields (MRF's) are developed in
              two distinct  contexts.  In the first, mixtures will be constructed to allow 
              robust inference when anomalies, and heterogeneity  are present in the spatial
              process.  In the second context, mixtures over different scales  will be
              considered, so that the scale of the MRF can  be rigorously treated as a
              parameter when making inference.  Only very recent advances in Markov chain 
              Monte Carlo (MCMC) make inference from such models possible.  Applications in
              agriculture, imaging and environmental monitoring  will be considered.    The
              proposed research will develop statistical methodologies for  analyzing spatial
              data which combines information at various scales.    Development of spatial
              models suitable for agriculture,  imaging (eg. remote sensing and medical
              imaging), environmental  monitoring and assessing environmental trends are main
              goals  of this research.  Current statistical methods typically require 
              restrictive assumptions which often make formal analyses   in these areas
              difficult or impossible.  This methodology will relax these  assumptions.  A
              primary motivation for combining information from various   scales is for
              dealing with geographical information systems used  for environmental
              monitoring.  Such systems invariably contain data   at varying scales which can
              be incorporated in the analysis.
