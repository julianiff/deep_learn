Abstract    :
              9505485  Keen     The proposed conference is in the area of complex analysis.
              The planned conference inaugurates a series of conferences, The Bers
              Colloquium, to be held triannually, whose theme will be a topic in the
              Ahlfors-Bers mathematical tradition. Lars Ahlfors and Lipman Bers have worked
              on value distribution theory, Teichmuller space, complex dynamics, and other
              areas of function theory; have had a significant impact on the modern
              development of one variable complex function theory.    Ahlfors and Bers can be
              regarded as founding members of the modern theory of functions of one complex
              variable, and the proposed conference is a celebration of their mathematical
              heritage.
