Abstract    :
              9505744  Anderson     The proposed research covers two areas, Riemannian
              geometry and complex differential geometry. It is proposed to classify compact
              Riemannian manifolds which are extrema of the quadratic Riemmanian functional.
              In addition, quaternionic Kahler manifolds and extremal Kahler metrics are to
              be investigated.    Riemannian manifolds are higher dimensional generalizations
              of curved surfaces. They are abstract objects in that they exist on their own
              rather than in an ambient space. Kahler manifolds are complex analogs of
              Riemannian manifolds: just as the study of complex functions provides insights
              into real functions, the study of Kahler manifolds often reveal unexpected
              features of Riemannain manifolds.
