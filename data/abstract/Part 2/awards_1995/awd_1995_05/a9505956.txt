Abstract    :
              This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program, targets the  development of direct amperometric affinity electrodes
              for application as immunosensors and  DNA probes.  These devices will expand
              the newly created class of biosensors based on "wired"  redox macromolecules. 
              In these amperometric sensors, substrates selectively undergo electron 
              transfer with redox proteins which in turn undergo electron exchange with
              amperometric  electrodes.  "Wiring" of redox processes is accomplished through
              immobilization of enzymes  at electrodes in an imidazole-substituted
              polyacrylamide hydrogel containing coordinated osmium  wherein substrate
              analytes are afforded easy access to enzyme sites, and electron exchange 
              between enzyme and electrode is mediated  by the redox polymer.  Increased
              analytical  sensitivity derives from the use of both high-turnover enzymes and
              highly efficient mediation  of electron exchange between enzyme and electrode. 
              Specific goals to be pursued by Professor  Heller and his students during the
              tenure of this three-year grant include bringing electrochemical  DNA sensing
              to a level of sensitivity that will obviate the need for polymerase chain
              reaction  (PCR) amplification of the probed sequence, and surpassing the speed
              of present PCR  methodology through enhanced mass transport in the hydrogel of
              the amperometric biosensor.    The development of more rapid, sensitive, and
              selective techniques for detecting and quantifying  biomolecules is broadly
              important to fundamental disciplinary and technological advances.   Through
              synergistic combination of fundamentals of biochemistry, biophysics, materials 
              chemistry, inorganic chemistry, and electrochemistry, new biosensors will be
              developed which  have selectivity and sensitivity characteristics that exceed
              current methodology.
