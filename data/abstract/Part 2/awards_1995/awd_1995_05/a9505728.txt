Abstract    :
              9505728  Damuth    The PIs will map mass flow deposits in the upper 1.0 sec
              record of  sediments on the US continental rise between Blake Ridge and New 
              England seamounts. Single and multi-channel seismic profiles in  existence will
              be used to map vertical extend of mass flows. 3.5  kHz records will also be
              examined. Buried canyons will also be  mapped. Armed with improved awareness of
              the seismic expression of  mass-flow deposits, the PIs intend to extend their
              volumetric  measures of down-slope transport to the rise back to the Neogene 
              time.
