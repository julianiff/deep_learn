Abstract    :
                This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at George Washington University in the
              purchase of an Inductively  Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS).  This
              equipment will be used in the following  areas of research:  (1) investigation
              of novel high-temperature helium plasmas and new  nebulization systems used in
              analytical spectrometry for elemental analysis; (2) investigation  of
              matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry for the detection
              of bio-  organic trace materials; (3) determination of the current quality and
              quantity of ground  water in the District of Columbia, and to develop plans to
              contain discharges of pollutants  from point and non-point sources; (4)
              measurement of the concentrations  and isotopic  ratios of metals in biological
              samples; (5) detection of metal pollutants in samples from the  aquaculture
              development areas in order to find the path of metals to humans through the 
              food fish; isotopic ratios in near-surface samples; and (6) development of
              validated  methodologies for analysis of forensic samples.    Inductive Coupled
              Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) is a high temperature technique which  uses
              the discharge generated by inducing a magnet field in a flowing conducting gas
              to determine  the elemental composition of a material.  The technique has
              remarkable selective and sensitivities  that allows analytical chemical
              determination of ground water pollutants landfill leachates, trace  metals,
              forensic material and biological material.
