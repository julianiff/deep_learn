Abstract    :
              This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) will allow  the investigator to
              pursue the use of data-parallel  computers to determine the intons and exons in
              DNA  sequences.  In particular, the main tasks of this award  include the use
              of an intermediate representation of DNA,  the directed acyclic graph, to
              perform parallel parses to  recognize more complex DNA subsequences.  The
              investigator  will begin collaborations with biologists to complete the 
              exploration.  This award is jointly funded by the  Computational Biology
              Activity and the Theory of Computing  programs.
