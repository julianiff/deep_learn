Abstract    :
              9505067  Yeung     The proposed research lies in complex differential geometry.
              The investigator seeks to prove that the complement of a generic hyperplane of
              sufficiently high degree in projective space is hyperbolic. This is a natural
              extension of the classical Picard theorem in function theory; was proved in
              dimension two recently by Yeung and Siu.    Many problems in the theory of
              complex hyperbolic manifolds can be viewed as value distribution problems, and
              as such they relate also to diophantine approximation theory. Diophantine
              approximations are an important subarea of number theory dealing with integer
              equations; mathematicians have recently uncovered a deep and unexpected
              relation between diophantine equations and complex analytic geometry.
