Abstract    :
              9505544  Haskell      The International Junior Investigator and Postdoctoral 
              Fellows Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to  conduct three to
              twenty-four months of research abroad. The  program's awards provide
              opportunities for joint research,  and the use of unique or complementary
              facilities, expertise  and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will
              support a ten-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Deirdre Haskell to work
              with Dr. Zoe Maria  Chatzidakis at the University of Paris.  This research
              concerns topics in the model theory of p-adic  fields.  Dr. Haskell wants to
              undertake two projects.  The  first concerns the model theory of algebraically
              closed  fields with an automorphism.  The second concerns the recent  proof by
              A. Wilkie of the model-completeness of real closed  fields with exponentiation.
               Dr. Haskell would pursue  analogues of their results for formal power series
              over  valued fields. ***
