              NCR-9505443  University of Wisconsin-Madison  Blind Simulation and Regenerative
              Processes  James A. Bucklew and Peter E. Ney      Importance sampling is used
              to speed up Monte Carlo simulation of rare  events.  The methods used to date
              have required exact knowledge of the  underlying probability structure of the
              system being simulated. Direct  Monte Carlo simulation requires only an
              assumption of ergodicity to  guarantee that relative frequency estimates of
              system parameters will  converge to true values.  The direct Monte Carlo
              technique is an example of  a blind simulation technique: a generic class of
              methodologies which  bootstrap their way without exact knowledge of the
              underlying probability  law.  Some partial results achieved to date indicate
              that in  many  interesting situations, blind techniques can perform just about
              as well as  those utilizing much more prior information.  Applied to systems
              with  memory (Markovian for example) these techniques lead naturally to the
              study  of regenerative processes.  These are processes that at random times
              stop  and essentially start themselves over again.  Aspects of the theory of 
              these processes are yet to be developed and are needed for the analysis of 
              blind simulation methods.  This study of blind simulation and regenerative 
              processes promises to very important in the bag of tricks available to  system
              simulators.
