              9505980 Chang    Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation reactions are important for
              mediating cell response to environmental signals and  regulating  various
              cellular functions.  This grant is examining the role of  phosphorylation in
              yeast, specifically the plasma membrane (H+( encoded by the PMA1 gene, which
              has a critical physiological role and is essential for cell viability.  The
              activity of Pma1 (the protein encoded by this gene), is altered by
              environmental factors including glucose metabolism.  This investigator has
              shown that Pma1 activation  which occurs in response to glucose in the medium,
              is  mediated by site-specific dephosphorylation  which occurs at the plasma
              membrane.   During its transit through the secretory path, Pma1 is
              constitutively phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues.    This
              investigator will identify the specific kinases that interact with specific
              domains of Pma1, using the yeast 2 hybrid system and peptide microsequencing of
              proteins that co-immunoprecipitate with Pma1.  Mutants defective for glucose
              mediated a activation will be used to identify the gluc ose regulated
              phosphorylation sites.   %%%  These experiments will elucidate the signal
              transduction mechanisms which are used by yeast to respond to environmental
              changes and to fulfill physiological needs.   They will also provide
              information on phosphorylation in signal transduction and regulation. ***
