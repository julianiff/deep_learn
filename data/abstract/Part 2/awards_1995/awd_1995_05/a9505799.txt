Abstract    :
              9505799  Tanner       The Department of Statistics at Northwestern University
              will  purchase an HP PA-RISC 7200 high-end server, three HP-PA 715/100 
              workstations and appropriate statistical software (SPLUS and IMSL)  which will
              be dedicated to the support of the project "Instrumentation  for Parametric and
              Semiparametric Modeling of Continuous and Discrete  Data". The equipment will
              be used to address the computing needs of  several interactive research
              projects: "Likelihood-Based Estimation in  Semiparametric Models" (Project PI:
              Tom Severini), "Conditional  Log-linear Models for Longitudinal Studies"
              (Project PI: Shelby  Haberman), "Bayesian Learning in Mixtures-of-Experts and
              Hierarchical  Mixtures-of-Experts Architectures" (Project PI: Martin A. Tanner)
              and  "NonLinear Partial Least Squares Using Neural Networks" (Project PI:  Ajit
              C. Tamhane).
