Abstract    :
              Under this award, Dr. Betts will pursue a wide range of problems  involving
              primarily the thermodynamics of atmospheric energy and  water interactions from
              the surface through the troposphere, in  support of programs such as the Global
              Energy and Water Cycle  Experiment Continental-Scale International Project
              (GCIP) and the  Boreal Forest Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS).  The
              overarching  objective is to improve the surface boundary condition over land
              in  large-scale models.  At present, forecast and climate models have  serious
              deficiencies in their physical parameterizations,  particularly in the modeling
              of energy and water transports at the  earth's surface (more so over land than
              over the ocean), and in the  coupling of convective processes to the
              large-scale dynamic and  radiation fields.  The principal investigator will
              tackle these  issues by first analyzing observations from several field
              programs  and then using them to test and develop physical parameterizations 
              in large-scale models.  Operational forecast models will be used  primarily so
              that the research directly benefits the forecasting of  weather on timescales
              of a few days, as well as the global model  data bases, which are used for
              climate studies.  This research is  supported under NSF's Water and Energy: 
              Atmospheric, Vegetative,  and Earth Interactions (WEAVE) Program.***
