Abstract    :
              9505174  Lawson     The proposed research lies at the interface of algebraic
              geometry and algebraic topology. A principal goal is to further develop the
              theory of algebraic cycles on projective varieties: this theory, largely
              founded by Lawson, seeks to understand projective varieties from a topological
              standpoint, and can be considered as a generalization of the theory of schemes.
                 An algebraic variety is defined as the common zero set of a collection of
              homogeneous polynomials in several variables; algebraic geometry is the study
              of algebraic varieties (or what is the same, homogeneous polynomial equations
              in several complex variables). The proposed research has to do with applying
              topological tools to study various subsets of algebraic varieties.
