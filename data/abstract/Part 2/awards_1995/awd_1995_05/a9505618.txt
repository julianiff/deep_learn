Abstract    :
                 9505618 Lapeyre  This project will use synchrotron radiation photoemission
              spectroscopy and other electron spectroscopies to study the structure and
              electronic properties of overlayers on semiconductor surfaces.  Emphasis will
              be given to the performance of photoelectron diffraction experiments where
              scanned energy spectra can be inverted to obtain three dimensional images of
              the photoemitting atom and its near neighbors.  The inversion is a Fourier-like
              transform based on the holographic principle and does not require any external
              input to obtain an image.  The technique has been demonstrated on various
              systems including Al, Ga, As and Se on Si surfaces.  Of particular interest for
              future investigations are structural changes that influence the nature of
              growth--both homo- and hetero-epitaxy--at semiconductor surfaces and the
              electronic properties of surfaces.  Photoemission holography will be applied to
              structure determination of systems composed of various adsorbates on Si, GaAs,
              and ZnSe.  Two new applications of the holographic technique will be developed:
              a) a single adsorbate on a compound semiconductor substrate, and b)multiple
              adsorbates on an elemental semiconductor substrate. %%% A new atomic-level
              materials characterization technique, photoemisson holography, is being
              developed and applied to basic synthesis and processing research studies of
              materials with strong technological relevance to electronics and
              optoelectronics.  An important feature of the program is the training of
              students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area of materials
              research. ***
