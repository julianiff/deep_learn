Abstract    :
              9505153  Martin       Martin will work in set theory and descriptive set theory,
              especially  determinacy hypotheses, and his first goal is to complete his
              long-awaited   research monograph on proofs of determinacy from large cardinal
              axioms.   Steel will also work generally in set theory and descriptive set
              theory,   and more specifically on the construction and study of canonical,
              inner   models of ZFC that satisfy specified large cardinal or determinacy  
              assumptions.  Moschovakis will work on fixpoint recursion and its  
              applications to the theory of computation, including the mathematical  
              modeling of recursive algorithms, the logic of recursive definitions, and   the
              construction of canonical solutions for recursive equations in  
              non-deterministic and concurrent settings.       The Principal Investigators of
              this Grant have been among the key  contributors to the reshaping of the
              classical, set-theoretic foundations of   mathematics during the last
              twenty-five years, with the introduction and   study of new hypotheses about
              sets that have made it possible to solve many   long-standing, open problems
              about the real numbers.  Martin and Steel will   continue working on this
              fundamental program, seeking to extend it and to   delineate its limitations. 
              Moschovakis changed interests about ten years   ago, and his current research
              program aims to provide a rigorous,   mathematical foundation for computer
              science.  One of the main, ultimate aims   of his work is to construct a "logic
              of programs" that will be useful in   the development and verification of
              computing systems.  ***
