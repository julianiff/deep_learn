Abstract    :
              9505982  Ruiz  This proposal intends to evaluate the use of ICPMS and LA-ICPMS
              for the determination of trace elements, including rare earth elements (REE) in
              fluid inclusions.  Preliminary data shown in this proposal suggest that the
              bulk leachate analyses of well characterized samples are useful and also
              indicate that it is possible to analyze single fluid inclusions by LA-ICPMS. 
              perfecting these techniques may allow us to directly analyze fluids from
              various stages of hydrothermal systems which in turn will further our
              understanding of the transport of metals in ore-forming fluids.  We will
              accomplish three main goals during this study:  (1) fully develop the
              crush-leach ICPMS for analyzing bulk inclusions for REE and other
              petrologically and economically important trace metals, (2) evaluate the full
              potential of LA-ICPMS for the study of single fluid inclusions, (3) conduct a
              detailed ICPMS study on bulk fluid inclusions and LA-ICPMS study on single
              fluid inclusions from the Bingham, base metal porphyry system in order to
              determine which fluids carried the bulk of the metals in this system.  Bingham
              was chosen because it is very well studied and contains large inclusions in
              quartz.  Studies as the one proposed here are needed to constrain current
              debates on sources of metals in deposits associated with silicic magma systems.
