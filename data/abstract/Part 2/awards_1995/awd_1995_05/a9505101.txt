Abstract    :
              9505101  Meeks     A variety of problems in differential geometry and topology
              of minimal and constant mean curvature surfaces are proposed. Total Gaussian
              curvature results as well as topological obstruction results will be sought for
              complete minimal surfaces of finite total curvature. For infinite total
              curvature minimal surfaces, topological uniqueness, growth estimates and the
              index theory will be examined. Global properties of constant mean curvature
              surfaces will be studied. Computer graphics and (period) computations for some
              of these surfaces will also be pursued.    Minimal surfaces and constant mean
              curvature surfaces were first systematically investigated by the Belgian
              physicist Plateau in his famous soap film experiments. These surfaces model
              physical surfaces where either the surface area is minimized by surface tension
              or in the case of a stable interface between two materials. In recent years,
              periodic minimal surfaces are used to model condensed matter on a molecular
              scale.
