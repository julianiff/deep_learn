Abstract    :
              9505511  Li  Research equipment will be purchased for use in multiple research
              projects including: failure models for polyimide thin films, interfacial
              degradation in epoxy-resin laminates used in MCM-L; adhesion of polymer films
              to metal, ceramic and semiconductor substrates; materials characterization for
              the design of high level packaging assemblies; physical failures in plastic
              packaged microelectronics; and advanced packaging materials metrology.  ***
