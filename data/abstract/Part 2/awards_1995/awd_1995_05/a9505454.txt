Abstract    :
              9505454  Bisesi  This is an award to support exploratory research on the
              potential  for enhancement of biological processes for degradation of 
              petroleum hydrocarbons present in soil that has been polluted by  these
              substances.  In this research, soil contaminated with the  target hydrocarbons
              will be innoculated with earthworm species,  selected for their enzymatic
              pathways known to accelerate  transformation of organic compounds, and with
              soil microorganisms  that contain enzymes known to catalyze the degradation of
              toxic  organic compounds.  The investigator plans on studying the  influence of
              extracellular enzymes produced by microorganisms and  soil characteristics that
              affect the process by which organic  soil contaminants derived from petroleum
              may be transformed into  substances of lesser or no pollutional significance.  
               The proposal leading to this award was submitted to NSF under the  Special
              Guidelines for an SGER (Small Grant for Exploratory  Research) in the NSF Grant
              Proposal Guide (NSF 94-2).  Results of  this research are expected to provide
              the basis for further  research on the potential for biologically augmenting
              and  enhancing the decontamination of soil that has been polluted by  gasoline,
              lubricating oil and diesel fuel that has leaked from  underground storage tanks
              or otherwise entered soil where the  hydrocarbons pose a potential for
              contaminating groundwater.  ***
