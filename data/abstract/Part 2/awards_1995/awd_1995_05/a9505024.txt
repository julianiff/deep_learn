Abstract    :
              9605024  Dwyer       The project touches on several areas in topology.  One of
              its  goals is to express some classical index theorems, especially those 
              involving the Euler and signature operators, as homotopy theoretic  statements,
              and then to study the higher-order information provided  by this
              reinterpretation.  The researchers are also investigating  geometric questions
              about surfaces in four-dimensional manifolds,  as well as algebraic issues
              surrounding the action of permutation  groups on the homology of configuration
              spaces.  Finally, they are  working towards a classification of p-compact
              groups (i.e.  "homotopy Lie groups") as well as towards a more complete 
              understanding of how topology and number theory are mixed together  by the
              constructions of algebraic K-theory.       The general theme of the project is
              the study of some  remarkable and exciting connections between geometry (the
              science  of topological spaces, that is, of higher-dimensional shapes) and 
              algebra (the science of equations and numbers).  The connections go  both ways.
               For instance, deciding whether or not it is possible to  use the methods of
              calculus on a particular topological space turns  out to involve solving some
              fairly subtle equations.  On the other  hand, the collection of all solutions
              to an equation can often be  assembled in one way or another into a topological
              space.  The  investigators are looking at some particular aspects of the 
              interplay between geometry and algebra, and they expect that taking  a dual
              point of view will lead to major advances in both areas.  ***
