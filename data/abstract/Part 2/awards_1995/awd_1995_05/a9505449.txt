Abstract    :
              The PI will study the phenomenon of mesospheric clouds, their  atmospheric
              environment, and their role in middle atmospheric  global change.  The PI will
              combine (1) data analysis of existing  data gathered by spacecraft, rockets and
              ground-based radar; and  (2) theoretical modeling of the microphysics of
              mesospheric ice  particle evolution, and of the atmospheric environment,
              including  coupled dynamics, radiation, and photochemistry of the mesosphere 
              and lower thermosphere.  The research will increase understanding  of physical
              processes occurring in the upper mesosphere, an  atmospheric region which is
              still poorly understood because of its  complexity and inaccessibility.***
