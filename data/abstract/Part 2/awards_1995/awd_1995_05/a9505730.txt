Abstract    :
              9505730  STEPHEN    This renewal award supports development of instrumentation
              for  deploying seismometers in the deep ocean at a hole (OSN-1) drilled  by the
              Ocean Drilling Program near the island of Hawaii.  The  overall objective is to
              enable measurement of seismic activity  accurately and over long periods at
              ocean bottom sites, to fill  major gaps in recording worldwide earthquake
              activity which is  primarily limited to land measurements.  With their previous
              award,  these Woods Hole Oceanographic Investigators, in collaboration with 
              colleagues at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, have prepared  and tested
              (in a test well on land) a seismograph system suitable  for installation in a
              borehole.  In the present work they will  prepare a suitable housing for the
              seismometer to withstand deep-  ocean pressures, and will design and build
              equipment to install the  seismograph and data recording package in the ocean
              bottom borehole  from a ship at the sea surface.
