Abstract    :
              9505149  Fornaess     The proposed research lies in the area of several complex
              variables. Complex dynamical systems in several variables - this is a new area
              of research founded by the proposer and his coworkers - will be pursued:
              iteration of holomorphic maps, holomorphic flows, and holomorphic hulls are
              among the topics of study in this area. The Cauchy-Riemann operator in singular
              spaces and the boundary regularity of holomorphic mappings will also be
              investigated.    Complex dynamical systems generalize real dynamical systems
              arising from autonomous systems of ordinary differential equations. Real
              dynamical systems are widely used to model natural phenomena including fluid
              flow, planetary motion, and ecological systems. Complex dynamical systems,
              which are relatively recent constructs, have already found applications in
              fractal geometry.
