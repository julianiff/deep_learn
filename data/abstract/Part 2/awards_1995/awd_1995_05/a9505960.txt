Abstract    :
              TITLE: and MIMD/SIMD Architectures    Parallel computing applications differ
              widely in the type of  computational paradigm that is best suited to
              efficiently  exploit their  parallelism.  Current software systems for 
              parallel hardware support only  single-paradigm computing.  The objective of
              this research project is to  investigate  system-level support for efficient
              multiparadigm parallel  computation.  Previous work on coordination languages
              and  multiparadigm  sequential programming languages form a solid  foundation
              for this research,  although significant new ideas  are required.  Although
              current high-performance  computer  architectures are moving toward a combined
              MIMD/SIMD  organization,  very little software and system support exists  for
              such hybrid computer  architectures. This research will  thus also focus on
              aspects of multiparadigm  computing for  massively parallel SIMD and MIMD/SIMD
              machines, including  the  Rewrite-Rule Machine as a testbed architecture.  The 
              research results will  enable future systems designers to  better appreciate
              the engineering trade-offs  to efficiently  support multiparadigm computing in
              a parallel environment.  The  results of this research are expected to enhance
              the  future programming ease of  high-performance massively  parallel computing
              systems.
