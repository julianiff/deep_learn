Abstract    :
              9505059  Bott     The proposed research covers various topics from differential
              topology, algebraic geometry and number theory: the topics include knots,
              smooth manifolds, and symplectic geometry.     Differential topology deals with
              the existence and uniqueness of differentiable structures on a (topological)
              space - a differentiable structure on a space enables one to do calculus on the
              space. Interestingly enough, recent advances in theoretical particle physics
              are fueling much of the exciting developments in this area of pure mathematics.
