Abstract    :
              9505801  Knopoff    This grant is to provide partial support for a two-day
              colloquium entitled "Earthquake Prediction: The Scientific Challenge" jointly
              sponsored by National Science Foundation and the National Academy of Sciences. 
              It will be held February 10-11, 1995, in Irvine, California.  The colloquium
              will present what has been learned scientifically concerning earthquake
              prediction in the approximately 20 years of the U.S. National program; programs
              in other nations began at similar times.  It is anticipated that the
              proceedings will identify the major unsolved problems.  Broad areas of
              concentration include the phenomenology of precursory seismicity, the
              phenomenology of non-seismic precursors, laboratory information and physics of
              the seismic source.  This research is a component of the National Earthquake
              Hazard Reduction Program.  ***  ??
