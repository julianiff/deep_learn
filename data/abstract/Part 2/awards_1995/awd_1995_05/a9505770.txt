Abstract    :
              9505770  Haggerty  The primary objective is to test the Core/Mantle
              Boundary-plume origin by studying the geochemistry and mineralogy of
              kimberlites and entrained xeonoliths.  Theoretical, experimental, and
              geochemical templates will be applied to identify the various components that
              have been sampled along the 2900 km conduit.  One section of the conduit,
              between 410 and 660 km (the transition zone, TZ), is of particular interest
              because the boundaries are marked by dense mineral phase transitions, deep
              focus earthquakes, high pressure minerals capable of water retention, and a
              layer that may harbor the accumulation of subducted ocean floor basaltic slabs.
               A second objective is to place limits on the extent of chemical heterogeneity,
              and to describe the geology of the TZ.  This will be done through a mineral and
              geochemical study of ultradeep xenoliths, eclogites (high pressure basalt), and
              xenoliths modified by fluidal melt processes (metasomites).  A third objective
              is to study an unusual form of diamond known as carbonado, which is sintered
              but also porous.  Resolving the origin of carbonado will have geological
              implications and technological applications.  These studies will be undertaken
              on rocks from South Africa, Botswana, and Sierra Leone, and on carbonado from
              Brazil.  Standard techniques with  state-of-the-art instruments, will be
              applied to the study in laboratories at the University of Massachusetts, and in
              collaboration with other institutes.
