Abstract    :
              This NSF-CONACyT Collaborative research project concentrates on analyzing
              wait-free  synchronous distributed systems.  In particular, techniques from the
              abstract mathematical area of  simplicial algebraic topology are applied as a
              powerful combinatorial tool. Specifically, as modern  parallel and distributed
              systems scale up, there is an increasing need for algorithms and data 
              structures to tolerate delays and failures.  A data object or algorithm is
              wait-free if it guarantees  that any process can execute any operation within a
              fixed number of steps, independent of the level of  contention and the
              execution speeds of the other processes.  The goal of this project is to work 
              toward a comprehensive theory of wait-free synchronization.  In the past few
              years, a number of  researchers have developed powerful new tools, based on
              classical algebraic topology, for analyzing  wait-free algorithms and data
              structures in a variety of models.  These new techniques are used in 
              developing a comprehensive theory of multiprocessor synchronization.  The need
              for such a theory has  become compelling as tec hnological advances have made
              concurrent and distributed platforms readily  available.  The topological
              approach to these problems may represent a powerful new combinatorial tool  for
              Computer Science, not just for distributed computing, as for any problem area
              that requires  reasoning about uncertainty and partial information.
