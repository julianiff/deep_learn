Abstract    :
                This award, under the U.S.-Mexico CONACyT Initiative, is concerned  with an
              in-depth scientific understanding of the nature of the  relationship between
              mobile robotic agents and their environment.   The research addresses the
              agent-environment relationship directly  using schema theory and
              neurophysiological and ethological models  to ultimately provide credible,
              generalizable, and useful results  in this domain.  These systems will
              ultimately be grounded in both  simulations and actual robotic hardware.  An
              in-depth understanding  and dynamic modeling of the relationship a robot has
              with its  environment (i.e., the overall ecology) is important to ensure that 
              fielded robotic systems don't compete inappropriately with other  agents that
              can do the task more effectively (and by competing,  reduce their usefuless);
              that the robots are successful competitors  within the ecological system and
              can potentially displace less  efficient agents; and that they are ecologically
              sensitive so that  agent-environmental system dynamics are well-modeled and as 
              predictable as possible whenever new robotic technology is  introduced.  The
              research efforts will be tied together through the  use of software tools
              already in existence or under development at  both sites, including NSL, a
              neural simulation language; ASL, an  abstract schema language; and MissionLab,
              a schema-based  mission-oriented simulation and robot implementation
              environment.
