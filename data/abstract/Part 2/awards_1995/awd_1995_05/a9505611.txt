Abstract    :
                This meeting, Columbia University Theory Days, is a meeting which  has been
              held twice per year, once in the fall and once in the spring, for  the past
              twelve years.  This continuing conference attracts 150 -- 200   researchers,
              mostly from the Metropolitan New York City Area.  Each theory  day consists of
              four one-hour invited talks, with scheduled discussion session  after each
              talk.  There are two primary goals which have been accomplished   by the
              previous twenty-four theory days: (1) The opportunity for theoretical  
              computer scientists to meet and exchange ideas; (2) Permit those researchers  
              in allied  areas to learn of new theoretical results and to encourage  
              theoreticians to help solve problems in these applied areas.  The mailing  list
              contains more than 700 names of scientists, students and computer 
              professionals with an interest in theory.  The speakers of the first  
              twenty-four theory days included such theoreticians as A. Shamir, S. Micali, 
              M. O. Rabin, R. Karp, A. R. Meyers, J. D. Ullman, C. Papadimitriou, N. Lynch, 
              S. Goldwasser, S. R. Kosaraju and J. Feigenbaum.  The Department of Computer 
              Science at Columbia University covered the expense of the first five years, 
              and the department together with the National Science Foundation covered  the
              expense of the following seven years.  The National Science Foundation  is
              providing partial support for the next six Theory Days.
