Abstract    :
              American industrial and living standard dominance has eroded  away since 1950. 
              This fact implies economic convergence as  evidenced by the catching up of
              Japan, Germany, and now a number  of newly emerging economies.  Until recently,
              economists paid  very little attention to the contribution which the
              globalization  forces of trade, migration, and international investment have 
              made to this convergence.  Furthermore, they typically limited  their
              convergence measures to GDP per worker-hour, while  excluding factor prices
              like wages and land rents.  This project  seeks to repair those shortcomings.  
               There have been two golden ages of convergence for the OECD  countries:
              1850-1914 and 1950-1994.  Previous NSF funded research  by the principal
              investigator has shown that the globalization  forces of mass migration and
              trade caused most the convergence up  to 1914.  It was also shown that
              convergence stopped between 1914  and 1950, while America fended off the
              challengers.  The purpose  of this project is to determine why convergence
              stopped during  those four decades when the pre-1914 open world economy
              imploded  into autarky.  In particular, what role did policy restrictions  on
              trade and migration play?  The findings should help guide any  effort to assess
              the contribution to convergence which the  retreat from autarky and the advance
              to global integration has  made since 1950.  It will also help identify the
              forces of de-  globalization which seem to be lurking on the horizon of the
              next  century.
