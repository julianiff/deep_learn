Abstract    :
              EAR-9505215  Lassiter, John C.    Re-Os isotopic data from a suite of cogenetic
              basalts from Hawaii will be used to improve understanding of the behavior of Re
              and Os during melting of the mantle and melt transport through the crust. 
              Because of the analytical difficulties in measuring Re and Os abundances in
              very low-concentration materials, it is only in the past few years that it has
              been possible to consider application of Re-Os systematics to problems of
              mantle convection and crustal evolution.  Unlike other isotopic systems
              currently used to address these fundamental problems, Os behaves compatibly
              during melting.  As a result, 187Os/186Os ratios are extremely sensitive to
              relative contributions of evolved and primitive materials.    This project will
              (1) constrain the chemical behavior of Os (and Re) during melt production; (2)
              document the interaction of melts with the surrounding mantle and crust during
              transport to the surface; and (3) determine the degree of Os isotopic
              heterogeneity in the basalts and the relationship to possible mantle
              heterogeneities.   These advances in the understanding of Re-Os systematics
              will permit their use in advancing the overall understanding of mantle
              evolution.
