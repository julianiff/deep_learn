Abstract    :
              9505175  Croke     The proposed research lies in the general area of Riemannian
              geometry. In particular, various dynamical properties of geodesic flow are to
              be investigated. Other topics include the study of periodic metrics: this
              portion of the project relates to the recent resolution of Hopf's conjecture on
              toral metrics. Hopf's conjecture states that a Riemannian metric on a torus
              without conjugate points must be flat.    Riemannian geometry is currently a
              very active field of research in mathematics; length-minimizing paths, periodic
              behavior of the distance function, curvature and its relation to the global
              shape of the space are among the topics studied in this field. The familiar
              Euclidean geometry is a very special case of Riemannian geometry characterized
              by a total absence of curvature.
