              University  Title:  Resampling Methods Under Long Range Dependence    ABSTRACT:
                 The main thrust of the research is to develop suitable  resampling schemes
              and to study their properties for data  exhibiting very strong forms of
              dependence. It is well known  that existing resampling schemes perform very
              poorly under   such dependence structures. Two new resampling   schemes for
              long-range dependent data are investigated.   These schemes are  a
              sampling-window   method based on subsamples of the data and a bootstrap 
              method based on finite Fourier transformations.   Their   effectiveness in
              different inference problems is examined.     The phenomenon of long range
              dependence, such as the   concentration of  an air-pollutant in a city observed
              at closely   located sites, occurs when the data are highly correlated.  This  
              sort of data has a high level of variability, even after averaging.    The
              research involves developing suitable resampling  schemes for long-range
              dependent data that will provide good statistical  estimates.   The research
              has direct applications in Hydrology,   Geology, Economics, and Environmental
              problems.
