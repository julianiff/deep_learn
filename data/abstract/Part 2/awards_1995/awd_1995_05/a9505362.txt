Abstract    :
              Concerns about the effects of human interference in the oceanic  environment
              upon the life and habits of marine mammals have been  recently raised.  In
              response, researchers have taken interest in  processing all relevant
              information to better understand this  interference with the hope and goal of
              protecting marine life.  In  this context, the development of signal processing
              methods for the  exploration of sounds generated by marine mammals in the ocean
              is  being pursued.  Success of this research will enable the tracking  of
              mammals, and the reconstruction of the signals they produce,  through remote
              acoustic sensing.    Localizing marine mammals in the ocean and identifying the
              sounds  they generate requires the establishment of a link between physics 
              (acoustics) and signal processing.  The normal modes approach is  being adopted
              for modeling the acoustic signal propagation in the  oceanic environment 
              Models will then be sought that capture the  time and frequency structure of
              biological signals.  The  combination of acoustics and signal analysis is
              expected to  facilitate inversion of the acoustic field measured at an array in
               the ocean for the estimation of the location of sound-transmitting  marine
              mammals and the actual form of the signals they transmit.
