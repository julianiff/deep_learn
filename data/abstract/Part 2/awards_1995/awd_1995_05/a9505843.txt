Abstract    :
              9505843 Kodama  This project will test a new low -temperature demagnetization
              technique for isolating single domain magnetization from multi-domain-like
              behavior in magnetite from rocks of the Grenville province in Canada.  The
              isolated magnetizations will then be compared to those isolated from a standard
              demagnetization experiment, and will be dated by comparison with 40Ar/39Ar
              spectra from feldspar gains from the same rocks.  The results of this study
              will be significant for all paleomagnetic experiments. They will also help
              refine the Precambrian polar wander path for the North American plate, which
              significantly improve understanding of late Precambrian plate tectonics.
