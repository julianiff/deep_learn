Abstract    :
              9505628  Melville  Evidence suggests that dissipation due to turbulence in a
              shallow  mixed layer in the presence of surface waves is larger than that in  a
              comparable solid-wall turbulent boundary layer by as much as two  orders of
              magnitude.  In this project, the PI will develop an  improved method for
              measuring turbulent dissipation under breaking  surface waves, using a single
              beam acoustic Doppler profiler.  ***
