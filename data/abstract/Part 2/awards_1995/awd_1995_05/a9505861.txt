Abstract    :
              This award will facilitate travel by a group of American  scientists to the
              Fourteenth International Conference on  General Relativity and Gravitation
              (GR14).  This meeting  will take place in Florence, Italy on August 6-12, 1995.
                 This international conference is the major professional  meeting in the
              field of gravitational physics, and is held  once every three years.  Many
              research topics of high  interest will be discussed covering theoretical and 
              experimental gravitation, as well as astrophysics and  cosmology.
