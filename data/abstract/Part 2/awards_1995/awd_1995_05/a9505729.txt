Abstract    :
              9505729  Malone     Funds are provided for a multi-institutional workshop to
              discuss  the roles of marine laboratories in implementing priorities for 
              research and monitoring in the coastal zone.  The workshop is  being sponsored
              by NSF, NOAA Coastal Ocean Program, and EPA  Office of Research and
              Development.  The workshop's goal is to  identify mechanisms by which marine
              laboratories can best address  national needs in coastal monitoring and
              research.  The potential  role(s) of marine laboratories will be discussed in
              light of  several areas of interest: 1) multidisciplinary research that 
              transcends scales of biological organization from molecules to  organisms and
              ecosystems; 2) multidisciplinary research that  transcends the traditional
              boundaries of ecosystems constituting  the land-sea interface from drainage
              basin to coastal ocean; 3)  cost-effective monitoring networks that will not
              only document  environmental variability and detect trends but will also
              provide  a framework for hypothesis testing to reveal causes and  consequences
              of such trends; 4) information flow and liaison  between the research
              community, federal and state agencies, and  the public; and 5) regional
              distributed data and information  management systems for scientific analysis
              and the formulation of  integrated strategies for coastal zone management. The
              workshop  is to organized under the auspices of the National Association of 
              Marine Laboratories (NAML).
