Abstract    :
              This project involves the study of discrete groups with specific applications to
              analytic number theory. The principal investigator has shown that special
              values of derivatives of L-functions are expressible as finite linear
              combinations of certain one-cocycles which are generalizations of modular
              integrals. One goal of this project is to develop a theory of these
              one-cocycles which generalizes the well known theory of modular integrals, and
              to develop applications of derivatives of L-functions associated to modular
              forms. Another goal is to find sharp bounds for the Shafarevich-Tate group for
              elliptic curves defined over function fields. Recently, the principal
              investigator in conjunction with Hoffstein and Lieman has shown that there are
              no Siegel zeros for zeta functions associated to adjoint square lifts from
              GL(2) to GL(3). The methods used for this proof will be pursued to study Siegel
              zeros on GL(n). A final goal is to develop new crypto-systems based on zeta
              functions.      This research falls into the general area of number theory.
              Number theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole numbers,
              addressing suah questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one whole
              number by another. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and was
              pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within the
              last half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse applications
              in areas such as data transmission and processing, and communication systems.
