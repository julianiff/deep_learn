Abstract    :
              EAR-9525336  Stern, Libby A.    The oxygen and hydrogen isotope systematics of
              non-carbonate minerals in altitudinal transects will be compared with oxygen
              isotope values of cogenetic calcite and meteoric water.  These data will: (1)
              quantify the isotopic effects of soil water evaporation, and (2) test which
              soil minerals are more useful as climate indicators.  The assumption behind the
              method is that soil minerals record the isotopic composition of meteoric water
              at the time of their formation.  The oxygen isotope value of pedogenic calcite
              has been used as a proxy for climate, but the climate record preserved in other
              soil minerals is largely unexplored.  Because calcite does not form in soils in
              relatively humid climates, this work, if successful, will greatly expand the
              environments in which climatic indicators can be utilized.
