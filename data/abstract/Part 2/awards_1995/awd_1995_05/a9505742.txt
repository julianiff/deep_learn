Abstract    :
              9505742  Farley  This research project is designed to be a definitive study of
              the applicability of the (U-Th)/He system for geochronology and
              thermochronology of common accessory minerals (particularly apatite).  This
              system has significant potential to provide temporal constraints on geological
              events which are difficult to date with alternative techniques.  The project
              involves laboratory diffusion experiments to constrain He retention
              characteristics, as well as measurement of He ages for intercomparison with
              ages determined by independent methods.
