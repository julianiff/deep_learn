Abstract    :
              9505190  Pierrehumbert          The  research  under  this  award  involves  and
               continues  research  on  a family of problems in extratropical, tropospheric 
              synoptic  to planetary scale dynamics and the related effects  on  the  Earth's
               general  circulation and seasonal  and  interannual  fluctuations.  The theme
              unifying these studies is an approach to  the   general  circulation  based  on
               mixing  concepts  and  the  dynamical  consequences of homogenized potential 
              vorticity  (PV)  pools  in  the troposphere.  Four major topics will  be 
              pursued:  (1)  implications of homogenized PV structure for identifying the 
              mechanism  for  eddy-planetary wave feedback in the  troposphere,  (2)
              determination of the effects of radiation and moist processes  on  the 
              evolution  of  PV  in  the atmosphere,  (3)  statistical  equilibrium  models
              of horizontal heat fluxes where  upper  level  vortices are coupled to low
              level processes, and (4) an extension  of previous work in the mixing by
              synoptic eddies.           While   Dr.  Pierrehumbert  deals  primarily  with 
              highly  idealized  models, his work provides valuable insights which  are 
              applicable  to a wide range of research areas.  Dr. Pierrehumbert  is   one  
              of   the  most  creative,  original,  and   productive  theoreticians   in  
              atmospheric   dynamics,   for   whom    this  accomplishment-based renewal
              award is most appropriate.
