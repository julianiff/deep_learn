Abstract    :
              ***  9505411  Worthington   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 11
              project will conduct the necessary research required to produce the Diffuse
              Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) technology for use as semi-conductor wafer
              temperature measurement. Phase I successfully demonstrated the DRS technique.
              Phase 11 will adapt and extend the DRS technology and: 1) build a DRS
              temperature measurement materials data base, 2) develop the DRS technology for
              a process control interface, and 3) add other process monitoring capabilities
              to the DRS spectrometer. Research will be conducted in three research venues.
              First,   national laboratory collaborators will collect data on GaAs wafer
              materials.  Second, the University of Washington will collect data on surface
              morphology,  and epilayer growth. Third, Thermionics Northwest will: analyze
              the data received from the research partners, construct a low cost improved
              performance DRS wafer temperature sensor, collect and analyze data on Si
              wafers, and increase the temperature measure range of the DRS technique for Si.
                The control of wafer temperature is critical to film thickness, uniformity
              and quality. Most wafer processes require temperature measurement and control
              to increase yield and device density. In-situ temperature sensing with
              real-time data acquisition is needed for process control. The research
              conducted in Phase 11 will support product development of one or more process
              control products using the DRS technology for semi-conductor research and
              production facilities.  ***
