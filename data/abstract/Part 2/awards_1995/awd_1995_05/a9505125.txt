Abstract    :
              9505125  Bryant     The proposed research lies in the area of exterior
              differential systems. The proposer seeks to classify systems of various types
              which admit non-trivial conservation laws, and to develop effective algorithms
              for computing integrable extensions of a given system. The proposer also wishes
              to understand the geometric invariants of a control system and to investigate
              control algorithms. The main tools to be used are Cartan's method of
              equivalence and Cartan-Kahler theory.    Exterior differential systems
              generalize systems of partial differential equations; their study is heavily
              geometric and heavily computational at the same time. Control theory is used
              extensively in such areas as manufacturing and robotics; the proposed research
              may help to create more efficient design algorithms based upon a deeper
              understanding of the geometric invariants involved.
