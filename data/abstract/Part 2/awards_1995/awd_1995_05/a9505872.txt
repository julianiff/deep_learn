Abstract    :
              This research is exploring the application of optical systems for  high-speed
              database processing.  It is combining a parallel model  of computation,
              associative processing based on the use of content  addressable memory, with an
              inherently parallel technology, optics.   The purpose is to integrate into one
              study the elements of parallel  architectures, parallel algorithms, device
              technology, and  laboratory demonstrations which will test and demonstrate the 
              advantages of optics for high-speed database processing.    The approach taken
              on this project provides direct hardware support  for database operations.  It
              consists of identifying the basic  fundamental operaitons required for data
              base processing and  aprallelizing them as much as possible.  This is followed
              by  developing an optical parallel architecture that directly  implements the
              parallelized operations.  Parallel algorithms for  database processing are then
              developed that build on these  fundamental operations.  Consequently, the
              optical architecture  will support database applications in a truly parallel
              fashion.
