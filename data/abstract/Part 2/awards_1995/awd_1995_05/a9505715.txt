              Preliminary Research on Result Synthesis in a Distributed  Artificial
              Intelligence Environment    The goal of this study is to propose a systematic
              approach to  synthesize solutions from a set of heterogeneous intelligent 
              agents with overlapping expertise.  A dichotomous classification  problem will
              be examined to demonstrate how multiple inductive  agents can work
              cooperatively to solve a problem.  First, a  comparative analysis of various
              inductive methods, including  statistical and artificial intelligence (AI)
              techniques will be  conducted.  This is followed by an in-depth investigation
              of how  the differences in sample characteristics (i.e., normality,  linearity,
              etc.) affect the performance of each inductive method  to establish a
              foundation for result integration.  The concepts  and procedures developed in
              meta-analysis statistics will be used  to combine results.  The research will
              facilitate true  cooperation in a DAI environment by introducing computational 
              models that promote negotiation through cooperation rather than  competition. 
              The incorporation of the models is expected to  improve the overall performance
              and enhance the consistency and  validity of a DAI system.
