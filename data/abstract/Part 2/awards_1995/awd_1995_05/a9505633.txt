Abstract    :
              9505633  Carriquiry    This U.S.-Chile Program award will fund travel and
              related  expenses for twelve U.S. scientists and two U.S. graduate  students,
              to participate in a workshop on probability and  statistics, to be held in
              Valparaiso, Chile, on November  1995.  Also, partially funded by this award
              will be four  Latin American participants from Uruguay and Colombia. 
              Organizers are Dr. Alicia Carriquiry, Iowa State University,  Ames, and Dr.
              Servet Martinez, Universidad de Chile.   The  workshop will bring together
              active researchers from Latin  America with colleagues from the U.S. and
              Europe.  Topics to  be discussed will range from prequential analysis, 
              stochastic search model selection and stochastic processes  for spatial
              variability, to infinite particle systems and  quantum probability theory. 
              U.S. speakers are leading  researchers in the area of modeling, estimation and
              analysis  in stochastic processes, and have contributed  extensively  to the
              field.  The main objectives of the workshop are to  facilitate the exchange of
              recent research developments in  the field and to promote international
              scientific  cooperation by identifying  common research areas  for the 
              participants.  A significant feature of the conference will  be the active
              participation of young U.S. and Latin American  researchers.    ***
