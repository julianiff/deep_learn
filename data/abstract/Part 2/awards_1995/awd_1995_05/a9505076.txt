Abstract    :
              Feinman    Under the direction of Dr. Gary Feinman, Mr Andrew Balkansky will 
              collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct an  archaeological
              survey of the Sola Valley which is located in  Oaxaca Mexico. While very little
              work has been done in the  region, it is known to contain several large sites
              which include  mounded architecture and carved stelae. Mr. Balkansky and 
              assistants will aim for 100% coverage of the valley floor. All  sites will be
              located and surface artifacts such as ceramics and  stone tools will be
              recovered. On this basis it will be possible  to reconstruct the population
              history of the valley and determine  how settlement and political organization
              changed over time.    The Oaxaca region is important to archaeologists because
              of the  prehistoric state which was centered at Monte Alban and which  arose
              there. Archaeologists wish to understand how complex  societies arise and
              through extensive research at the Monte Alban  site it is now possible to trace
              the development at this core in  some detail. However it is also necessary to
              understand how this  state expanded and to do this one must look at peripheral
              areas  such as the Sola Valley. The research which Mr. Balkansky will  conduct
              will shed new light on the process of state formation and  the strategies
              employed for state expansion and incorporation of  new regions.    This
              research is important for several reasons. It will shed new  light on the rise
              of complex societies. It will provide data of  interest to many archaeologists
              and assist in the training of a  promising young scientist.
