Abstract    :
              9505969  Clapham              This is a grant for support of an international
              symposium on Organellar Ion Channels and Transporters to be held under the
              auspices of the Society of General Physiologists.  The symposium will focus on
              the biochemistry, molecular biology, structure/function and physiology of ion
              channels and transporters in intracellular membranes of the endoplasmic
              reticulum and other organelles.  The aim of  the symposium is to integrate the 
              physiological, biochemical and genetic approaches to the study of this class of
              membrane proteins and provide a focus for discussion of this new frontier of
              membrane biology.        The meeting consists of five sessions : 1)endoplasmic
              reticulum ion channels and transporters, 2)mitochondrial channels and
              transporters, 3)nuclear channels and transporters, 4) secretory mechanisms  and
              5)organellar localization of calcium.  There will also be poster sessions and a
              session entitled new ideas, new faces, consisting of shorter talks by young
              investigators selected from abstracts submitted for the poster session.  These
              proceedings will be published.  %%%         This meeting covers an area which
              is relatively recent in the studies on membrane structure and function.  Most
              of these studies have been concerned with the plasma membrane, however this
              meeting concerns the membranes of the intracellular organelles.  Since these
              proceedings will be published, this information will be available to all
              interested scientists.  ***
