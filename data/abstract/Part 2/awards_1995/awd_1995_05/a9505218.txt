Abstract    :
              EAR-9005218  Junta, Jodi L.    The principal objective of this research is to
              test the hypothesis that clay minerals can nucleate and grown in/on leached
              layers produced by the OweatheringO (hydrolysis) of other silicates.  Because
              aluminum is ubiquitous in nature, a second logical objective is to document how
              aqueous aluminum reacts with leached layers.  To achieve these objectives, the
              Fellow will use a dual approach, combining wet-chemical solution methods with
              microscopic and spectroscopic analyses to quantify how weathered silicates can
              react with aluminum to form clay minerals.  The study will demonstrate how clay
              minerals nucleate and grow in soils.  This research has implications for
              understanding the cycling of excess aluminum released by acid rain.  The
              techniques mastered by the Fellow during this work will open up new research
              avenues to study the cycling of environmentally or economically important heavy
              metals in other settings.
