Abstract    :
                  Jarrard  9505299    The hippocampus and adjacent brain structures
              (subiculum, entorhinal cortex) have been implicated in the processes underlying
              learning and memory.   With this award, Dr. Jarrard will lead a group of
              undergraduate students in studies of these brain regions.  Selective
              inactivation will be used to test the role of each structure in several
              different learning tasks.  This work will expand our understanding of the
              interconnected brain systems that subserve different forms of memory. 
              Furthermore, the project will provide valuable training for young scientists in
              training.  ***
