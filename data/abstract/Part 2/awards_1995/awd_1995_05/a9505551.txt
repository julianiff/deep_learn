Abstract    :
              9505551  Hakimi       Effective communication in networks is emerging as a
              critical  factor in improving the performance of distributed systems  including
              multiprocessor computers and computer networks.    Research in this project
              will focus on three classes of problems:  1) the design of effective sequential
              and parallel algorithms for  certain common communication functions in
              networks, such as  all-to-all broadcast or "gossiping"; 2) the study of
              gossiping in  a faulty environment and its application to the problem of 
              automatic identification of the faulty units; and 3) the  investigation of
              gossiping in wireless (radio) networks and the  channel assignment problem in
              cellular telephone systems.   Work  will also include extending the PI's
              previous work on effective  information dissemination in networks with emphasis
              on devising  efficient approximation algorithms for known difficult problems 
              and extending work on distributed gossiping algorithms in a faulty  environment
              to make it applicable to automatic identification of  intermittently faulty
              units in a network.  The principal  investigator will also study problems in
              wireless networks and  cellular systems using generalizations of graph coloring
              problems.  ***
