Abstract    :
              Sarkis  9505967   The objective of this project is to organize and sponsor a
              workshop on benchmarking for agility.  This workshop is meant to address issues
              that face those parties that have interest in the research, development and
              implementation of agile manufacturing concepts and technology within industry. 
              The specific emphasis is to help agility management, researchers and other
              stakeholders define and determine the process of development, planning,
              acquisition, and use of benchmarks, with a discussion on needs, lessons
              learned, effort and utility of various benchmarking processes and techniques.  
              This workshop is to be composed  of  speakers and participants from academia,
              government and industry.   The experiences of these individuals and results of
              this workshop will help those involved with agility programs, including the
              NSF/ARPA sponsored agile manufacturing research institutes, the agility forum
              (AMEF), TEAM, interested agile pilots representatives, and various government
              agencies.  This workshop is also intended to increase the awareness and
              definition of agility and its related performance measures.
