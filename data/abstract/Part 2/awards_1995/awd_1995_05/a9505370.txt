Abstract    :
              The aim of this research is to develop vision algorithms for  analysis of
              non-rigid motion from medical imagery. We will continue  our algorithm
              development in snake tracking and image velocity  field computation for
              assessment of tissue deformations and  analysis of fluid flow from MRI and
              X-ray imagery, and extend the  techniques to 3D. MRI is unique in its ability
              to non-invasively  and selectively alter tissue magnetization, and create
              tagged  patterns within deforming tissue such as the heart muscle. The 
              resulting pattern defines a time-varying curvilinear coordinate  system on the
              underlying tissue, allowing for precise and  quantitative measurement of tissue
              motion and deformation from a  sequence of images. The motion of these visible
              tag lines is  tracked with Dynamic Programming (DP) B-spline snakes, and 
              interacting B-spline deformable grids. Warp algorithms have been  developed
              which continuously map two tissue regions in the plane  such that two embedded
              grids of curves are brought into  registration. For fluid flow field analysis,
              a scalar function  formulation for optical flow has been developed. The novel
              aspect  of the new optical flow framework is that it automatically enforces 
              incompressibility on the resulting velocity field. Applications of  the
              techniques to various experimental conditions are planned.
