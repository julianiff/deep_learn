Abstract    :
              9505621  Lichtenberg       The research concerns the theoretical and numerical 
              study of  diffusion in systems with many degrees of  freedom.  The systems to
              be studied are weakly coupled  mappings with the uncoupled  mappings being
              periodic in the  action space, and coupled oscillator chains.  Local 
              diffusion, averaged over action space can be used to  calculate the global
              diffusion properties of the  coupled  system.   The diffusion along stochastic
              resonance layers is  known as Arnold diffusion.  This diffusion can be
              calculated  within a three-resonance model, when the system parameters  can be
              appropriately controlled.  Fundamental questions such  as the relationship to
              upper bounds on the diffusion, and to  energy equipartition will be addressed. 
              The effect of the  number of degrees of freedom and the strength of the 
              coupling parameter will be studied.  Comparisons of analytic  approximations to
              the numerical results should allow an  analytic formalism to be developed that
              can be extended  beyond the range of numerical analysis.  ***
