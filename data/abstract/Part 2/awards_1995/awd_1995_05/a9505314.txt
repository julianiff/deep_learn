Abstract    :
              9505314  Kuzyk  This proposal seeks partial funding for an international
              conference  on the topic of organic nonlinear optics with meeting headquarters 
              at Kusatsu, Gunma, Japan, July 23-26, 1995.  Travel funds are  requested to
              support U.S. invited speakers and Ph.D. students.  The  purpose of the meeting
              is to bring together top researchers - whose  expertise spans material design,
              material characterization, device  fabrication, and integrated device
              architectures - to the intimate  setting of a small town to discuss and assess
              progress in the  field.  This upcoming conference is motivated by two previous
              NSF-  supported conferences that were held in Pullman, Washington in the 
              summer of 1992 and in Val Thorens, France in the Winter of 1994  (ICONO'1). 
              This proposed meeting would be the third in the series  of meetings that we
              plan to hold every 18 months.  The demand for  such a meeting was evidenced by
              full-capacity attendance of  ICONO'1.  The strategy is to hold this meeting in
              those countries  that are active in this field.  At the ICONO'1 meeting, U.S.
              and  other non-European attendees had the opportunity to learn about a  large
              array of European research activities that are normally not  represented at
              U.S. conferences.  ***
