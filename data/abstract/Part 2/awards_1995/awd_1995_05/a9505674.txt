Abstract    :
              9505674  Farag         The project will develop new approaches for 3-D model 
              building in computer vision.  These models will based on stereo  pairs and/or
              the 3-D surface data obtained by a laser scanner.   For either of these
              modalities, the model building process  consists of two mainly sequential
              steps.  The first step provides  a representation for 3-D objects; this step is
              called the Data  Representation and Registration Phase (DRRP).  The second step
               develops methods for 3-D model verification and is called the 3-D  Model
              Verification Phase (MVP_.       Four research topics will be addressed while
              carrying out  the proposed study: (i) design of a representational scheme in 
              the form of a 3-D surface model describing various geometric and  irregular
              objects, the input being stereo pairs and/or laser  scanned data; (ii)
              development of methods for accurate fusion of  data obtained from multi-views;
              (iii) development of methods for  merging surface information in situations
              where both stereo  imaging and laser scanners are available; and (iv)
              application of  the methods used in (i)-(iii) in manufacturing and biomedical 
              engineering.  ***
