Abstract    :
               The project will focus on the specification, programming, and  implementation
              of different kinds of distributed shared memories.  Proof  techniques and
              programming methodologies will be developed  for dealing with the  complexities
              in these definitions.  Conditions will be developed under which  programming
              with these  weak memories has the same net effect as programming in  the more 
              familiar sequential domain.  The developed methodologies will  support  both a
              posteriori as well as a priori approaches towards  program design and 
              verification.  A testbed for distributed  shared memories will be implemented. 
              This testbed will function  in a heterogeneous environment of a parallel
              machine  and a high-  performance local area network, and will be used for 
              experimenting  with protocols and applications from the  scientific, database,
              and digital  libraries domain.  The testbed  will also support distributed
              simulation of  shared memories and  architectures.
