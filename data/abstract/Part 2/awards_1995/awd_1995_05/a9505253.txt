Abstract    :
              9505253  Gabai       The investigation focuses on several of the central open 
              problems in three-dimensional manifold topology.  E.g., is the  homeomorphism
              type of a hyperbolic three-manifold determined by its  homotopy type?  Is a
              hyperbolic metric on a closed 3-manifold  unique up to isotopy?  Is every
              closed irreducible aspherical  3-manifold covered by 3-space?  Do theorems
              about Haken manifolds  or 3-manifolds with taut foliations generalize to
              manifolds with  essential laminations?       A three-dimensional manifold is a
              space M with the following  property.  Any sufficiently small observer in M
              believes that he is  living in standard three-dimensional space.  This assumes
              that the  observer is nearsighted, i.e. his vision is restricted to small 
              distances.  Despite the fact that 3-manifolds have an extremely  simple local
              structure, their global structures are in general  quite complex.  Though great
              efforts have been made in this century  to understand the nature of 3-manifolds
              and much progress has been  made these last 40 years, mathematicians still
              appear to be quite  far from a complete understanding.  This project addresses
              some of  the most fundamental open problems in the subject.  ***
