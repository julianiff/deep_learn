Abstract    :
              9505837  WYSS                             This research is to measure the
              direction of polarization of the  S-waves from local earthquakes recorded by
              most of the 12 three-  component seismograph station in the Alaska network. 
              Emphasis will  be placed on those stations where preferred mineral orientation
              is  not likely to be responsible for the anisotropy.  The derived  stress
              directions will be compared to those estimated in previously  funded NSF work
              based on inversion of fault-plane solutions.  It is  important to estimate
              stress directions from S-polarizations, where  this can be done, because there
              is not enough information available  concerning stress directions to understand
              the seismic hazard in  central and southern Alaska.  All stress direction
              estimates (from  fault-plane solutions, volcanic dikes, hydrofracture and 
              anisotropy) will be integrated to construct a seismotectonic model  for central
              and southern Alaska.  This research is a component of  the National Earthquake
              Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
