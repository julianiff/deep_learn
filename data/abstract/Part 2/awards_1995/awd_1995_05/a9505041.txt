Abstract    :
              9505041  Cherry     The proposed research lies in the interface of number theory
              and several complex variables. The proposer wants to understand the
              relationship between Nevanlinna theory and diophantine geometry. In particular,
              he will study error terms in Nevanlinna theory and p-adic analogues of
              holomorphic curves.    Recently, formal analogies between certain areas of
              complex geometry and number theory have been observed. This is unexpected in
              that these two areas are traditionally unrelated areas of mathematics: number
              theory deals with integer equations whereas complex geometry deals with
              non-discrete objects.
