Abstract    :
              9505673  Phelan    This U.S.-Chile Program award will fund a planning visit by  
                 Dr. P. Larry Phelan of Ohio State University to meet with      Prof. Andres
              O. Angulo of the Universidad de Concepcion to      lay the groundwork for a
              proposal on the mating behavior of      the primitive moths of austral South
              America.  Understanding      of primitive moths is important and necessary to
              elucidate      the evolutionary history of moth pheromones.  The     
              Palaephatidae occupy a phylogenetic position that suggests      their status as
              a missing link in this evolutionary path.      Preliminary observations of
              mating behavior will be made in      the field and specimens collected for
              pheromone extracts and      for morphological studies of pheromone glands in
              both males      and females.                              ***
