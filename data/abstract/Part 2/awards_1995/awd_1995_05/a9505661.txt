Abstract    :
                9505661  Blaine  This award provides support for the planning and preliminary
              design of a world virus  database. The planning and preliminary design will be
              pursued by experimentation with  current standards and newly developed
              guidelines for biological database interoperability to  support the design of a
              World Virus Database (ICTVdB). The International Committee  on the Taxonomy of
              Viruses (ICTV), a standing committee of the Virology division of the 
              International Union of Microbiological Studies, is charged with establishing,
              maintaining and  disseminating information on a universal system for virus
              taxonomy. Such a system can used  to address questions in systematics,
              comparative biology and ecology. Database structural  design, data collection,
              and dissemination methods will be explored in close collaboration  with other
              major biological database producers to implement concepts recommended by an 
              emerging federation of database providers.  Development of the ICTVdB, because
              of its  interdisciplinary interest and close links to genetic sequence data,
              can provide a model for the  design, testing and modification of software tools
              for database interoperability.
