              David K. Patton University of South Carolina  Dissertation Improvement Research:
              Knowledge-Based Categorization of Maps  This study will advance understanding
              of categorization as a cognitive process by examining knowledge-based category
              learning within a map reading environment.  Various models of categorization
              will be examined.  Three experiments and a simulation will be conducted to
              evaluate the connection between individual features and broader environmental
              concepts, investigate effects of existing knowledge on category learning, and
              test a structure of category knowledge with a network model.  The study will
              make important contributions to understanding similarity/comparison judgments
              in map reading, effects of top-down information in map reading, effects of
              category structure on recalling map information, and the use of network models
              in evaluating theories of cognition.
