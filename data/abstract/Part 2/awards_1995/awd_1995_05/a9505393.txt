Abstract    :
                Numerical methods are developed for solving large   scale matrix  problems
              arising in applications. These applications are   quite  diverse and  include
              such areas as statistical modeling and  quantum   chromodynamics (QCD).  The
              basic tool for these  computations comes from the   classical theory of 
              moments and  numerical quadrature. These  problems are   equivalent to 
              estimating  upper and lower bounds for a quadratic form.    One area of  
              particular interest  is computing the generalized  cross validation parameter. 
               This technique is used  in solving ill-posed least squares problems by
              regularization   methods.  A  numerical procedure is developed which enables
              one to analyze    very large data  sets. Also, a method for computing a
              parameter  which is of   importance in  solving ill-conditioned sparse least 
              squares problems is   developed.  The basic  objective of this  research is to
              develop new and robust   algorithms for solving  very  large scale linear
              problems.
