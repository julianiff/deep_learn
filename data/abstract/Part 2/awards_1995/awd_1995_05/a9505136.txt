Abstract    :
              9505136  Ontaneda       A basic problem in Geometry and Topology is to study the
               relation between curvature (local information about a space) and  topology
              (global information about a space).  The investigator  studies a particular
              case of curvature: spaces of non-positive  curvature, in the riemannian case
              and in the PL (piecewise linear)  case. He also studies some problems
              concerning riemannian and PL  rigidity (in the non-positively curved case); the
              relation between  riemannian and PL non-positively curved geometry; and how the
               topology could determine the curvature: which spaces admit a  non-positively
              curved geometry.       A space with non-positively curved geometry is a space
              on  which, essentially, an object, as it moves away from an observer,  seems to
              decrease in size at a rate equal to or faster than the  rate in the "real
              world" (euclidean geometry).  In general,  geometry determines some properties
              about the (global) shape of the  space.  For instance, if a space has a
              non-positively curved  geometry, after "unwrapping" the space we obtain another
              space  that, unlike a doughnut, can be shrunk within itself to a single  point
              (Cartan-Hadamard theorem).  This research project is oriented  towards studying
              such relations on spaces with non-positive  geometry: how the geometry (local
              data) determines the global shape  (topology) and also how topology could
              determine the geometry.   Although the relevance of this to the "real world" is
              not obvious  if one considers only the apparently Euclidean environs of the 
              earth, questions of cosmology -- the nature of the universe as a  whole and not
              merely our small corner of it -- are intimately  related to these mathematical
              questions.  ***
