Abstract    :
              9505309  Lee   This research is to optimize the thermal performance of woven
              fabric components.  A micro-structure engineered material approach will provide
              the tool for predicting the radiative properties of multi-layer fibrous
              composites.  The morphology of the material is accounted for through a solution
              to Maxwell's relations.  Experimental measurements of the bi-directional and
              hemispherical transmittance and reflectance of the specimen will also be taken.
               A computer program will be developed for performing optimization and design
              analyses.   The technology developed will result in a unique optimization
              software for the design of advanced fibrous composites and the optimization of
              existing materials.  The design and improvement of such materials will ensure
              substantial cost savings for the development of advanced fibrous composites for
              applications in aerospace, industrial, and personnel fire-protection clothing.
