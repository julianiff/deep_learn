Abstract    :
              Caporaso   9505140    Professor Caporaso will work on two problems in algebraic 
              geometry. She intends to study the Kodaira dimension of fiber  products of
              certain families of curves whose general member is of  general type. She will
              also study the geometry of the universal  Picard variety.    This is research
              in the field of algebraic geometry. Algebraic  geometry is one of the oldest
              parts of modern mathematics, but  one which has had a revolutionary flowering
              in the past quarter-  century. In its origin, it treated figures that could be
              defined  in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays
              the field makes use of methods not only from algebra,  but from analysis and
              topology, and conversely is finding  application in those fields as well as in
              physics, theoretical  computer science, and roboticq.  ***
