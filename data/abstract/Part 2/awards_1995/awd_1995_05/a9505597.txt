Abstract    :
              9505597  Pursley       The 1995 IEEE International Symposium on Information
              Theory  will be held in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada, on September 
              17-22, 1995.  Papers presented will address new results in:   applications of
              information theory, image and speech coding,  communication systems, multi-user
              information theory, cryptography  and security, neural networks, data
              compression, optical  communications, data networks, pattern recognition,
              detection and  estimation, Shannon theory, distributed information processing, 
              signal processing, error-control coding, source coding, and  stochastic
              processes.        This symposium is a premiere meeting in the field of 
              Information theory.  Travel through this grant will provide travel  support for
              U. S. participants, primarily graduate students and new  faculty members, whose
              papers are selected for presentation at the  symposium, but who lack the funds
              required to travel to the  conference.  ***
