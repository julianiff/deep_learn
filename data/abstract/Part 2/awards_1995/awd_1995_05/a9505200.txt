Abstract    :
              9505200  Yanco   This project will adapt general mobile robotics research to the
              specific problem of a wheelchair robot.  A wheelchair robot kit, with a
              notebook computer providing the platform for the user interface, will be
              utilized to create a low-cost, general-purpose wheelchair robot that can be
              used as a navigational assistant in wheelchair accessible indoor environments. 
              The system is planned to be easy to use and to increase the efficiency of the
              user's travel in the wheelchair.    Seven women students at Wellesley College
              will be involved with the Principal Investigator in the project.  Since women
              are underrepresented in computer science and engineering in general and in
              robotics in particular, this project is particularly appropriate in the
              opportunity it provides to expose women undergraduates to possibilities in
              research activities and to encourage them to continue with further study in
              this area.  With the planned complementary educational activities, the project
              will also bring new technical breadth to their computer science education at
              this liberal arts institution.  ***
