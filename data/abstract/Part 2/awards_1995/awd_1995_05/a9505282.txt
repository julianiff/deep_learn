Abstract    :
              DMI-9505282  Lee   A critical deficiency exists in current dielectric materials
              that prevents their use in the next generation of semiconductor devices.
              Replacing conventional inorganic dielectrics with organic polymers is one of
              the more promising approaches to circumventing this problem. Organic materials
              offer lower dielectric constants, better planarization, improved dimensional
              stability, and require fewer manufacturing steps to process than their
              inorganic counterparts. However, current organic polymer dielectrics such as
              polyimides are not suitable as interlevel dielectrics for IC applications. Thus
              new organic polymers with the right combinations of properties are required.  
              We are proposing to continue the development of a new class of dielectrics
              based on polyquinolines. Polyquinolines do not have the same deficiencies that
              plague polyimides and polyquinoines are ideally suited to serve as dielectric
              materials due in part to their inherently low dielectric constants, low
              moisture uptakes, and unparalleled thermal stabilities. Unfortunately, the
              glass transition temperatures (<280 C) of most polyquinoline materials are too
              low for IC applications. In Phase I we sought and achieved the preparation of a
              useful polyquinoline derivative with a Tg above 300 C. In this Phase II
              program, we are proposing to continue the development of these materials and
              prepare polyquinoline dielectrics with T,'s2350 C. The new polymers developed
              in this program will be subjected to numerous evaluations to qualify them as
              intermetal dielectric materials. The final confirmation involves the
              preparation and electrical evaluations of IC test structures made from these
              materials.   The materials polymers that will be developed in this program are
              being designed to serve as intermetal dielectrics in IC applications. However,
              the anticipated advantages that they will offer are likely to make them
              attractive in many dielectric uses including IC passivation and various
              insulating layers for liquid crystalline displa y and multichip module
              applications.
