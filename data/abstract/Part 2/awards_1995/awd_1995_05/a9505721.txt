Abstract    :
              9505721  Buller    This proposal seeks to provide a direct Internet connection
              between Native American communities including Community Colleges that as of yet
              no network connectivity.    Training for the classroom use of the Internet will
              provided and will be done in conjunction with the AISES Teacher Enhancement
              Project.  This will provide over 100 educators of American Indian students with
              their first look at network use and networked information.    Thus the major
              goal of facilitating access to the Internet for as many Native American as
              possible will be provided.
