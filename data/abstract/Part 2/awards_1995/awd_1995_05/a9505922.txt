Abstract    :
                  This project deals with register optimization techniques  for  modern
              computer architectures. In modern pipelined architectures  code is  carefully
              scheduled to avoid unnecessary delays. However,  some delay slots may  be
              unavoidable. This project will develop  techniques to `glean` unfilled delay 
              slots to perform work  normally considered not worthwhile, such as splitting 
              live ranges  into shorter ranges. Shorter ranges induce fewer register 
              conflicts, allowing registers to be used for other purposes. 
              Normally,registers  are not used across procedure boundaries. The  project will
              develop techniques  to optimally allocate registers  at the interprocedural
              level. More  specifically, the techniques  will attempt to avoid unnecessary
              register  spilling on  caller/callee boundaries.    The project will also
              investigate the  use of idle processors to  perform a variety of program
              correctness analyses.  This is  achieved using a `shadow` process which
              executes only when a  processor  becomes idle.
