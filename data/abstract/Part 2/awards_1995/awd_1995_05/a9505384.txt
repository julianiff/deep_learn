Abstract    :
              9505384  Fornari       The objective of this work is to develop a quantitative 
              model of submarine lave flow emplacement based on flow morphology  using
              methods developed for the study of extraterrestrial lava  flows.  The model
              will include the effect of underlying slope,  microtopography and variable
              effusion rate.  It will place the  often spatially limited views of submarine
              lava flows available  from current data-collection techniques in the broad
              context of  an entire flow, allowing effusion rates for a whole flow to be 
              extrapolated from these narrow views.  ***
