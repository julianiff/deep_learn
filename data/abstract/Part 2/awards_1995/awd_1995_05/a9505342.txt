Abstract    :
              9505342        Tzavaras  We propose to study various topics related to the
              formation,  propagation and resolution of singularities during the dynamic
              deformation of  continuous media. The topics are: (i) Effect of viscosity on
              shock propagation  for hyperbolic conservation laws. (ii) Fluid-mechanic limits
              for discrete  velocity models for Riemann data. (iii) Formation of shear bands
              at high  strain rates. The proposed techniques are from the domain of
              qualitative  theory of partial differential equations, with the use of
              computational tools  when necessary to guide the theory. The proposed problems
              vary from concrete  models for specific phenomena, to general theory hyperbolic
              systems of  conservation laws, to developing techniques for studying the
              transition from  discrete to continuum theories.   The theoretical
              understanding of structures  such as shock waves and shear bands is critical
              for designing improved  algorithms in technological applications where such
              phenomena are dominant.  Shear bands are regions of intensely localized strain
              that appear during high  speed deformations of metals and often precede
              rupture. Shear bands play a  major role in ballistic penetration of metals and
              in various manufacturing  processes involving metals.
