Abstract    :
              9505676  Drake   This award provides one-half the funding required to purchase
              components to upgrade the electron microprobe instrument housed and operated in
              the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona. The University
              is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for the acquisition.  
              The upgrade consists of replacing the system's computer control hardware and
              software, replacing a contaminated backscattered electron detector, and
              acquiring a  new vacuum evaporating unit for carbon coating of non-conductive
              samples. The electron microprobe is a basic analytical tool for microanalysis
              of solids used by a large group of researchers on the University of Arizona
              campus from the Lunar and Planetary Lab, the Department of Geosciences, 
              Materials Sciences, and Engineering. This upgrade ensures access to a
              state-of-the-art instrument at a minimal cost compared to a new instrument.
