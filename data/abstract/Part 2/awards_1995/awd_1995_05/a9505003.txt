Abstract    :
              9505003  Davis       The project of Professors Ruth Charney and Michael Davis 
              involves problems in topology, geometry, and geometric group  theory.  The main
              focus of the project is the study of piecewise  Euclidean polyhedra of
              nonpositive curvature (in the sense of  Gromov's CAT(0) inequality). 
              Understanding the local geometry of  such spaces is equivalent to understanding
              when polyhedra with  piecewise spherical metrics are "large" (i.e., satisfy the
              CAT(1)  inequality).  This project attempts to answer a number of questions 
              concerning "large" piecewise spherical polyhedra, as well as the  related
              question of when a negatively curved Riemannian manifold  supports a piecewise
              hyperbolic CAT(0) metric (with B. Okun).   Charney's research also includes the
              study of Artin groups via  geometric techniques; Davis's includes the study of
              certain  singular fiber bundles with applications to smooth torus actions on 
              manifolds (with R. Scott).       Groups are algebraic structures abstracting
              the concept of  symmetry, which is pervasive in mathematics and mathematical 
              physics.  The field of geometric group theory has, historically,  involved
              ideas from several areas of mathematics -- topology,  combinatorics, and group
              theory.  The recent introduction of  techniques patterned on differential
              geometry has led to exciting  new developments in the field as well as new
              applications to  problems in topology.  One of these techniques, a version of 
              "nonpositive curvature" for topological metric spaces, has played  a major role
              in these developments.  The project of Charney and  Davis aims at a better
              understanding of this notion of curvature  and how it may be applied to
              problems in topology and group theory.  ***
