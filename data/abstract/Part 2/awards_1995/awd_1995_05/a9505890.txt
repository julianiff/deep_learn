Abstract    :
              This award supports Professor Slawomir Kwasik and a graduate student of Tulane
              University to collaborate in mathematics research with Professor Bjorn Jahren
              and others of the Department of Mathematics of the University of Oslo, Norway. 
              They will study the relationship between algebraic K-theory and pseudo-isotopy
              of manifolds, and they will apply new methods employing Waldhausen's A-theory
              to study various geometric questions concerning the topology of manifolds. 
              They will also use gauge theoretic techniques to gain a new insight into the
              pseudo-isotopies of low-dimensional manifolds.  The research is strengthened by
              the experience of Dr. Kwasik in the more geometric aspects of pseudo-isotopy
              theory but relies primarily on the expertise and new approach developed by
              Professor Jahren.   Recently introduced mathematical techniques have provided
              powerful tools to perform specific algebraic calculations.  This has led to a
              surge of interest in research in the above areas.  Significant progress has
              already been made in the algebraic aspects of these theories, but work is just
              beginning in the geometrical side.  Indeed the strongest centers pursuing this
              research are in Northern Europe, and the proposed collaboration with a
              Norwegian group will provide access to the latest research developments for Dr.
              Kwasik and his student.  Another attractive feature is the involvement of two
              well regarded Polish mathematicians who have made contributions to the same
              area of mathematics.  They plan to synchronize visits to Norway with Dr.
              Kwasik.  This will provide to US investigators insights and links to Eastern
              European workers in this field.
