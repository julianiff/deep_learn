Abstract    :
              The electrochemical and spectroscopic characterization of diamond  thin film
              electrodes forms the focus of this research project at  Utah State University,
              supported by the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry Program.  Synthetic diamond
              thin films show promise as  physically and chemically robust electrode
              materials which may have  application in a wide variety of electrochemical
              sensors and  electrochemical processes in severe service environments.  The
              work  of this project is designed to develop the basic understanding of  these
              materials necessary for their subsequent use in a variety of  important
              technologies.  The synthesis and characterization of diamond thin film
              electrodes  is the subject of this research project.  Diamond possesses an 
              interesting combination of physical, chemical and electrochemical  properties
              which make it promising as an electrode material in a  number of sensing and
              process applications.  A basic science  understanding of the relationship
              between the structure of these  films and their electrochemical and
              spectroelectrochemical activity  is the goal of this research.
