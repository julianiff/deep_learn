Abstract    :
              EAR-9505217  Lithgow-Bertelloni    The Fellow proposes to calculate the global
              intraplate stress field for the last 65 My of EarthOs history based on simple
              models of mantle flow and detailed plate tectonic reconstructions.  The
              approach is to test first the hypothesis that global scale mantle circulation
              can explain relatively large-scale (>500 km) intraplate variations in stress
              regimes and geology, by carefully comparing a large variety of existing
              geological and geophysical data sets (e.g., intraplate stress data, paleostress
              indicators, seismic, gravity, and heat flow profiles, etc.).  The results will
              serve as a baseline for assessing the importance of smaller scale dynamic
              features, such as localized upwellings, and of regional scale crustal
              heterogeneities.      A regional study using detailed seismic tomography models
              will be carried out for Western North America, to understand the influence of
              global dynamic processes on the development of the three types of stress
              regimes represented by the Rocky Mountains compressional region, the Basin and
              Range extension and the strike-slip deformation in California.  This work has
              the potential to reach far beyond parochial applications in deciphering the
              mechanics of enigmatic intraplate tectonic features; evolution of the stress
              field is one missing key to understanding mantle convection.
