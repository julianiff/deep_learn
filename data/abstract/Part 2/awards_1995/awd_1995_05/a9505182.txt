Abstract    :
              The PI's objective in this project is providing detailed spectral  signatures of
              coronal loops from model calculations which  consistently account for dynamics
              and energetics from the corona  through the chromosphere.  He will simulate a
              variety of loop  lengths and heating mechanisms, and will examine thermal
              stability.   The PI will also perform model calculations of coronal loops 
              extending into the chromosphere using self-consistent radiation  hydrodynamic
              calculations to provide definitive spectral signatures  of these loops.  He
              will use the ALTAIR, a highly sophisticated  computational tool that integrates
              hydrodynamics and frequency  dependent radiative transfer code and increases
              the speed in  solving generalized non-LTE problems.***
