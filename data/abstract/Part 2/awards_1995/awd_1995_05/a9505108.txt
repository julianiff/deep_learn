Abstract    :
              9505108  Minc       Research under this project will involve the following
              areas:  1) embedding of a chainable continuum in the plane with a given  point
              accessible, 2) inverse limits of the same map of  0,1 , 3)  fixed-point
              problems for weakly chainable tree-like continua, 4)  computer-generated images
              of inverse limits of arcs, 5) algorithms  to determine whether a simplicial map
              between graphs can be  factored through an arc.       Some applications to
              dynamical systems are envisioned.  ***
