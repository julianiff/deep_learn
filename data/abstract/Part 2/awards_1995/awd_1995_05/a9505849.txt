Abstract    :
              9505849  Martin        A winter-time meteorological phenomenon known as an 
              inverted trough   has been shown to be associated with extreme weather events
              such as heavy snow  with high winds.  To date,  however, there has been little
              study of inverted troughs.   The goal of this research is to investigate the
              mesoscale structure, evolution and  precipitation distribution associated with
              inverted troughs.  This research will be  accomplished by using detailed data
              sets acquired during the already completed  Stormscale Operational and Research
              Meteorology-Fronts Experiment, Systems Test  (STORM-FEST) field program, along
              with an advanced mesoscale numerical model.        By adding to the current
              understanding of the processes responsible for the  production of mesoscale
              precipitation bands in the Northern Great Plains winter  cyclones, the results
              of this research will help to improve short-term weather  forecasting in the
              region.  ***
