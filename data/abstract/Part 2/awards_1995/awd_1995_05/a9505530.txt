Abstract    :
              9505530  Zworski     The proposed research lies in the general area of spectral
              and scattering theory. More specifically, the proposer wants to investigate
              distribution of resonances and geometric properties of the scattering matrix.  
               This research deals with a class of differential equations arising in solid
              state physics and scattering phenomena by convex obstacles. The investigator
              seeks to lay a mathematical foundation for scattering phenomena and to consider
              more sophisticated scattering problems, say scattering on finite volume
              hyperbolic surfaces.
