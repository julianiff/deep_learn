Abstract    :
                9505932  Chave           The PI will continue to use 6 unpowered submarine
              telephone  Pacific cables and add 3 new ones to  study the deep electrical 
              structure of the earth, improve our understanding of the ocean's  response to
              wind forcing, space physics, and the dynamo mechanism  in the earth's core, as
              well as investigate the mid-mantle  electrical structure of the Pacific basin.
