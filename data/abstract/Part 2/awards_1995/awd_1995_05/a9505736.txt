Abstract    :
                9505736  Block    This proposal by a young investigator of unusual breadth of 
              expertise spans several levels of biological organization.  The basic interest
              of the PI is in the biology of muscle  and, more particularly , how the
              membrane system within the  muscle cells controls the contraction/relaxation
              cycle of  muscles. In ordinary striated muscle, i.e., those that  contract to
              produce movement, these membranes serve as  storage depots for calcium ions.
              The release/sequestration  of calcium ions in the membranous system of such
              muscle  cells regulates their contraction. The PI is examining the  coupling of
              these calcium mechanisms to the impulse  generated by nerves which initiates
              the contractile event.  To do so she employs a unique muscle cell found in the
              eye  muscles of deep-diving fish such as the marlin, that  is, a  muscle cell
              that does not contract but rather produces heat.  This "heater tissue" is used
              to warm blood on its way to the  fish's brain, thus keeping the brain warm even
              while the  fish dives in deep and cold water.    The PI is currently studying
              the elaborate counter-current  heat exchange system at the base of this heater
              organ, using  biochemical and morphological methodologies to study how  these
              cells regulate the movement of calcium and thereby  generate heat. Using a
              unique, non-contracting muscle system  the PI will also be addressing questions
              of interest to all  contractile physiologists.
