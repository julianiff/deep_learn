Abstract    :
              9505017  Dumas     The proposed research is in the area of dynamical systems; in
              particular, averaging and stability of Hamiltonian systems are to be
              investigated. The investigator proposes to generalize Anosov's averaging
              theorem to systems with more general hypotheses on the driving flow; proposes
              to apply Lasker's frequency analysis to the study of transport in symplectic
              maps.    Hamiltonian systems arise in celestial mechanics, accelerator physics
              and elsewhere in nature. The frequency analysis method, first developed by
              Lasker, can be applied to a variety of such systems to detect long time
              instability. The proposed research seeks to provide a rigorous theoretical
              framework for this method.
