Abstract    :
              Phong  DMS-9505399    Phong will investigate core problems on oscillatory and
              singular integrals, Radon transforms, Green's functions, and analyticity of
              generalized functions.  He will study coalescent versuq uniform estimates for
              oscillatory integrals, the singular integral equations for large N field
              theories, and the problem of analytic continuation for divergent integrals on
              the moduli space of Riemann surfaces.  He will also investigate potential
              connections with the cut-off phenomenon in probability theory, molecular
              collisions in chemistry, string theory, and two-dimensional models of quark
              confinement.    The mathematics underlying this research is harmonic analysis,
              which has as its origins the attempt to approximate an arbitrary function by a
              linear combination of very regular, much in the way that a sound wave is
              approximated by a sum of its pure tones.
