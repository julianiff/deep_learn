              Proposal:  9505583  PI:  Ker-Chau Li  Institution:  UCLA  Title:  High
              Dimensional Data Analysis      Abstract:    The research concerns the
              development of new statistical methods   for exploring nonlinearity in high
              dimensional data.  Two tools,   sliced inverse regression (SIR) and principal
              Hessian directions   (PHD), have been developed based on a dimension reduction 
               theory which underlies the investigator's approach in the   high-Dimension
              area.  To continue this line of research, the   investigator studies several
              new problems which have more   complicated structures than the basic regression
              formulation.    The research topics include the generalization of SIR/PHD to  
              multiple outcomes, development of PHD-based tree-structured   methods, study of
              visualization for mathematical/physical/computer   models, and analysis of
              nonlinear time series data.    The research takes a  combination of dynamic
              graphics, computation,   and statistical theory to study high dimensional data.
              Dimensionality is   one of the most challenging problems in maly scientific
              areas today.     Immediate applications of these research results include
              analysis of   longitudinal data in biomedical, socio-economic, or industrial
              studies,   and groundwater modeling in hydrological studies.
