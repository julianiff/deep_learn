               Title: WORKSHOP ON MODEL UNCERTAINTY AND MODEL ROBUSTNESS                     
                      PROJECT ABSTRACT    In recent years, advances in statistical
              methodology and computing have made available powerful modeling tools in a
              variety of areas. Along with the added modeling flexibility, increasing
              attention is being directed to assessing the consequences of modeling
              assumptions on results. Debates on the effect of modeling assumptions on
              crucial scientific and pmlicy prediction, such as global warming and the health
              impact of toxic waste, have reached the mass media.  This award supports travel
              to a workshop in Bath, UK, that will  discuss these issues.    Travel to a 
              workshop on model uncertainty and model robustness---the quantitative
              exploration of the mapping from assumptions to conclusions will be supported. 
              The workshop will  blend methodology and case studies.  The workshop has the
              potential to significantly advance this field of statistical research and
              encourage dissemination of an important class of modeling techniques to
              practitioners. The goals of the workshop are: a) to help eliciting current
              issues and methods from a host of different application areas and disciplines;
              b) to favor wider utilization of worthy practical approaches and solutions
              developed in specific fields; c) to advance understanding of relative merits of
              existing tools ad approaches, and d) to point to directions for future
              methodological developments.  The workshop is international, which is a
              reflection on the composition of the research community in this area.  
              Participants supported with the award represents a balance between senior and
              junior researchers as well as women and minorities.
