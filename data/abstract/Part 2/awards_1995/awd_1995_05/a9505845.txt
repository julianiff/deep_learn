Abstract    :
              9505845  Magliveras       This research explores a new lossless image
              compression  technique.  The method is based on optimal non-linear codes of 
              spanning trees.  Maximum compression rates occur for codes of a  certain
              critical covering radius, whose value depends on the  statistical
              characteristics of the image.  The method utilizes  variable image-scanning
              using codes of spanning trees to maximize  compression ratios.  Compression
              rates are expected to be  significantly better than those achieved by previous
              methods.  ***
