              mos    The Information Superhighway and the Decentralization of  Organizations 
                The "Information Superhighway" promises to lead to the massive  dispersion of
              information-handling activities.  What does a large  organization lose and what
              does it gain when it replaces face-to-  face exchange of information among a
              large group of persons with  decentralizion to many remote sites? How does a
              decentralized  organization, which has a common task, make the best use of the 
              information infrastructure that ties it together? How should the  costs of the
              infrastructure, and of the local networks that  connect to it, be measured and
              how should the costs be divided up  among the users.  This research project
              aims to clarify and study  these complex questions.  One segment of the program
              is the  modeling of real organizations; another is the development of new 
              theory; and a third is the empirical study of a continually  accumulating
              database on Internet usage at Berkeley, which will  convert into a "testbed"
              for the experimental study of  alternative schemes for allocating network
              resources among users.  One aim of the empirical work is the (paper) design of
              an "On-  line University".  In all parts of the research project, problems 
              will be studied from the viewpoints of several disciplines:  economics,
              computer science, electrical engineering, and  operations research.
