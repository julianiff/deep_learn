              Title:  Model Selection for Mixtures      Abstract    This research is
              concerned with the problem of selecting a  suitable model when the competing
              models involve mixtures of  distributions.  Criteria for model selection among
              mixtures and  convolutions of exponential distributions are proposed and shown 
              to be asymptotically close to Bayes procedures.  The performance  of the
              criteria are compared to that of complexity based model  selection criteria. 
              The methodology is then applied to data from  ethological science.  The case of
              mixtures of multiple regression  models and logistic regression models is also
              considered and  applied to the problem of testing for son preference in
              Vietnam,  using data from the Vietnam Living Standard Survey.      In many
              modeling situations, a single model is not suitable for  all the data.  For
              example, when investigating whether there is  significant statistical evidence
              of son preference (preference for  boys over girls) in countries such as
              Vietnam, the problem is   complicated by the fact that some families display
              son preference  and some do not.  In ethological science, an area of behavioral
                science concerned with detailed observation and recording of the  behavior of
              one or more individuals, interesting questions arise  as to whether a behavior
              can be split into consecutive activities  or is a mixture of several
              activities.  These problems can be   addressed by modeling with statistical
              mixtures.
