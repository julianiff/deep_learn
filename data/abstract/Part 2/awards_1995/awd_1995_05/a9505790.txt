Abstract    :
              IRI-9505790  Rao, H. Raghav  SUNY-Buffalo  $44, 498 - 12 mos      This research
              is in discrete resource allocation among multiple  agents in an environment of
              incomplete information.  The problem  is considered from the viewpoint of a
              coordinator.  The existence  of incomplete information makes the issues
              involved particularly  complex.  A decision and information theoretic
              perspective is  being used to study multiple information structures, the nature
               of information flows, computational costs, and team problem  solving.  A
              comparative analysis of various information and  communication structures for
              multi-agent decision-making will be  undertaken, based on the concepts of
              spatial and logical entropy,  with all of the likely significant costs included
              in the  analysis.  The results are expected to be significant both for  the
              practical use of decision and information theoretic models  and for providing
              insights into harder problems in discrete  resource allocation under incomplete
              information.
