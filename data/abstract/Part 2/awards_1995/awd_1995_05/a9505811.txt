Abstract    :
              9505811  JACKSON    This research is to compute the incremental stress tensor in
              the  upper crust of southern California as a function of time since  1850, and
              compare observed seismicity with the estimated stress  increment at the time of
              the earthquake.  Several recent  developments make this possible to do more
              realistically than  before: 1) a wealth of new geodetic and geologic data for
              southern  California, 2) a model for calculating elastic stress accumulation 
              in a faulted medium that has been adjusted to fit these new data,  and 3) a
              catalog of moment tensors for all earthquakes with  magnitude larger than 6
              since 1850.  This research is a component  of the National Earthquake Hazard
              Reduction Program.  ***
