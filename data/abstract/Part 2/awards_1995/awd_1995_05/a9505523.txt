Abstract    :
              9505523  Williams    This U.S.-Russian Cooperative Research grant is for "SO2
              and  Trace Metal Fluxes from Kudriavy Volcano, Kurile Islands  (Russia)" is
              between Dr. Stanley Williams of Arizona State  University and Russian
              scientists from: the Institute of  Experimental Mineralogy (Moscow), the
              Institute of Volcanic  Geology and Geochemistry (Petropavlask-Kamchatsky), and
              the  Institute of Volcanology and Geodynamics (Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk).    Kudriavy
              volcano is a perfect location of studying metal fluxes  from magmas due to its
              extremely high fumarole temperature (up to  940  C), strong gas flux, common
              calc-alkaline andesitic  composition, and the lack of a hydrothermal system
              which would  interact with the magmatic gases to change their composition. 
              Studying metal fluxes at these purely magmatic high temperature  conditions
              will help further to constrain the mass of metals  degassing from calc-alkaline
              magma bodies, in general.  The  research will: (1) measure SO2 flux by COSPEC
              and determine rare  metal fluxes; (2) direct fumarole gas sampling to determine
              the  isotopic composition of O, H, S, C, N, and He in highly magmatic,  arc
              type volcanic gases and investigate the effects of  temperature on the isotopic
              compositions; (3) make inferences on  the ultimate origins of the rare metals
              using obtained data; and  (4) measure SO2 flux from other volcanoes nearby on
              the Kurile  Arc: Baranski, Ivan Grozniy, and Burevestnik.      This proposed
              research in geological sciences fulfills the  program objectives of advancing
              science by enabling leading  experts in the U.S. and Russia to combine
              complementary talents  and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual
              interest  and competence.  The workshop will also be used to promote the 
              interest of graduate and undergraduate students in particle  physics.  ***
