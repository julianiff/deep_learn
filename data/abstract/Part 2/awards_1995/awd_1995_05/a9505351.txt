Abstract    :
              9505351  Cook      The International Junior Investigator and Postdoctoral 
              Fellows Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to  conduct three to
              twenty-four months of research abroad. The  program's awards provide
              opportunities for joint research,  and the use of unique or complementary
              facilities, expertise  and experimental conditions abroad.    This award will
              support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Carolyn D. Cook to
              work with Mr. Mateus  Kilmaskossu at Cenderawasih in Irian Jaya, Indonesia.   
              The goal of this project is to plan and do research towards  developing the
              potential of indigenous Pandanus agroforestry  with the Amung-me people of
              Irian Jaya, Indonesia.  They  will conduct background research providing the
              basis for  this development which will promote biodiversity while  creating a
              sustainable enterprise.  These people have no  sources of income but desire to
              enter a new market system in  their province.  They lack the skills and
              education to mine  at the nearby mining company.  These two elements make them 
              ripe to learn a new area of specialization which could raise  their self
              esteem, plus allow them to make a living.  This  project aims to establish a
              network of communication and  exchange of knowledge among faculty and students
              of  Cenderawasih University, the Amung-me, government officials, 
              non-government organizations, future researchers and beyond.  ***
