Abstract    :
              9505697  Fox-Farsi-Yu    This is an award to hold a special year in the
              interdisciplinary  areas of index theory, coarse geometry and topology of
              manifolds  at the University of Colorado Boulder. The purpose of this  special
              year is to bring together mathematical analysts and  topologists in this area
              for fruitful interactions. The special  year will start with a CBMS conference
              "Index Theory, Coarse  Geometry, and Topology of Manifolds" and will end with a
               conference "K-homology, Index Theory, and Geometry". There will  also be a
              workshop for graduate students to introduce them to  this research field.
              Visiting experts will be in residence to  serve as the nucleus of this
              activity.  ***
