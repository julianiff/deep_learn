Abstract    :
              9505579  Fornari       This is a detailed filed investigation of the relation 
              between volcanic and tectonic features, and the distribution of  hydrothermal
              activity and associated biological communities at  the Lucky Strike segment of
              the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.  The aims of  the program are to map the Lucky Strike
              hydrothermal vent field,  to determine the geographic distribution, structure
              and  biological characteristics of the vent sites, to obtain a  detailed
              geological data set for a magmatically robust slow-  spreading ridge segment,
              and to sample using the ROV Jason the  fluids, biota, and sulfide substrates.
