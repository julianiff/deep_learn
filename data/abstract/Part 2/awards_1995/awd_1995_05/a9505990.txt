Abstract    :
              9505990  Gurnis   This award provides 55% of the funds required for the
              acquisition of a computer system that will be installed and operated in the
              Seismological Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology. Caltech is
              committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for the acquisition.   The
              equipment will be used primarily in computer-intensive research that includes
              geophysical modeling of the structure and processes occurring in the Earth's
              crust and mantle regions. It will be managed as a research and teaching
              resource available to staff and students involved in solid earth sciences
              research at Caltech.  ***
