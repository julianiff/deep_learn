Abstract    :
              9505898  Salyers  DNA transfer by conjugation from bacteria to plants and from
              bacteria to yeast has been demonstrated, but transfer of bacterial DNA to
              mammalian cells has not been reported. The lack of evidence for DNA transfer
              from bacteria to mammalian cells is probably due to the failure to look for
              such events in the right way rather than to the absence of such events in
              nature.  The first systematic attempt to determine whether bacteria can
              transfer DNA to mammalian cells under laboratory conditions is being
              undertaken.  Since this is a high risk project, the project is focused on a
              single achievable goal, whose accomplishment will determine the feasibility of
              further work in this area.  Specifically, shuttle plasmids that can replicate
              in mammalian cells as well as in bacteria are being constructed, and broad host
              range conjugal elements of bacteria are being tested for the ability to
              mobilize the shuttle plasmids to mammalian cells.  %%%  This Small Grant for
              Exploratory Research takes advantage of the unique qualifications of this
              researcher to test for the possible ability of bacterial cells to transfer
              genes to animal cells.  If such transfer is demonstrated, it would have
              important implications for genetic studies of animals, both from an
              evolutionary point of view and as a new technique for the genetic manipulation
              of animal cells  ***
