Abstract    :
              9505421  Amado       Low energy nuclear physics theory should be derived  from
              the fundamental theory of the strong interactions,  quantum chromodynamics or
              QCD.  The difficulty is that the  principal ingredients of low energy nuclear
              phenomena, the  nucleon, pions, the nuclear force...are not simple features  of
              QCD but rather come out from the nonperturbative domain  of that theory.  Hence
              obtaining low energy nuclear physics  from QCD is a difficult task.  Happily,
              classical QCD is  also obtained from the nonperturbative end of the theory.  We
              have begun to show that starting from classical QCD and  reintroducing some
              leading quantum corrections one can  understand low energy nuclear physics
              phenomena as disparate  as the static nuclear force, nucleon-antinucleon 
              annihilation at rest and the disoriented chiral condensate.  Here we propose to
              continue these investigations with a view  to improving their predictive power
              and widening their  investigations with a view to improving their predictive 
              power and widening their domain of application.  Our major  effort will be on
              annihilation and on the disoriented chiral  condensate while we continue to
              search for new avenues for  application of our classical/quantum approach to
              QCD in  nuclear physics.  ***
