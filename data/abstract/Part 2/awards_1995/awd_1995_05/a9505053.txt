Abstract    :
              9505053  Casson       Casson will study the Geometrization Conjecture for 3- 
              dimensional manifolds, proposed by Thurston in 1982.  A proof of  this
              conjecture would complete the topological classification of  closed
              3-manifolds, provide insight into topological properties of  3-manifolds, and
              lead to efficient methods to determine whether two  given 3-manifolds are
              topologically equivalent.  Casson will  explore a very direct approach to
              Thurston's conjecture; given a  topological description of a 3-manifold M, he
              will attempt to find  triangulations of M that are closely related to a
              geometric  structure on M.  Kirby will continue his work (often with Paul 
              Melvin) in Topological Quantum Field Theory.  He will try to  explain the
              Kontsevich and Vassiliev invariants, using  intersections of certain
              codimension-two manifolds in a  compactification of products of the given
              3-manifold with diagonals  deleted.  He will also continue to study the
              formulae for the  Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants, looking for topological
               interpretations and applications.       Since the space that we live in is
              three-dimensional, and all  our lives we perfect our three-dimensional
              geometric intuition  simply by going about our everyday business, it is always 
              surprising to the layman to learn that mathematicians' are  frequently more
              capable of answering questions about higher  dimensional geometric objects than
              about the analogous objects in  dimension three.  This is, however, very much
              the case.  The most  famous outstanding conjecture in topology is the
              three-dimensional  Poincare conjecture, made at the turn of the century.  On
              the other  hand, its higher dimensional analogues have all been settled.  The 
              research of this project is directly addressed to these notoriously 
              recalcitrant problems.  ***
