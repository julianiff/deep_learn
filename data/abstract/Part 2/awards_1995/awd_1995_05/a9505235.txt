Abstract    :
              EAR-9505235  Kedar, Sharon    Proposed broadband modeling of volcanic seismic
              sources will be used to evaluate the fluid volume changes and mass transport
              that take place during volcanic activity, as well as to resolve the source
              geometry of the seismic activity.  The broadband seismic data will be collected
              on Kilauea, Hawaii, and Stromboli, southern Italy, over the next two years.  To
              date, seismologists have not exploited the new broadband date for the study of
              volcanic processes.  Although it is a difficult problem, the results could be
              very useful for responding to volcanic hazards.  The simple harmonic behavior
              of volcanic ground motion (Oharmonic tremorsO) renders their interpretation
              from band-limited data ambiguous, as any source that tends to resonate may be
              responsible.  The complex stratigraphy and materials with widely ranging
              seismic velocities adds complex path effects to the problem.  The broadband
              signature of volcanic events has already highlighted source processes that
              could not be deduced in the past; broadband seismograms promise to
              revolutionize the study of volcanic tremors in the same way that they have
              impacted earthquake studies in recent years.
