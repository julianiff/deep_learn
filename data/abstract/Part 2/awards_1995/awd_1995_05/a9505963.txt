Abstract    :
              9505963  Mao        Data traffic in networks has always been dominated by file 
              transfers. In today's high-volume applications like the Internet  bulletin
              boards, most files are simple text files.  In the future,  files are expected
              to consist of hypertext documents, with  significant audio and video
              components.  Already, a few seconds of  low-quality audio occupy hundreds of
              kilobytes.  These numbers are  indicative of the large sizes of future
              multimedia files.  Other  applications of the future which are thought to
              involve large file  sizes are those arising from scientific applications,
              large-scale  databases and network-wide system backups.       In this proposal
              the principal investigators take issue with  the notion that large files should
              be routed as small files  conventionally are -- by breaking up the file into
              packets and  relying on packet routing algorithms.  They examine and propose to
               study the problem of scheduling large file transfers.  Past  approaches
              traditionally avoid collecting information across  networks to schedule
              particular files, simply because the overhead  of doing so overwhelms any
              benefits accrued in computing optimal  schedules.  However, when file sizes are
              very large and are also  known in advance of transmission, it makes eminent
              sense to collect  information and compute good schedules, thus utilizing
              network  resources efficiently. The researchers will formulate a file  transfer
              scheduling problem, argue its importance, assess  shortcomings in the available
               research on this problem and outline  issues for future research.    ***
