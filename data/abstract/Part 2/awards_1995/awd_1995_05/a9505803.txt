              Proposal #:  9505803      PROJECT ABSTRACT       Pheromonal regulation of
              invertebrate reproduction influences several fundamental ecological processes
              in the sea, e.g., recruitment, fecundity, and population growth rate.  Chemical
              communication is also crucial to locating conspecifics, recognizing potential
              mates, and transferring sperm.  Despite the evolutionary significance of these
              chemical signals, little is known about the type of molecules employed and the
              basis for discrimination.  The main objectives of this research are:  1)to
              identify one class of chemicals (=glycoproteins) responsible for mate
              recognition in marine copepods, 2) to investigate their range of polymorphism
              within and between species, and 3) to examine their role in the maintenance of
              productive isolation among species.
