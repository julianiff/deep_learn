Abstract    :
              9505534  Bray    The XIII International Symposium on Nuclear Quadrupole 
              Interactions will be held July 23-28, 1995 at Brown  University in Providence,
              Rhode Island.  The symposium will  be devoted to all aspects of NQI in gases,
              liquids and  solids covering both experimental and theoretical work e.g. 
              microwave measurements in gas phase, Mossbauer spectroscopy,  NMR, ESR, NQI,
              quadrupolar interactions in superconductors,  metals, biological and polymeric
              materials. There will be  several plenary lectures given by the internationally
              known  scientists in the field.  Scientific papers will be reported  in the
              oral and poster presentations at the meeting.      %%%      This symposium
              presents a unique opportunity for  international scientists to present
              multidisciplinary  research results in broad classes of materials and enable 
              students to interact with world-class scientists.      ***
