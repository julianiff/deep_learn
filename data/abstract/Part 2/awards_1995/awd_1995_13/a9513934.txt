Abstract    :
              This award supports Professor E. James Davis and graduate  students of the
              University of Washington to collaborate in  their research in aerosol chemistry
              with Professor Gustav  Schweiger of the Ruhr University of Bochum, Germany. 
              They  share an interest in chemical reactions in aerosols which  are associated
              with atmospheric pollution and ozone  depletion.  Professor Davis has unique
              facilities featuring  the coupling of electrodynamic balances with Raman 
              spectroscopy, which are particularly well suited for the  study of relatively
              slow gas/aerosol chemical reactions.  Professor Schweiger has developed unique
              facilities which  combine the vibrating orifice drop generator with Raman 
              instruments, an approach which is well-suited to the study  of rapid reactions.
              Joining of their complementary expertise  and facilities will be mutually
              beneficial.  Microparticles play an important role in atmospheric  phenomena.
              Condensation nuclei affect cloud microphysics,  and nucleation and growth
              phenomena dominate cloud physics.  In addition to their chemical role,
              microdroplets can serve  as optical cavities, and resonances arise from
              interference  of the internally reflected and refracted light, which 
              complicate analytical inferences.  This collaboration  addresses the
              interaction between elastic and inelastic  (Raman) scattering which is unique
              to microdroplets, and how  this interaction affects measurement of chemical
              reactions  of particular significance in atmospheric chemistry.
