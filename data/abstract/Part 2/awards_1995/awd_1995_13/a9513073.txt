Abstract    :
              9513073  Qu      This award supports US participation in a bilateral US-China 
              workshop on basic research issues and emerging technologies  in the areas of
              mechanics and processing of advanced  materials.  US participants will be
              chosen from applicants  within ten years of their Ph.D.  The purpose of the
              workshop  is to provide an opportunity for young investigators from  the two
              countries to exchange ideas and develop partnerships  for cooperative research
              in important areas of advanced  materials research.    The workshop topic is
              timely and of common interest. The  area of advanced materials is critically
              important to both  China and the US.  The Chinese PI, Dr. Yang Wei of Tsinghua 
              University, Beijing, earned a Ph.D. at Brown University and  is a regular
              contributor to refereed journals.  He was named  one of China's top ten young
              scientists in 1994, and  maintains strong research collaborations within and
              external  to China.  In a September 1995 report published by NIST on  materials
              research in China, a number of recommendations for  improving the cooperation
              in materials science were made.  One calls for increased scientist to scientist
              interaction  to define research opportunities for collaboratimn.  This 
              workshop should be an important first step in allowing new  US investigators to
              see the research programs in China and  to define where collaboration will
              advance US interests in  materials science.  The workshop will be held in
              August 1996  at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.  ***
