Abstract    :
                   Recent experiments at the Michigan State cyclotron, the SPS  at CERN, and
              future experiments at RHIC at Brookhaven National  Laboratory promise to create
              conditions where enough heat is  supplied to dissolve nuclear matter into
              constituent protons and  neutrons at cyclotron energies, and to vaporize the
              matter into  constituent quarks and gluons at the large facilities.  At these 
              higher energies, the structure of the vacuum itself should  actually melt for a
              brief instant throughout the nuclear volume.  Since these collisions result in
              the emission of thousands of  subatomic particles from a single event, the
              promise of various  experimental observables and signals depends crucially on 
              experimental details regarding the geometry, acceptance and  resolution of the
              detectors.  By collaborating closely with  experimental groups and by carefully
              modeling the collisions and  the experimental response, we hope to resolve
              several outstanding  questions regarding the nature of these fundamental phase 
              transitions.
