Abstract    :
                  This  proposal requests funds to dramatically increase the  sensitivity  of
              calorimeters used to study biological systems. The ultimate goals in  this  
              calorimetry   includes  the  study  of  the  thermodynamics   of 
              protein-protein  and protein-DNA interactions, the  thermodynamics  and 
              kinetics  of  drug  binding  (both proteins and  DNA),  drug  occupancy 
              studies,  and  studies  of  protein  folding.  Dr.  Hellman  has   used 
              semiconductor-based     micromachining    technology     to     develop 
              microcalorimeters  for  measuring  the  specific  heat  of  thin   film 
              materials  of interest to solid state physics. These devices have  been 
              successfully used to measure a wide variety of materials, all less than  5000 
              A thick and weighing under 10 ,u g; it is not an exaggeration  to  say  that 
              these measurements could not be made anywhere  else  in  the  world. There is
              however one requirement to all the measurements made to  date  using  these 
              microcalorimeters: measurements  must  be  made  in  vacuum. This requirement
              is due to the excess thermal conductance  from  the sample area to the
              surrounding environment which would occur if the  measurements  were  attempted
              in a gas or in  water  vapor.  Biological  systems  however cannot be held in
              vacuum; they are typically based  in  an  aqueous solution which would
              evaporate. A proposed modification  of  Dr.  Hellman's work will allow use in
              xenon saturated with water  vapor  and   will   produce  calorimeters  capable 
              of  much  more   sensitive  measurements  than  is  presently  possible. 
              Because  many  of   these  biological systems are only available in minute
              quantities,  this  work  would be of great significance for basic research on
              macromolecules not  accessible to present methods .
