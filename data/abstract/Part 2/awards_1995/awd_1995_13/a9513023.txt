Abstract    :
                   A multi-user group proposes to purchase a phosphorimager for the  rapid,
              sensitive, and accurate detection and quantitation of  radioactive and
              chemiluminescent species in analyses of the molecular  genetics of signal
              transduction, DNA replication, and gene expression.  Specific projects include
              analysis of the mechanism by which DNA  replication is initiated in eukaryotic
              cells and how this process is  regulated; the mechanism of activation of Ras
              proteins by receptor  tyrosine kinases and the identification of downstream
              targets of  activated Ras proteins; the dissection of protein-protein
              interactions  that regulate transcription of genes in eukaryotic cells by RNA 
              polymerase II; testing models for the structure of large RNA molecules  and
              determination of the ways in which RNA structure can influence gene 
              expression, and exploration of signal transduction pathways involved in  cell
              growth and development. Specific applications that will utilize  the
              phosphorimager include in vivo radiolabelling of proteins;  determination of
              protein half-life; analysis of protein  posttranslational modificatimns,
              subcellular localization and  oligomeric states; analysis of protein-protein,
              protein-nucleic acid,  and intranucleic acid interactions; analysis of
              transcriptional control  elements; analysis of in vivo and in vitro DNA
              replication products.  The results of these studies will significantly extend
              our  understanding of basic cellular processes.
