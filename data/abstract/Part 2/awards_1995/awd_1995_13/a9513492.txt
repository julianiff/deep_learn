Abstract    :
              9513492  Lattman  The 1996 Johns Hopkins Protein Folding Meeting will be held
              16-19 March 1996 at the Coolfont Conference Center, located about 2 hours from
              Baltimore and Washington in Berkeley Springs West Virginia.  The meeting will
              include 4 three-hour sessions of presented talks, planned and chaired by
              leaders in the field.  Additional events include the first Christian Anfinsen
              Lecture, a poster session, and the opportunity for informal exchanges. 
              Material from the meeting will be published in Proteins:  Structure, Function
              and Genetics.  %%%  Protein folding is the name given to the process by which
              protein molecules assume their normal functional form.  In cells protein
              molecules are manufactured in the form of flexibly, extended chains - rather
              like a microscopic piece of cooked spaghetti.  Each strand then spontaneously
              folds up into a compact ball that represents the active form of the protein
              molecule - the so-called native state.  The remarkable fact is that all the
              molecules of a particular protein fold up into exactly the same native state.  
              In contrast, if one folds up individual strands of spaghetti, say by putting
              them in a spoon, each of the strands will fold up in a different way.  Protein
              molecules are called chains because they are built up as a sequence of chemical
              links called amino acids.  there are 20 different amino acid types.  The
              information telling the protein how to fold up is contained in the sequence of
              the amino acids in the protein chain. The 1996 Johns Hopkins Protein Folding
              Meeting will gather together experts from all over the world to present and
              discuss new research on various aspects of protein folding.  Topics will
              include attempts to predict the native structure of a protein, and studies on
              the details of the actual folding process.  Funds are requested to defray the
              costs of attendance for speakers and students.  ***
