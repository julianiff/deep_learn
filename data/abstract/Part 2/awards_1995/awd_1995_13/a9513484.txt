Abstract    :
              This award supports collaboration in molecular biology between the research
              groups of Harry F. Noller at the University of California at Santa Cruz and
              Wolfgang Wintermeyer of the Institute for Molecular Biology of the University
              of Witten-Herdecke, Germany.  In particular, it will involve research visits to
              Germany by Kevin Wilson, a U.S. postdoctoral fellow.  The proposed research is
              focused on understanding the mechanism of ribosomal translocation.  One
              objective is to map an intermediate state of the transfer RNA-ribosome complex.
               A second is to map the sites of interaction of elongation factor EF-G with the
              ribosomal RNA.  Both tasks will require the combination of special ribosomal
              materials prepared by the German group and state of the art chemical probing
              methods developed by the U.S. group.  The planned collaboration between these
              two experienced research groups will contribute valuable new information on the
              precise process of translocation and the formation of intermediates by
              transfer-RNA on ribosomes during protein biosynthesis.  This is an area of
              active interest in molecular biology.
