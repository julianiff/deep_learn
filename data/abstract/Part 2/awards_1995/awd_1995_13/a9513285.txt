Abstract    :
                                                                                         
              9513285  ffrench-Constant      This award will provide partial travel support
              for  Dr. Richard ffrench-Constant, and two of his graduate students,  from the
              Department of Entomology at the University of Wisconsin,  to conduct
              collaborative research with Dr. Stephen C. Trowell of  the Australian CSIRO
              Division of Entomology, Black Mountain  Laboratory, in Canberra.  The focus of
              the research is on  technology transfer gained in the analysis of Drosophila 
              cytochrome P450 to the economically important pest Helicoverpa,  species of
              which show P450 mediated resistance to pyrethroid  insecticides.    The more
              specific objectives of this collaborative study are: 1)  to document cytochrome
              P450's role in insecticide resistant  strains of Drosophila; 2) to clone
              homologous P450's from  resistant strains of Helicoverpa; and,  3) to examine
              the role of  resistance conferring P450's from both Helicoverpa and  
              Drosophila in insecticide metabolism following functional  expression of
              recombinant clones.  The budworm, Helicoverpa, is  the primary pest of cotton
              in both the United States and  Australia.  The pest is currently being
              controlled using  pyrethroids, but the mechanism of pyrethroid resistance is
              not  known.  This collaborative study aims to define the precise  mechanisms of
              pyrethroid metabolism in resistant strains in order  to look for selective P450
              inhibitors or synergists, and to  enable a rational choice of effective
              pyrethroid compounds and  alternative pesticides.  The collaboration is
              supported in   Australia through the Department of Industry, Science and 
              Tourism (DIST).
