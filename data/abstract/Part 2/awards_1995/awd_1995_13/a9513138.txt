Abstract    :
              9513105  Stern  This award supports the participation of 12 U.S. scientists  in
              a  U.S.-Japan workshop and field trip, to be held near  Tokyo from July 27 to
              August 1. 1996. The co-organizers are  Dr. Robert Stern of the University of
              Texas at Dallas and  Professor Makoto Arima of the Yokohama National
              University.  The main purpose of this meeting is to discuss the state of 
              present understanding of the 3000 km long Izu-Bonin-Mariana  convergent margin
              (IBM arc system), and to develop plans for  future cooperative research
              programs in this arc system.  A  total of 12 Japanese, 12 U.S., and 3 foreign
              scientists will  participate.  Five aspects of the IBM arc will be the focus 
              of the workshop and field trip:  1) Generation of arc and  back-arc basin
              magmas; 2) Early arc history and forearc  evolution; 3) Back-arc basin
              evolution; and 4) Hydrothermal  processes and ore deposits; and 5) Crustal and
              lithospheric  structure.    The U.S. participants provide a broad cross section
              of  expertise and geographical representation in the area of  Western Pacific
              convergent margin  processes, and were  selected on the basis of being the most
              active researchers  in the U.S.  Therefore, this proposal fulfills the 
              objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of  scientific knowledge
              through an international collaboration.  ***
