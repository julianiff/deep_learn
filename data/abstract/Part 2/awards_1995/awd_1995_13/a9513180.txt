Abstract    :
                    9513180  Macalady      This award will partially support the travel of  
              Dr. Donald Macalady of the Department of Chemistry and  Geochemistry at the
              Colorado School of Mines to conduct   collaborative research with Prof. Keith
              Hunter, Department  of Chemistry, at the University of Otago in Dunedin,  New
              Zealand.  The research will focus on the role of natural  organic matter (NOM)
              as an electron transport mediator in a  variety of chemical reactions of
              natural and anthropogenic  substances.    The research will be guided by the
              hypothesis that NOM can serve  as a general electron transfer mediator for
              oxidation/reduction  reactions in aqueous systems and that the mechanisms of
              these  reactions involve a specific set of reaction centers within the 
              structure of NOH.  Southern New Zealand provides an excellent  environment for
              such investigations.  Few other locations provide  as many types of aquatic
              environments from pristine oligotropic  lakes through estuarine marshes to the
              oceanic environments  within short distances.  The combination of the
              experience of the  American investigator in redox chemistry of NOM and the
              interests  and facilities of the New Zealand collaborator are ideal for  
              conducting this multidisciplinary study.
