Abstract    :
                    9513945  Wu    This is a two-year award proposed by Dr. Francis Wu, SUNY
              at  Binghamton and Professor Yih-Hsiung  Yeh, Institute of Earth Sciences,
              Academia Sinica in Taiwan.  This proposal requests funds for travel  to Taiwan
              and for supporting one graduate student to analyze  the data collected by the
              R/V Ewing.  The goal of this study is to understand mountain buildup in  the
              Taiwan arc-continent collision.  The  information collected both from the R/V
              Ewing and from the  Chinese Petroleum Company can provide useful insights 
              regarding deep crustal structures.  This project also  provides opportunities
              for a U.S.  graduate student to work with a unique set of data and to  gain
              international research experience at a  top research institute in Taiwan.  The
              project is jointly  supported by the Taiwan National Science Council and the 
              NSF.
