Abstract    :
              9513010  Russell  The Joint Institute for Energy and Environment at the
              University of Tennessee, a collaborative arrangement of the University of
              Tennessee, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the Tennessee Valley Authority,
              will establish the NSF National Center for Environmental Decision-Making
              Research (the Center).  The Center will engage environmental decision makers,
              primarily at the subnational level, with the processes and data they need to
              confront and solve difficult environmental decision problems.  Now, and even
              more in the future, these decision makers are the ones critical to achieving
              measurable improvement in the environment at acceptable social and economic
              costs.  Yet they are ill-equipped to know how their decisions should be
              effectively structured to assure effective implementation.  The Center will
              improve environmental decision making by performing a series of complementary
              tasks:  (1) synthesizing and analyzing  existing research to provide in an
              accessible form findings relevant to improving environmental decision making; 
              (2) performing case studies of decisions made (or not made) in response to
              environmental problems as a diagnostic tool to illuminate what has been and
              what remains to be learned; (3) assembling a toolkit of processes and
              techniques that decision makers can use in addressing their environmental
              problems;  (4) designing a 21st century information system to support decision
              makers; (5) involving decision makers as both partners in the research and
              clients for its products.  %%%%  9513010  Russell  The Joint Institute for
