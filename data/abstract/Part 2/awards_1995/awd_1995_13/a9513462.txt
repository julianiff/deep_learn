Abstract    :
                    9513462  Berndt    This award will support the travel and minor research
              costs for   five American investigators under the direction  of  Dr.
              Christopher Berndt, Department of Materials Science and  Engineering from the
              State University of New York at Stony Brook,  to enable the group to conduct
              cooperative research regarding the  thermal spray processing of polymers with a
              group of Australian  researchers from the Department of Materials Engineering
              at  Monash University under the guidance of Prof. George Simon.    The project
              aims to improve the quality and types of polymers and  composites that can be
              thermally sprayed as coatings on metallic  substrates.  Lower melting points
              and the macromolecular  structure will influence lamellae formation, diffusion
              and  oxidation mechanisms.  This project brings together the thermal  spray
              expertise from the American researchers with the Australian  polymer experts. 
              Fundamental explanations will provide insight  to polymer adhesion and
              environmental degradation.  This research  is important in promoting the
              technology into petrochemical and  automotive industries requiring corrmsion
              resistant barrier  coatings.  The collaboration in Australia is supported
              through  the Department of Industry, Science and Technology.
