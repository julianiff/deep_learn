Abstract    :
              9513051  Gonzalez    This U.S.-Argentina collaborative research effort between 
              Tulane University and INCAPE petrochemical institute in  Santa Fe, Argentina
              will investigate the synthesis,  characterization, and application of supported
              metal  catalysts prepared by the sol-gel method. More specifically, 
              experiments will include sol-gel preparation of bimetallic  catalysts,
              preparation and testing of catalytic membranes,  and synthesis of platinized
              sulfated zirconia.  Primarily  focusing on the last of these, Richard Gonzalez
              of Tulane  will work with Carlos Apesteguia of INCAPE to prepare and  test such
              materials as catalysts in the oxidation of CO and  other reactions.    The
              international collaboration brings together the  expertise of Apesteguia in
              catalyst poisoning and  deactivation with that of Gonzalez in sol-gel
              preparation.  Research will take place in both laboratories with annual  visits
              by the PI to Argentina and one visit from Argentina  to the U.S.  ***
