Abstract    :
              9513084  Olson    This award supports the participation of 15 U.S. scientists 
              in a U.S.-Japan seminar entitled "Molecular Dynamics of  Ligand Binding to
              Myoglobins and Related Heme Proteins" to  be held at Rice University in
              Houston, Texas on March 2-5,  1997. The co-organizers are Professor John S.
              Olson from  Rice University and Professor Teizo Kitagawa from the  Institute
              for Molecular Science, Okazaki National Research  Institutes, Japan.  The
              specific aims of the seminar are to:  (1) summarize current successes in
              correlating computer  simulations with kinetic measurements of oxygen, carbon 
              monoxide, and nitric oxide binding to myoglobins and  hemoglobins; (2) identify
              key problems associated with  extending computations and structure
              determinations to  physiologically important time scales (nano- to 
              milliseconds); and (3) propose new approaches to address  these issues and
              their relationship to the design of heme  protein-based blood substitutes.  The
              long-term goals are to  create joint research programs between a cross section
              of  leading Japanese and American scientists which will push  further the
              limits of computational, protein engineering,  and time-resolved spectroscopic
              techniques, and which will  fulfill the objectives of the U.S./Japan Program
              through the  exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge by  international
              collaboration.  ***
