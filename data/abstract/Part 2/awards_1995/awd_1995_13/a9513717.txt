Abstract    :
              9513717  Yan       This proposal is to investigate the fundamental constituents 
              of matter and the forces between them on two fronts.  One aim is  to test and
              to extend the current understanding of the "Standard  Model" of subatomic
              phenomena in terms of quarks, leptons,  gluons, weak bosons, and their
              interactions.  This research will  also highlight the interplay between
              particle physics and  astrophysics, as well as mainstream topics in
              astrophysics such  as the mechanism for supernova explosions and the
              solar-neutrino  problem.  The second major theme is the search for a unified 
              theory of all interactions, and closely related problems in such  diverse
              fields as mathematical physics, statistical mechanis and  condensed matter
              physics.  ***
