Abstract    :
              HLAVIN  9513877  This conference, organised as a satellite to the annual meeting
              of the Society for Neuroscience, addresses a topic of rapidly growing
              importance in the understanding of brain development.  Adhesion molecules
              comprise a diverse set of substances that  regulate the development of the
              brain , and other tissues, by  means of intercellular signals which regulate
              the growth and formation of appropriate connections.  L1 is one such molecule. 
              When it is present in a mutant form, abnormal development results.  the
              conference will enable established and younger investigators form related
              disciplines to share new insights on the significance and mode of action  of
              L1.
