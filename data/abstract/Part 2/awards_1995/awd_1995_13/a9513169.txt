Abstract    :
              EEC-9513169  Baier    This award provides funding for a joint, international
              research collaborative program between the I/UCRC for Biological Surface
              Science at SUNY Buffalo and six scientists from three former Soviet Union (FSU)
              countries--Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.  The research will study the population
              dynamics of zebra mussels (Dreissen Sp.) in an effort to understand how
              environmental factors can play a role and manage zebra mussel populations in
              North America.    The researchers identified in this proposal have excellent
              backgrounds, expertise, and qualifications to perform the work described.  The
              importance of identifying mechanisms to control this biofouling organism in the
              U.S. and FSU is great.
