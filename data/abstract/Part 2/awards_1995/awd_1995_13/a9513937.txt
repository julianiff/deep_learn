Abstract    :
              This award supports Professors Dan Moldovan and Eric Lin and two graduate
              students, all from Southern Methodist University, to collaborate in computer
              science and engineering research with Professor H. Richter and others of the
              Computer Science Department of the Technical University of Munich, Germany. 
              They share an interest in parallel computing systems and in particular the
              architecture of the `Scalable Coherent Interface` (SCI) - based parallel
              computers.  Together they plan to study, design and evaluate a distributed
              computer system consisting of a network of multiprocessors.   The U.S. group
              has developed a parallel computer called `Semantic Network Array Processor`
              (SNAP), which they want to scale up.  The German group has done similar work
              with a network of multiprocessors.   Their joint effort will benefit from their
              complementary expertise in different operating systems, network architecture
              and approaches to parallel programming environments.  The increasing
              sophistication of microprocessors still lags behind the escalating demand in
              science and industry.  This research addresses scalability questions related to
              a new aggregation architecture for a Local-Area Multiprocessor (LAMP).  The
              objective is to satisfy rapidly evolving network user needs at the lowest long
              term cost and high efficiency.
