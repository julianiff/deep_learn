Abstract    :
                This international dissertation enhancement award will support travel and
              living expenses to the United Kingdom of Robert G. Stewart, a graduate student
              of  Donald W. Hall at the University of Florida.  Mr. Stewart will conduct
              studies in pest control with Alison Blackwell of the Unviersity of Dundee and
              John Pickett, Head, Biological and Ecological Chemistry Department at
              Rothamsted Agricultural Experimental Station in England.  The objective of the
              research is to evaluate the components of the yaupon holly, Ilex vomitoria, as
              possible attractants for suveillance and/or control of the insect Culicoides
              mississippiensis or salt marsh biting midge.  This insect is a major pest along
              the Florida gulf coast.  The proposed studies will identify a blend of
              potential attractrants through electroantennogram measurements and confirm the
              electrophysiological activity of the blend through bioassay methods.    The
              project takes advantage of unique expertise in the United Kingdom.  The UK
              researchers are expert in the development of electroantennogram techniques for
              very small delicate insects.   Their collaboration will advance understanding
              of insect-plant associations for control of insect pests and disease vectors.
