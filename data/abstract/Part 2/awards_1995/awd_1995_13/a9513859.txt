Abstract    :
              Recently, in collaboration with Dr. Tickle in England we have demonstrated in
              chick embryos, that applying a certain group of substances known as FGFs (for
              fibroblast growth factors) can induce limbs to form where they normally would
              not. This leads to the supposition that the FGFs are capable of transmitting
              the limb-growth signal. However none of the applied growth factors is expressed
              in the correct place or at the correct time in the embryo to be the true limb
              initiation signal. In this project we propose to study the role of another
              member of this family of genes, FGF-8. FGF-8 is expressed at the correct time
              and in the correct place in the developing embryo to initiate the process that
              leads to the formation of a limb. We will investigate whether applying this
              gene to the embryo elicits the formation of a limb and we will also try to
              block the function of these gene during normal development to convince us that
              FGF-8 is really doing the job of initiating formation of a limb in vivo. 
              Identifying the FGF family member that acts endogenously in limb induction
              would significantly increase our understanding of vertebrate embryology in
              general and of limb development in particular. This work should illuminate
              general mechanisms of cell signaling, which is probably the most important
              single mechanism that directs appropriate arrangement of tissues and cells in
              vertebrate embryos.
