Abstract    :
              9513671  Milgram    Cells are composed of a number of separate membrane bound 
              structures.  Each of these structures carries out a specific  function, such as
              energy production, degradation of old and damaged  proteins, and intercellular
              communication.  The proper functioning  of the cell depends upon the ability of
              the cell to direct each of  its many thousands of proteins to the correct
              structure.  There are  many cells, including those in the brain and endocrine
              glands,  which synthesize small chemical messengers called peptides.  Once 
              these small proteins are released into the intercellular space they  find their
              way to target cells and bind to proteins imbedded in the  surface of the
              recipient cell and initiate signaling.  These  peptides are derived from larger
              protein precursors which are  packaged into packets for release called
              secretory granules.   However, the mechanisms whereby proteins and peptides are
              targeted  to secretory granules is unclear.  The present work investigates  the
              mechanisms used by proteins to insure their packaging in the  proper secretory
              granules and will determine whether the amino acid  sequences of the proteins
              contain information sufficient to direct  the proteins to the correct
              intracellular organelle.  This research  will provide a greater understanding
              of how peptides are made and  targeted to secretory granules in neuroendocrine
              cells.  In  addition, this work is essential for understanding how cells in all
               organisms use chemical messengers for communication and has  applications to
              cell biologists beyond the neuroendocrine field.
