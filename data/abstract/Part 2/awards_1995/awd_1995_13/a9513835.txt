Abstract    :
              9513835  Bahcall       This proposal has two main thrusts, string theory and 
              neutrino astrophysics.       String theory is an attempt to move beyond the
              quantum  mechanical description of elementary particles as point like 
              particles to a formulation of them as excitations of a  microscopic string-like
              object.  These excitations would include  not only quarks, gluons, leptons
              etc., but also the graviton, the  quantum excitation of gravity so that one
              would have a truly  unified theory.  The ultimate aim of this research is a
              better  and deeper understanding of space-time and a quantum theory of 
              gravity.       The interior of the sun is cooled by the emission of  neutrinos
              whose interactions are so weak that they can escape  from the surface.  By
              studying the detailed properties of these  neutrinos, as seen in terrestrial
              detectors, one learns about  neutrino properties and about the interior of the
              sun.  ***
