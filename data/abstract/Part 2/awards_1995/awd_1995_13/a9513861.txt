Abstract    :
              9513861  Ferbel       This grant provides support of the 1996 Advanced Study 
              Institute on Techniques and Concepts of High Energy Physics,  the latest in a
              series of successful biennial institutes  that date back to 1980.  The purpose
              of the institute is to  provide instruction on advanced technology in particle-
               physics experiments and related theoretical concepts to a  select group of
              young physicists at the level of recent  PhD's or advanced PhD students.  The
              award covers their  travel and incidental expenses in part.  ***
