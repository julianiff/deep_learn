Abstract    :
              9513967  Heath  The Department of Botany and Plant Sciences, University of
              California, Riverside (UCR) has held a symposium for the past 17 years on
              timely topics in plant biology.  The 18th Annual Sympoisum in Plant Biology,
              entitled "How Plants Use the Light Environment to Regulate Growth and
              Development," will be held January 18-20, 1996.  The objective of the 1996
              Symposium is to bring together scientists working in the area of plant growth
              and development as influenced by light, with the intention that the
              presentations, and the discussion arising from them, will lead to a greater
              understanding of the cellular, physiological, and genetic aspects of the
              photo-environment.  It will cover the major electromagnetic bands which
              influence plants on earth, including the phytochrome and blue light responses
              and the UV spectrum which will be increasing due to the weakening of the ozone
              layer shield.  The five sections will be: 1) properties of the photoreceptors;
              2) light regulation of gene expression; 3) signal transduction; 4) the use of
              mutants; and 5) the whole plant response, to also including circadian rhythms. 
              Speakers from abroad and from other institutions, including young investigators
              who have introduced innovative molecular approaches, will be invited to
              participate.  Poster presentations will also be included in the program.  The
              presented papers, as well as poster abstracts, will be published rapidly and
              inexpensively.  Riverside is an ideal location for this symposium because there
              are many researchers within California and the western states.
