Abstract    :
              9513924  Chant  Accelerator based research in intermediate energy nuclear
              physics  of a University of Maryland group will be supported primarily at 
              CEBAF utilizing electromagnetic probes.  There will be a major  contribution to
              the commissioning of CEBAF as well as initiation  of new experiments with
              CEBAF.  The research will include a  measurement of the polarization of the
              recoiling deuteron from e-  d scattering and studies of parity violation in the
              scattering of  polarized electrons from helium nuclei.  Specialized detectors 
              will be developed for use in these and other experiments at  CEBAF.  Continuing
              researah using hadron probes such as pion-  induced reaction studies on a
              polarized Li target at IUCF and  (p,pN) experiments at TRIUMF will be carried
              out by the group  ***
