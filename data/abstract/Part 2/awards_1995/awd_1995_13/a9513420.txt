Abstract    :
              9513420  Thompson  Two major types of cells are contained within the nervous
              system: neurons, which are the   cells that generate, conduct and transmit
              information to other cells; and glia, which are the   cells that surround and
              support the neurons.  Glial cells are important in the repair of nerve   tissue
              after injury; one class of glia, the Schwann cells, assist in regeneration of
              damaged   axons (nerve fibers) by extending long processes that then serve as
              substrates along which   the new axons re-grow.  If some of the many motor
              axons that innervate a muscle are   damaged, the remaining axons begin to send
              new "sprouts" to make new connections with   the denervated muscle fibers. 
              During sprouting, the surrounding Schwann cells appear to   extend processes
              that induce the growth of nearby axons, and guide those growing axons   to
              denervated fibers.  This project uses physiological and immunohistochemical
              techniques   to determine the roles that muscle activity and gene expression of
              particular molecules   play in the guidance of axons, with particular emphasis
              on cell adhesion molecules.  Results from this work will be important in
              understanding how the other cells of the   nervous system influence the
              specific targeting of sprouting nerve cells during   development and
              regeneration, and will have an impact on developmental biology and cell  
              biology as well as neuroscience.
