Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to study fossil soils and grasses as evidence for Middle
              Miocene grasslands in  East Africa and their role in the evolution of apelike
              ancestors of humans. The role of grasslands  in human evolution has been
              debated since Charles Darwin's day, and the existence of Middle  Miocene (14
              Ma) grasslands in Kenya has continued to be controversial. Several lines of 
              evidence now converge to indicate Middle Miocene grasslands in Kenya: (1)
              isotopic study of  carbonate in fossil soils and apatite of mammalian teeth
              indicating tropical grassy vegetation, (2)  fossil soils similar to those of
              modern grasslands (Mollisols), (3) grazing muzzle and tooth  scratching on
              antelope fossils, and (4) fossil grasses with the abundant opal (phytoliths)
              and  scarce pores (stomates) of open country grasses. These findings are in
              some cases based on only  preliminary studies and now need to be extended to
              more sites of Middle Miocene age (13-16  Ma) scattered through southwestern
              Kenya: Ombo, Majiwa, Maboko, Nyakach, Fort Ternan,  Serek and Kapsibor. Fossil
              soils at each site will be described and sampled for laboratory  analysis.
              Fossil grasses will also be collected and returned to the laboratory for the
              microscopic  examination needed to identify them using a computer database.
              Also planned are isotopic  studies of the grasses and fossil soils to determine
              the kinds of grasses and vegetation present  (C3 or C4 grasses). This project
              builds on the highlights of a previously successful program to  provide a
              detailed view of the physiology, nature, botanical composition and extent of
              the  earliest East African grasslands.
