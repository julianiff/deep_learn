Abstract    :
              Lesser Blum is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational
              Chemistry Program to continue his statistical mechanical   research in the area
              of aqueous solutions using one center model   potentials of water which can be
              solved explicitly.  The model consists   of a spherical shell, a permanent
              electric dipole and a short range   directional potential for the hydrogen bond
              which includes up to   octupolar terms. Monte Carlo computer simulations have
              shown that   atom-atom correlation functions are in good agreement with
              experiment.    Computer simulations and formal analytical theory will be used
              to study   ionic solutions with this model, and the scaling behavior for both  
              non-associating, pairwise and multi- associating ions.  Simple, analytical, 
              yet accurate theories for ionic solutions in   water-like model solvents, both
              in homogeneous media and near interfaces,   are of interest in a large number
              of applications including: chemical   engineering equation of state
              applications, colloid chemistry, solution   kinetics, stability and folding of
              proteins, dynamics of biomembranes,   corrosion, and catalysis in
              electrochemical cells.
