Abstract    :
              9513874  Wu    This award supports cooperation in studies of macrofungi of 
              China and North America between the Field Museum of Natural  History, Chicago,
              and the Institute of Microbiology, Chinese  Academy of Sciences, Beijing,
              China. Fungi play vital roles  in forest and grassland systems, yet knowledge
              of species  diversity and distribution of fungi in many areas of the  world is
              sparse compared to information available on nearly  all animal and plant
              groups.  The situation is especially  critical in China where little is known
              about the  biodiversity and biogeography of Chinese fungi.   This  project is
              the first study designed to obtain biodiversity  data for Chinese fungi that
              are comparable with information  from other parts of the world.    During the
              two year study, US and Chinese scientists will   conduct cooperative research 
              on the biological diversity of macrofungi in China and   undertake comparisons
              with  the mycotas of eastern North America and Central America.   The proposed
              research  requires field work in both the US and China to sample   fungal
              biodiversity and to collect  materials for DNA analyses as well as laboratory
              work to   assay genetic divergence  among allopatric populations suing DNA RFLP
               and direct   sequencing techniques.  The  combined expertise of the US and
              Chinese participants and   the resources of their herbaria  and laboratories
              are necessary for the successful completion   of the project.  Support on  the
              Chinese side will be provided by the Chinese Academy of   Sciences.
