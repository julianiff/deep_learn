Abstract    :
              9513167  Scheraga  This work is a three-part attack on the protein folding
              problem.  First, the statistical mechanics of the problem will be elucidated. 
              Simplified lattice models of proteins (with realistic but easily computable
              procedures) will be used to provide fundamental statistical mechanical insight
              into the protein folding problem.  The Entropy Sampling Monte Carlo method
              (augmented by a conformational-biased chain regrowth procedure and a
              jump-walking method) is used to determine the density of states of the protein,
              from which the properties related to conformation and folding are reduced.  The
              method is being extended to an off-lattice treatment.  Second, in order to be
              able to use energy as a criterion to distinguish the global minimum from other
              local minima in the multidimensional energy surface (the so-called
              multiple-minima problem), a new force field is being developed.  Third, the
              multiple-minima problem is being surmounted by the diffusion equation method. 
              %%%  This theoretical approach will provide the basic understanding of the
              folding properties of protein.  This problem is currently at the frontier of
              protein research.  The basic understanding to be acquired will be applicable to
              the biotechnology industry.  Finally, this approach will provide training for
              the research associates carrying out this research, and also for several
              graduate students working together with these research associates.  ***
