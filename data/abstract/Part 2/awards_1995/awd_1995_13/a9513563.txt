Abstract    :
                  9513563  Speed      This award supports the participation of ten American 
              mathematicians at a workshop entitles "Nonparametric Statistical  Methods: The
              Road Ahead" to be held at the Australian National  University in Canberra, ACT,
              June 30 through July 4, 1996.  The  American organizer is Prof. Terence Speed
              from the Statistics  Department of the University of California, Berkeley.  The
               Australian organizer is Prof. Peter Hall from the School of  Mathematical
              Sciences, Center for Mathematics and its  Applications, at the Australian
              National University.    The workshop will review achievements and discuss
              future research  in the area of statistical nonparametrics, that body of
              adaptive,  empirical and nonparametric techniques which has in recent years 
              come to play a key role in modern statistical practice.  The  workshop will
              consider the implications, prospects and directions  in which this aspect of
              statistical science should progress in  order to assist in answering the
              increasingly complex scientific  questions being addressed.  In addition to
              bringing together  top statisticians from both countries, a selected few 
              participants will come from Canada, Russia, Switzerland and the  United
              Kingdom.    Australian support for this workshop is provided by the  Australian
              Department of Industry, Science and Technology (DIST)  under the U.S.-Australia
              Cooperative Science Program.
