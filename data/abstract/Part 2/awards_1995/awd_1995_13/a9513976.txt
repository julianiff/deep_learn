Abstract    :
                  ***    9513976  Sive    The goals of this proposal are to analyze the
              mechanisms by which the anteropostenor axis is formed in the ectodenn of the
              frog Xenopus laevis. The dorsal ectoderm gives rise to all neural tissue and to
              the non-neural anterior cement gland. Firstly, Dr. Sive will ask whether the
              homeodomain gene otx2 controls cement gland formation. She isolated otx2 as a
              product of a subtractive cloning screen for early dorsal ectodermal markers.
              otx2 misexpression leads to ectopic expression of neural, mesodermal and cement
              gland genes. otx2 is expressed in the cement gland, making it a good candidate
              for a primary regulator of cement gland development. Using a hormone-inducible
              otx2 protein that she constructed, Dr. Sive will ask whether cement gland
              formation is a direct consequence of otx2 activity. She will also ablate otx2
              function by employing antisense ribozymes and body injection. Secondly, she
              will analyze the mechanisms that restrict expression of a cement gland marker,
              XAG, to the front of the embryo. Dr. Sive has isolated the XAG promoter, and
              will analyze the DNA sequence elements and factors that regulate it. Since otx2
              may directly activate XAG, she will ask whether otx2 binding sites are present
              in the XAG promoter. This research will lead to greater understanding of events
              required for normal neurogenesis, for determining the molecular basis of
              embryonic neural defects and for defining parameters required for correcting
              neural lesions neonatally and after trauma or disease later in life.    ***
