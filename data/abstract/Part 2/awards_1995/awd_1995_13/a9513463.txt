Abstract    :
              9513463  Bleecker  The gaseous hormone ethylene regulates a number of important
              developmental processes in higher plants.  The initial biochemical events
              involved in ethylene perception are being investigated in the plant Arabidopsis
              thaliana.  The ETR1 gene in the plant codes for a protein with sequence
              homology to sensory receptor proteins of bacteria.  Mutations in the ETR1 gene
              confer dominant insensitivity to ethylene.  The role of the protein coded by
              ETR1 as an ethylene receptor was confirmed by expressing the ETR1 gene in yeast
              and finding that the transformed yeast binds ethylene to the ETR1 protein. 
              Using the yeast expression system, altered forms of the ETR1 protein will be
              expressed to investigate the mechanism of binding and signal transduction. 
              Using in vitro mutagenesis, effects of specific changes in single amino acid
              residues of  the protein will be followed by analysis of the ability of the
              altered protein to bind ethylene when expressed in transgenic yeast, and to
              transduce the ethylene signal transgenic plants.  In conjunction with work
              funded by other sources on the purification of the ETR1 protein from yeast, the
              proposed research will be used to construct a molecular model for the mechanism
              of action of this plant hormone receptor.  In addition the novel mutant forms
              of the ETR1 gene identified in this study will provide biotechnologists with
              the ability to genetically engineer alterations in ethylene sensitivity in
              economically important plant species.  ***
