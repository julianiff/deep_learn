Abstract    :
              9513846  Anderson  This award provides renewed support for the algae collection
              at the Provasoli-Guillard Center for Culture of Marine Phytoplankton (PGC) at
              the Bigelow Laboratory.  The PGC formally established in 1980, and was
              designated a National Center and Facility by Act of Congress in 1992.  The
              collection maintained by the PGC is a unique resource for the study of marine
              algae, especially those found in the open ocean.  Approximately 1450 cultures
              consisting mainly of well-identified organisms in pure culture are propagated
              by serial transfer in liquid or on agar.  The PGC currently sends about 1000
              cultures a year to public and private sector researchers in the U.S. and
              abroad.  There is a small charge for each culture.  Funds raised through sales
              amount to about 25% of the total budget and are used for collection activities,
              including purchase and maintenance of equipment, and purchase of materials and
              supplies.  The collection is managed by a part-time Director, with the
              assistance of a curator and assistant curator.  Oversight is provided by an
              external advisory committee which meets annually to advise the Director of the
              Collection and the CEO of the Bigelow Laboratory. The committee has a formal
              charter describing its duties and provisions for appointing new members as
              current members expire.  Funds provided through this award are largely devoted
              to staff salaries, purchase of equipment and part of the costs of the annual
              advisory committee meeting.  ***
