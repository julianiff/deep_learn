Abstract    :
                  9513350  Stark      This award will provide partial travel support for Dr.
              Glenn Stark  from the Physics Department at Wellesley College to conduct 
              collaborative research with Dr. Brenton Lewis, The Australian  National
              University (ANU) Research School of Physical Sciences and  Engineering.  The
              work will focus on high-resolution laser  spectroscopy of molecular oxygen in
              the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV).    The broad objectives of this project are to
              gain insight into the  electronic structure of the oxygen molecule and to
              contribute to an  understanding of the role of this basic molecule in the 
              photochemistry of the earth's atmosphere.  Molecular oxygen is a   strong
              absorber of solar VUV radiation in the earth's atmosphere  and thus determines
              the depth of penetration of this radiation.  The research will be centered
              around laser-based measurements in  the 110-135 nm spectral region.  The work
              of Dr. Stark in VUV  spectroscopy is complementary to that being used by the
              Ultraviolet  Physics Unit at ANU.  The work in Australia is supported through 
              the Department of Industry, Science and Technology (DIST).
