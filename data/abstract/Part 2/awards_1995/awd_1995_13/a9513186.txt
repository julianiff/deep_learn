Abstract    :
                      9513186  Baker      The award will support the travel of Dr. Ian Baker,
              Thayer   School of Engineering at Dartmouth College, to enable him to  conduct
              collaborative research with Dr. Paul Munroe of the  School of Materials Science
              and Engineering at the University  of New South Wales.  The proposed work aims
              to further an  understanding of the relationship between grain boundary  
              structure and chemistry and the occurrence of intergranular  fracture in FeAl,
              a material of some potential commercial  importance.    Poor ductility and
              brittle fracture are important drawbacks of  intermetallic compounds.  The
              focus of this study is on grain  boundaries (GBs) in bicrystals.  The effects
              of boundary  character and constitutional disorder, changing the ration of Fe 
              to Al, will be examined with a view to determining why some GBs  fracture and
              others do not.  The effect of ternary alloying  additions will also be examined
              to determine why some alloying  elements suppress grain boundary fracture.  The
              work proposed  will use a field emission gun scanning transmission electron 
              microscope, FEG STEM, which is jointly operated by the University  of New South
              Wales and the University of Sydney.  The project  brings together the
              complementary research interests of the  investigators with access to
              specialized equipment.
