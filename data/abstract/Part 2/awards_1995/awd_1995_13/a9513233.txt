Abstract    :
              We propose to build an atomic force microscope with a conducting tip to 
              identify sites where electroactive molecules span an otherwise  insulating
              lipid membrane. The microscope will be capable of detecting  currents of a few
              femtoamps, and will operate under environmental and  temperature (80-300K)
              control.    Recent work by Mazur and Hipps indicates that the current-voltage 
              characteristics at conductive sites are related to the redox chemistry  of the
              electroactive molecules and we propose to study this phenomenon  using
              well-characterized molecular assemblies of porphyrin-linked  alkanethiols with
              the goal of distinguishing individual organic  molecules. Operation at low
              temperatures will be used to control ion  currents (such as unwanted surface
              conduction in a water layer) and to  stiffen soft samples (leading to higher
              AFM resolution). Our ultimate  goal is to develop a new spatial-mapping tool
              for studying electronic  and ionic processes across cell membranes. The first
              biological sample  we will study will be the well characterized (and highly
              ordered)  arrays of the photosynthetic reaction center from Rhodopseudomonas 
              viridis. We hope to be able to identify the cytochrome bcl complexes  and
              determine their spatial distribution in the membrane.
