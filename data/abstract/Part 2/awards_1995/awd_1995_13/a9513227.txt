Abstract    :
                      9513227  Platz    This award supports the travel costs for Dr. Matthew
              Platz  from the Department of Chemistry at the Ohio State University  to enable
              him to make a three month stay conducting collaborative  research with Prof.
              Curt Wentrup of the Queensland University  Department of Chemistry.  Dr. Platz
              will use this period to study  dialkyl and cycloalkylcarbenes by the technique
              of matrix  isolation spectroscopy.      The investigators will attempt to
              isolate simple carbenes in  cryogenic matrices and to characterize them through
              UV-Vis and  IR spectroscopy. This work will determine the ground state 
              multiplicity of simple carbenes.  This projects draws together  the
              complementary expertise of Prof. Platz in the area of carbene  reactivity,
              using laser flash photolysis, fluorescence and EPR  spectroscopy, with that of
              Prof. Wentrup in matrix isolation.
