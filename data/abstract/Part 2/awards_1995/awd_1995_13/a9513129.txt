Abstract    :
              9513129  Hodgson    This award supports a three year cooperative research 
              project between Dr. Keith Hodgson of Stanford University and  Dr. Yoshiyuki
              Amemiya of the National Laboratory for High  Energy Physics in Tsukuba, Japan. 
              This project represents a  program of cooperative instrument development for
              time-  resolved solution, small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) using 
              synchrotron radiation.  The new instrumentation will be  applied to selected
              collaborative research projects on  protein folding and allosteric transitions.
               The principal  aspects of the research plan are 1) to participate in the 
              joint development of advanced CCD-based detectors for SAXS  studies; 2) to
              collaborate on the development of techniques  to investigate structural changes
              in a faster time domain  (down to about 1 ms) than currently utilized, and 3)
              to  utilize these developments at the Photon Factory in Japan  and then on an
              ultra high flux beam line at the Stanford  Synchrotron radiation Laboratory
              (SSRL) for actual  structural studies of biological systems.  The U.S. 
              investigators will benefit significantly by participating in  the development
              of advanced x-ray detector systems in Japan  whereas the Japanese collaborators
              will gain experience with  the new synthetic multilayer monochromator at SSRL. 
              This  proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in its joint  endeavor
              bringing state of the art methods from two  countries into a joint
              international collaborative effort.  ***
