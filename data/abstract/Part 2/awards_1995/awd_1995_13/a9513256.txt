Abstract    :
                  9513256  Carter    This proposal is for partial support for a conference
              that will deal with the neural and physiological underpinnings of social and
              affiliate behavior in higher vertebrates.  A unique feature of this conference
              is that it will bring together scientists representing fields as apparently
              diverse as social psychology and neuroendocrinology with the intent of
              integrating knowledge concerning affliative behavior gained from these
              different disciplines.  In addition, the biology of social and affiliative
              behavior will be examined in a variety of species.  The integration of
              knowledge gained from comparative as well as multidisciplinary approaches
              should facilitate advancement of our understanding of the biological basis of
              affiliative behavior.
