Abstract    :
              9513400  Roth  Protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation events condition the
              regulation of numerous cellular processes in eukaryotes.  However, there are
              few examples in plant systems that provide a model to dissect the functional
              significance of a phosphorylation-mediated signal transduction pathway.  The
              long term goal of this research is to characterize the role of the plant
              encoded double-standed (ds) RNA-dependent protein kinase, pPKR, in uninfected
              and in virus and viroid infected cells.    The primary goals of this renewal
              are: to extend characterization studies of pPKR and to determine its functional
              significance with respect to regulation of protein synthesis initiation in
              tobacco and potato plants.  The pPKR is part of a regulatory pathway that may
              be involved in regulation of protein synthesis, cell division and
              differentiation, and defense against viral infection.  Therefore, it is
              important to understand the role of this protein in plants.
