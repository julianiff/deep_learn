Abstract    :
              This award supports research visits by students of Professor George Whitesides
              of Harvard University to Heidelberg, Germany, as part of a collaborative
              research project between Professor Whitesides and Professor Michael Grunze of
              the Department of Physical Chemistry of the University of Heidelberg.  The
              objective of their research is to develop biosensors and biosensor arrays. The
              Grunze group has developed an acoustic plate mode (APM) sensor as a technique
              to measure antibody recognition of immobilized antigen.  The Harvard group has
              developed several model systems of thin organic films involving adsorption of
              protein to self-assembled monolayers (SAM's) .  SAM's are well defined model
              surfaces and offer unprecedented control for tailoring surfaces with a variety
              of delicate and complex functions.  These systems will be used to test and
              optimize the APM sensor.  The collaborators will also explore novel processes
              for fabricating the interdigitated electrode arrays that comprise the APM
              device.  Building on the complementary expertise of the participating US and
              German research groups, this innovative research will lead to new biosensors
              that are robust, discriminating, inexpensive and fast.   They could have a
              variety of practical applications in medical diagnostics, microlithography and
              other fields.  On the fundamental level, the research should improve our
              understanding of the relation between molecular order and viscoelastic
              properties of organic monolayers.
