Abstract    :
                   This request is for funds to purchase a Molecular  Dynamics PhosphorImager
              for use in research and teaching in  molecular biology. This instrument will be
              critical for  research applications of at least eight faculty as well as  in
              training undergraduate and graduate students in molecular  biology.
              Autoradiography using storage phosphor technology  offers several advantages
              over traditional detection  methods. Quantitation of amounts of radioactive
              protein or  DNA on gels or filters has traditionally been done using X-  ray
              film and densitometry or using scintillation counters.  Storage phosphors are
              up to 100 times more sensitive than  X-ray film, enabling measurements well
              below levels of  detection for film. Also, screens are quantitatively  accurate
              over five orders of magnitude as compared to X-ray  film which has a linear
              range over only two orders of  magnitude. The new technology is also
              environmentally  advantageous because it eliminates the heavy metal waste 
              disposal problems associated with film processing, and when  it replaces
              scintillation counting it reduces mixed organic  and radiochemical waste
              disposal problems. This technology  will enable new experimental approaches,
              improve  quantitation, enhance productivity, and it will afford our  students
              state of the art training.
