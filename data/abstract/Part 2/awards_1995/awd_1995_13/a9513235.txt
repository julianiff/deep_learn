Abstract    :
              9513235  Pullin    This Americas Program award will fund travel and related 
              expenses for a group of  U.S. scientists to participate in a  workshop on
              quantum gravity to be held in Punta del Este,  Uruguay, March 25-27, 1996. 
              Organizers are Dr. Jorge  Pullin, Pennsylvania State University, and  Dr.
              Rodolfo  Gambini, Ministerio de Educacion y Cultura, Universidad de  la
              Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay.  This award will fund  two U.S. senior
              scientists and seven junior researchers. Its  purpose is the exchange of  ideas
              and recent  research in  the field of quantum gravity. The  proposed format of
              the  workshop is a three day meeting with plenary sessions by  leaders in the
              field,  and contributed papers and posters by  scientists of the region and 
              U.S. participants.    Scientific activity in the Southern Cone of South America
               has grown at a steady pace in the last ten years.  In the  area of quantum
              gravity, the region has three small but  internationally highly visible groups.
               This workshop will  allow young researchers  from the region and the U.S. to 
              exchange ideas and establish ties that may give rise to  future collaborations.
