Abstract    :
              9513133  Grossman    This award supports a three year cooperative research 
              project between Dr. Arthur Grossman of the Carnegie  Institution of Washington
              at Palo Alto and a group led by  Dr. Hideaki Usuda at Teikyo University in
              Tokyo. This  project brings together two groups with very different 
              disciplines.  Usuda and his group are using physiological  tools to examine
              changes in metabolic processes during the  acclimation of a unicellular green
              algae to phosphorus  limitation.  Grossman's group is more focused on molecular
               technology and how that technology can be used to define the  molecular
              details of acclimation to nutrient limitation.  Grossman and two graduate
              students will visit japan to help  initiate molecular work at Teikyo University
              and acquire the  skills for quantifying physiological processes. The project 
              brings together workers with complementary skills.  There  will be a valuable
              exchange of both technical and conceptual  information that will be important
              for both short and long  term interactions. Therefore, this collaboration
              fulfills  the objectives of the Program by promoting the exchange of 
              scientific knowledge and promising to result in a long term  productive
              interaction with the Japanese scientific  community.  ***
