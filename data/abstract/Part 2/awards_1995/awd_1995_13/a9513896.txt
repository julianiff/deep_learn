Abstract    :
                    9513896  Udin    This award supports collaboration between Dr. Susan Udin,
              SUNY,  Buffalo, and Dr. Tsai Haojan, Beijing Medical University, China  on
              patch-clamp studies ofApril 22, 1996 cholinergic transmission  in the tectum. 
              The CNS contains a multiplicity of nicotinic and muscarinic  receptor subtypes,
              but many gaps remain in the understanding of  how these receptors contribute to
              physiological response of the  cells that receive cholinergic inputs. One way
              to begin to assess  the contribution of those receptors is to study to the
              responses  of neurons in the frog optic tectum.  The frog tectum is 
              particularly suitable because it has an unusually restricted  population of
              cholinergic axons, all of which are derived from  the nucleus isthmi.
              Whole-cell patch clamping will be used to  identify tectal cells that respond
              to cholinergic agonists.  The  distribution and morphology of the cells will be
              revealed by  biocytin filling.  The results will help to clarify the 
              contribution of cholinergic processes in central nervous system  neurons.  In
              addition, these experiments with Rana will provide  data for comparison with
              results of the similar experiments in  Xenopus frogs; this comparison is of
              interest because the  cholinergic axons that project to the Xenopus tectum from
              the  contralateral nucleus isthmi display dramatic plasticity during a 
              critical period of development of the cholinergic axons, whereas  such
              plasticity is absent in Rana.
