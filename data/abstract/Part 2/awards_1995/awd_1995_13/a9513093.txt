Abstract    :
              9513093  Ishii    This award supports the participation of 12 U.S. scientists 
              in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Two-Phase flow Dynamics, to be  held in Fukuoka,
              Japan, from July 7-13, 1996.  The co-  organizers are Professor Mamoru Ishii of
              Purdue University  and Professor Tohru Fukano of Kyushu University.  The main 
              objective of this seminar is to bring together highly  qualified researchers
              with common interests for intensive  and detailed exchanges of information
              about their current  and future research in the field of two-phase flow. 
              Collectively, the research pursued by the seminar  participants has the
              potential to: improve instrumentation  methods, develop reliable constitutive
              relations, and obtain  a better understanding of detailed two-phase flow
              phenomena.  The major objectives of the seminar are to: 1) develop  general
              directions for research; 2) focus future research  with regard to the recent
              significant developments in  instrumentation technology; and 3) discuss best
              approaches  for the fully three-dimensional two-phase flow model.  The  seminar
              should contribute greatly to the sustained rapid  progress in two-phase flow
              dynamics during the coming  decade.  ***
