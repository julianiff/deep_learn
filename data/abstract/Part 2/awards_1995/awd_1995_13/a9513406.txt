Abstract    :
              The allocation of water is a complex system, involving externalities, public
              goods, and shared production facilities.  Such complex systems have employed
              central authorities to solve coordination problems and dictate solutions to the
              allocation problems.  In a world of rapid technological and environmental
              change, government solutions may move too slowly to allow a society to adapt
              efficiently.  Smart, computer-assisted markets provide the promise of
              developing flexible decentralized solutions to complex problems.  Smart markets
              allow private market allocations to instantaneously account for coordination
              problems.  They also can incorporate environmental or distributional
              constraints; thus, individual decision makers can respond to a changing
              environment, allowing society as a whole to adapt rapidly. This research
              develops, tests, and implements a generic smart market for water allocation
              which will be initialized for application in California.  The research provides
              an empirical testbed for a smart market for water allocation in any arid land: 
              other applications will simply involve a different network configuration and
              supply sources whose parameters can be used to initialize the appropriate nodal
              trading system.
