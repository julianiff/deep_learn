Abstract    :
              9513100  Burghardt    This award supports a three year cooperative research 
              project between Dr. Gordon M. Burghardt of the University of 
              Tennessee-Knoxville and Dr. Akira Mori of Kyoto University.  The collaborators
              assembled also include Dr. Richard Goris  at the Yokohama City University
              School of Medicine and  biologists specializing on reptile chemical ecology in
              the  USA.  This project will investigate the structure and  function of a
              remarkable nuchal venom gland in a Japanese  natricine snake.  The problem is
              how the snake synthesizes  and uses this complex chemical stew of potent
              toxins, which  seem to be unique to this species and some relatives.  Since 
              related toxins are found in the skin of favored prey of this  species,
              amphibians, it is possible that the venom derives  from chemicals sequestered
              from the diet of the animal.  This has not been demonstrated in any amniote
              vertebrate to  date, although many eat potentially toxic amphibians.  Neonatal
              snakes seem to have an undeveloped gland and the  ontogeny of the system will
              be explored through a series of  experiments.  The behavior of the snakes
              towards potential  predators and responses of such animals to the toxins will 
              also be explored in noninjurious tests.  The project brings  together workers
              in behavior, development, snake venoms, and  histology from two countries. 
              This proposal fulfills the  objectives of the Program in its joint endeavor
              bringing  state of the art methods from two countries into a joint 
              international collaborative effort.  ***
