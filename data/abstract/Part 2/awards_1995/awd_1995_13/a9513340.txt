Abstract    :
                  9513340  White      This award, covering a period of three years, will
              support the  travel of Dr. Stephen White, Department of Astronomy at the 
              University of Maryland, to conduct collaborative research  with Dr. Robert
              Duncan of the Australian Telescope National  Facility (AT).  The research will
              focus on a study of the radio  emission from the Southern Hemisphere star Eta
              Carinae.  Dr. White is currently conducting research through an NSF award  on
              radio continuum observations of active stars.  This grant will  add an
              international dimension to his current research.    Radio images of Eta
              Carinae, thought to be among the most massive  known stars in our Galaxy, can
              only be obtained through the 25m  AT dish located at Mpora.  Observations of
              this star have  revealed extraordinary radio emissions which have made it one
              of  the brightest radio stars in the sky.  The radio flux continues  to rise as
              gas surrounding the star apparently is being ionized  by a disturbance
              propagating outward from the star.  The goal of  the investigation is to follow
              the evolution of the outburst and  determine its nature, to study the ionized
              gas in order to  determine the kinematics of gas ejected from the star and the 
              cause of the different asymmetries seen in the outflow, and to  determine the
              physical conditions in the outflow by observing the  newly-ionized gas
              recombining.
