Abstract    :
              9513998  Zhou       This grant renews support for research by a group at  Boston
              University.  Their research is with a large  international group that operates
              the L3 detector at the LEP  electron-positron collider at the CERN laboratory
              in Geneva,  Switzerland.  The group's major interest is a search for  evidence
              of Higgs-boson production.  LEP having been  increased in the past year, the
              accessible mass range is  substantially greater than is has been.  ***
