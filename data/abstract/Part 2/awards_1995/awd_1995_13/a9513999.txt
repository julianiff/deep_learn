Abstract    :
              9513999  Burchat       This grant to a faculty member at Stanford University 
              supports two research projects.  First, she, a postdoc and  graduate students
              will continue analysis of a massive data  sample on Charm meson decays obtained
              some years ago at  Fermilab.  They are also established in the BABAR 
              collaboration, an international group that has been formed  to design and
              contruct the detector to be used to study  Bottom  mesons at the PEPII
              electron-positron collider at  the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.  They
              will continue  to the Vertex Detector component of BABAR and will develop  and
              operate radiation monitoring devices to be used in a  beam-abort system for the
              collider.  ***
