Abstract    :
                    The objective of the proposed research is to develop  ultra-high       
              resolution, Superconducting QUantum Interference  Device (SQUID)       
              magnetometers (UHRSM) that are optimized for the  imaging of the       
              magnetic fields produced by action currents, remanent        magnetization, and
              magnetic susceptibility in isolated  living        tissue and small
              experimental animal preparations at  the scale of        100m.. Such
              measurements are not yet in wide spread  use,        primarily because of the
              limitations and costs of  existing        instrumentation. This project is
              designed specifically  to address        these points. The proposed instruments
              will be capable  of making        measurements that are impossible with any
              other  technique, and        should lead to new insights into cellular biology
              and        electrophysiology. As they are being developed, these  instruments  
                   will be immediately incorporated into the  electrophysiological       
              research on cardiac muscle, nerves, and intestinal  smooth muscle        that
              is ongoing at Vanderbilt, and will be made  available to        collaborators
              from other institutions. The proposed  research        involves the staged
              development of the cryostats,  SQUIDs, and        vacuum windows required for a
              high-sensitivity UHRSM  utilizing a        liquid-helium-cooled,
              low-temperature  superconductivity (LTS)        SQUID, and a lower sensitivity,
              higher resolution  UHRSM with a        liquid-nitrogen-cooled, high-temperature
               superconductivity (HTS)        SQUID. The first system will use hand-wound
              pickup  coils, a        commercially-packaged LTS SQUID, and a custom-built,   
                  continuous-flow cryostat that should provide a semi-  automatic       
              system not requiring periodic helium and nitrogen  transfers. The        more
              advanced versions will utilize custom LTS and HTS  SQUID        gradiometers
              and magnetometers mounted in inexpensive  commercial        dewars designed for
              infrared spectroscopy. While this  is under         development, specialized
              LTS SQUIDs with on-chip  pickup coils        will be fabricated at Hypres at no
              cost to NSF.  Apodization and        other coil design techniques will be used
              , to develop  arrays of        SQUIDs whose pickup coils are optimized for
              high-  resolution        biomagnetic j imaging and inverse calculations of the 
              current and        magnetization distributions in the biological samples. 
              Digital        SQUIDs will be provided by Hypres for evaluation.  These       
              instruments are based upon proven cooling and vacuum-  window       
              technologies; the challenge lies in integrating these  with        optimized
              SQUID magnetometers to create user-friendly,        inexpensive magnetic
              microscopes. These instruments  will be        unique in their ability to
              measure quantitatively  magnetic fields        at the near-cellular level.
              While electrical  measurements of        neural and cardiac tissue have been
              explored  extensively over the        past century, only in the past few years
              has it been  possible to        use SQUIDs to image cellular action currents.
              High  resolution        magnetic susceptibility imaging has yet to be applied 
              to        biological systems. Many biological phenomena  involving       
              electrical cell-to-cell communication and non-uniform        propagation, such
              as those that are key to the  behavior of        cardiac~ihuscle and intestinal
              smooth muscle, are  governed by the        transfer of electrical charge. Since
              the distributed  electrical        resistivity and capacitance of these systems
              is often  unknown or        poorly characterized, electrical measurements alone
               cannot        suffice to quantify this charge transfer. Hence direct       
              measurements of current are crucial to understanding  cell-to-cell       
              coupling. More importantly, the combination of  magnetic        measurements of
              current and electrical and optical  measurements        of voltage offers
              unique promise towards improving the        understanding of not only th e
              transfer of charge  between cells        but also the tissue properties that
              relate current to  voltage.        Other biological applications include the
              study of  cortical        oscillations, spreading depression, action currents
              in  algae and        higher plants, iron biominerals in living systems, and 
              magnetic        tracers. The proposed program of instrumentation  development, 
                    coupled with an aggressive program of biophysical  measurements,       
              should advance the ability to study the electrical  behavior of        cellular
              systems and their response to physical and        pharmacological
              interventions.
