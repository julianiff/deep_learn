Abstract    :
              9513788  Frisch  The 2nd Rencontre du Vietnam will be held in Saigon (Ho Chi
              Minh  City) from October 21 to 28, 1995, where the solar eclipse will  be
              total.  Two conferences will be held in parallel, with  substantial mixing. 
              Using the eclipse as an opportunity to  stimulate interest in the Sun and its
              environment, an  Astrophysics conference will be devoted to the Sun and the 
              heliosphere.  A parallel conference will focus on timely and  related topics in
              Elementary Particle Physics.  This support will  help to defer the expenses of
              scientists and underrepresented  minorities and women.  ***
