Abstract    :
                    Abstract  9513596  Dobrowsky      The objectives of this proposal are to
              determine the structural components and the molecular mechanisms which regulate
              the coupling of the low affinity neurotrophin receptor, p75NTR, to the
              activation of a novel lipid second messenger system, the sphingomyelin (SM)
              cycle.  Activation of the SM cycle produces ceramide which has been implicated
              in mediating the growth suppressing or apoptotic effects of specific cytokines
              and growth factors.      Neurotrophins are growth factors which are necessary
              for the differentiation and maintenance of neuronal cells.  The PI has recently
              demonstrated that neurotrophins induce SM hydrolysis through p75NTR. The
              cellular location of this SM pool will be determined. The structural
              requirements for the interaction  of sphingomyelinase with the the p75 NTR will
              be determined, and their interaction will be studied in the presence and
              absence of the neurotrophin ligand.  Since activation may also occur  through
              intermediary molecules, the effect of neurotrophins on  p75NTR dependent
              phospholipase A2 activation and arachidonic acid production a potential
              physiologic activator of SMase) will be examined.      Since there are some
              indications of crosstalk between this pathway and tyrosine kinase, p75NTR
              dependent SM hydrolysis will be examined in tyrosine kinase receptor mutants,
              or by using inhibitors to uncouple tyrosine kinase from downstream signaling
              proteins.  These studies will provide mechanistic insights into factors which
              regulate the coupling of p75NTR to SMase and elucidate the functional role of
              crosstalk pathways in the coordinate regulation of neurotrophin signaling
              pathways.  They will also provide information on the role of lipids in
              intracellular signaling.     ***
