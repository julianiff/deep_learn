Abstract    :
                  9513347  Meagher  Heavy metal contamination has reached toxic levels in many
              parts of the world and has become an urgent problem. Our long term goal is to
              identify and utilize single gene traits to effect ecologically sound solutions
              to metal ion contamination based on phytoremediation.  The project of the
              bacterial merA gene, mercuric ion reductase (MerA), catalzes the detoxification
              of ionic mercury, Hg++, reducing it to its less toxic metallic form, Hg0. 
              Recently it has been shown that a highly mutagenized merA gene, merApe9,
              confers remarkable levels of resistance to Hg++ in transgenic Arabidopsis
              plants.  Transgenic seeds germinate, seedlings grow, and plants flower and set
              seed on media containing up to 100 uM Hg++ (20 ppm), while control seedlings
              die during or shortly after germination at 25 uM.  These plants evolved
              significant levels of Hgo in the process.  The most resistant plant lines grow
              as well on Hg++ as unchallenged control plants and acturally require mercury
              for optimum growth.  The transgenic plants also show resistance to toxic levels
              of Au+++ in media.  The immediate goal of this project is to explore metal ion
              reduction as a method of phytoremediation for a variety of heavy metal
              pollutants.    Preliminary evidence is presented to suggest that besides Hg++
              merA pe9 also can reduce Au+++ and Cu++ in E. coli.  MerA belongs to a diverse
              family of sequence-related reductases, which recognize a wide variety of
              organic and thiol substrates in addition to Hg++.  Besides Hg++ MerA already
              binds Ag+, Cu++, Cd++, and Au+++.  Therefore, it is hypothesized that: the merA
              gene can be mutated to direct the efficient reduction of a wide variety of
              metal ions for remediation or extraction.  The specific aim of the proposal is
              to generate merA mutants with novel substrate specificities (e.g., enhanced
              reduction of Hg++ and novel reduction of Cu++, Pb++, and Cd++).  In the future
              transgenic constructs will be examined in model plants for their potential use
              in the phytoremediation of  metal ion pollution.
