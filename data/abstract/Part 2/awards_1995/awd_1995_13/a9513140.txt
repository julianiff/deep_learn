Abstract    :
              9513140  Majda    This award supports a three-year collaborative research 
              project between Professor Marcin Majda of the University of  California at
              Berkeley and Professor Yoshio Umezawa of the  University of Tokyo. The goal of
              this collaboration is to  explore some fundamental issues in the design of
              selective  molecular sensors.  Specifically, molecular recognition  phenomena
              and host-guest interactions in monolayers at  electrodes will be investigated.
              This proposal brings  together scientists from two countries working on
              different  aspects of the same general problem.  The US scientists will  have
              the opportunity to use modern spectroscopic and  microscopic equipment in Japan
              as well as to work with novel  types of compounds synthesized in Japan.  The
              Japanese  scientists will have a chance to use Langmuir-Blodgett and 
              electrochemical techniques developed in Berkeley. This  collaboration should
              increase our understanding of molecular  recognition phenomena and result in
              development of new  technologies for selective sensor fabrication.  ***
