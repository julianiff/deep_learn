Abstract    :
              This award supports Professor Martin Fischer and a graduate student from
              Stanford University to collaborate in civil engineering research with Professor
              A. Schub and colleagues of the Institute for Geotechnical and Construction
              Engineering of the Technical University of Munich, Germany. Both groups are
              conducting research in the application of information technology to
              construction project management, but they bring complementary expertise in
              project planning and control to the joint effort.  The strength of the Stanford
              group lies on the construction planning side, the link of planning to product
              and computer-aided-design models of facilities, and in the symbolic modeling of
              engineering systems and processes.  The German group brings expertise in time
              and cost control of construction projects, the use of information technology
              for real-time schedule and cost control, and it has close links to the
              construction industry which will be useful in validating the research.  The
              joint effort of these two research groups is very likely to achieve their
              mutual goal of developing computational models of construction methods in order
              to improve existing construction planning, scheduling and cost estimating
              systems.
