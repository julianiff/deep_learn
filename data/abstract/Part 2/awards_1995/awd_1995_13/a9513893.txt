Abstract    :
              9513893  Boyd  This grant is for a program of experimental and analytical 
              research in nuclear astrophysics, carried out under the direction  of a Ohio
              State University faculty member.  It will study nuclear  reaction cross
              sections of relevance to big-bang nucleosynthesis,  search for new nuclides
              near the region of proton instability  (light isotopes of intermediate mass
              elements), and explore  components of the a capture by 12C which is important
              to many  aspects of the stellar evolution..  The experiments will utilize 
              radioactive ion beam facilities in the Michigan State University  and
              elsewhere.  A preliminary design study of a possible new  facility for neutrino
              aqtrophysics measurements will also be  undertaken.  ***
