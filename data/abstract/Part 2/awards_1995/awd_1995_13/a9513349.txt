Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the use of yeast strains to express enzymes   of
              general utility in organic synthesis. The specific oxidative enzymes   to be
              studied include cyclohexanone monooxygenase, flavin monooxygenase   and
              cytochrome P-450's. These enzymes will not require cofactors and will   be the
              equivalent of a chiral m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid in a form that   will be as
              easy to use as the achiral reagent itself. They will be   applicable to carry
              out such transformations as olefin epoxidations,   thioether oxidations (to
              chiral sulfoxides) and Baeyer-Villiger   reactions. With this award the
              Synthetic Organic Program is supporting   the research of Dr. Jon D. Stewart of
              the Department of Chemistry of the   University of Florida. Professor Stewart
              will focus his work on   yeast-expressed enzymes designed to carry out
              enantioselective reactions   in organic synthesis. Besides formation of
              optically active products   which are useful for the preparation of
              stereochemically complex systems   that have important biological properties,
              these enzymes all use   molecular oxygen, rather than an organic oxidant, which
              makes them   attractive from both an economic and environmental standpoint
