Abstract    :
              9513511  Preuss   Genetic approaches will be used to investigate further the
              requirements for pollen recognition by the stigma. Suppressing mutations that
              restore function to pop1(cer6-2) pollen, a mutant which has a defect in pollen
              pistil interactions, have been identified and examining these suppressors will
              likely identify key pollen components. In addition, novel genetic screens for
              gene products required for pollen-stigma interactions will be done. These
              screens will focus on genes expressed in the haploid pollen and make use of the
              recently identified quartet mutations that cause pollen to be released in
              intact tetrads. The specific aims are:  1.  Examine suppressors that restore
              fertility to cer6 pollen. Determine whether lipid and protein components have
              been restored and whether the suppressing mutations map to genes other than
              cer6.  2.  Perform a screen for gametophytic mutations that disrupt
              pollen-stigma interactions by using chemical mutagenesis of quartet seeds to
              screen for genes required for pollen hydration and to use insertional
              mutagenesis to characterize genes required for subsequent events in the
              reproductive process.  %%%  The focus of this work is on genetic approaches
              that will identify Arabidopsis gene products essential for the initial step in
              pollination-recognition of pollen by the stigma cells. Because plants rely on
              insects and wind for pollination, they encounter pollen grains from many
              different species. However, only pollen from the appropriate species is
              permitted to grow through the pistil and deliver sperm to the eggs. An improved
              understanding of the molecular basis for pollen recognition would be a major
              advance.  ***
