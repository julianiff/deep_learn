Abstract    :
                9513162  Hsu      This is a 12 month award proposed by Dr. Tai-Ran Hsu, San 
              Jose State University. This proposal requests funds to  convene a Trans-Pacific
              workshop on education and human  resource development in mechatronic
              technology.  This  workshop will include educators, scientists, engineers and 
              business leaders in the mechatronics industry from Korea,  Taiwan, Hong Kong,
              Singapore, Malaysia and Japan.  The  meeting will be held at the San Jose State
              University,  California on May 19-24, 1996.  Mechatronics is an important  and
              emerging technology combining mechanical science with  electronics.  The U.S.
              has held a leadership role in this  technology, but this leadership role has
              been seriously  challenged in recent years by producers in Pacific-rim 
              countries as these countries have invested heavily in this  technology.  The
              result has been a dramatic shift in the  manufacturing of mechatronics products
              from the U.S. to  these countries.  The principal reason for the shift of this 
              industry to overseas is the quality and quantity of the  labor force including
              the cultural values of the workers.  Human resource development  therefore
              becomes a key factor,  in order for the U.S. labor force to be competitive in
              this  industry.  This workshop comes at an opportune time for  developing an
              agenda for education and human resource  development in U.S. colleges for
              training the front line of  workers in this industry.  The result can be of
              importance  for strengthening the U.S. competitive position in this  field.
