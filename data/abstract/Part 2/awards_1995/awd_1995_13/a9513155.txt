Abstract    :
                9513155  Kowalczykowski    This award supports a three year collaborative
              research  project between Dr. Hideo Shinagawa of Osaka University,  Japan and
              Dr. Stephen Kowalczykowski, University of  California, Davis, USA. The major
              goal of this project is to  biochemically reconstitute the process of genetic 
              recombination, using purified protein and DNA components.  Genetic
              recombination is complex biological process whose  mechanism is not understood.
              Yet, it is this process that  results in the assortment of genes which gives
              rise to  genetic diversity. Further, if harnessed properly,  recombination can
              be exploited either to repair defective  genes that underlie certain human
              diseases or to genetically  engineer agriculturally important plants or
              animals. Genetic  recombination underlies one of the major approaches to gene 
              targeting.    The proposal brings together the efforts of two major 
              laboratories that have constituted different parts of the  process: the
              Kowalczykowski laboratory, which has reproduced  the initial steps of the
              recombination in vitro, and the  Shinagawa laboratory which has reconstructed
              the latter  steps. It is anticipated that collaboration of these two 
              laboratories will achieve the first in vitro reconstitution  of genetic
              recombination. Furthermore, through the exchange  of ideas and technology, this
              project will broaden our base  of basic knowledge and promote international
              understanding  and cooperation.  ***
