Abstract    :
                  9513306  Cahoon      This award will partially cover travel and related
              equipment  shipping costs for Dr. Lawrence Cahoon, Department of Biological 
              Sciences at the Wilmington Campus of the University of   North Carolina, to
              enable him to conduct collaborative research   with William Vant of the
              National Institute of Water and  Atmospheric Research (NIWA) in Hamilton, New
              Zealand.  The focus  of this investigation is on the ecology of benthic
              microalgae in  an estuarine ecosystem.     The research will investigate the
              relationship between microalgal  and phytoplankton biomass and production in
              the Manukau Harbor.  This estuarine ecosystem receives treated sewage effluent
              from  Auckland, creating a strong gradient of nutrient loading and  turbidity. 
              The study will test the hypothesis that light  attenuation by phytoplankton,
              and its derived detritus, drives an  inverse relationship between the algal and
              plankton biomass.  The  study brings together the expertise of the New Zealand 
              investigator in light attenuation in aquatic ecosystems and the  American
              researcher in the measurement of benthic microalgal  biomass and production.
