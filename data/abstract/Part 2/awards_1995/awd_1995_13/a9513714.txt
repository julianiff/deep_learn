Abstract    :
              95-13714  Sazer  Yeast cells of the species S. pombe respond to nutrient
              limitation by undergoing a number of physiological and morphological changes
              that allow the cells to survive the temporary absence of nutrients.  The
              starvation response in fission yeast includes cell cycle and growth arrest,
              decreased cell size, enhanced resistance to heat shock and identification of
              proteins that positively regulate the transition of fission yeast cells from a
              proliferative state to starvation induced arrest.  A genetic screen will be
              conducted for the identification of cDNAs which when overexpressed in wild type
              cells induce the starvation response even in the presence of nutrients.  The
              rationale behind this approach is that ectopic expression of a key regulatory
              protein can mimic its normal activation state.  The initial selection will be
              for cDNAs from growing cells that at high levels of expression induce
              heat-shock resistance and growth arrest in wild type cells.  Further
              characterization will include a comparison of the phenotypes of cells
              overexpressing these cDNAs to wild type cells starved of nutrients, sequence
              analysis, constuction and analysis of loss of function mutants and
              determination of the pattern of expression of the genes in wild type cells
              starved of nutrients.  A small-scale trial of this screen has already yielded
              positive results:  the identification of 5 novel fission yeast
