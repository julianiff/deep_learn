Abstract    :
              9513921  Berkowitz    This research is to characterize a putative beta subunit
              of a  plant K + channel.  This molecule is a translation product of a  cDNA
              from Arabidopsis which is 50% homologous to a recently  characterized beta
              subunit in brain, which rapidly inactivates K  channels by occluding the ion
              conduction path in the pore region  of the protein.  The research in this grant
              will be aimed at  characterizing this channel and studying its interaction with
              the  known K channels in plant cells.  Since K+ channels are important  to a
              number of processes in plant cells, information on their  regulation is
              important.  ***
