Abstract    :
              This proposal involves a request to purchase the Molecular  Dynamics 425SI      
                Phosphorimager, a device for the  detection and quantitation of radioactivity
              used in a  variety of biochemical experiments. The quantitative and  high
              resolution capabilities of this instrument will allow  performance of
              biochemical experiments not currently  possible. The primary advantages of this
              technology over  conventional autoradiography using X-ray film are an 
              increased linear response, dynamic range, and sensitivity,  as well as reduced
              exposure time. The instrument provides  quantitative data from experiments
              involving the use of  radioisotopes such as 32p, 35S, 14C, and 1251. An
              instrument  of this type is not currently available in our building  (Koshland
              Hall) at the University of California at Berkeley.  The quantitation of
              radioactive samples will be carried out  by the user groups in a variety of
              biochemical and molecular  biology experiments detailed in Section 8. The
              primary areas  of quantitative analysis will be nucleic acid-protein (DNA  and
              RNA) interactions and signal transduction (GTPase  activities of signalling
              proteins). The  technology involves  the use of storage phosphor screens which
              store energy from  sample beta particle emission. The stored energy is then 
              released by scanning the storage screen with a laser beam.  This emission is
              detected by the instrument and stored on a  computer hard disk. The data can
              then be accessed and  analyzed using a software package provided with the 
              instrument and transmitted through an ethernet network to  user computer
              terminals. A number of quantitative  biochemical experiments not currently
              possible will be  feasible because the Molecular Dynamics Phosphorimager is 
              vastly superior to X-ray film autoradiography.
