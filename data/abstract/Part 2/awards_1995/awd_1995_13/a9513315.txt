Abstract    :
              This award supports Professor Jane Vanderkooi and two graduate students from the
              University of Pennsylvania to collaborate in biochemistry research with
              Professor Josef Friedrich and his graduate students in the Physical Chemistry
              Institute of the University of Bayreuth.  They are combining their
              complementary expertise in EPR and optical hole burning to study dynamic
              aspects of protein structure.  Proteins are organized and random at the same
              time, giving rise to a complex energy landscape which, in turn, results in a
              variety of possible substates. Direct observations of protein structural
              dynamics near physiologically relevant temperatures is very difficult by
              conventional methods.  This research suggests that conformational states, or
              structural organization, of protein can be identified by characteristic
              patterns of spectral holes in an electric field combined with other
              measurements.  By performing comparative hole burning spectroscopy on metal
              derivatives of cytochrome c , porphyrin, and glasses, under various conditions
              of pH and pressure, these investigators expect to observe changes in various
              bonding states of proteins which will improve the understanding of structural
              organization and randomness in proteins.
