Abstract    :
                                  Non-Technical Summary                                    IBN
              95-13884    PI: K. Fite         Finding Food: Neuroethological Aspects of
              Foraging                                  This is a proposal for partial
              support for a conference that  integrates functional (adaptive ecological) and
              mechanistic  approaches to the study of how animals forage.  That is, how  do
              animals locate, capture and identify sources of essential  nutrition.  The
              unique feature of this conference is that it  brings together scientist who
              seek to answer this  fundamental question from the perspectives of 1) sensory 
              mechanisms, 2) neural processes, 3) cognitive and learning  processes, and 4)
              behavioral ecology.  This conference will  be an exemplary forum that will
              provide young as well as  experienced investigators a view of how contemporary
              science  attacks an age-old question in Animal Behavior, how do  organisms find
              the sources of ingested energy necessary to  sustain life.
