Abstract    :
              This award supports Professor Eric Hellstrom and a junior colleague and graduate
              student of the University of Wisconsin to collaborate in materials research
              with Dr. P Majewski and his group at the Institute for Non-Metallic Inorganic
              Materials of the University of Stuttgart.  The objective of their research is
              to increase the flux pinning in bismuth-based high temperature superconductors.
               Their approach will be to create flux pinning centers in silver sheathed
              bismuth-based tape by manipulating the chemistry of the bismuth-based
              superconductor and varying the thermal processing.  The collaboration brings
              together the expertise of the U.S. group in the scientific issues involved in
              fabricating, processing and characterizing long lengths of silver-sheathed high
              temperature superconductors, with the detailed knowledge of phase relations in
              the bismuth-based system generated at the University of Stuttgart.   Increased
              flux pinning will raise the current density that these superconductors can
              carry at thirty degrees Kelvin to a level that will greatly expand the
              applications in which they can be used.  The complementary expertise of the
              U.S. and German groups creates a uniquely qualified collaboration to pursue
              this valuable objective.
