Abstract    :
              9513121  Cohen    This award supports the participation of nine U.S.  scientists
              in a U.S.-Japan seminar on the Surface Dynamics  and Structures in Epitaxial
              Growth, to be held in Nagoya,  Japan, from March 24-27, 1997.  The
              co-organizers are  Professors Philip I. Cohen of the University of Minnesota 
              and Ayahiko Ichimiya of Nagoya University.  The meeting will  last four days
              and its proceedings will be published as a  regularly refereed, special issue
              of "Surface Review and  Letters."  This meeting will further the increasing 
              interactions between U.S. and Japanese scientists  investigating epitaxy; in
              particular a special symposium of  the Japanese Physical Society has been
              scheduled immediately  following the seminar in the same city.  This U.S.-Japan
               seminar should significantly enhance the interactions and  contacts between
              U.S. and Japanese scientists who are  developing theories of surface processes
              and who are using  new electron probes to characterize surfaces; the conference
               will improve our understanding of these probes, and it will  help develop the
              technology for the growth of new, thin,  film materials.  Therefore, this
              proposal fulfills the  objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer
              of  scientific knowledge through international collaboration.  ***
