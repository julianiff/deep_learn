Abstract    :
              9513669  Chong  This research is to study physical properties of liposomes
              composed of the tetraether polar lipid fraction E (PLFE) isolated from
              thermoacidophilic archaebacteria Sulfolobus acidocaldarius.  The specific aims
              are to determine isothermal compressibility, thermal expansivity, proton
              permeability, lipid rotational and lateral diffusion of PLFE liposomes.  The
              hypotheses are:  (i) PLFE liposomes are rigid but loosely packed and (ii) the
              sugar moieties at the PLFE polar headgroups play a crucial role for maintaining
              a pH gradient across the archaebacterial plasma membrane.  Fluorescence probe
              techniques as well as chemical modifications and high pressure methodologies
              will be employed.  %%%  The general purpose of this research is to gain a
              better understanding of the structure-function relationship of the
              archaebacterial membrane.  The results obtained in this research will set a
              solid basis for the future studies of interactions between Sulfolobus
              acidocaldarius membrane-bound proteins and PLFE lipids.  Archaebacteria are
              curios and remarkable organisms.  The native habitat of the thermoacidophilic
              archaebacterium Sulfolobus acidocaldarius is hot (65-75 0C) and acidic (pH 2-3)
              sulfur springs.  Besides, Sulfolobus has found wide use in biotechnology, most
              notably in the use of its DNA polymerase and (-galactosidase for molecular
              biology research.  Also, liposomes made from archaebacteria-type lipids show
              remarkable thermostability, which may have potential use in the nanoscale
              design of artificial ion channels and membrane receptors.  ***
