              Sung  The proposed research will use a set of Arabidopsis root mutants to
              characterize the genes necessary for continuous root growth. These mutants,
              called root meristemless (rml), are impaired in the ability to initiate and
              maintain cell division in the root apex, resulting in meristemless roots of 1-2
              mm in length. Complementation analysis has identified two RML genes, RML1 and
              RML2, which are mapped to chromosome four and three, respectively. Although
              rml1 mutants produce normal embryonic roots, root apical cells undergo no, or
              limited, cell division after germination. rml1 mutants are able to initiate
              lateral and adventitious roots, However, these roots also arrest  cell division
              once the size of the embryonic root is reached. It is hypothesized that the two
              wild type RML genes are involved in the signal transduction pathway mediating
              cell proliferation at the root tip. To test this hypothesis, Dr. Sung will
              identify and clone the genes involved in root apical cell proliferation. The
              RML1 gene will be cloned first to develop a molecular probe for studying the
              temporal and spatial expr ession of the RML1 gene in the wild type and mutant
              plants. The phenotype of the 35S:RML1 transgenic plants will be characterized
              to seek evidence supporting the proposed role of the RML1 gene. The long term
              goal is to understand the principles and mechanisms of localized cell
              proliferation in plants. ***                         ;
