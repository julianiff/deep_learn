Abstract    :
              This award supports collaboration between Mitchell Begelman and his research
              group at the University of Colorado, and Ruediger Staubert and others of the
              Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics of the University of Tuebingen,
              Germany.  They are studying the origin of the hard X-ray component in emissions
              from hot coronae around accretion disks.  In particular, they are attempting to
              develop a set of self-consistent models through numerical analysis which can
              then be used more widely by other astronomers.  The collaborative plan combines
              the theoretical skills in modeling active galaxies possessed by Begelman and
              his graduate student, James Dove, with the data acquisition and analysis skills
              of Professor Staubert and his colleagues.  The latter has been one of the
              leading groups in the world in the study of high energy phenomena in x-ray
              binaries and other systems.  The U.S. side will be responsible for developing
              computer code and the basic theoretical models; these models will be greatly
              improved by the physical data obtained by the German group.   The technique of
              x-ray spectroscopy has improved substantially, and now produces x-ray spectral
              data that is high enough quality to warrant detailed theoretical modeling. 
              This project brings together two research groups with the complementary
              expertise to accomplish this task and improve understanding of accretion disk
              coronae.
