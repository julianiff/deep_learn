Abstract    :
              9513154  Dodge  Research will be carried out in high energy electron scattering 
              reactions centered on the study of coherent neutral pion electro-  production
              from complex nuclei.  Research in this area will  advance our understanding of
              the interactions of the delta  resonance in the nuclear medium, and test
              predictions of model-  independent low energy theorems and chiral perturbation
              theory.  The experiments will be carried out largely at the NIKHEF  laboratory
              in Holland.  Planning for future experiments at the  CEBAF laboratory to test
              the Drell-Hearn-Gerasimov sum rule will  also be carried out.  This activity
              relates to probing the spin-  structure of nucleons.  Development,
              construction, and  utilization of major state-of-the-art equipment, including
              drift  chambers for the CEBAF CLAS spectrometer, is integral to this  latter
              activity.  All of the above topics are high priority  activities in
              contemporary nuclear physics.  ***
