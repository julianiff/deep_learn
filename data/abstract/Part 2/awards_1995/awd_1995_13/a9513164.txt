Abstract    :
              9513164  Lange    This award supports a three-year cooperative research  project
              between Prof. Andrew Lange of the California  Institute of Technology and Prof.
              Toshio Matsumoto of the  Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS). 
              This  project will facilitate the development of, and analysis of  data from,
              state-of-the-art instrumentation used to conduct  astronomical observations at
              infrared wavelengths from above  the Earth's atmosphere.  The studies will
              address  fundamental problems in astrophysics, including the diffuse  infrared
              background radiation and the nature of the dark  matter in galactic halos.   
              This proposal brings together research scientists from Japan  and the U.S.
              working in the area of experimental  astrophysics.  The U.S. scientists will
              have the opportunity  to become familiar with research techniques and equipment
              at  ISAS and at Nagoya University.  Therefore, this proposal  fulfills the
              objectives of the Program in its exchange and  transfer of scientific knowledge
              through an international  collaboration.  ***
