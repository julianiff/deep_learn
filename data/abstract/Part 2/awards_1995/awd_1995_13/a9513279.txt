Abstract    :
              9513279  Bradlow    A U.S.-Brazil Workshop on Geometry, Topology, and Physics 
              will be supported to take place in Aguas de Lindoia, Brazil  in 1996. There
              would be several distinct special sessions  and is expected to initiate an
              on-going collaboration  between the Institute of Mathematics, statistics and 
              Computer Science (IMECC) at the Universidade Estadual de  Campinas, and the US
              universities of Texas-Austin, Oklahoma  Norman, and Illinois-Champaign-Urbana.
              Led by Steven Bradlow  at Illinois and W. A. Rodrigues at IMECC, a bilateral 
              committee of 7 will organize and run the week-long workshop.  Both the Division
              of International Programs and the Division  of Mathematical Sciences contribute
              to the support of the  workshop.    The quality of the participants, the
              isolated locale for the  workshop, and the focus on the interface between
              methods and  applications promise to stimulate new areas of research and  new
              international collaborations.  Both recent graduates and  renowned researchers
              are included in the list of invitees,  contributing to strength and continuity.
