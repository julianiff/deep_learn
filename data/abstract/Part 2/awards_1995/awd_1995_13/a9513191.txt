Abstract    :
              9513191  Greenspan    Innate behavior, such as courtship in the fruit fly, 
              Drosophila  melanogaster, is subject to a high degree of genetic  control.  But
              some  aspects of it are also modifiable through learning.  What a  male fly
              learns  during courtship is not to waste his time on a female who  has already
              mated  and who will consequently not be receptive to him.   An  enzyme in nerve
               cells known as the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein  kinase (CaM kinase 
              II) is thought to play an important role in learning and  memory.  We have 
              developed techniques to alter the activity of this enzyme in  vivo and will 
              carry out studies to define what parts of the brain are  involved in this 
              example of learned behavior.
