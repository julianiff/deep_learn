Abstract    :
              9513819  Fang     In eukaryotic organisms, proteins that are destined for
              secretion contain an amino-terminal signal peptide, a short sequence of amino
              acids that direct co-translational translocation of the nascent protein across
              the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).  Once this signal sequence
              completes its task of leading the nascent protein across the membrane, it is
              proteolytically removed by the action of a signal peptidase on the lumenal side
              of the ER.  The signal peptidase complex is a multi-subunit enzyme complex in
              the endoplasmic reticulum.  This small one-year award will support initiation
              of research activities aimed toward functional characterizations of two
              newly-identified genes involved in the activity of the yeast (Saccharomyces
              cerevisiae) signal peptidase complex (SPC): SPC3, an essential gene which
              encodes the 25 kD subunit of yeast SPC; and SPC4, a gene isolated as a
              high-copy suppressor of a temperature-sensitive mutant of Sec11, the gene
              encoding the 18kD subunit.  The studies of SPC3 will include phenotypic
              analyses of temperature-sensitive mutants after shift to the non-permissive
              temperature, and biochemical analyses of the interactions of the gene product
              with other proteins using epitope tagging.  The studies of SPC4 will include
              phenotypic analyses of mutations in this gene.  ***
