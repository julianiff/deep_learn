Abstract    :
                  Abstract  9513864  Fewtrell      This proposal is to study the role of
              calcium in stimulus-response coupling in non-excitable cells.  Both the
              amplitude of the calcium signal and its frequency of calcium oscillations have
              been found to be important, as well as additional signals like protein kinase
              C.  In this proposal the temporal relation between changes in intracellular
              calcium and secretion will be studied in single cells using a mucosal mast cell
              line.  Intracellular calcium will be measured by indo-1 photometry, and the
              secretion of individual serotonin-containing granules will be measured
              simultaneously in the same cell by constant potential amperometry.  This will
              determine the calcium response associated with a burst of secretion. 
              Fluorescence imaging will be used to monitor the calcium responses of a number
              of cells  simultaneously.  These calcium responses will be measured in response
              to a number of different stimuli.  %%%    This project will examine the role of
              calcium in the secretory response of mast cells to specific effectors, which is
              a type of stimulus response coupling, that occurs in many physiological
              responses.  ***
