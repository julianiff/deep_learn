Abstract    :
                9513578  Friesema    This award will support the participation of twelve U.S. 
              investigators to take part in a workshop concerned with the  delineation of
              appropriate boundaries for parks and nature  reserves.  The workshop will be
              held at the University of  New England in Armidale, New South Wales, Australia,
              in late  January 1996.  The American organizers of the workshop are   Dr. H.
              Paul Friesma, Director of the Environmental Policy Program  at Northwestern
              University, and Dr. Ronald Sundell, leader of the  ecology and natural
              resources team of the Argonne National  Laboratory Center for Environmental
              Restoration Systems.  The  Australian organizer is Prof. John J. Pigram,
              Executive Director  of the Center for Water Policy Research at the University
              of New  England.  The workshop is being conducted under the U.S.-  Australia
              Cooperative Science Program and support in Australia is  provided through the
              Australian Department of Industry, Science  and Technology (DIST).   
              Biophysical, sociocultural and managerial factors need to be  considered in the
              selection and delineation of park and natural  reserve sites.  A key question
              is the determination of boundaries  which will incorporate appropriate resource
              attributes and  contribute towards the attainment of the goals and objectives
              of  park management.  Park and reserve boundary delineation issues  are
              receiving increasing attention in both the U.S. and Australia  as parks and
              reserves come under increasing pressure from a range  of sources.  The workshop
              will consider the assessments of  ecological attributes, biophysical variables,
              managerial  considerations and community attitudes deemed essential in the 
              establishment and maintenance of parks and reserves.  The  workshop provides a
              timely opportunity to discuss common  problems and concerns in the two
              countries.
