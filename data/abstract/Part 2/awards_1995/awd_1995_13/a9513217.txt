Abstract    :
              ***  9513217  Nienhaus  This research will develop an instrument that allows the
               study of protein dynamics over a wide range of times at the  level of single
              molecules.  The instrument is based on-  photon excitation of florescence.  To
              obtain the high spatio-  temporal density of photons necessary for a high
              probability  of two-photon absorption events, florescence excitation will  be
              provided by focusing the 150 fs wide pulses of a  femtosecond Ti:sapphire laser
              to a diffraction limited spot  in an epi-illuminated microscope.  The method
              promises an  extremely good signal-to-noise ratio because the excitation  light
              is well separated in wavelength from the emission of  the florescent probes. 
              Therefore, Rayleigh and Raman  scattering can be efficiently suppressed. 
              Detector noise  will be further reduced by time gating.  The instrument is 
              sensitive to dynamic process with characteristic time scales  ranging from
              nanoseconds to seconds and longer, which escape  from the time window of
              conventional fluorescence  spectroscopy.  Processes that can be studied include
               rotational and translational diffusion, internal  conformational relaxation of
              proteins, and molecular  interactions. for example, protein aggregation and
              binding  of small ligands.  ***
