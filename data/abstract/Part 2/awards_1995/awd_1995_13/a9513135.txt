Abstract    :
              The work to be performed in this program is the spectroscopy  of alkali clusters
              at the rotational level using resonant  two-photon ionization and
              optical-optical double resonance  spectroscopy.  The goal of the experiments is
              to probe the  dynamic behavior of the vibronic states through the  influence of
               ro-vibronic coupling on the rotational levels.  Clusters form the bridge
              between gas phase atomic physics  and condensed matter physics, and the
              information which is  sought at this detailed level is fundamental to 
              understanding the transition from one phase to the next.
