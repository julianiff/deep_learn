Abstract    :
              9513036  Matyjaszewski    This award supports the participation of 9 U.S.
              researchers  in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Macromolecular Architecture and 
              Engineering, to be held in Sendai, Japan from October 27 to  October 31, 1996.
              The co-organizers are Prof. Krzysztof  Matyjaszewski of Carnegie Mellon
              University in Pittsburgh  and Professor Prof. Shohei Inoue of Science
              University of  Tokyo.  The theme of the proposed seminar was chosen in  order
              to highlight recent advances in the elaboration of  novel polymerization
              methods and their use in the design of  new and well-defined complex
              macromolecular architectures  capable of generating advanced materials with
              controlled  optical, electronic, ionic, biomedical, high strength, and  other
              special properties.  Important contributions in each  of these areas are being
              made both in U.S. and in Japan, and  increased exchange of ideas and
              information between these  two groups is clearly warranted.   The U.S.
              participants  provide a broad cross section of expertise and geographical 
              representation in the area of synthetic polymer chemistry  and polymer
              characterization, and were selected on the basis  of being the most active
              researchers in the U.S. Therefore,  this proposal fulfills the objectives of
              the Program in its  exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through an 
              international collaboration.  ***
