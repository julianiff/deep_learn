Abstract    :
              9513102  Liebermann    This award supports a three-year cooperative research 
              project between Professor Robert C. Liebermann of the State  University of New
              York at Stony Brook and Professor Tetsuo  Irifune of Ehime University.  The
              collaborators assembled  also include faculty and postdoctoral staff of the
              Mineral  Physics Institute at Stony Brook and Hokkaido University.  This
              proposal will address some of the most important areas  of research on  the
              elastic and rheological properties of  the high-pressure phases of mantle
              minerals.  The objective  of this research is an improved understanding of the 
              dynamical processes in the Earth's interior.    This proposal brings together
              research scientists from two  countries working in complimentary ways on
              mineral physics  and chemistry.  The U. S. scientists will have the 
              opportunity to become familiar with the high-pressure  facilities at Ehime
              University and the electron microscope  facilities of Hokkaido University.
              Therefore, this proposal  fulfills the objectives of the Program in its
              exchange and  transfer of scientific knowledge through international 
              collaboration.  ***
