Abstract    :
              9513078  Lanyi    This award supports the participation of 14 U.S. scientists 
              in a U.S.-Japan seminar on the Structural Basis of  Information and Energy
              Transduction in Retinal Proteins, to  be held in Kyoto, Japan, from March
              16-20, 1997.  The co-  organizers are Professors Janos K. Lanyi of the
              University  of California, Irvine and Akio Maeda of the University of  Kyoto. 
              The purpose of this seminar is to assess recent  progress in understanding the
              structural basis for the  function of retinal proteins.  These proteins are
              currently  under intense investigation because they participate in  energy and
              information transfer, both essential for life.  Leading researchers from the
              U.S. and Japan will interact  and exchange ideas so as to develop new concepts
              and  experimental approaches to study retinal proteins as light  receptors.
              Specifically, the seminar will include topics on  excited state dynamics,
              photochemical reaction kinetics,  protein conformation changes, proton
              conduction mechanisms,  thermodynamics, signal transduction in vision and in 
              phototaxis, and photosensors based on retinal proteins.  The  U.S. participants
              were selected on the basis of being the  most active researchers in the
              rhodopsin field.  Therefore,  this proposal fulfills the objectives of the
              Program in its  exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through 
              international collaboration.  ***
