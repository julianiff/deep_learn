              9513672 Damuni        There is considerable evidence that insulin regulates
              diverse cellular processes, in part, by causing a marked increase in the
              phosphoylation of numerous cellular proteins on serine and threonine residues. 
               However, despite substantial progress in recent years, the mechanism
              underlying this effect of insulin remains unclear.  The experiments described
              in the proposal are designed to test the hypothesis that the mechanism by which
              insulin causes a marked increase in the phsophorylation of cellular proteins on
              serines and threonines is mediated in part by: a) the phosphorylation and
              activation of a distinct insulin-stimulated protein serine threonine kinase
              (cPK) catalyzed by MBPK-1 and MBPK-2, two new members of the mitogen-activated
              protein kinase (MAPK) family, b) the phosphorylation and inactivation of
              protein phosphatase 2A, a major cytoplasmic protein serine threonine
              phosphatase, and c) by the activation of phosphorylation of MBPK-1 and 2 
              catalyzed by MAPK kinase.  The specific questions addressed in this application
              are: a) are cPK, PP2A, MBPK-1 and MBPK-2 phos phorylated at regulatory sites in
              intact cells in response to insulin, and b) are MBPK-1 and MBPK-2 distinct
              members of the MAPK family of enzymes.  To address these questions, a
              combination of biochemical, immunological and molecular approaches will be
              employed to determine the location of residues modified on cPK, PP2A, MBPK-1
              and MBPK-2 in vitro and in  vivo.  To establish the relationship of MBPK-1 and
              MBPK-2 to the MAPK family of enzymes, cDNAs of the former will be isolated,
              sequenced and expressed, and the recombinant proteins will be purified and
              characterized.  The studies in this application will provide  important new
              information on the mechanism of insulin action. ***                         ;
