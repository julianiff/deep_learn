Abstract    :
              9513303  Grodzicker  This proposal is for partial support of a conference
              devoted to progress in the use of the zebrafish as a subject for studies in the
              development of the nervous system.  The zebrafish has emerged in recent years
              as a model system with which to analyse the developement of the central nervous
              system at structural, biochemical, and genetic levels.  The forum will bring
              together leading established scientists and young scientists to  evaluate the
              current state of knowledge and explore future prospects.
