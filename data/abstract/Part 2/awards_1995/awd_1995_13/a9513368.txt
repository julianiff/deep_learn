Abstract    :
              This award supports Professors Lane and Edith Hemaspaandra, of the University of
              Rochester and Le Moyne College, respectively, to collaborate in computer
              science with Professor Gerd Wechsung of the Friedrich Schiller University of
              Jena, Germany.  Together they will study several topics of current interest in
              computational complexity theory  These include (1) rigorous studies of the
              effect of query order on complexity (i.e., whether and when the order of access
              to multiple information sources matters) and (2) certificate complexity
              (calculating the conditions that control the size of classes of sets which
              always have acceptance certificates that can be easily computed.)  The U.S. and
              German participants in this collaboration bring to bear complementary strengths
              in the creative theoretical aspects and the rigorous mathematical aspects of
              computational complexity.  The joint effort of these talented and prolific
              researchers should produce significant contributions to the study of structural
              aspects of complexity theory.  Results will have implications in many aspects
              of computer and information science.
