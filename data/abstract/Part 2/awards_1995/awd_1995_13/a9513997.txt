Abstract    :
              9513997  Cherry       A group at Louisiana State has participated in an 
              international collaboration-the Japanese American  Cooperative Emulsion
              Experiment (JACEE) - in carrying out  experiments from which they will obtain
              information on the  composition of cosmic-rays.  This grant supports their 
              continuing analysis of the data recorded in emulsions  carried to high
              altitudes on long-duration balloon fights  that circle the South Pole.  ***
