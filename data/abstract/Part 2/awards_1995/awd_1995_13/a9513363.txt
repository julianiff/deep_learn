Abstract    :
              This award supports Professor Lu Sham and a junior associate of the University
              of California at San Diego to collaborate with Professor Friedhelm Bechstedt of
              the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena, Germany.  They are studying
              coherence effects in strongly-correlated insulators and metals.  In particular,
              they will investigate the possible detectability of coherence through the
              nonlinear optical response of the system.  The collaborating research groups
              bring complementary expertise in many body theory and in optical properties of
              condensed matter systems.  Strong electron-electron correlation plays a pivotal
              role in the electronic properties of modern metals and insulators such as the
              cuprate compounds and the heavy fermion compounds.  If optically excited
              coherence effects can be shown to exist in theory, this will provide an
              operational definition for strong correlation in a large number of metals and
              insulators.  In turn, this would lead to an optical means for experimentally
              observing strongly correlated behavior and an effective optical test for
              predictions of strong-correlation theories.
