Abstract    :
              9513847  Linbo  Certain transgenic plant lines expressing translatable or
              untranslatable forms of the tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV) coat protein gene are
              resistant to infection by TEV.  Past research has suggested that such
              transgenic plants are resistant due to the presence of a sequence specific RNA
              dgradation activity which targets both the transgene RNA and TEV RNA. The
              specific aims of this research are to identify: (1)  the significance of the
              RNA degradation in virus resistance, (2) the specific RNA sequences recognized
              by this RNA degrading activity, and (3) how the RNA degradation system may be
              induced.  %%%  Plant viruses can be serious agricultural pathogens, causing
              significant crop losses. The largest group of plant viruses, and one of the
              most economically important is the potyvirus group. Some transgenic tobacco
              plant lines have been engineered to produce two different types of  coat
              protein RNA when infected with TEV. The plant which has one form of the RNA is
              immediately resistant to the viral infection but the other type is at first
              susceptible and then becomes resistant. The goal of this project is to
              characterize the two forms of resistance.  ***
