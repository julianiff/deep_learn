Abstract    :
              9513059  Iwasa    This award supports a three-year cooperative  research 
              project between Professor  Yuki-Kazu Iwasa, Department of Mechanical
              Engineering,  Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Professor Osami 
              Tsukamoto, Faculty of Engineering, Yokohama National  University, Yokohama,
              Japan.  The project involves other  U.S. investigators from the Brookhaven
              National Laboratory,  Los Alamos National Laboratory, Rensselaer Polytechnic 
              Institute, and Iowa State  University.  The specific issues  to be covered in
              this phase of the collaborative effort are:  (1) AC losses in high-temperature
              superconductors (HTS),  particularly the impact of conductor design,  (2)
              conductor  processing techniques for "long" HTS, and (3) stability and 
              protection of power transmission cables.  The United  States  and Japan are the
              leaders and rivals in superconducting  magnet technology and are the nations
              most intensely engaged  in high-Tc superconductor research and development.  At
               present, since the R&D effort in Japan on high-Tc  superconductivity, both in
              university and industry, is  substantially greater than it is in the United
              States, it is  likely that this exchange program will greatly benefit U.S. 
              researchers.  ***
