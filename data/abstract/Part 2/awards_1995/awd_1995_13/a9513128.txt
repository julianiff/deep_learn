Abstract    :
              9513128  Huff    This U.S.-Argentina collaborative research effort will test 
              two paleogeographic reconstructions attempting to explain an  apparent early
              Paleozoic connection between North and South  America.  The alternatives would
              either have Laurentia  colliding with western South America during the Middle 
              Ordovician or a piece of Laurentia breaking off later in  Cambrian time and
              drifting south, accreting to the western  margin of South America.  The
              collaboration between Warren  Huff of the University of Cincinnati, Dennis
              Kolata of the  Illinois State Geological Survey, Stig Bergstrom of Ohio  State
              University, and Carlos Cingolani of the Universidad  Nacional de la Plata
              together with 7 other Argentine  investigators will create a team in
              interrelated specialties  to carry out the test of the two hypotheses. Recent
              finds of  beds of K-bentonites suggest the possibility of determining  the
              stratigraphic and areal distribution of Ordovician  volcanic ash beds and their
              ability to resolve the  alternative hypotheses.    The proposed research will
              produce an international  collaboration through field work in Argentina and
              extensive  data analysis carried out in both the U.S. and Argentina.  To assure
              successful field studies, Argentine specialists  in structure and tectonics,
              graptolites, petrology and  geochemistry, paleontology, and stratigraphy have
              been  included.  One graduate student will also travel to  Argentina to
              participate in the project.    ****
