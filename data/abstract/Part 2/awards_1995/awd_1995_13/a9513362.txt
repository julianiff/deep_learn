Abstract    :
              9513362  Hayes      The ultimate goal of this study is to assess and define the
              potential role of pollutants and pesticides such as DDT on the rapid
              disappearance of amphibians worldwide, particularly frogs.  Many of these
              pollutants act on the frogs as the animal's own substances do.  Consequently, a
              deeper understanding of the physiologic molecules and mechanisms may ultimately
              shed light on not only basic survival mechanisms but also disruptive mechanisms
              which are at the core of the decline of these species.  Another significant
              thrust of this project is to involve students, both undergraduate and graduate,
              in various stages of the project, thereby allowing them not only to develop as
              future scientists but also to acquire an awareness of this significant
              disruption of biological life.   ***
