Abstract    :
                ***  9513808  Dean    Magnaporthe grisea causes rice blast, a devastating
              disease of rice. Dr. Dean is interested in a specialized developmental process
              required by this fungus for successful infection of its host. Infection is
              initiated by the formation of a specialized infection cell, the appressorium.
              The induction of this uniquely organized cell is dependent on specific
              environmental cues. The goal of Dr. Dean's research is to understand how the
              fungus recognizes these cues, relays the information within the cell to
              initiate appressorium formation as well as the biochemical machinery that is
              associated with appressorium development and function. Results from these
              investigations will not only provide fundamental information but will have
              practical relevance. Dissection of the genetic and biochemical pathways central
              to infection related morphogenesis will identify new targets for intervention
              and may lead to the development of rational mechanism based control measures
              for M. grisea and potentially other fungal pathogens. Previous research
              identified a number of interesting developmental mutants and showed that a cAMP
              mediated signal transduction pathway is essential for appressorium formation
              and pathogenicity.  Transformants lacking the gene encoding the catalytic
              subunit of protein kinase A (cpkA), the principle source of intracellular cAMP,
              are unable to form appressorium on rice and are nonpathogenic. To further
              advance our knowledge of intracellular communication and identify other key
              elements regulating the induction and development of appressorium formation the
              following experimental objectives are proposed: 1) Isolation and
              characterization of genes required for appressorium formation, including DNA
              complementation of mutant loci and identification of transcriptionally
              regulated genes, 2) Identification and characterization of cellular signaling
              components mediating the induction of appressorium formation, including
              G-proteins and other proteins specifically phosphorylated during  infection
              related morphogenesis.  ***
