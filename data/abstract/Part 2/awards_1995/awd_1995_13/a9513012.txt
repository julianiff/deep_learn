Abstract    :
              A plan is presented to study the mechanistic and ecological aspects of  plant
              interactions with the abiotic environment; with microbes,  including
              mycorrhizae; and with herbivorous insects. We request funds  for a High
              Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Workstation  (Beckman  Instrument
              Bioseparation Gradient HPLC "System Gold" (Model 126  Programmable Solvent
              Module and Model 166 Ultraviolet/Visible Detector)  and a Bio-Rad Automatic
              Sampling System (Model AS-100) , a fluorometer   Perkin Elmer model LS 50B
              "Luminescence Spectrometer" , and a  spectrophotometer  Hitachi U-1100
              Spectrophotometer with sample  sipper . These systems will be used to support
              research in three  laboratories at the University of Colorado; all of which are
              involved  in the analysis and quantification of a variety of chemical compounds
               important in ecological processes. In the laboratory of Professor Deane 
              Bowers, research is focused on the analysis of plant and insect primary  and
              secondary compounds that are important in tritrophic interactions 
              (plants-herbivorous insects-natural enemies). Research in the  laboratory of
              Professor Steve Schrnidt is in two major areas. In the  first, biodegradation
              of pentachlorophenol (PCP) by microorganisms is  studied; and the second is a
              collaborative project with Professor  Russell Monson. This collaborative
              research studies alpine nutrient  cycling at several levels: the processes and
              mechanisms of amino acid  uptake by alpine plants, and amino acid uptake in
              relation to  plant-microbe interactions, including mycorrhizae. The efforts of
              these  three laboratories will be greatly enhanced by the availability ofthe 
              requested equipment, which is presently unavailable, unreliable and 
              out-of-date, or heavily used for research in other laboratories.
