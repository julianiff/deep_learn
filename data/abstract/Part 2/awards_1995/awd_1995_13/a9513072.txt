Abstract    :
              9513072  Lieb       This research is devoted to various aspects of many-  body
              theory in quantum mechanics, to certain aspects of  field theory and
              differential equations, and to some  problems in pure mathematics.  These
              various topics have  grown out of a body of research over several decades and
              the  underlying unity is that solutions in the various problem  areas shed
              light on each other.       There are four major areas.  One is the study of 
              geometric symmetry breaking in such models as Ginzburg-  Landau vortices and
              Skyrmions.  The question of symmetry  breaking is a crucial one in modern
              physics.  The second  concerns electron correlations in many-body systems
              which,  currently, is a central topic in areas such as  superconductivity.  The
              third concern centers around the  structure of atoms and molecules.  The
              earlier work in these  areas, notably the problem of permanent dominance for 
              matrices and the question of the continuity or lack of it  for Steiner
              symmetrization of functions, which is a useful  tool in quantum mechanics and
              analysis.  ***
