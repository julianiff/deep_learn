Abstract    :
              9513071  Tufillaro       A program of research is described whose goal is to 
              enhance the modeling and control of low dimensional  nonlinear systems that
              exhibit chaotic behavior.  In order  to achieve this goal the first objective
              is to develop a  series of procedures for building models that accurately 
              describe the time evolution of these systems.  The models  are global discrete
              mappings and ordinary differential  equations constructed only from
              experimental time series  data.  The second major objective is to exploit 
              synchronization between the fitted models and measured time  series as a means
              of carrying out model verification and  control.  The third objective is to
              explore the use of  topological procedures to constrain and fine tune these 
              models.  The proposed research will significantly enhance  the ability to
              detect, model, and control the dynamics of  chaotic systems using observed time
              series data.  This  project is a collaborative effort involving the close 
              interaction of several research groups in nonlinear science  (UCSD, GIT).  ***
