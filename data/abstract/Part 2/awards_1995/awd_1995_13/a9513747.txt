Abstract    :
                      9513747  Hille      This award will support the travel over three years
              to enable  Dr. Charles Russell Hille from the Department of Medical 
              Biochemistry at the Ohio State University to conduct collaborative  research
              with Dr. Robert Anderson of the Department of Chemistry at  the University of
              Auckland.  The cooperative research will focus on  the characterization of
              electron transfer within two complex  oxidoreductases.    Xanthine oxidase from
              cow's milk catalyses the oxidative  hydroxylation of Xanthine to form uric
              acid.  Studies of the four  redox-active centers of this enzyme will be pursued
              using pulse  radiolysis.  Other work will focus on electron transfer within 
              trimethylamine dehydrogenase.  The pulse radiolysis data will be  used to
              compare and contrast the behavior of these proteins  with regard to the
              involvement of prototropic events in the  observed electron transfer processes.
               The pulse radiolysis  facilities in Auckland have been specifically designed
              with  biological applications in mind.  This project draws together the 
              biochemical expertise of Dr. Hille with the facilities available in  Dr.
              Anderson's laboratory.
