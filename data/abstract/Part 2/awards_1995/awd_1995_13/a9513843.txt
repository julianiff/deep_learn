Abstract    :
              9513843  Ashtekar  Description:  This proposal requests support for the "US-Indo
               Binational Workshop on Classical and Quantum Gravity", to be  held at the
              Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics  (IUCAA), Pune, December
              13-19, 1995.  The workshop organizers  are Professor Abhay Ashtekar and
              Post-doc Jorge Pullin of the  Center for Gravitational Physics and Geometry,
              Penn State  University, and J.V. Narlikar, Director of IUCAA.  This workshop 
              will take advantage of India's distinguished tradition in general  relativity
              as well as their significant investments in radio and  optical astronomy which
              recently have stimulated further research  in general relativity, astrophysics
              and cosmology.  Rapid progress  in the interface of general relativity with
              astrophysics, cosmology,  particle physics, quantum theory and certain branches
              of  mathematics has added to the number of directions of active  research.  The
              workshop will bring US participants together with  key Indian scientists
              working in gravitational physics with the aim  of developing collaborative
              links between research groups in the  US and India in well-defined areas of
              gravitational physics.  Scope:  The event will be hosted by the IUCAA and is
              supported  by the Department of Science and Technology.  US scientists will 
              have a unique opportunity to gain direct knowledge about the  research being
              carried out by first-rate Indian scientists and to meet  next generation
              leaders.  Considering the calibre of young Indian  scientists now working in
              this field, there is a high probability that  even more important contributions
              will arise from collaborative  efforts with the US scientists.   ***
