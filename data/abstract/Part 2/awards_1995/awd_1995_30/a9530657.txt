Abstract    :
              A  new  feature  space trajectory (FST) description  of  3-D  distorted versions
              of an object or object part is considered  in  which  different  distorted
              object views  are  different  vertices  on  the FST.  Adjacent vertices are 
              connected  by  straight  lines.  Different objects  or  object  parts  have 
              different  FSTs.  For  input data (an object  or  an  object  part),  the FST
              closest to the input data denotes the  class  of  the  object  and the closest
              line segment  on  that  FST  denotes  the  pose  of the object or  part.   A 
              neural  net  processor   performs   all  needed  distance   calculations. 
              Fundamental  issues associated with this new  representation  of  distorted 
              objects  are  addressed.  Processing  a  time  sequence of input data and its
              pose estimation ability  will  be  used  in active vision systems.  Its good
              generalization  and performance on small training sets will be studied.  Its 
              ability to reject false (non object) inputs and to learn new  inputs will be
              studied.
