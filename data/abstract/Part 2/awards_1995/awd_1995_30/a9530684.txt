Abstract    :
              9530684  Takahashi    This research project is part of the US Joint Global Ocean
               Flux Study (JGOFS) Southern Ocean Program aimed at (1) a  better understanding
              of the fluxes of carbon, both organic  and inorganic, in the Southern Ocean,
              (2) identifying the  physical, ecological and biogeochemical factors and 
              processes which regulate the magnitude and variability of  these fluxes, and
              (3) placing these fluxes into the context  of the contemporary global carbon
              cycle.    Water masses such as Antarctic Bottom Water and Antarctic 
              Intermediate Water which originate in the high latitude  Southern Ocean areas
              spread through the interior of the  major ocean basins thus forming a major
              conduit for  exchanges of heat and dissolved gases such as carbon dioxide  and
              oxygen between the atmosphere and the interior of the  oceans.  Therefore, an
              improved understanding of the  processes governing the physical, and
              biogeochemical  properties of the source waters in the Southern Ocean is 
              important not only for gaining quantitative knowledge of the  carbon-nutrient
              cycle in the global oceans, but also for  predicting the future course of
              atmospheric carbon dioxide  and hence the climate of the earth.    This
              research program consists of the following three kinds  of field observations. 
              Continuous underway measurements of  the total carbon dioxide concentration in
              surface waters  will be made throughout the JGOFS cruises in order to 
              determine the seasonal and geographic variations and the  causes of oceanic
              carbon dioxide sink/source conditions.  Measurements of the partial pressure of
              gaseous carbon  dioxide and total carbon dioxide in discrete seawater  samples
              will be conducted to observe depth profiles of the  carbon chemistry
              (especially in the upper 500 meters) at  hydrographic stations located at
              various latitudes during  two seasonal cruises.  High resolution measurements
              of  the  hydrographic structure of the uppermost 250 meters and od  nutrients
              will be conducted  in order to document the  mesoscal e variability of
              biogeochemical properties within  the Antarctic Polar Front Zone.  This will be
              done with a  towed pumping system, designated as SeaSoar, on one of the 
              cruises to the APF.  ***
