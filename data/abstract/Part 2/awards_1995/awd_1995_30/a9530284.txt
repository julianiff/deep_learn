Abstract    :
              9530284  Shervais      This award provides funds for in partial support  of the
              costs of upgrading an aging (circa 1986),  first generation CAMECA SX-50
              electron microprobe  in use at the University of South Carolina's  Department
              of Geological Sciences for geochemical  analyses in petrologic studies of
              continental,  oceanic and lunar samples.  The upgrade will  replace outdated
              and no longer supported computer  hardware and software used for controlling
              the  instrument and for subsequent data analysis.  These improvements will
              allow more rapid and  improved X-ray image acquisition, thin film  analyses and
              energy dispersive spectrum analyses.  ***
