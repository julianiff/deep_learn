Abstract    :
              9530886  Williams           Recent political changes in the Republic of Mongolia
              make it  possible for the first time in modern history to begin the 
              establishment of long-term cooperative programs to study a wide  variety of
              important scientific problems in this important region  of Asia.  In order to
              begin this process, NSF requested the P.I.s  to organize a Planning Workshop
              for American scientists to explore  and develop opportunities for cooperative
              research with Mongolian  scientists.  The purpose of the workshop is to provide
              the broader  U.S. scientific community, including governmental and non- 
              governmental agencies, with a coordinated science plan for future  large and
              small scale scientific investigations in the Republic of  Mongolia.        
              Several important questions to be addressed by the workshop  include:         o
                 the level of biological endemism in lakes of the Hovsgol            and
              Darhad Grabens of northern Mongolia and the            relationships between
              the biota of the Selenga River in            northern Mongolia which connects
              Hovsgol Nuur with Lake            Baikal;         o    the tectonic and
              structural relationship of these lake            systems and surrounding
              tectonic terrains to the            Himalayan orogeny, the uplift of the
              Tibetan Plateau and            the reactivation of the Baikal Rift Zone
              including the            evolution of Lake Baikal and the climatic regime of
              Asia;         o    the surface ruptures and deformation associated with        
                 great earthquakes in Mongolia to understand the process            of
              intracontinental mountain building.  ***
