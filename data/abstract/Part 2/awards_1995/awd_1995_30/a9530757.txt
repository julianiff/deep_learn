Abstract    :
                  The objectives of the proposed research are to determine the rates of
              subglacial ice accretion, identify the genesis of englacial debris bands, and
              assess the generality of freeze-on mechanisms.    Recent research by the
              authors demonstrates that debris-rich basal ice at the Matanuska Glacier, in
              south-central Alaska, forms by basal freeze-on in an open hydrologic system. 
              Evidence includes: 1) tritium-rich basal ice; 2) summer melt-season ice growth
              in subglacially-fed, high-pressure discharge vents; and 3) measurements of
              sub-zero water temperatures.  Subglacial water flowing towards the terminus
              supercools when the pressure-melting point rises faster than the temperature
              increases.  During periods of high discharge, supercooling occurs where the
              slope of the bed is steeper and in the opposite direction than the slope of the
              glacier surface.    Tritium analysis provides a "fingerprint" of ice which
              formed since 1952.  Elevated concentrations of tritium in basal ice indicate
              post-1952 freeze-on from atmospherically-derived waters.  High-resolution
              analysis of tritium, (18(, and (D from multiple basal sections at the Matanuska
              Glacier will provide data necessary to calculate subglacial accretion rates and
              to estimate the relative contributions of different water sources to the
              subglacial drainage system.  A record of tritium concentrations in
              precipitation in this region from 1958 to 1993 provides an input function to
              which the tritium profiles in basal ice can be correlated.  In addition,
              tritium, (18(, and (D in samples obtained across englacial debris bands at the
              Matanuska Glacier will provide information on the genesis of these ubiquitous
              and controversial features.    Interpretations of Heinrich events, estimates of
              glacial debris flux, and models of glacier sliding all require knowledge or
              assumptions of subglacial conditions and mechanisms of debris entrainment.  The
              information gained from this research will increase our understanding of
              subglacial processes and will provide critica l constraints to numerical models
              of glacier flow and debris transport in the glacial system.
