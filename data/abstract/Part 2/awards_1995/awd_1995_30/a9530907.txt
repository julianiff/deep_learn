Abstract    :
              9530907  HANSELL    This project will supply shipboard scientific support
              equipment   for the research vessel WEATHERBIRD II, operated by the Bermuda 
              Biological Station for Research, Inc, and dedicated to use in  support of ocean
              science research.          The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program
              provides funds  for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe    
              conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support   for such
              items as deck equipment including winch systems for the   deployment and
              retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational   equipment such as radars,
              gyroscopes and earth satellite     receivers to pin point the location of
              research sites,     communication equipment including radio transceivers and   
               satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data     communications and
              other equipment such as motorized workboats    for transporting scientists to
              and from data retrieval sites.        The Project Director, Dennis A. Hansell
              is fully qualified to    direct this project having had considerable experience
              in    overseeing the acquisition and installation of shipboard    equipment.   
                 This project will allow the institution to refurbish a drum and  obtain a
              control valve for the hydro winch, obtain a search and  rescue transponder for
              improved safety, and obtain an INMARSAT C  and 2 VHF radios for improved
              communications.  ***
