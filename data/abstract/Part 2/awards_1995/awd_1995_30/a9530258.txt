Abstract    :
              9530258  Du  The corrosion of silicon nitride materials at high  temperature in
              dry and wet oxygen will be studied.  The  effects of aluminum implantation will
              receive special  emphasis and the effects of sodium contamination will be 
              evaluated.  The surface composition and microstructure will  be characterized
              in detail at various stages of the  corrosion process and correlated with
              corrosion rates which  will be determined by in-situ thickness measurements 
              involving laser reflectance complemented by ex-situ  ellipsometry and
              profilometry measurements.  A kinetic model  will be constructed to describe
              the corrosion process and to  evaluate corrosion rate constants, diffusivity
              values of  rate-controlling species, and their temperature dependence.  ***
