Abstract    :
                    9530310  Ehrenpreis    This award provides support for a conference on
              applications of  harmonic   analysis in number theory and approximation theory.
              The  conference is being   held in honor of Donald J. Newman, and the emphasis
              is on areas  of mathematics   that have been influenced by Newman's ideas. The
              conference will  create   opportunities for cross-fertilization of ideas among
              workers in  two important   areas of classical mathematics.    Number theory
              has its historical roots in the study of the whole  numbers,   addressing such
              questions as those dealing with the divisibility  of one   whole number by
              another. It is among the oldest branches of  mathematics and   was pursued for
              many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within   the last half
              century it has become an indispensable tool in  diverse   applications in areas
              such as data transmission and processing,  and   communication systems.
              Harmonic analysis combines those elements  of mathematics   best  exemplifying
              the ideas of synthesis.  One seeks to  decompose  complex   problems into
              fundamental components.  These components are then  analyzed for   their basic
              characteristics. Finally, the  solution is  reconstructed through a  
              recombination of the  components.The Fourier series and Fourier  transform are 
                examples of tools used in this context; one discrete , the other  
              representing   a continuous decomposition. Harmonic analysis is a surprisingly 
              useful tool in  studying whole numbers.
