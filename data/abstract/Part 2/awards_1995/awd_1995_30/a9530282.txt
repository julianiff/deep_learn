Abstract    :
              95-30282  Binzel    Dr. Binzel will carry out a 5-year project of infrared 
              spectroscopy of  asteroids using a new, state-of-the-art spectrograph and the 
              NASA Infrared  Telescope Facility, Mauna Kea, HI.  The spectrograph covers  the
              wavelength  range of 0.9 to 1.8 microns and will permit pushing the 
              observational limits  for observing asteroids by at least two magnitudes
              fainter  than previous  observations.  The spectrograph was designed,
              purchased, and  tested by the  Principal Investigator through a previous NSF
              Presidential  Young  Investigator award (AST 90-58462).    The scientific goals
              of the observations are manifold.  They  include  identifying asteroid analogs
              for ordinary chondrite and  basaltic achondrite  meteorites, sampling the range
              of compositional properties  of near-Earth  asteroids, and investigating
              unusual mineralogies among the  asteroids.  Supporting visible wavelength
              spectra will be obtained via a  separate  NASA-funded observing program at Kitt
              Peak, AZ.    The ultimate objective of the investigation is to improve  our
              knowledge of  the relationship between the principal classes of meteorites  and
              asteroids,  and to advance our understanding of the formation and  evolution of
              the planets  ***
