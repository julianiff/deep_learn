Abstract    :
              9530190  Nguyen  This program extends the frequency of oscillation for
              micromechanical resonators to the VHF, UHF and S bands for application in
              wireless communication networks.  Investigations will be conducted into
              material properties, mechanical design, circuit modeling, transducer design,
              fabrication, and electrical evaluation of the resonators.  In order to extend
              the range of frequencies the resonators require nano-scale
              electrode-to-resonator gaps.  This research will examine the influence of
              scaling on thermal and phase noise, the need to integrate peripheral circuits
              on the same substrate as the resonators, new design methodologies and a study
              of the performance parameters including reliability considerations.  In
              particular, the research will focus on those loss mechanisms which limit the
              achievable quality factor, Q, of  high frequency micromechanical resonators. 
              the ultimate objective of this research is to realize single-chip transceivers
              based upon microelectromechanical (MEMS) signal processors.  ***
