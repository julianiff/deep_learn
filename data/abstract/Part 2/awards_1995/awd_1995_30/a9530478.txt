Abstract    :
              AST 9530478    The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment.    Dr. Paczynski
              will lead a group of international researchers  in  expanding and extending the
              Optical Gravitational Lensing  Experiment (OGLE) to a second phase.  The group
              will utilize  a  new 1.3 meter telescope being built by the Warsaw University 
              Observatory at the Las Campanas site in Chile.  They will  use a  CCD camera
              with 2000 x 2000 pixels to obtain multi-band  photometry of 100 million to 1
              billion stars towards the  bulge of  our Galaxy, the Magellanic Clouds and to
              make stellar  catalogs  for an area of up to 1000 square degrees on the sky. 
              The  group  will also search for microlensing events in the densest  stellar 
              fields.  Microlensing data will be provided in real time on  the  Internet, and
              stellar catalogs will be distributed on CD  ROMs.
