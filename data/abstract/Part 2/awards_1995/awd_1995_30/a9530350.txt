Abstract    :
              This award will support purchase and modification of instruments to  permit more
              effective analyses of trace metals and nutrients,  concentrating on Cd and P. 
              An atomic absorption spectrophotometer  will be purchased and modified to be
              able to analyze trace elements  in-line from water samples.  An ion
              chromotograph and flourescence  detector will be added to an existing nutrient
              analyzer.
