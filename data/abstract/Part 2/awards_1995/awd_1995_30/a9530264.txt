Abstract    :
              This award is made in the Office of Special Projects in support of the  
              research of  Professor Stephen Leone at the University of Colorado at  
              Boulder.  The goal of the work is to study fundamental aspects of kinetic  
              energy enhanced neutral beam epitaxy of electronic materials at low   substrate
              temperatures.  Kinetic energy enhanced neutral atoms will be   produced by
              pulsed laser vaporization of electron beam-deposited  thin   films of
              transparent substrates followed by  velocity selection of the   neutral atoms
              in the 1-10 eV range. Systems to be studied include cobalt,   iron, platinum,
              tungsten, nickel, palladium, titanium and molybdenum    atoms on  silicon
              (100), cobalt silicide,  and the heteroepitaxy of   silicon/germanium. Film
              growth will be monitored by  low energy electron   diffraction, Auger
              spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Time of   flight ion scattering 
              spectroscopy using He+ and Ne+ will be developed   to determine lattice
              spacings of the films as a function of film   thickness and growth mechanism. 
              This research will address the fundamentals of metal film deposition on  
              silicon substrates which are of fundamental importance to interconnects   on
              semiconductors.  Heteroepitaxy studies of the germanium/silicon system  
              induces lattice-strain which offers the opportunity to control the   effective
              bandgap structure of optoelectronic devices.
