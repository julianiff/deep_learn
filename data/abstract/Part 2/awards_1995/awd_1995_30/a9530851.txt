Abstract    :
              95-30851  Azam  This research project is part of the US Joint Global Ocean Flux 
              Study (JGOFS) Southern Ocean Program aimed at (1) a better  understanding of
              the fluxes of carbon, both organic and  inorganic, in the Southern Ocean, (2)
              identifying the physical,  ecological and biogeochemical factors and processes
              which  regulate the magnitude and variability of these fluxes, and (3)  placing
              these fluxes into the context of the contemporary global  carbon cycle.    This
              research will investigate the role and quantitative  importance of bacteria in
              the transformation of organic matter as  part of the JGOFS Southern Ocean
              Process Study.  Researchers  hypothesize that extreme seasonal and spatial
              variation in the  Southern Ocean leads to transient uncoupling between bacteria
              and  primary producers as mediated through the dissolved organic  matter pool. 
              The principal goal of the research will be  comprehensive spatial and temporal
              coverage of core measurements  (bacterial abundance, biomass, and production). 
              This will allow  an integrated quantitative assessment of the fraction of
              primary  production consumed by bacteria.  Equally important is the study  of
              the mechanisms controlling the rate and time frame in which  primary production
              is processed by bacteria.  This is critical to  complement the core
              measurements and address these issues.  Specifically, total bacteria counts
              will be complemented with  counts of nucleoid-containing cells and respiring
              cells to  determine the fraction of the bacterial assemblage that is  active. 
              Incubation experiments in collaboration with other  researchers will examine
              variation in DOM lability and the growth  yield of bacteria.  This project will
              provide a quantitative and  mechanistic understanding of variability in a major
              pathway of  carbon flow, the microbial loop, in the Southern Ocean.
