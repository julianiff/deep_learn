Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
              Armentrout will continue work studying the gas-phase dynamics and chemistry of
              organometallic ions, especially second- and third-row transition metals,
              reacting with atomic ions.  The main outputs of these investigations are bond
              energies between the metals and various ligands, such as hydrogen, oxygen, and
              carbon.  An extensive part of the proposed work will examine the effects of
              sequential ligation on the thermochemistry and reactivity of metal centers. 
              Flowing afterglow ion production and guided ion-beam mass spectrometry will be
              used to obtain kinetic and thermodynamic data.  Better correlations between
              gas-phase studies and condensed-phase organometallic and catalytic reactions
              should result from these experiments.  By studying reactions involving
              electrically charged molecules containing transition metal atoms, Armentrout
              can determine many properties of the corresponding neutral species, such as the
              strength of bonds between these atoms and attached units called ligands.  Such
              information is useful for understanding many processes, such as condensed-phase
              and catalytic reactions on surfaces as well as metal interactions with nucleic
              acids, which are significant in DNA replication, transcription, and messenger
              RNA translation.
