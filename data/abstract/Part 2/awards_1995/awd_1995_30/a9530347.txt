Abstract    :
              Abstract  9530347  J.W. Keto, M.F. Becker and J.R. Brock, University of Texas at
              Austin    It is proposed to experimentally investigate generation of
              nanoparticles using "laser ablation of microparticles" (LAM, a process proposed
              by the principal investigators), optimize particle collection,  and to develop
              a pilot station to check the scale-up approach.  A laboratory system with a
              production capacity of about 0.5 kg/hour using a nominal 100 Watt laser system
              is targeted.  LAM generates dry particles in the 50-300 nm size range in an
              inert carrier gas,  at either near-atmospheric conditions and low velocity flow
              or in vacuum at supersonic velocity  flow.  The nanoparticles of either
              insulator, semiconductors, metals or alloys are collected in a compatible
              surfactant to prevent agglomeration and facilitate further processing and use. 
              Fundamental knowledge for particle production and handling for the manufacture
              of conductive thick-film pastes for electronic circuits will be developed in
              collaboration with DuPont Company.  DuPont will provide expertise in powder
              preparation and handling for use in such kind of pastes, perform testing and
              give feedback to the academic team concerning the paste performance as a
              function of the particle characteristics and the production process.       The
              main contributions of the proposal target better understanding and modeling of
              the LAM process, research on the collection and processing of ultrafine
              particles, a scale-up approach, and application of the resulted particles to
              the development of a new technology which consists in the use of nanometer
              sized particles in pastes for printed circuit board conductor strips.  ***
