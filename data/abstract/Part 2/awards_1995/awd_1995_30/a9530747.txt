Abstract    :
              AST 9530747    The UM/CTIO Magellanic Cloud Emission-Line Survey.    Dr. Smith,
              Dr. Bregman, and a team of collaborators will  undertake a complete CCD
              emission line survey of the magellanic  clouds.  These investigators will take
              advantage of the newly  available camera on the University of Michigan/CTIO
              Curtis  Schmidt telescope.  The spatial resolution will be 0.84 parsec,  and
              the sensitivity will be an order of magnitude better than  previous
              photographic surveys.  The results should provide a  better understanding of
              the interstellar medium and its global  characteristics.
