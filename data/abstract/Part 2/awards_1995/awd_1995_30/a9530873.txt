Abstract    :
              9530873  Sinclair    The goal of this research is to make predictions for the
              relationship among the operating variables (pressure drop, gas, flux, and solid
              flux) in solid transfer lines.  These predictions will be generated from
              fundamental hydrodynamic models comprising mass, momentum, and energy balances
              for the two phases.  Representation of fluid-fluid, particle-particle, and
              fluid-particle interactions will be investigated in the model development, as
              well as proper formulation of boundary conditions.  Computer simulation of
              transient two-dimensional gas-solids flow will be performed, and the model will
              be extensively tested with a full range of available experimental data.    The
              results from this will lead to improved design and operation of pneumatic
              systems.  This is continuation of the research begun at Carnegie Mellon
              University.  ***
