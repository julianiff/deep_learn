Abstract    :
              9530395    Wong    In this project, the PIs will study the dynamics of
              transverse flow in a coastal plain estuary, specifically the James River
              estuary in Virginia.  Two parallel transects with high spatial resolution
              measurements will be occupied, using an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler, and
              CTD casts during two tidal cycles on spring and neap tides.  In addition, high
              temporal resolution measurements will be made with three current meter moorings
              at each one of the two transects and two bottom pressure recorders at either
              side of the estuary between the two transects. Three different dynamical
              regimes in the year will be addressed, namely, high river discharge (May), low
              river discharge (August), and the weakest vertical stratification (October).  
              A number of objectives relating to the transverse circulation will be
              addressed, culminating in an evaluation of the dominant terms in the transverse
              momentum balance, both from the observations and from a numerical model.
