Abstract    :
              OCE-9530451  Carignan    The PI requests funding to purchase shipboard
              instrumentation in  support of NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be
              used  aboard the R/V BLUE FIN, a 72 foot vessel, which is owned and  operated
              by the Institute.  Instrumentation requested includes a  CTD, a water sampling
              system, and an acoustic release system.  The  instrumentation is requested for
              support of NSF-funded cruises  aboard the BLUE FIN during 1996 and to enhance
              the scientific  capability of the vessel in the future.
