Abstract    :
              The objective of the study is to investigate crustal accretion styles and
              parameters in backarc setting and their differences from mid-ocean ridges.  The
              study has implications for ophiolites that are presumed to be generated in
              backarc environments.  The study will also test various models of tectonic
              history of the Lau spreading center area.  A multichannel seismic reflection
              survey of the Lau Basin on the Ewing with a 4 km - 160 channel streamer over 9
              acquisition days will be undertaken.
