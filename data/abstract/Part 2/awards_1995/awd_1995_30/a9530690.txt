Abstract    :
                   Elliot 9530690  This award provides funding for an investigation that will
              incorporate a  drive torwards a 1904 conjecture of Dickson, and the celebrated
              prime-pair problem. This drive will be developed using harmonic analysis on the
              multiplicative group of the rationals. To this end, unimodular  multiplicative
              functions are to be viewed as characters on the group, and a systematic study
              made of their value distribution on arithmetic progressions with large
              differences. Besides their intrinsic interest and applicability in number
              theory, the methods to be employed offer a theoretical approach to various
              algorithms used in the fast factorization of large numbers;  hence, these
              methods bear on public encryption. Methods already developed for the study of
              arithmetic functions, exposed in part in an AMS Memoir, more fully in a book to
              be published by Cambridge University Press, are to be employed to radically
              restructure the teaching of Analytic Number Theory in the proposer's
              university, and, in particular, applied to the training of several graduate
              students working towards a Ph. D. An auxiliary study is to be made of the value
              distribution of the least primitive root of  a prime modulus. The function is
              connnected to an old conjecture of  Vinogradov, and of vital interest in the
              theory of computing.   This research falls into the general mathematical field
              of Number Theory.  Number theory has its historical roots in the study of the
              whole numbers,  addressing such questions as those dealing with the
              divisibility of one  whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches
              of mathematics and  was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic
              reasons. However, within  the last half century it has become an indispensable
              tool in diverse  applications in areas such as data transmission and
              processing, and  communication systems.
