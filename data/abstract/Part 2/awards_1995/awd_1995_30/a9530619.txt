Abstract    :
              95-30619  DePoy    Dr. DePoy and his Co-Principal Investigator, Dr. Andrew P. 
              Gould, will carry  out a 3-year search for extra-solar planets.  The search 
              will be based on a  multi-color microlensing detection technique (see below). 
              The instrument to  be used is the Ohio State Infrared Imager and Spectrometer, 
              which was built  with previous NSF grants (AST 90-16112 to J. A. Frogel and 
              AST 92-18449 to  Dr. D. L. DePoy).  Observations will be carried out at the 
              Cerro Tololo  Inter-American (CTIO) Observatory 1-meter telescope.   
              "Microlensing" refers to the magnification of a background  star when it is 
              occulted (or nearly occulted) by a less distant star.  For  solar-mass stars, 
              microlensing light curves have time scales of about two  months.  If the 
              nearby star has planets, their presence can be inferred by  searching for 
              deviations from the standard microlensing light curve.  Such  deviations are 
              expected to reveal themselves in less than a day.  Microlensing searches 
              require nightly photometry of millions of stars and  sophisticated data 
              processing.    The investigators will rely on notification from teams that  are
              already  carrying out microlensing surveys in the attempt to detect  dark
              matter in  the universe.  Dr. Depoy and his coworkers have close ties  to three
              such  microlensing/dark matter teams.  Once a target has been  identified, the 
              investigators will monitor it and look for deviations from  the standard 
              microlensing light curve.  Simultaneously, they will take  images of the 
              target in two widely spaced wavelengths. This additional  imaging information 
              will allow them to constrain the masses of both the star and  planet, and to 
              determine their physical separation.  They estimate that  they may be able to 
              detect 10-20 Jupiter-mass planets during two years of  monitoring if all  stars
              have planetary systems similar to ours.  There is a  small probability  of
              detecting planets with masses as low as the earth's.  A  null-result would 
              allow the investigators to const rain the existence of  planets.  ***
