Abstract    :
                  This is jointly funded project (between the Theory of  Computing Program,
              CCR and Probability Program, DMS),  that  started under CCR-92-25008,
              ``Probabilisitic Considerations  in the Analysis of Algorithms''. Probalilistic
              considerations  arise in the analysis of algorithms in at least two important 
              ways: (1) In a randomized algorithm the outcomes of random  events are used to
              determine the progress of the algorithm.  Randomization is now a standard tool
              of the computational  scientist; (2) A second area of consideration is when the
               problem instances come from some probability distribution,  and one wants to
              understand the average performance of a  particular algorithm, which is often
              far better than its  worst case.    Under this previous grant, CCR-92-08597,
              probabilistic and  algorithmic issues were explored in such areas as: (a) 
              sampling, (b) path problems, (c) counting, (d) heuristics  for bisection/k-cut
              of weighted graphs,(d) greedy  algorithms, (e) computational biology, (f)
              complexity of  determining polyhedra from its faces, (g) hypergraphs,  and(h)
              probabilistic combinatorics.    This project explores problems in both areas.  
              In (1) the  area of randomized algorithms, the problems examined  include: (1a)
              random walks on graphs; (1b) approximation  algorithms; and (1c) learning and
              routing problems.  In (2)  the area of probabilistic analysis, the problems
              studied  include: (2a) greedy algorithms; (2b) in computational  biology,
              sequencing by hybridization and physical mapping  reconstruction for DNA; and
              (2c) some geometric problems.***
