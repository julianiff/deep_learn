Abstract    :
              This  research explores methods for increasing the  autonomy  and  reliability
              of spacecraft and space robotic systems  by  using  a  new  class  of adaptive,
              dynamically structured, neural networks.  Similar  to strategies observed in
              human adaptive motor  control,  the  networks are used to develop flexible,
              compact models of the  robot,  its payload, and the environment in which they 
              interact;  these  adaptive  models are then used to  modify  the  low  level 
              motion   control   program  so  as  to  ensure  efficient,   high  performance 
              operation.  There are three main objectives  to  the  proposed research.  The
              first is to extend neural control designs  for  fixed-base robots to
              dynamically more complex space  robotic  systems.  The second is to
              systematically investigate methods for  dynamically  varying the amount of
              computation performed  by  the  network,  attempting to simultaneously achieve 
              high  performance  with  minimum  complexity.  By combining techniques from 
              wavelet  analysis  and  nonparametric estimation with nonlinear  dynamical 
              stability  theory,  it is hoped to develop a general  methodology  for 
              designing  network  structure  adaptation  mechanisms  which  achieve  a 
              prespecified  complexity/performance  tradeoff.   The  final goal is to
              implement the resulting controllers on prototype  space  robots  operating in
              neutral buoyancy simulation,  and  to  evaluate their performance on baseline
              mission operations.
