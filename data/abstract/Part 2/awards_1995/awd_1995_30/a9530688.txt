Abstract    :
              This project will analyze trace elements (Ba, Al, Ti, Fe and  Mn) in particles
              that settle through waters of the Southern  Ocean.  These trace elements are
              hypothesized to be both  tracers of ocean productivity and indicators of carbon
               transfer from the upper ocean to the deep ocean and the  sediments.  Some
              elements, particularly the ratio Al/Ti, may  reflect productivity linked to
              siliceous plankton.  Sequential leaching combined with statistical analyses
              will  be used to identify the elements associated with different  sediment
              components.
