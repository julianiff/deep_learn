Abstract    :
              9530103  Moore    This project will use seismic data collect on and offshore of 
              southern Hawaii to determine the three-dimensional structure of  Kilauea and
              Mauna Loa volcanos.  Results will contribute to  understanding the role of
              earthquakes in accommodating stress, and  provide better constraints on
              historical earthquake data.
