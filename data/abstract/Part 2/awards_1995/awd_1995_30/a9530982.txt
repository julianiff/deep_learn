Abstract    :
              Abstract  Varadhan  9530982    This proposal will partially support a conference
              on differential equations to be held June 3-14 in Italy.  Extended survey talks
              will be given by H. Brezis, S.T. Yau, A. Majda, J.K. Moser, and L. Hormander. 
              There will also be talks by many of the international leaders in the field.  
              There also be participation by a large number of American postdocs and advanced
              graduate students.    Differential equations provide the fundamental paradigm
              for mathematical models of motion.  In this regard, differential equation
              models of fluid dynamics are important for understanding weather prediction,
              airplane flight, and the flow of blood through the human heart.
