Abstract    :
              9530469  Wynblatt    This research consists of two main thrusts.  The first 
              focuses on the modeling of surface roughening -faceting and  premelting phase
              transitions in lead alloys.  It extends  research from a previous grant in
              which Monte Carlo and  Molecular Dynamics computational techniques were
              developed .  Surface compositional and roughening-faceting phase  transitions
              in lead-bismuth-nickel alloys are emphasized.  The second thrust is an
              experimental approach to wetting  transitions in liquid alloys in the
              gallium-lead system.  A  scanning Auger microprobe technique is used to study
              wetting  transitions in liquid metallic systems under an ultrahigh  vacuum
              environment.  This permits surface composition  monitoring for assurance that
              surfaces are free of random  contaminants.  The study on multicomponent alloy
              systems  introduces composition as a variable thereby extending past  research
              which emphasized pure solids.  %%%  Surfaces of alloy systems containing more
              than one component  are  subject  to segregation phenomena.  Surface
              segregation  is relevant to many materials problems, including corrosion, 
              oxidation,  wear,  and  materials  processing  ,   such   as  sintering and
              joining.  ***
