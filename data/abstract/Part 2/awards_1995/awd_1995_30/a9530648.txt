Abstract    :
              Recent research suggests that hatcheries have been an important factor
              contributing to the decline of salmon runs throughout the Pacific Northwest. 
              This dissertation research project is designed to cast historical light on the
              construction of management policies through time, with particular attention
              paid to the emergence of artificial propagation as the primary tool of salmon
              management.  The Oregon salmon fisheries serve as a long term case study of the
              intersection of federal, state, and private understandings of salmon
              management.  Archive-based research will focus on correspondence between
              government administrators, fishery managers, industry leaders, and fishermen. 
              The research is designed to illuminate the varied understandings of the nature
              of salmon and to discern the relative influence of economic interests,
              political agendas, and science in the shaping of fishery management.  A central
              question is why artificial propagation emerged and remained the primary tool of
              salmon management when there was little scientific support or demonstration of
              its efficacy.  A historical approach to this question should help scientists
              and managers better understand the forces that have shaped fishery science and
              its application over time.
