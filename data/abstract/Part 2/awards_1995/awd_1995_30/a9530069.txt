Abstract    :
              9530069  Willey   The project investigates the chemical composition of rainwater
              samples collected at a coastal location in Wilmington, NC, and relates
              variations in the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to air mass
              origin. The Wilmington site (UNCW) is suited for wet deposition research
              because it receives precipitation from continental and maritime storms.  The
              decade of rainwater research conducted by the PI at the Wilmington site shows
              the chemical composition of rain from the two storm types to differ  with
              respect to pH, inorganic ions, formic and acetic acids, and during cold
              seasons, hydrogen peroxide concentrations.  Results obtained from the project
              will help to quantify levels of DOC that are removed from the atmosphere
              through wet deposition.  This information is relevant to processes affecting
              carbon accumulation in the atmosphere.   As a Research in Undergraduate
              Institutions (RUI) Activity, the three-year project will support one graduate
              student full-time (masters level), and six undergraduate students as summer
              research assistants.  Student assistants will be involved in sample collection,
              chemical analysis, and data interpretation relating to precipitation events. 
              The UNCW rainwater project has been an effective mechanism for training
              undergraduates in an applied area of analytical chemical research.  The project
              will continue to make significant contributions to the development of human
              resources in science.   ***  ATM-9530069
