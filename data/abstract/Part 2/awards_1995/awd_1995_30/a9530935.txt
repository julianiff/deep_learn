Abstract    :
                Using a network of digital ionospheric sounders (dynasondes) deployed in the
              Norwegian Arctic, this proposal intends to study the physics of the
              high-latitude ionosphere.  This study, which is to be conducted in
              collaboration with European researchers from the UK and Scandinavian countries,
              will utilize data from three instruments that span the region from Northern
              Norway to Svalbard. The dynasondes will be within the field of view of the
              incoherent scatter radars and hence will benefit from detailed measurements
              over small ionospheric volumes.  A primary emphasis of this study will be to
              learn more about the physics of the dayside ionospheric  cusp region, where
              shocked solar wind reaches the ionosphere, and to identify the ionospheric
              signature of various processes.  Vertical incidence ionospheric sounding
              measurements will be employed to address various issues of contemporary
              scientific debate, such as the temporal persistence of the dayside cusp, the
              behavior of transient features in the dayside ionosphere, and the morphology of
              large scale density enhancements.  An educational opportunity for the exchange
              of students between Utah State University and the University of Wales is
              feasible as the result of a program at the latter institution.  Student
              participation is also possible through a recently established program of Arctic
              studies on Svalbard by a consortium of the Norwegian Universities.
