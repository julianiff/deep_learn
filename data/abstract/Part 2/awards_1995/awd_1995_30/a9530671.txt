Abstract    :
              9530671  CARIGNAN  This proposal requests support for shipboard scientific
              support   equipment for the research vessel BLUE FIN, operated by the   
              Skidaway Institute of Oceanography, and dedicated to use in    support of ocean
              science research.      The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program
              provides funds  for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe
              conduct  of ocean science research. This Program provides support for such 
              items as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment  and
              retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment  such as radars,
              gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin  point the location of research
              sites, communication equipment  including radio transceivers and satellite
              transceivers for voice  and scientific data communications and other equipment
              such as  motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data 
              retrieval sites.    The Project Director, Steven J. Carignan is fully qualified
              to  direct this project having had considerable experience in  overseeing the
              acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment.     This project will
              allow the institution to replace a failed and  unserviceable radar, improve
              ship to shore communications with  upgraded antennas, install a rudder angle
              indicator for improved  navigation and upgrade fire fighting and life raft
              safety systems.  ***
