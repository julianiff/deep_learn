Abstract    :
              Generic  problems  of  image  understanding  in  the  context  of 
              reconstructing  the  3D  visual  environment  with   uncalibrated  cameras  are
              to be investigated using tools of modern statistics.  These  generic  problems 
              also  raise  challenging  questions  in  statistics requiring analysis of real
              data of uncommon types  not  ordinarily found in the statistical literature. 
              Introduction  of  robust  estimators  into computer vision  led  to  a 
              significant  performance   improvement.   The  currently  popular  estimators, 
              however, are not optimal for image data since they tend not to be 
              simultaneously efficient locally and with high breakdown  points.  Realistic 
              models  of  noisy data should take  into  account  the  distributions arising
              from the image formation process,  as  well  as the presence of errors in all
              the feature coordinates not only  in  the  measurements.  Redefining image
              understanding  tasks  as  statistical  problems, offers additional  insight 
              which  can  be  converted  into  new algorithms with superior  performance.  
              The  goal of this research is to exploit recent progress in statistics  for 
              the advance of computer vision, and to use the real problems  of   image 
              understanding as a testing ground  and  catalyst  for  novel statistical
              methods.
