Abstract    :
              9530338  Waring  The laws and regulations governing activities that have the
              potential to create risks of environmental harm have become both increasingly
              punitive and complex.  The past decade has seen an increase in the use of
              criminal penalties for environmental violations.  However, the effectiveness of
              these sanctioning strategies at deterring potential environmental offenders is
              not well understood.  This research focuses specifically on the perceptions by
              the population at risk of committing hazardous waste offenses of the formal and
              informal sanctions used to enforce hazardous waste laws.  The research is based
              in the state of Florida.  It uses a two-pronged approach.  The primary focus
              will be the analysis of 100 in-depth face-to-face interviews with employees of
              companies subject to hazardous waste regulation.  The second focus will be the
              collection and analysis of contextual data on the past, present, and future
              enforcement practices of the state of Florida.  %%%%  The laws and regulations
