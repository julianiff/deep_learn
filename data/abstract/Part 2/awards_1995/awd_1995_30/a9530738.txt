Abstract    :
              The research is a collaborative project among researchers at six universities. 
              The researchers will extend their previous study of the record of atmospheric
              chemistry concentrations recorded I the glacial ice at Summit, Greenland form a
              summer-only study to a full year by adding a winter sampling program.  The ice
              core record from the Greenland Ice Sheet Project (GISP2) has been analyzed for
              traces of atmospheric chemistry but the results cannot be fully assessed until
              a complete annual record of present chemistry is available because the largest
              signal in the ice core results form snow that accumulates during the winter
              months.  A winter sampling program has been logistically impossible until this
              year.  A complete annual cycle of the record of how modern atmospheric record
              from GISP2 ice cores for the past 110,000 years.
