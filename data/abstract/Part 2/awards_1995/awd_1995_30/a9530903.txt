Abstract    :
              9530903  SMITH     This project will provide shipboard scientific support
              equipment   for the research vessel ALPHA HELIX, an NSF-owned ship operated  
              by the University of Alaska, Institute of Marine Science, and     dedicated to
              use in support of ocean science research.            The Shipboard Scientific
              Support Equipment Program provides funds  for ship equipment deemed essential
              to the proper and safe      conduct of ocean science research. This Program
              provides support   for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for
              the   deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational  
              equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite      receivers to pin
              point the location of research sites,      communication equipment including
              radio transceivers and      satellite transceivers for voice and scientific
              data      communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats    for
              transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.            The
              Project Director, Thomas D. Smith is fully qualified to     direct this project
              having had considerable experience in     overseeing the acquisition and
              installation of shipboard     equipment.          This project will allow the
              institution to replace the ship's  obsolete SSB radio with one that meets GMDSS
              requirements, replace  fire fighting nozzles with modern ones and install
              uninterruptable  power supplies to protect science equipment.  ***
