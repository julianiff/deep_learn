Abstract    :
              This project develops a new class of data acquisition systems with user 
              configurable hardware.  The primary development effort is the creation of 
              software tools which will enable scientists and engineers who are not skilled 
              hardware designers to utilize such systems.  Some of the primary research
              issues  are the development of techniques for specifying and analyzing timing
              behavior  between fixed and configurable hardware and the development of
              techniques for  designing robust interfaces.    A typical application of this
              work is a reconfigurable data acquisition card  consisting of a fixed analog
              section and a configurable digital section built  from one or more field
              programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and static RAM chips.   Existing data
              acquisition cards are generally used by scientists and engineers  who are not
              skilled hardware designers; however, the currently available tools  for FPGAs
              require significant digital design experience.  For a reconfigurable  data
              acquisition card to be useful, it is necessary that the configuration tools 
              accept as input high level programming language which is accessible to a 
              competent programmer.  Any custom hardware necessary to interface the analog 
              sections or host CPU must be provided in the form of libraries which can be 
              conveniently linked to the user's code.
