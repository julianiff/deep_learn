Abstract    :
              AST-9530632    Galactic Structure and Kinematics from Absolute Proper Motions.  
               Dr. Jones and colleagues at the University of California at Santa  Cruz will
              apply the absolute proper motions derived from the  Northern Proper Motion
              Survey (NPM) to outstanding problems in  galactic structure and kinematics. 
              These include a definitive  study of solar motion and galactic rotation, a
              powerful probe of  changing stellar populations and kinematics away from the 
              galactic plane, a massive study of RR Lyrae luminosities and  kinematics, and
              astrometric studies of the corrections to  precession and comparisons of NPM
              with other catalogs.  These  researchers will also begin observations on an
              extension to the  NPM Survey toward low galactic latitudes.
