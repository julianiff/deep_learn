Abstract    :
              9530845  Hansell         As their contribution to the U.S.JGOFS Southern Ocean
              Process  Study, the investigators will study the seasonal and spatial 
              distribution of dissolved organic matter in the water column of the  Ross Sea
              and the Antarctic Polar Frontal zone.  By measuring both  the concentration and
              the rates of production and consumption of  dissolved organic matter, the
              investigators hope to assess the  quantitative importance of this pool of
              organic matter in the  overall carbon cycle in the austral circumpolar seas.
