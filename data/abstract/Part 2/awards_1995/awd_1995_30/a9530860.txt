Abstract    :
                      The emergence of order from disorder is observed in a wide range of
              complex dynamical systems.  Several geological features, including patterned
              ground, constitute some of the clearest and  most accessible examples of
              abiotic self-organization in nature.  It is proposed to investigate the
              spontaneous emergence and dynamics of patterned ground through a coordinated
              program of field measurement and computer simulation of discrete particle
              motion in soil subjected to freeze/thaw activity.  The close bending of these
              two approaches promises to be synergistic, with the simulations guiding the
              investigations in formulating novel and more precise questions in the filed and
              vice-versa.    A new and more fundamental view of patterned ground as a prime
              example of self-organization will be obtained through the integration of the
              following specific objectives:  (1) to develop a three-dimensional computer
              simulation of discrete particle motion in soil subjected to recurrent freezing
              and thawing, and use it to investigate the development of patterns in frozen
              ground;  (2) to measure stone and soil displacements, document the formation of
              patterns and their reaction to disturbances, and monitor with automated
              instrumentation soil temperature, moisture and climate parameters in
              established study sites with well developed sorted circles and stripes; (3) to
              construct a micro-mechanical model of sorting in patterned ground through
              computer simulation and laboratory experimentation; and (4) to develop a
              realistic heat and mass transfer model to investigate factors critical in the
              formation of sorted circles: active layer depth and three-dimensional geometry
              of propagating freezing and thawing fronts. An important practical benefit of
              developing a realistic near-surface heat transfer model for frozen ground is
              that it promises to contribute to a more precise understanding of both the
              anticipated impacts of climate change  permafrost areas, and the record of
              recent climate change that is contained in permafro st temperatures.    The
              goal of the proposed research is to understand the processes through which
              patterns such as these circles of stones in the Arctic arise from a disordered
              initial state: in this case, a wave cut platform covered with 1-2 m of assorted
              beach sediments.
