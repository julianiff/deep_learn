Abstract    :
              9530506  Goodman  This meeting will bring together researchers in computational
              and  discrete geometry.  The purpose of the meeting is to foster  interaction,
              centered on geometric questions, between computer  scientists and
              mathematicians.  Such interaction started mainly  by a similar conference held
              in Santa Cruz in 1986.  During the  ten years since that meeting, researchers
              in each area have made  substantial contribution to the other. Combinatorial
              and discrete  geometers have gotten more and more interested in algorithmic and
               complexity-related questions, while the computational geometers  have used
              their techniques successfully to make inroads into  problems that had
              previously seemed intractable to  mathematicians.  Both fields have grown as a
              result of this  interaction.  The present meeting will survey much of the 
              progress made during the past decade, and delineate the areas in  which
              progress is likely to take place during the coming years.  ***
