Abstract    :
              9530797  Shearer    This grant provides $67,350 as partial support of  the costs
              of upgrading computational facilities  used for research in geophysics at the
              Institute  for Geophysics & Planetary Physics, University of  California, San
              Diego.  Specifically, the  equipment will include 12 HP 712 workstations and 
              six 9 Gb hard disks to be purchased over a period  of three years.  The
              computers and additional mass  storage devices will be used by a group of 19 
              faculty, students and post-doctoral researchers  for a variety of studies
              including, inversions of  3-D global seismic data sets for testing  hypotheses
              about mantle dynamics, stacking long-  period waveforms to image upper mantle
              seismic  discontinuities, numerical modeling of mantle flow  dynamics and
              modeling the geomagnetic field using  large paleomagnetic data sets.  ***
