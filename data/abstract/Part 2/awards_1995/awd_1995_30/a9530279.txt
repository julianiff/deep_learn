Abstract    :
              9530279  Freeman    The PIs will reconstruct curves of the magnitude of isotopic
               fractionation by marine plankton during Neogene using delta 13-C of 
              prymnesiophyte-derived long-chain ketones (alkenones) and  planktonic carbonate
              phases. If climate colling is driven by a  decline in atmospheric CO2, then on
              a global scale isotopic  fractionation should also decrease. The isotopic proxy
              method of  reconstructing pCO2 will prove useful to evaluate climate change 
              over large temporal and geographic scales during the early Neogene.
