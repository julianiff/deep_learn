Abstract    :
              9530317  Shen         This project will use teleseismic earthquake data to map
              the  configuration of the upper mantle discontinuities beneath mid-ocean 
              ridges and will place constraints on the pattern of mantle  convection beneath
              mid-ocean ridges addressing the question of  whether mantle convection is
              layered or involves the whole mantle.  Data from the ICEMELT experiment will
              provide results for the slow-  spreading Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and data from a
              seismic array in  South America will provide results for the fast-spreading
              East  Pacific Rise.
