Abstract    :
              Eileen Ryan  Planetary Science Institute  FY 96: $53,917  For 24 months.    A
              Numerical Analysis of Collisions in the Solar System.    A major process
              affecting the growth and evolution of planetary  bodies is hypervelocity
              impact.  Although some of the  basic  principles of impact phenomena are
              moderately well understood,  how material fragments near the impact site and
              how initial  conditions affect that fragmentation have been difficult to 
              quantify.  Also, the dependence of fragmentation outcome on  target size is not
              well defined.  Dr. Ryan and colleagues have  developed and tested a
              two-dimensional Lagrangian hydrocode for  modeling collisional fragmentation. 
              Since gravitational effects  are incorporated into the code, it is highly
              useful in the  simulation of large-scale impact events beyond the reach of 
              laboratory studies.  The ability to characterize the outcome of  an impact
              event of any size given a particular set of initial  conditions is applicable
              to many problems: asteroid impacts on  planetary surfaces, collisional
              evolution of the asteroid belt,  asteroid family formation, planetesimal
              accretion, ring particle  dynamics, and meteorite delivery mechanisms, for
              example.    The goal of Dr. Ryan's present study is to improve the modeling  of
              impact events by modifying  the 2-dimensional code to include  the effect of
              target porosity/internal fractures.  The code will  then be extended to 3
              dimensions during the second funding year.  The results of this modeling will
              be applied to better undertand  collisions in the Solar System, primarily the
              problem of the  formation of asteroid families.
