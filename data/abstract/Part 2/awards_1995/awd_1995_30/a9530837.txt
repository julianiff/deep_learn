Abstract    :
              9530837  Gardner         The principal investigator will employ optical
              instruments  from shipboard to determine the types and size distribution of 
              particles and particle aggregates in the oceanic water column  during the U.S.
              JGOFS Southern Process Study. By making these  measurement, the investigator
              and his colleagues expect to be able  to calculate rates of particle
              aggregation and disaggregation and  to clarify the role played by aggregation
              in determining the  vertical flux of particulate materials, especially carbon,
              during  and between periods of algal blooms.
