Abstract    :
              Pfeiffer  OCE-9530389      This award provides funding to purchase shipboard
              instrumentation  in support of NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be
              used  aboard the R/V CAPE HENLOPEN, a 120 foot vessel, which is owned and 
              operated by the University of Delaware. The R/V CAPE HENLOPEN  operates mainly
              in the Chesapeake Bay and along the eastern coast  of the U.S.  Instrumentation
              requested includes a towed CTD system  and replacements for a salinometer, an
              incubator, and a 12 kHz  pinger. The instrumentation requested is required for
              support of  NSF-funded cruises aboard the CAPE HENLOPEN during 1996 and will 
              enhance the scientific capability of the vessel in the future. The  University
              of Delaware will provide $25,260 in matching funds   for the towed CTD system.
