              filename="AB30140.DOC"    9530140  Berlato  This proposal requests support for
              a series of workshops in order to   organize a program of cooperation between
              universities in Argentina,   Brazil, and Uruguay for the study of the climate
              of Southeastern South   America and the impact of interannual variability,
              specifically the ENSO   phenomenon, on the water resources and agriculture of
              the region.  The   workshops will address the current understanding of the
              links between sea   surface temperature anomalies in the Pacific and climate
              forecasts for the   region; past experiences with applications of ENSO-related
              rain forecasts   through programs like the IRICP Pilot Program; identification
              of the key   sectors in agriculture and water resources that could benefit from
              the   forecasts; discussion of data availability and accessibility in the
              region;   training and education aspects; and the dissemination of results. 
              This proposal includes participants from Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay.  
              Scientific advice will be provided from experts at UCLA and Texas A&M  
              University from the United States.  These countries are members of the IAI,  
              an initiative to stimulate global change research among the scientific  
              institutions of the Americas.  The National Science Foundation is the  
              designated U.S. Government agency to carry out the U.S. responsibilities  
              within the IAI.  %%%  This proposal requests support for a series of workshops
