Abstract    :
              9530532  Padovani    This grant is for partial support of publication costs for
              the  Subcommittee on Natural Disaster Reduction (SNDR) strategic and 
              implementation plan document entitled, "Natural Disaster Reduction:  A Plan for
              the Nation".  The SNDR is a multi-agency working group  that is part of the
              Committee on Environment and Natural Resources  (CENR) of the National Science
              and Technology Council, which was  established by the President on November 23,
              1993.  The SNDR  coordinates U.S. federal agency participation in the
              International  Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR).  The SNDR is made
              up  of 19 member agencies and departments, cooperating to increase the  overall
              effectiveness and productivity of U.S. Federal agency  programs for reducing
              deaths, injuries, and economic and social  disruptions resulting from natural
              disasters, such as the  devastating Northridge earthquake which struck the Los
              Angeles  region on January 17, 1994.  Lessons learned in the Northridge 
              earthquake are an important part of this document.  This grant is  a component
              of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
