Abstract    :
              9530322  Roy    The proposed project is to study the possibility of growing 
              single-crystal diamond in a Czochralski-type process from a  metallic liquid at
              low pressures.  Professor Roy has  recently demonstrated precipitation of
              diamond from these  metallic  melts.  These metallic melts are alloys of the 
              metal, carbon, and hydrogen.  In the proposed process, the  melts would be
              formed in the 2.45 GHz microwave plasma  furnace or in the hot-filament diamond
              growth unit.  Small  seed crystals of diamond would be touched to the surface
              of  the metallic  melt and then, if diamond grows on the seed  crystal, would
              be slowly pulled from the melt.  In another  method, the alloy would be melted
              on top of a single crystal  diamond seed.  Addition diamond would grow onto the
              seed.  Following growth the diamond would be characterized using  standard
              techniques.  %%%  Diamond is an increasingly important industrial material. If 
              successful, the method of growing diamond at low pressures  would dramatically
              reduce the fabrication cost of diamond.  ***
