Abstract    :
              9530394    Lwiza    In this project, the PIs will study the dynamics of
              transverse flow  in a coastal plain estuary, specifically the James River
              estuary in  Virginia.   Two  parallel  transects with high  spatial  resolution
               measurements  will be occupied, using an Acoustic  Doppler  Current  Profiler,
              and CTD casts during two tidal cycles on spring and  neap  tides.  In addition,
              high temporal resolution measurements will  be  made  with  three current meter
              moorings at each  one  of  the  two  transects and two bottom pressure
              recorders at either side  of  the  estuary  between  the  two  transects. 
              Three  different  dynamical  regimes in the year will be addressed, namely,
              high river discharge  (May),  low  river  discharge (August), and  the  weakest
               vertical  stratification (October).   A number of objectives relating to  the 
              transverse  circulation  will  be  addressed,  culminating  in   an  evaluation
               of  the  dominant  terms  in  the  transverse  momentum  balance, both from
              the observations and from a numerical model.
