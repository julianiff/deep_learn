                  P.I.:  CONOVER,  DAVID                         Proposal  #:   95-  30209    
                                     PROPOSAL ABSTRACT                                       
                  Genetic  variation and local adaptation may be  responsible  for  many of
              the differences in somatic growth noted among fishes  and   other  organisms.  
              Using  a  marine  fish  (the   Atlantic  silverside  Menidia  menidia) as a 
              model  system,  this  project  proposes  to test selective factors that affect
              the evolution  of  growth  rate.  Specifically, experiments using laboratory 
              stocks  of   silversides   will  compare:   1)  the  size-dependency   of 
              reproductive   output,   growth,  and   survival   at   different 
              temperatures,  2)  swimming  performance  and  vulnerability   to  predation
              before and immediately after consuming maximum rations;  and   3)   the 
              variance  in  maximal  and  compensatory  growth.  Additionally,  bioenergetic
              models will be used to  simulate  the  effect   on   body   size  of 
              transplanting   genotypes   across  environments
