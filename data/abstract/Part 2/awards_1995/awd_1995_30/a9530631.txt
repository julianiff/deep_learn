Abstract    :
              9530631  JONES     This project will provide support for shipboard scientific   
               support equipment for the research vessel WECOMA, an NSF-owned    ship
              operated by Oregon State University, and dedicated to use in  support of ocean
              science research.          The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program
              provides funds  for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe    
              conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support   for such
              items as deck equipment including winch systems for the   deployment and
              retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational   equipment such as radars,
              gyroscopes and earth satellite     receivers to pin point the location of
              research sites,     communication equipment including radio transceivers and   
               satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data     communications and
              other equipment such as motorized workboats    for transporting scientists to
              and from data retrieval sites.          The Project Director, Frederick Jones
              is fully qualified to     direct this project having had considerable
              experience in     overseeing the acquisition and installation of shipboard    
              equipment.          The project will allow the institution to acquire two air
              tugger  winches for use on the after deck and a P-Code GPS for highly  accurate
              navigation.  ***
