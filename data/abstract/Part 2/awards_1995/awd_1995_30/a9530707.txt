Abstract    :
              Julio C. de Paula of Haverford College is supported by the Experimental  
              Physical Chemistry Program to investigate the nature of excited states of  
              metalloporphyrins using time-resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy.  The  
              focus of his studies will be (a) to investigate equilibrium dynamics   between
              conformers of tetraphenylporphyrins in triplet excited states,   (b) to
              distinguish between charge-transfer and metal-centered excited   states by
              varying the substituents on ruthenium and nickel ion complexes,   and (c) to
              assign the time-resolved resonance Raman spectra of the cupric  
              tetraphenylporphyrins.    Metalloporphyrins have a rich photochemistry that may
              be applied to   artificial photosynthesis, molecular electronics, and
              photodynamic cancer   therapy.  For example, free-base zinc and cupric
              porphyrins are known to   sensitize tumor necrosis in vitro.  Further, polymers
              of ruthenium   porphyrins are photoconductive and can act as molecular wires.  
               Non-planar metalloporphyrins are emerging as important compounds for a  
              number of these applications, because distortions of the porphyrin ring  
              modulate electrochemical and photochemical properties.  These studies of   the
              excited electronic states of metalloporphyrins will lead to a better  
              understanding of their photochemical activity.
