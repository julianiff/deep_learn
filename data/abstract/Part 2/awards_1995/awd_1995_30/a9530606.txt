Abstract    :
              This starter grant award to Occidental College will support the research   of
              Professor Eileen M. Spain.  The theme of the research is the study of  
              transition metal chalcogenide thin films deposited by pulsed laser  
              vaporization, which can produce high kinetic energy species.  To   understand
              the issues of film growth and nucleation with high kinetic   energy species,
              two modern experimental techniques are employed.  Film   topography is measured
              by atomic force microscopy and the experimental   parameters that produce
              crystalline films are determined.  With   single-photon ionization
              time-of-flight mass spectrometry, the identity,   kinetic energy distribution,
              and relative concentration of the plasma   species that affect the deposited
              film properties are measured.  This research will advance the fundamental
              understanding of materials   issues underlying the growth of thin films.  Such
              films are the basis for   fabrication of submicron electronic devices composed
              of various metal and   metal-containing layers, a technology of intense
              interest in the   microelectronics industry.
