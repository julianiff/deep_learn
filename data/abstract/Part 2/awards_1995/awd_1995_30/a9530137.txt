Abstract    :
              9530137  Langmuir    This project will develop a database that will contain
              information  on igneous and metamorphic oceanic rocks from mid-ocean ridges, 
              seamounts, back-arc basins, and selected hotspots and will be  served to the
              public over the World Wide Web. to the degree  possible the database will be
              populated with self-describing  metadata including inter laboratory
              calibrations, standards, error  limits, and quality control.
