Abstract    :
              9530087  Duncan  Robert Duncan of Oregon State University is supported to
              participate in a planned research submersible (R/V Nautile) expedition with
              French researchers to sample and analyze samples of the deep crust exposed in
              the Beata Escarpment in the Caribbean Sea.  Duncan's work will emphasize the
              precise dating of samples from the ridge using the Argon-40/Argon-39 technique
              in which his lab specializes; he will also analyze samples for rare earth
              elements.  The objective of Duncan's research is to test a model based
              primarily on samples rocks collected on land surrounding the Caribbean that
              much of the seafloor underlying the Caribbean was formed very rapidly about 88
              million years ago by a large volcanic outpouring related to the Galapagos
              mantle plume.  In addition to the specific studies proposed here of samples to
              be collected by submersible, the project will assist in identifying precise
              sites for proposed deep ocean drilling by the Ocean Drilling Program, an
              international collaborative research effort led by NSF using the research
              drilling vessel JOIDES Resolution.  ***
