Abstract    :
              OCE 9530249    Brown    This   project  will  investigate  atmospherically 
              forced,  winter  convection  in  the  Gulf  of  Maine  and  consider  the  
              relative  importance  of  wind and convection in mixed layer deepening.  Both 
              the general process of winter convection and the specific issue  of  Maine 
              Intermediate  Water formation will be addressed.  Two  field  experiments,
              including moored arrays and hydrographic surveys, will  be  conducted  during
              consecutive winter seasons.  The  experiments  will   determine   the  scales 
              of  convective   overturning,   the  relationship between mixed layer variation
              and surface fluxes,  and  the  relationship  between convection history  and 
              the  volume  of  winter  water produced in a season. Observations will also be 
              used  to assess the fidelity of a numerical model of convective plumes.
