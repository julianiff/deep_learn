Abstract    :
              9530329  Osterberg  We propose an experimental investigation to connect optical
              and electrical  properties of glasses with defects on an atomic and molecular
              scale. We  will measure the electrical transport properties of both pure and
              doped  fused silica.  We will correlate the optical properties of defects in 
              germanium doped silica with well-known electron spin resonance data, using 
              optical detection magnetic resonance and light-induced electron spin 
              resonance.    The purpose of this work is to establish a complete picture of
              photoinduced  optical properties of amorphous silica glass. This work will
              provide  underpinnings for the fabrication of periodic refractive index changes
              and  space charge fields in glasses that affect the technological areas 
              ferroelectric glasses, electronic insulation, optical waveguides and active 
              electro-optic fibers. Direct applications can be made to photoinduced 
              absorption in the 1.3-1.6 micrometer region in telecommunication fibers, 
              fiber-optic Bragg gratings, self-organizing optical nonlinearities in  glasses
              and in-fiber all-optical signal processing.    This work is a collaborative
              effort between Thayer School of Engineering,  Dartmouth College, the Fiber and
              Electro optics Research Center, Virginia  Polytechnic Institute and State
              University and the Naval Research  Laboratory, Washington, D.C..  ***
