Abstract    :
              OCE-9530307    Geochemical and field evidence suggest that melt transport in the
               mantle is localized into some form of meso-scale channels; however,  the
              mechanism for the formation of such channels from a grain-scale  distribution
              of melt is poorly understood.  Two possible mechanisms  will be investigated: 
              (1) reactive inflitration instability, which  is an interaciton between the
              fluid-mechanics of melt motion and  chemical dissolution, and (2) purely
              mechanical flow segregations  due to local pressure graneints.  A series of
              numerical model  problems will be used to quantify the behavior and effects of
              both  of these processes.
