Abstract    :
              9530526  Mason      This project is proposed as part of Intergovernmental 
              Oceanographic Commission (IOC) Baseline Trace Metal Study of  the  oceans.  The
              primary objective is to obtain needed data for  the  distribution, speciation
              and biogeochemcial cycling of Hg in  the  waters and atmosphere of the
              equatorial and South Atlantic  Ocean.  The field program will be conducted on
              the IOC cruise of the  R.V.  Knorr to these regions in the western Atlantic
              during  may/June  1996.  The research involves shipboard collections for total 
              Hg,  particulate and Hg species (i.e., reactive, elemental and  methylated Hg)
              in air and water, on-board Hg analyses, and  incubation experiments designed to
              study the biotic and  abiotic  sources of elemental and methylated Hg in the
              open ocean  waters.  Post cruise activities will include analyses of stored 
              samples  and additional incubation experiments.  This research is  designed  to
              complement and extend recent investigations of Hg in the  North  Atlantic Ocean
              (August, 1993) that were part of the IOC  Baseline  Trace Metal Study, and
              earlier Hg studies in the Pacific  Ocean.  ***
