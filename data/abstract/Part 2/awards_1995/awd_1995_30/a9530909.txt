Abstract    :
              The spatial model of voting proposed by Downs and extended by many scholars is a
              benchmark for theories purporting to explain political behavior.  Yet evidence
              against the assumptions and predictions of this theory is accumulating. 
              Further, spatial theory has not adapted to account for new findings in the
              fields of cognitive science, neural networks and artificial intelligence.  This
              research tests a dynamic model of memory and attention, developed by the PI, 
              as it informs alternative models of voting behavior.  By focusing attention on
              the role of new issues in voter decision making, the theory will be tested in
              an area that traditional spatial theory has little to say:  volatile
              environments where voters are subjected to new information.  Three hundred
              citizens will participate in a series of controlled experiments that present
              alternative exposure conditions and atlternative contents.***
