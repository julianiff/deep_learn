Abstract    :
              95-30752  Hunten    Dr. Hunten and two Co-Principal Investigators, Drs. Stephen 
              W. Bougher and  Ann L. Sprague, will carry out comparative studies of 
              planetary atmospheres.  This project is a continuation of earlier NSF-supported
               investigations.  It  also runs in parallel and complements, but does not 
              duplicate, NASA-funded  work in planetary aeronomy.    The focus of this
              investigation will be the tenuous  atmospheres of the Moon  and Mercury, the
              atmospheres of Jupiter, Venus, Mars, and  Pluto, and  micro-meteoroid entries
              at Earth.    Four topics will be addressed in particular:  (1) The  circulation
              and energy  balance of planetary thermospheres, using a three-  dimensional
              computer code  developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.  (2)
              The  interaction of atoms of the Moon's and Mercury's tenuous  atmospheres with
               those bodies' surfaces.  (3) Completion of the analysis and  interpretation 
              of infrared spectra obtained with the Kuiper Airborne  Observatory during the 
              impact of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 on Jupiter in 1994.  (4)  Completion of a 
              study of the preservation of micrometeoroids entering the  Earth's atmosphere.
