Abstract    :
              This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry
              Program, examines the detailed mechanisms of hydrocarbon  conversion reactions
              on well characterized transition metal  surfaces.  Ultra-high vacuum
              spectroscopic methods are used to  probe the reaction chemistry of alkyl and
              metallacycle  intermediates deposited on nickel and platinum surfaces using 
              halide precursor molecules.  The reaction chemistry of alkenes and  oxygenates
              on these surfaces is also explored.  The results of  these studies provide
              basic information which is useful for the  understanding of heterogeneous
              catalytic processes relevant to the  production of fuels and commodity
              chemicals.  The understanding of the reaction mechanisms of hydrocarbon 
              conversion reactions on transition metal surfaces is important to  the
              development of catalytic materials and processes.  This  research project uses
              spectroscopic methods to examine the  mechanisms of these reactions in detail. 
              Mechanistic studies of  hydrocarbon and oxygen containing molecule reactions 
              are the focus  of this work.
