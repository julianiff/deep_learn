Abstract    :
              9530829  Whitledge    This award provides funds to the University of Texas at
              Austin for  acquisition of oceanographic instruments to be used aboard the R/V 
              LONGHORN in support of NSF-funded research projects.  The LONGHORN  is a 105
              foot vessel that is owned and operated by the University.  The ship operates
              mainly in U.S. coastal waters int he Gulf of  Mexico.  The instrumentation
              funded includes a Precision Depth  Recorder (PDR), and an altimeter for use
              with the CTD.  The  instrumentation is required for the successful completion
              of NSF-  funded projects aboard the vessel during 1996 and will enhance the 
              capability of the vessel in the future.
