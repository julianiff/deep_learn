Abstract    :
                  The PI proposes to study the record of the cosmogenic and atmospheric 14C in
              air samples that have been trapped in the ice core recovered from the summit of
              the Greenland ice sheet by the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2). The
              abundance of 14C in the GISP2 ice core will be used to determine the
              atmospheric chemistry at the site for the past 30,000 years and to determine
              the chronology of climatic changes.  Changes in the 14C tracer are an important
              piece of the evidence of a changing atmosphere during the transition from full
              glacial conditions to the present interglacial period.
