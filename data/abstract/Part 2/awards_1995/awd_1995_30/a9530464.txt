Abstract    :
              9530464    The objectives of this research program are to investigate  and
              clarify  fundamental questions in relation to the geostatic stress  condition
              in  undisturbed ground, as well as in clays and granular soils  subjected to 
              sampling, in situ testing, earthquake shaking, or  construction operations, 
              including ground modification. Effective horizontal pressure  has a 
              significant effect on resistance to settlement and  liquefaction of granular 
              soils. as well as on ground response to in situ tests before  and after  ground
              modification.  The specific questions formulated for  investigation  include
              the permanent effect of pre-shearing on the  horizontal pressure in  the
              laterally constrained level ground condition, and  settlement of clean 
              granular soils subjected to cyclic pre-shearing. The  research method relies 
              on exacting experimental techniques and long-term laboratory  and field 
              observations, as well as mathematical modeling and numerical  analysis.  High
              quality undisturbed samples of natural clays, as well  as reconstituted 
              specimens of natural sand deposits, are used in the  laboratory 
              investigations.  ***
