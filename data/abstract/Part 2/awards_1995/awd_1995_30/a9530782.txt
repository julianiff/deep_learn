Abstract    :
                    A global synthesis of glacier mass balance data is proposed, which will
              include an evaluation and digitization of measured mass balance data .  The
              mass balance data set will include three databases:  I. annual specific mass
              balances of all measured mountain and subpolar glaciers;  II. annual
              accumulation (or winter balance) and annual ablation (or summer balance);  III.
              winter, summer and annual mass balance gradients will altitude.  These data
              will be analyzed in several ways: statistical spatio-temporal analyses of
              individual glaciers, mountain ranges and countries, both hemispheric and
              global; analyses of annual fluctuations and determination of long-term
              mass-balance trends; and analyses of mass balance gradient changes.    The main
              tasks include:  (1) Assemble and check the annual specific mass balance data of
              all measured glaciers since 1945.  (2) Determine the contribution of glacier
              changes to sea level, e.g., how much do different glacier regions contribute to
              sea-level change?  (3) Estimate the variability of winter and summer balances
              (or annual accumulation and ablation) and their impact on annual mass balances
              in different geographical locations.  (4) Determine the main causes for mass
              balance changes  in different mountain regions.  (5) Analyze mass balance
              gradients (activity indices) and their changes in connection with climate
              change.    The end products of this research will include three mass balance
              data sets which will be produced at INSTAAR in a form accessible by the
              community, and the data report, "Mass balance of mountain and subpolar
              glaciers: data and syntheses" which will be published by World Data Center A
              Glaciology, University of Colorado, Boulder.
