Abstract    :
              9530327  Willis       This award provides funding to purchase shipboard 
              instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research.  The  instruments will be
              used aboard the R/V WECOMA, a 177 foot  vessel, which is owned by NSF and
              operated by the  University.  Instrumentation funded includes a portable 
              salinometer, 5-liter Niskin samplers, an ARGOS PTT receiver,  a dewpoint
              hygrometer, an optical rain gauge, and a core  splitter.  The instrumentation
              is requested for support of  NSF-funded cruises aboard the WECOMA during 1996
              and will  enhance the scientific capability of the vessel in the  future.  ***
