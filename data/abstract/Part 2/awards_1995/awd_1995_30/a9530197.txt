Abstract    :
              9530197  Atkinson  A series of laboratory experiments will be conducted to
              examine the   dynamics of buoyant coastal discharges over slopping bootoms
              within a   rotating frame. A particular focus is on developing a description of
              the   turning and spreading characteristics of the plume as it moves off-shore
              and   its possible interaction with the bottom. The driving hypothesis for this
              work   is that the discharge flow width is controlled by the Rossby radius, at
              least   initially, and that this may cause the flow to remain attached to the
              bottom   over greater distances that would be expected in the absence of
              rotation.
