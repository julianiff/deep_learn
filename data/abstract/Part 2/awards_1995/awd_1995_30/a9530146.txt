Abstract    :
              9530146  Toomey    This project will analyze a seismic data set from natural 
              earthquakes recorded on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 35'N. Three-  component
              seismometers collected a set of P and S waves which will  be jointly inverted
              and used to produce three dimensional images of  Vp and Vs structure.
              Anisotropy will be examined from splitting of  shear waves. New algorithms will
              be developed, including ray-  tracing routines, inversion of delay-time data,
              and analysis of  anisotropy.
