Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9530048    Funds are supplied to support a postcongress symposium
              on calorimetry to be held July 7-10, 1996, in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico.  The
              symposium will follow (and be linked to) the Eleventh International Congress on
              Catalysis.  Funds are used mainly to support travel between the Congress site
              in Baltimore and the symposium site in Mayaguez.
