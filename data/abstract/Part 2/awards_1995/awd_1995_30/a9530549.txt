Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at University of Minnesota at Duluth
              acquire a 300 MHz NMR  Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a
              number of areas including the  following: (1) Creation of New Carbon-Carbon
              Bonds, (2) Halocyclopropyl Ether Fragmentation  Applied to the Development of a
              Substituted Acrolein Anion Synthon, (3) Chemistry of  Polyvalent Iodine, and
              (4) The Regiochemistry of the Hydroboration of 1-Aryl-1-Propenes.    Nuclear
              Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to 
              chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
              identify unknown  substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms
              within molecules, and to study the  dynamics of interactions between molecules
              in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR  spectrometry is essential to
              chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from  these NMR
              studies are useful in the areas such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
