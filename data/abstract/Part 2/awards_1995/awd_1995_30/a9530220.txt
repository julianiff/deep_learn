Abstract    :
              9530220    Carton    This project is a contribution to the modeling component to
              be   carried out as part of the Atlantic Circulation and Climate   Experiment
              (ACCE) under the World Ocean Circulation Experiment   (WOCE).  The focus will
              be on upgrading existing isopycnal models,   data assimilation, and integrating
              different types of regional   models.  Comparisons will be made among different
              modeling approaches   in order to assess the strengths and weaknesses of each,
              and to   determine the best overall approach for including ocean variability  
              in climate modeling.  Particular attention will be paid to   assimilating, into
              the models, data from the field phase of ACCE, as   well as from historical
              data bases.  In this particular project, the   PIs will  use data assimilation
              techniques to determine the domination balances in the upper ocean heat budget
              on searonal to decadal time scales.  They will assimilate historical
              hydrographic and drifter data into the GFDL Modular Ocean Model (MOM) to give
              historical perspective on the timescales related to the ACCE ecpseirment. 
              GEOSAT and TOPEX altimeter data, as well as velocity measurements would be
              added to previous historical analyses caried  out by the Pis.  A completer
              analysis of the two years of ACCE data will also be carried out, along with
              careful estimates of uncertainties, especially those associated with air-sea
              fluxes.
