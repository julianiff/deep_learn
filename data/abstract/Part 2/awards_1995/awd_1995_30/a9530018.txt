Abstract    :
                This workshop, organized by the Dr. Robert Naiman, of the Center for
              Streamside Studies, University of Washington, in collaboration with Dr. Kevin
              Rogers, of the Center for Water in the Environment, University of the
              Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa, brings together scientists from the
              U.S., France, UK, South Africa, and other countries in Southern Africa, from a
              range of disciplines, to examine the environmental factors creating and
              maintaining the characteristics of riparian corridors in Southern Africa.  The
              expected outcomes are a comparison of the state of knowledge about riparian
              corridors in temperate and subtropical regions, and a statement of priority
              research directions, especially for Southern Africa.  The workshop will include
              active researchers and graduate students from the biological, geological, and
              social sciences, as well as policy makers and resource managers.  Five South
              African universities are represented, including two historically-disadvantaged
              institutions.   The African participants come from five different countries:
              South Africa, Malawi, Mozambique, Botswana, and Namibia  The structure and
              function of riparian corridors and the human impact on these systems is an
              important issue for Southern Africa, where over 60 percent of the population
              lives within one kilometer of surface water. This workshop on this important
              theme can help to strengthen collaborative linkages internationally  (between
              US and Southern African scientists), regionally (between So. African scientists
              and their counterparts in neighboring countries), between historically white
              and historically black institutions in South Africa, across disciplinary
              boundaries, and, it is to be hoped, between researchers and policy makers.
