Abstract    :
              9530730  French    The Joint Optoelectronic Project (JOP) is a joint program
              entered into by the U.S. and  Japanese Governments to provide prototyping
              services for experimental  optoelectronic devices and modules.  The goals of
              the project are to establish a joint  research project in optoelectronics to
              improve the availability of novel prototype  optoelectronic materials, devices,
              circuits and modules by providing users with  access to leading edge
              optoelectronic fabrication facilities, to stimulate research  activities in
              optoelectronics for computing in both the U.S. and Japan and to  encourage
              effective commercialization.  The funds provided in this award will be used to
              help support U.S. user  participation in the JOP.  It is anticipated that the
              novel, custom-designed  optoelectronic devices and modules obtained using the
              broker facility will advance  device and systems research activities within the
              academic community.
