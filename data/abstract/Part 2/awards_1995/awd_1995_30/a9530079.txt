Abstract    :
              9530079  Fryer  Fluid venting from sediments is a critical component of the
              overall  mass geochemical balance along convergent continental margins where 
              oceanic crust and sediments are underthrust. To date, little  attention has
              been paid to this process at non-accretionary margins  where underthrusting
              removes essentially all of the oceanic  sediment. The present project will
              provide important new  information on fluid venting in such regions by
              synthesizing  available data on sediment chemistry and tectonics from the
              Mariana  arc region where fluid venting is known to occur. The results of  this
              study should provide a useful guide with which to examine the  distribution and
              magnitude of venting through analysis of sediment  chemistry and metamorphism,
              without the need for costly geological  and geophysical surveys.  ***
