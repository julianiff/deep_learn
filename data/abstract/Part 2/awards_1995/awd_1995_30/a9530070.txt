              9530070  Mabres  This proposal will allow the planning of an Inter-American
              training center   for radar remote sensing in Peru.  The inter-institutional
              and   multi-national character of this proposed training center will benefit
              from   the ongoing participation of scientists from institutions throughout the
                world.  This Phase I proposal will focus on the necessary activities to  
              design the "Training and Education Center in Radar Science and   Technologies"
              which will be the objective of a Phase II proposal.  The   design activities
              will encompass 2 meetings to determine the center's   characteristics and its
              educational program, the level and number of   students, and the types of
              degrees or certificates to be conferred.  In   addition, there will be
              discussion regarding professors and the needs of   other Latin American
              countries in the formation of their research teams   (current or planned). 
              Radars are very powerful tools for remote sensing of the atmosphere.  Radar  
              techniques may be essential for many of the observations required in the  
              study of the following Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research  
              (IAI) research themes:  High Latitude Processes; El Ni=F1o-Southern  
              Oscillation and Interannual Climate Variability, and Ocean-Land Atmospheric  
              Interaction in the Intertropical Americas.  Specifically, radar techniques  
              can assist in observations which address the ozone problem, ocean surface  
              currents, sea state, iceberg drifts at high lati tudes, the  effects of the  
              El Ni=F1o-Southern Oscillation phenomenon, and other air-sea interactions.  
              This workshop will prepare a Phase II proposal to establish a center for  
              training and education in radar remote sensing science and technology so   that
              scientists in the region can better use radar observations.  The   training
              will be at the post-graduate level and will involve professors and   students
              in research projects in the above mentioned topics.  %%%  This proposal will
              allow the planning of an Inter-American training center   for radar remote
              sensing in Peru, using the world-class research   infrastructure that already
              exists at Piura and Jicamarca.  The   inter-institutional and multi-national
              character of this proposed training   center will benefit from the ongoing
              participation of scientists from   institutions throughout the world.  This
              Phase I proposal will focus on the   necessary activities to design the
              "Training and Education Center in Radar   Science and Technologies" which will
              be the objective of a Phase II   proposal.  The design activities will
              encompass 2 meetings to determine the   center's characteristics and its
              educational program, the level and number   of students, and the types of
              degrees or certificates to be conferred.  In   addition, there will be
              discussion regarding professors and the needs of   other Latin American
              countries in the formation of their research teams   (current or planned). 
              This proposal for the planning of a center for training and education in  
              radar remote sensing science and technology addresses the Inter-American  
              Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) cross-cutting theme of training  
              and education.  In addition, this proposed center will provide training in  
              radar techniques which may be essential for may of the observations   required
              in the study of the following IAI priority research themes:  High   Latitude
              Processes; El Ni=F1o-Southern Oscillation and Interannual Climate  
              Variability, and Ocean-Land Atmospheric I nteraction in the Intertropical  
              Americas.  The Jicamarca Radar Observatory, the Peruvian  
              Mesosphere-Stratosphere-Troposphere radar in Antarctica, and the Piura  
              Wind-Profiler Radar (all incorporated in this proposed training center)   will
              be available for scientists from the Americas to use.  A fundamental   aim of
              the project is to use this center to transfer world-class radar   techniques to
              other research groups in order to increase the potential of   radars to achieve
              the goals of the IAI.  The following countries are participating in the
              organization of this   proposal:  Peru and the United States.  These countries
              are Member States   of the IAI, a U.S. initiative to stimulate cooperative
              research on global   change issues among the scientific institutions of the
              Americas.  The U.S.   National Science Foundation is the U.S. Government agency
              designated to   carry out U.S. responsibilities within the IAI.  ***
