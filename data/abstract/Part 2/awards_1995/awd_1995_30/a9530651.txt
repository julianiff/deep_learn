              CTS - 9530651  Christodoulos Floudas  Princeton University      ABSTRACT      
              The project deals with the analysis, design and synthesis of non-ideal
              separation systems.  Global optimization techniques based on the minimization
              of Gibbs free energy and the tangent plane stability criterion will be used. 
              The stability criterion will be applied to systems with many components and
              chemical reactions.  Objectives include determination of azeotropes for both
              homogeneous and heterogeneous systems,  and evaluation of the effects of
              different fugacity models and equations of state on phase equilibria. 
              Parameter uncertainty will be incorporated into the design.  Also, azeotropic
              distillation systems will be analyzed by combining residue curve maps with
              optimization methods.  The results may lead to improved separation techniques
              for manufacturing chemicals.
