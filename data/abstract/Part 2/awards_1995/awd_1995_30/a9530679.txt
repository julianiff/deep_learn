Abstract    :
              9530679  Bose  The periodic analysis of the security of a power system is done 
              to ensure the ability of the power system to withstand  contingencies.  Such
              on-line analysis requires, in principle, the  checking of the effects of
              hundreds of disturbances on the power  system.  The checking of the
              post-disturbance steady state of the  power system for these contingencies
              requires only the handling of  algebraic equations (albeit in large numbers and
              with  nonlinearities), and such static security analysis (SSA) is now 
              routinely done on-line.  However, checking for instabilities  during the
              disturbance itself requires the handling of nonlinear  differential equations
              in addition to the algebraic equations,  and the computation required for this
              dynamic security analysis  (DSA) is about three magnitudes higher than that for
              the SSA.   Thus, on-line DSA is still in its development stage although 
              experimental prototypes have been implemented.  This proposal is  for examing
              the important aspects of this problem and developing  new approaches for its
              solution.  ***
