Abstract    :
              9530118  Matano  Remote observations indicate that the most energetic regions of
              the world's oceans are the offshore extensions of the Kuroshio Current, the
              Gulf Stream, the Agulhas retroflection, and the Brazil/Malvinas Confluence.  Of
              all these regions, the Brazil/Malvinas Confluence is, by far, the least
              studied.  The Brazil/Malvinas Confluence is characterized by one of the
              strongest oceanic temperature gradients and large seasonal latitudinal  
              displacements (up to 5=B0) along the continental slopes of Brazil, Uruguay, and
              Argentina.  Since the Brazil/Malvinas Confluence influences the fisheries and
              agricultural development of one of the most economically important areas of
              Latin America, it is of regional interest to understand the physical and
              biochemical processes with which it is associated.  From a more general point
              of view, the Brazil/Malvinas Confluence is important for a strong water mass
              ventilation that affects the global thermohaline circulation and therefore is
              important in global climate change.  Previous studies on the circulation in
              this region have only emphasized isolated aspects of the oceanic and
              atmospheric circulations without any attempt to study them as a coupled system.
               Scientists from Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Uruguay, and the United States will
              meet to elaborate a research project to investigate coupled models of the
              Brazil/Malvinas Confluence, resulting in a Phase II Start-Up Grant proposal to
              the IAI.  This proposal brings together participants from member countries of
              the Inter-American Institute   for Global Change Research (IAI), a U.S.
              initiative to stimulate cooperative research on global change issues among the
              scientific institutions of the Americas.  The NSF is the lead U.S. Government
              agency designated to carry out U.S. responsibilities within the IAI.  %%%  This
              workshop will bring together scientists from Argentina, Brazil, Mexico,
              Uruguay, and the United States to elaborate a research project to investigate
              the Brazil/Malvinas Confluence, an ocean  current that runs along the
              continental slopes of Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina.  This current one of the
              most energetic in the world, and strongly influences the fisheries and
              agricultural development of one of the most economically   important areas of
              Latin America.  The Brazil/Malvinas Confluence has a strong influence on the
              turnover of the world's ocean water and therefore on global climate change. 
              The Brazil/Malvinas Confluence is also one of the least studied currents in the
              world, in an area of the Atlantic that remains poorly understood by the
              oceanographic community.  The four countries involved in the project bring
              together some of the most important research groups and computer modeling
              facilities in the Americas to tackle   this problem, and will propose a
              research project to the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research
              (IAI), a U.S. initiative to stimulate cooperative research on global change
              issues among the scientific institutions of the Americas.  The National Science
              Foundation is the lead U.S. Government agency designated to carry out U.S.
              responsibilities within the IAI.  ***
