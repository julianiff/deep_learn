Abstract    :
              AST 9530695    Two New Views of the Dense Interstellar Medium.    Dr. Jaffe will
              utilize a proven, novel instrument on the CalTech  Submillimeter Telescope and
              a big-beam Fabry-Perot at McDonald  Observatory and at CTIO for a survey of the
              interstellar medium.  The primary goal is to characterize the portion of the
              material  in the dense interstellar medium where ultraviolet photons from 
              young stars dominate the ionization state and energetics of the  gas.  Such
              regions are predominantly molecular, but the most  common tracer of molecular
              material, CO, can be depleted or  absent.  The high electron densities in the
              ultraviolet  influenced material may prevent it from participating in star 
              formation.  If this is the case, the abundance and nature of the  material will
              play a role in determining the efficiency of star  formation in molecular
              clouds.  The approach of Dr. Jaffe's  project is to determine the amount,
              distribution, and physical  properties of the ultraviolet influenced molecular
              gas over large  scales.  =================================================
