                This research will examine the long-term labor market effect of 
              neighborhoods on thousands of former public housing residents who  received
              subsidies to move to various neighborhoods in the  Chicago area through the
              Gautreaux housing program from 1976 to  1995.  The correlation between
              residence in a very poor  neighborhood and negative labor market outcomes is
              very strong.   The question is to what extent these labor market outcomes are 
              the result of low skills and low motivation of individuals alone  as distinct
              from neighborhood effects.  The Gatreaux housing  program moved similar
              families to a variety of neighborhoods in a  quasi-random manner, therefore the
              labor market experiences of  the individuals in these families can be used to
              separate  individual effects from neighborhood effects.
