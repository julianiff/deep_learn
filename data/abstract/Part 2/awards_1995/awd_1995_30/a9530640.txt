Abstract    :
              This career advancement award supports the activities of an experienced scholar
              interested in improving her research skills in studying how values influence
              the software design process.   Activities will include:  1)  Acquisition of
              computer-related technical skills, including familiarity with tools used in the
              software development process and knowledge of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and
              computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) packages;  2)  Increasing command of
              qualitative research methods for study of the design process, particularly
              methods helpful to the analysis of videotaped data; and 3) Participation in a
              studio course in software design at MIT, experimenting with methods for
              studying the software design process and gathering data on the role which
              values play in the process.  Over the next five years, these activities will
              enrich two research projects.  One will study several software development
              field sites for evidence about the role of values, assumptions and judgments in
              those processes.  The other focuses on redesign of CAD/CAM software to support
              the skilled work of machinists and will result in development of prototype
              software for machinists.    These professional development activities are
              critical to achieving excellence in the investigator's future plans for
              research.
