Abstract    :
              9530933  Martinez-Miranda  The physical properties of liquid crystal (LC)
              materials in a confined geometry deviate from those of the bulk liquid crystal.
               This project studies LC's confined in cells made up of substrate plates that
              can impose different boundary conditions at the substrate - LC interface,
              depending on the way each substrate is prepared.  The purpose of this work is
              to study the effect of substrates consisting of photolithographed gratings, on
              the structure of layered (smectic) liquid crystals films, as a function of film
              thickness, depth within the film, and temperature.  The resulting competition
              may produce (multi)layering within the LC film, and in some materials, a
              variation of molecular layer spacing within the film.  ***
