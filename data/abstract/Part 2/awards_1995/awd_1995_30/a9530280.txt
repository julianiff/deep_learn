Abstract    :
              9530280  Heinrichs    This research will test a new model which explains
              sedimentary  organic matter preservation in terms of strong adsorption to 
              mineral particles in sediments. In the model, preservation depends  on the
              concentration and solubilization rate of labile organic  matter, the adsorption
              coefficient of dissolved organic substances,  the sediment accumulation and
              bioturbation rates, and the  decomposition rates of adsorbed and dissolved
              organic matter. The  model not only explains global patterns of organic matter 
              preservation, but also the general lack of preservation of  terrigenous organic
              matter and kerogen in the marine environment.   The test of the model will
              involve: (1) measurement of adsorption  and desorption of proteins, polyamino
              acids, and melanoidins by  clay minerals and iron oxide, (2) studies of the
              decomposition of  these adsorbed substances in coastal sediments, and (3) 
              measurements of the adsorption of natural sediment hydrolyzable  amino acids
              and organic matter.    If supported by results of this research, the proposed
              model would  explain the large differences in organic matter preservation in 
              different sedimentary environments, a key process in the long-term  global
              carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous cycles. This would aid  interpretation of the
              sedimentary record of organic matter  accumulation in both recent and ancient
              sediments.  The model could  improve predictions of the effects of changes in
              ocean productivity  and sedimentation, due to human activities or natural
              phenomena, on  sedimentary carbon accumulation in continental margins.
