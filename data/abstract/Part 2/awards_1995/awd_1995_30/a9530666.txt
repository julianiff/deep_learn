Abstract    :
              ***  9530666  Oviatt  A foundation is provided by this research for the
              development of substantially more robust, flexible, accessible, and
              user-centered interfaces for multimodal/multimedia systems that incorporate
              human language technology.  Specific objectives include: (1) modeling users'
              adapted language during error resolution, and applying this information to the
              design of better error avoidance and resolution techniques, (2) examining the
              impact of different types and qualities of complex visual display on users'
              linguistic input to interactive systems, and designing interfaces that
              effectively but transparently guide users' input to match system processing
              capabilities, and (3) developing a refined metric of cognitive workload that
              can be applied to the design of well-integrated multimodal interfaces.  To
              pursue these objectives, a rapid, semi-automatic simulation technique is being
              used that supports the collection of high-fidelity data during multimodal
              human-computer interaction.  This research will significantly advance the
              empirical, theoretical, and applied foundations needed for the design of
              multimodal interfaces, and will be critical to establishing usable systems that
              can succeed in actual field settings.  In particular, it can have a major
              impact on improving the commercial viability of next-generation communications
              devices and mobile technology for a wide range of applications.   ***
