Abstract    :
              9530378  Kiene    This three year study will increase our fundamental
              understanding  of the role played by dissolved DMSP in the biogeochemistry of 
              reduced sulfur in surface seawater. The specific objectives of the  project are
              1) to test whether the dissolved DMSP pool measured by  conventional filtration
              techniques is truly dissolved; 2) to  measure the kinetics of uptake for
              dissolved DMSP by natural  microbial assemblages using 14C and 35S DMSP and to
              determine  in situ turnover rates for DMSP (d); 3) to measure the sulfur 
              products formed during DMSP degradation and to determine how the  branching
              ratio between the lyase (DMS forming) and demethylation  (methanethiol forming)
              pathways vary in different waters; 4) to  determine mechanisms of methanethiol
              production in aerobic seawater  and finally, to determine the loss kinetics of
              MeSH in seawater and  the factors which affect these. The work will be carried
              out using  primarily coastal and shelf water samples from the Northern Gulf of 
              Mexico, but 2 oceanographic cruises are planned to provide  complementary
              information from warm oligotrophic and cool  mesotrophic ocean waters. The
              resulting data should greatly advance  our knowledge of how DMSP is processed
              in the sea and how it  impacts the chemistry of surface waters through
              production of  important reduced sulfur compounds like DMS and methanethiol.
