Abstract    :
              The automatic and efficient recognition of genes in DNA sequences is now widely
              recognized as a central problem in computational molecular biology.  This
              research project uses the gene recognition problem in databases of gene
              sequence data as a driver for research in machine learning.   It builds on
              several promising recent results, investigating decision tree methods,
              memory-based reasoning, and hidden Markov models.  Each of these approaches has
              particular strengths.  Recent research by the PI has found that decision trees
              can achieve consistently higher accuracy that any previous methods for finding
              protein coding regions in very short DNA subsequences.  Embedding of the
              decision tree approach in a dynamic programming algorithm can be used to 
              produce a more general system.  The techniques discovered to be most effective
              will be incorporated into a complete gene finding system that can identify
              genes with high accuracy, augmented with a user-friendly interface, and made
              freely available to the biology and computer science research communities.
