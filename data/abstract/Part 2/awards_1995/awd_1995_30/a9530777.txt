Abstract    :
              Greene  OCE-9530777        The PI proposes to purchase shipboard instrumentation
              in support of  NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be used aboard the
              R/V  POINT SUR, a 135 foot vessel, which is owned by NSF and operated by  the
              University.  Instrumentation requested includes an  uninterruptable power
              supply (UPS), a themosalinograph, an altimer,  upgrades for a CTD system, and a
              large volume trace metal free  rosette system.  Most of the instrumentation
              requested is required  for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard the POINT SUR
              during 1996  and will enhance the scientific capability of the vessel in the 
              future.  The trace metal free rosette system is requested as a  replacement for
              one that was lost during a JGOFS cruise in the  Arabian Sea.
