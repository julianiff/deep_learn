                       All natural communities are organized in the sense that the  species 
              within  them  interact  with  one  another.   When   the  strengths  and rates
              of interaction are known, understanding  the  forces that regulate community
              structure can be estimated.  These  estimates   are  useful  for  modelling 
              the  predictability   of  biological  changes  due to natural processes  and 
              anthropogenic  impacts.   Such  knowledge is basic to food web theory  and 
              many  conservation  issues.  The proposed research  will  examine  four  kinds 
              of  experiments  to  explore the  importance  of  a  major  predator   (the 
              starfish  Pisaster)  when  excluded   and   when  introduced in rocky
              intertidal habitats.  In addition,  long-term  (ca.  25-y) monitoring routines
              will be continued.  These studies  will   supply  information  on  inter-annual
               variation  in   the  abundance  of  a  suite  of grazers, in the  disturbance 
              factors  effecting   mussel  beds,  and  in  the  intensity  of   barnacle 
              recruitment.
