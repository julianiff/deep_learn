Abstract    :
              The PI plans to measure D-region parameters using incoherent scatter technique,
              then using the measured parameters to improve understanding of mesospheric
              physics, dynamics and aeronomy.  Some of the issues involved are:  (1)
              interpretation of incoherent scatter data, (2) derivation of ionospherically
              interesting parameters, (3) scattering from collision-dominated plasma
              containing heavy ions, and (4) understanding of mesospheric chemistry in terms
              of minor constituents and their reactions.  The PI will use existing data from
              Arecibo, as well as experimenting for additional data acquisition.  This
              project will pave the way for a ground-based method of studying temporal
              variations in mesospheric aeronomy.
