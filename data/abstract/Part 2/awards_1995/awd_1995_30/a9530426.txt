Abstract    :
              9530426  Becker  This project supports the fabrication of cable sensor systems
              and their deployment at six sites in the northeastern Pacific Ocean to study
              the hydrogeology of two regions of the Juan de Fuca Ridge.  Dr. Keir Becker of
              University of Miami (Florida) will collaborate in the instrument development
              and integration with researchers from the Geologic Survey of Canada and
              engineers at Texas A&M University.  The full sensor systems (supported herein)
              and data recording packages (built by GSC) will be installed in seafloor holes
              drilled by the drill ship JOIDES Resolution, operated by an international
              consortium led by the National Science Foundation.  Borehole seal systems will
              be fabricated by engineers at Texas A&M University, the subcontractor
              responsible for JOIDES Resolution operations.  The present study follows the
              successful development and deployment of these subseafloor "observatories,"
              designated "CORKs," for hydrogeologic investigations in six previous holes in
              1991-1994.  It proposes refurbishment of two existing sites and deployment at
              four new sites to be drilled during summer 1996.  The basic objective of the
              research is to define hydrogeologic properties of the seafloor in two different
              regions, addressing questions about rates of pore fluid flow within the ocean
              crust, and related questions about the degree of fracturing, bulk permeability
              and fracture heterogeneity, and the volume of mobile fluid in the rock
              "reservoir."  This research is closely related to research on submarine
              hydrothermal systems and study of heat and chemical balances in the oceans, all
              of which must make implicit or explicit assumptions about these properties. 
              The work undertaken in this project includes both passive monitoring of
              subsurface physical properties for multi-year duration and active pressure
              pulse transmission between existing drill holes to define intervening reservoir
              properties.  Annual visits to the deployment sites and continuous data logging
              will provide unique long term record s of subcrustal processes.  ***
