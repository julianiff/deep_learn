Abstract    :
              9530894  Lagunas-Solar    This Americas Program award will support travel and
              related  expenses for a short-term visit by Dr. Manuel Lagunas-Solar, 
              University of California, Davis, to develop a collaborative  research project
              with Dr. Juan A. Canumir Veas, University  of Concepcion, Chillan, Chile.  They
              plan to investigate the  effect of high-power monochromatic ultra violet (UV) 
              radiation to control microbial DNA in fresh produce.  The  main objectives of
              the project are to study the basic  photochemistry induced on the surface of
              fresh foods,  determine the effectiveness of the treatment under a variety  of
              physical, chemical and physiological conditions of the  treated products, and
              to evaluate the application of the new  process to fresh vegetables.    The
              chemically-based technologies in use for the past fifty  years to aid in the
              preservation of food have been subject  to criticism because of the increased
              health risks, and the  residues they leave on the environment, our food and our
               water.  The researchers propose to decrease dependence on  chemicals for these
              purposes throughout the use of non-  additive physical technologies.  ***
