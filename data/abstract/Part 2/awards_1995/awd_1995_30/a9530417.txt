Abstract    :
              9530417  Kaufman    This grant provides $65,000 as partial support of  the costs
              of acquiring equipment and salary  support for developing an automated high 
              performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique  for measuring rates of
              amino acid racemization in  fossil organic matter in order to improve upon the 
              existing techniques of both ion-exchange liquid  chromatography (LC) and gas
              chromatography (GC).  This method should provide a useful Quaternary 
              chronostratigraphic and paleothermometric tool,  offering the ability to
              measure several amino acid  pairs which racemize at different rates thus 
              allowing more precise dating over wider range of  ages than with existing LC
              and/or GC methods.  Once calibrated, the improved technique will lead  to
              long-term benefit for Quaternary scientists  engaged in geological,
              climatological,  archeological, and geochronological research.  ***
