Abstract    :
              AST 9530769    The Allegheny Observatory Astrometric Program.    The Allegheny
              Observatory astrometric program utilizes unique  instrumentation to determine
              very high precision parallaxes and  masses of astrophysically interesting
              objects within 250 parsecs  of the Sun.  Combining the Multichannel Astrometric
              Photometer  (MAP) and the new optical system of the Thaw refractor, the 
              astrometric program has sufficient precision to obtain reliable  trigonometric
              distances of several open star clusters as well as  other luminosity standards
              in most parts of the HR diagram.  Combined with data from a 70 year baseline
              photographic plate  collection, the MAP/Thaw system has sufficient precision to
               delineate portions of the mass-luminosity relationship previously  outside of
              the domain of trigonometric techniques, and to make  signfiicant improvements
              in our understanding of the effects of  age and chemical composition on the
              energy output of stars.  ====================================
