Abstract    :
              9530984  Garfunkel  The program addresses the study of ultra-thin (<10 nm)
              oxides on silicon substrates.  The investigation centers around a
              cross-correlation between growth mechanisms, composition, microstructure and
              electrical properties of the thin oxides.  Medium Energy Ion Scattering (MEIS)
              will be employed together with a number of analytical and electrical techniques
              to provide a characterization of the transition region between the oxide and
              the underlying silicon substrate.  ***
