Abstract    :
              This award will support hardware and software upgrades for sonar  systems used
              on deep-submergence vehicles.  The present collection  of >10 units used in
              processing will be replaced by an off-the-  shelf workstation, decoder and
              standard digital signal processor  boards.  Software will be developed to
              produce user-friendly  output, and to simply processing so that trained
              engineers are not  required.  Finally, software will be developed to make data 
              compatible for other computer tool systems (MB and GMT), eventually  allowing
              interactive processing and display by users of IBM- and  Macintosh-compatible
              systems.
