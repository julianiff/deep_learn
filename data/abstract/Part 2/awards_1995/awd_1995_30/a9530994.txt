Abstract    :
              9530994  BARANS    This award supports a program at the South Carolina Marine 
              Resources Division to provide undergraduate minority students  with experiences
              in marine and environmental research, by giving  them with greater
              opportunities to actively participate in mentor-  assisted independent research
              during accelerated summer training  projects.  The goal of the project is to
              increase the number of  undergraduate minoirities, primarily African-Americans,
              choosing  marine or environmental science as a profession.  ***
