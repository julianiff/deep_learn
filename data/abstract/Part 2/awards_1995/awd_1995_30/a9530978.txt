Abstract    :
              Investigators will continue a project of extracting dust samples from the
              Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 ice core.  The origin of the dust will be
              determined by comparing the geochemistry of the dust from the ice core to that
              of samples taken from potential continental sources worldwide.  Changes in the
              source area for the dust in the ice cores will reveal how continental
              weathering and atmospheric transport have changed in response to changing
              climate during the past 100,000 years. Changes in atmospheric transport
              patterns will provide data for testing climate models that predict changes in
              atmospheric conditions during climate events during both glacial and
              interglacial climate extremes. .
