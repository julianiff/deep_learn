Abstract    :
              AST 95-30831  P.I.  Phillip Ianna    Fundamental Properties of Nearby Northern
              and Southern Stars.    The characteristics of stars populating our galaxy are
              broadly  inferred from the observational properties of nearby stars.  This  is
              the sample we might expect to be known most completely, and to  have the best
              observational data.  In fact many of the nearest  stars lack measurements of
              the most basic kind, such as colors,  spectral types, or especially, distances.
               A stellar parallax is  the most fundamental piece of information needed for
              calibrating  the luminosities of a wide variety of stars and so providing the 
              foundation for setting up the distance scale for objects beyond  the nearby
              sample.    Dr. Ianna will continue to direct a program to determine the 
              distances to selected nearby star candidates by the trigonometric  parallax
              method emphasizing CCD observations from the southern  hemisphere.
