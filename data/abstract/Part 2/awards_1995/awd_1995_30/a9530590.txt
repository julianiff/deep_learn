Abstract    :
              AST 9530590    Interstellar Matter and Magnetic Fields.    In interstellar space
              the magnetic energy density is usually  comparable to the turbulent energy
              density so that the field  plays a very strong role in all physical processes. 
              However,  measurements of the magnetic field strength are very difficult 
              because they are subject to contamination by instrumental  effects, and the
              required sensitivity is high.  Accordingly our  knowledge of magnetic fields is
              limited by the observational data  base.  With this award Dr. Heiles will
              vigorously expand the data  base on interstellar magnetic fields with
              observations of Zeeman  splitting of atomic hydrogen, the hydroxyl radical, and
              radio  recombination lines.  He will also pursue morphological and  kinematic
              studies of the diffuse interstellar medium in our  Galaxy.
