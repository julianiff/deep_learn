Abstract    :
              9530961  Measures         Antarctic waters are generally characterised by low
              standing  stocks of phytoplankton and low rates of primary production despite 
              the abundance of inorganic nutrients in the water column. Many  researchers
              have speculated on the deficiency of iron in these  waters to explain this
              paradox but no conclusive evidence of the  importance of iron or its mechanisms
              in stimulating productivity  have been presented. The major goals of the JGOFS
              Southern Ocean  Process Study are, in part, to unravel the factors and
              processes  that regulate the magnitude and variability of primary productivity 
              and use this knowledge to determine the response of the Southern  Ocean to
              naturally occurring climate changes both in the past and  in the future. In
              this study, the principal investigation will  measure iron and other reactive
              trace metals in the water column of  various productivity regimes of the Polar
              frontal region of the  Southern Ocean. These measurements will be used to
              further our  understanding of the supply and distribution of iron in Antarctic 
              waters and, in concert with the measurements of other P.I.'s its  importance in
              affecting the structure of the microbial food web and  the dynamics of the
              various biogeochemical cycles in the water  column.  As the complex role that
              iron plays in the magnitude and  sequence of biological processes becomes
              better understood, these  measurements will grow in importance in modelling the
              interaction  of iron and its biological effects and indirectly, its impact in 
              global biogeochemical cycles.
