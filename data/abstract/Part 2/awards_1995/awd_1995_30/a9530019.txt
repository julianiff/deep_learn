Abstract    :
              9530019  Maciie           This is a three year collaborative proposal for
              investigating  upper mantle (< 1000 km) conductivity differences beneath the 
              oceans and continents.  Subcontinental and suboceanic upper mantle 
              compositional and temperature differences have been proposed to  explain a wide
              array of geophysical data (jordan, 1975) and are  postulated to play an
              important role in plate tectonics and mantle  convection.  This concept, known
              as the tectosphere concept,  envisions that the subcontinental mantle is cold
              and depleted in  iron relative to the suboceanic mantle.  Electrical properties
              in  the mantle are strongly dependent upon both temperature and iron,  and
              hence, it is expected that there would be considerable  information in the
              electrical property differences between the  suboceanic and subcontinental
              uppers mantles.    The project will involve collections of several field data
              sets  which will be combined into a consistent and robust 3-D model of  the
              upper mantle conductivity structure for a detailed electrical  look at the
              tectosphere concept.
