Abstract    :
              9530173    This planning proposal takes advantage of the ongoing Earth System
              Science Education (ESSE) program, already funded by NASA, to contribute to the
              development and the emerging goals of the IAI program.  The concept of the
              Earth as a system is central to the seven research themes already identified
              for the IAI science agenda. By virtue of its interdisciplinary agenda Earth
              System Science and Elobal Change topics both place unusual demands and provide
              for exiting opportunities in the development of classroom educational resources
              to meet the needs of IAI member countries. The ESSE program will be used as a
              model for the development  of similar collaborative efforts within the IAI
              member countries; however, tailored to the specific technical capabilities and
              scientific interests of the participants. In addition, the existing 
              scientific, technical and support resources of the ESSE program will be
              available to share with the ESSE-IAI team to facilitate an immediate, effective
              initiation of the proposed program.  ***
