Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the biosynthetic study of the   cyanobacterial
              toxins anatoxin a-(s)n Anabaena flos-aquae NCR 525-17,    microcystin-LR in
              Microcystis aeruginosa PCC-7820, the cytotoxins   cryptophycin-1 in Nostoc sp.
              GSV 224, cylindrocyclophane D in   Cylindrospermum lichenforme ATCC 29204 and
              fungal alkaloids from the   Stigonemataceae.  One of the ultimate goals of the
              project will be to   study  biosynthetic processes at the enzymatic level.  
              Also several   unnatural C-substituted aspartic acids and beta-alanines will be
                evaluated as substrates for the `aberrant` biosynthesis of cryptophycin  
              analogs.  With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is  
              supporting the research of Drs. Richard E. Moore and Thomas K. Hemscheidt   of
              the Department of Chemistry at the University of Hawaii, Manoa.  Drs.   Moore
              and Hemscheidt will focus their work on biosynthetic studies of  
              cyanobacterial toxins produced by blue-green algae.   It is important to  
              learn exactly how potent cyanobacterial toxins are produced , since   poisonous
              blooms of blue-green algae in eutrophic freshwater and brackish   lakes present
              serious environmental and health problems , not only to   domestic animals and
              wildlife that live on the surrounding shores, but to   human populations that
              depend on the water for drinking.
