Abstract    :
                  This project explores two aspects of discrete search:(a) The  search for the
              majority in the set of objects;(b) The search  for critical points in an
              unknown function.In both cases the  main tools are detailed analyses of binary
              decision trees  and Kraft's inequality. The goals of the project include the 
              design of, analysis of and the proof of lower bounds for  search algorithms.
