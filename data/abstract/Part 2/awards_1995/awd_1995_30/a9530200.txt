Abstract    :
              9530200  SMAYDA    A  32-yr  (1959-1990), process-oriented, quantitative
              time-series  of   weekly   environmental  and  phytoplankton  and  zooplankton 
              measurements  in  Narragansett  Bay,  supplemented  by   numerous  laboratory
              and in situ experiments, will be analyzed.  This  data  set  appears  to  be 
              the  longest, quantitative  time-series  on  plankton   and  environment 
              available  globally.    At   maximal  activity, 27 variables and processes were
              measured weekly.   This  project  will  investigate  the  patterns,  cycles, 
              trends   and  variability  in environmental conditions and their  relationships
               to  plankton  population dynamics.  Knowledge of  interanual  and 
              interdecadal variability is central to understanding how plankton  systems 
              behave;  the  "baseline" against which  the  effects  of  culturally  induced 
              changes  can  be  detected,  measured,   and  predicted.    ***
