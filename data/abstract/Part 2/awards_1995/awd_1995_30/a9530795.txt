Abstract    :
                  ABSTRACT    OPP-9530795  SCHLOSSER,  PETER  LDEO-COLUMBIA UNIV.    The
              investigator proposes to conduct a research project on a cruise aboard the
              German research vessel Polarstern as a part of the international initiative
              ACSYS planned by the World Meteorological Organization. He will make tritium,
              helium, and oxygen isotope measurements in the eastern Arctic Ocean to
              determine the extent of Atlantic water that has recently been found to extend
              much farther into the basin than previously known.  The expansion of Atlantic
              water into the Arctic could be the result of global change in response to a
              warming climate or a temporary change in circulation due to factors not
              associated with climate.  The data collected on this cruise will fill in an
              important gap in the Arctic Ocean so that future studies may observe the
              persistence of the change in circulation within a global change context.
