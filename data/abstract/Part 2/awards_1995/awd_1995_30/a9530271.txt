Abstract    :
              This is a one-year regular grant that investigates mathematical model-based
              methods for coordination in intelligent agent societies. The research addresses
              how to construct an general model of coordination that is based on a
              identification of a set of state variables that characterize relevant aspects
              of agent behavior in an agent society.  Coordination is defined as the
              management of dependencies among activities, following a widely used definition
              of coordination.  The problem of coordination is then the problem of exerting
              control over these dependencies. The research aims to discover logical
              orderings of state variables based on dependencies, and thus  to develop
              mathematical models of coordination strategies. Once coordination and control
              relationships are known, coordination problems can be treated using constraint
              satisfaction, constraint-propagation, ad optimization approaches. The
              mathematical models will be further explored and validated through simulation.
