Abstract    :
              This award supports the development of a computationally explicit theory of
              operant conditioning, in which animals determine the effects of their actions
              and adjust their behavior to maximize reward.  The Rescorla-Wagner model of
              classical conditioning and its various descendants have yielded considerable
              insight into how associations between sensory stimuli andreflex actions may be
              acquired.  But operant conditioning evokes  more complex and deliberate
              behavior patterns, for which there is no comparable computational model.  The
              theory being developed includes four types of learning: (i) on-line learning of
              reward predictors based on observed reinforcement contingencies, (ii) acquiring
              secondary reinforcers, such as the sound of a food dispenser being activated,
              (iii) generating new actions by selecting and shaping innate behaviors, and
              (iv) refining perception to focus on task-relevant signal discriminations.  In
              addition to testing the theory with computer simulations of classic animal
              learning experiments such as the Delayed Match to Sample task, the theory is
              being embodied in an RWI B21 mobile robot.  This research promises a new class
              of learning robots that can interact with people in much the same way that
              animals interact with their human trainers
