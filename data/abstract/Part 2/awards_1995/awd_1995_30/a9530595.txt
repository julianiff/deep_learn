Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the  
              Chemistry Division, Ben-Amotz will study the influence of solute-solvent  
              interactions on chemical reactions using pressure- and   temperature-dependent
              optical spectroscopic studies as well as   theoretical modeling.  Dissociation,
              isomerization, and ion-pairing model   reactions will be studied, and changes
              in the equilibrium constants for   model reactions will be measured in organic
              solvents as well as in   supercritical argon, xenon, and water using
              high-pressure Raman, FTIR,   and UV/visible spectroscopies in diamond anvil
              supercritical fluid   pressure cells.  The results will be used to test
              theoretical models   derived from liquid perturbation theory using both a
              first-principles   approach as well as a semi-empirical perturbed hard fluid
              (PHF) model.    Predicted and experimental results will be compared over a wide
              pressure   and temperature range in both liquid and supercritical fluid
              solvents.  The value of using predictive models to calculate properties of
              systems,   especially those under extreme conditions of temperature or
              pressure, has   become widely recognized by engineers.  These studies will
              contribute to   our ability to predict chemical reaction equilibria under
              increasingly   extreme and complex condensed phase conditions.  The results of
              this work   are likely to be important to industrial chemical synthesis, waste 
               recovery, and separation technologies.
