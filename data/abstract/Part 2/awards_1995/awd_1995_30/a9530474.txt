Abstract    :
              AST-9530474    Astrometric Research at the Yale University Observatory.    This
              award is a companion to one that supports Dr. Van Altena's  Southern Proper
              Motion Survey that is being carried out at Yale  Southern Observatory
              facilities in Argentina.  These funds cover  the incidental costs incurred by
              the Southern Observatory  personnel in New Haven during the course of their
              work on the  survey.  Expenses covered include travel, publication costs,
