Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry  
              Program supports research by Dr. Jacqueline K. Barton of the Department   of
              Chemistry, California Institute of Technology, for the construction of  
              metal-peptide complexes targeted to double helical DNA.  Oligopeptides   will
              be synthesized and coupled onto metallointercalators which have high   binding
              affinity for the major groove of DNA.  These intercalators will   position the
              appended peptide to bind specifically to other DNA sites.    The
              oligopeptides-- which are derived from the recognition elements of   DNA
              binding proteins such as phage 434 and P(22) repressors and the zinc   finger
              domains of Sp1 and ADR1--as well as the rhodium-containing   intercalators will
              govern the recognition characteristics. The   intercalator, peptide, and the
              linkage between the two will be varied to   target specific DNA sites.  
              Cleavage of the DNA strand by   photoactivation of the metallointercalator
              followed by chemical   footprinting will be used to determine binding
              locations.  The long term   goal of the project is the development of an array
              of small metal-peptide   complexes which bind DNA with predicatable
              sequence-specificities.    Additionally, by incorporating a coordination site
              for a secondary metal   ion into the appended peptide, zinc ion and
              metal-peptide-dependent   hydrolytic cleavage of the DNA phosphodiester
              backbone will be explored.  This research will contribute to understanding the
              principles of   recognition of nucleic acids by proteins, as well as develop
              some   vehicles to effect selective interaction of proteins with nucleic acids.
                 The results will be relevant to the design of therapeutic agents and  
              advanced clinical testing.
