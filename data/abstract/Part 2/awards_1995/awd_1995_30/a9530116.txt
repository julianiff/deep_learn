Abstract    :
              9530116  Soos  This is a renewal grant co-funded by the Division of  Materials
              Research and the Chemistry Division.  Theoretical  research will be conducted
              on the electronic properties of  conjugated molecules and polymers including
              nonlinear  optical response, efficient electroluminescence and high  conduction
              on doping.  The long-range goal of this research  program is a unified,
              semiquantitative description of  polymer excitations that parallels conjugated
              molecules,  incorporates modern vibrational spectroscopy, combines  nonlinear
              optical and linear spectra, and applies to both pi-  and sigma-conjugated
              systems.  Projects to be studied  include: a joint approach to conjugated
              molecules and  polymers; vibronic analysis of nonlinear optical and 
              electroabsorption spectra; electron-phonon coupling and  force-fields; and,
              charge transport in molecularly doped  polymers.  %%%  Theoretical analysis
              will be done on the electronic and  optical properties of polymers.  These
              materials have unique  properties and are amenable to processing such that 
              materials can be designed to have specific properties.  The  research is
              supported by both the Divisions of Materials  Research and Chemistry.  ***
