Abstract    :
              9530659  Chu   This project will explore heterogeneous reactions of bromine
              which are potentially  important to polar ozone depletion and ozone loss in the
              tropospheric Arctic boundary layer.  The role of HBr (hydrogen bromide)
              conversion into photochemically active bromine on ice surfaces will be
              explored. The results of this study will lead to a better mechanistic
              understanding of uptake and heterogeneous reactions involved in ozone
              depletion.  The initial focus will be on uptake of HBr and the formation
              mechanism of HBr hydrates on ice film surfaces. The phase diagram of HBr-ice
              along with other thermodynamic properties will be determined from this study.
              The uptake of the hydrogen halides HF, HCl, HBr, and HI on ice surfaces will be
              compared and the trends interpreted in terms of acidity and the interactions of
              the hydrogen halides with the ice surfaces. The reaction probabilities and
              mechanism of gaseous HOCl and HOBr with HBr on ice surfaces will be determined
              under simulated atmospheric conditions.   %%%  This project will use a glass
              flow reactor, together with pulsed molecular beam sampling, quadrupole mass
              spectrometry, and phase sensitive detection methods. Formation processes for
              HBr hydrates will be examined using specular reflection-absorbance IR
              spectroscopy. The effect of the ice film surface morphology on HBr uptake will
              be investigated by using scanning electron microscopic and BET isotherm
              adsorption methods. Models will be developed to interpret the results.   ***
