Abstract    :
              ***  Imlay   9530230         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              project will develop an efficient Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software
              package which uses hybrid structured-unstructured grids to minimize the grid
              generation effort, and massively parallel processing (MPP) computers to
              minimize run time. The recent emergence of high performance MPP computers has
              theoretically reduced the computer time required for the design and analysis of
              systems involving fluid flow using CFD. However, in practice, algorithms used
              in MPP today were developed for sequential computers and therefore do not
              harness the full power of massively parallel processing. Also, MPP computers
              have not simplified the structured grid generation process, which may take
              weeks for complex  configurations. During phase I, an efficient implicit
              finite-volume method was developed for solving the 2D Navier-Stokes equations
              on MPP computers using hybrid structured-unstructured grids and domain
              decompostion. The structured grids are used to resolve boundary layers near
              walls and unstructured grids are used to discretize the remainder of the flow
              field. During phase II, the algorithm will be extended to 3D, the domain
              decompostion will be expanded and improved, and quasi-dynamic load balancing
              will be added. Also, the potential market will be broadened by adding
              incompressible flow capability, the ability to run in parallel on networks of
              engineering workstations, and an interactive MOTIF user interface which will
              make the parallelism nearly transparent to the users.       The proposed
              solution algorithm has the potential to dramatically reduce the time required
              to perform a CFD analysis. The use of hybrid grids will simplify the grid
              generation process for practical (complex) geometries and the use of MPP
              computers will reduce the run time. The resulting analysis package will be
              marketable to the aerospace industry and other industries.   ***
