              Abstract  ATM-9530914  Saltzman, Barry  Yale University  Title: Dynamical Theory
              of Long-Term Climatic Change    This award supports studies of long-term (e.g.
              late Cenozoic)  climate change aimed at developing a predictive theory that can
               account for the increasing geological proxy evidence for the co-  evolution of
              climatic variables.  These variables can be subdivided  into (a) fast-response
              atmospheric and surface state quantities  that equilibrate relatively rapidly,
              and (b) slow-response, high-  inertia quantities (e.g., ice sheet mass, deep
              ocean temperature,  carbon inventories) that carry the main long-term evolution
              and  comprise the "center manifold" of the climate system to which the  fast
              response variables are attracted.  These studies involve  statistical analyses
              of the relevant time-series records, and  theoretical studies based on both
              general circulation models  (governing the fast response equilibrium processes)
              and dynamical-  system models (governing the slow-response, non-equilibrium 
              processes).  The aim is to enlarge upon present theory of  Pliocene/Pleistocene
              climatic evolution by: (a) extension to a  three-dimensional geographical
              coverage of ice sheet mass, (b) a  more general treatment of ocean dynamics,
              allowing the possibility  for multiple equilibria and instability, and (c)
              establishing  closure relations between the fast and slow response variables by
               systematic GCM studies.
