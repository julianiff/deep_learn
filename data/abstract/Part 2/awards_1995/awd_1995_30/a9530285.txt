Abstract    :
              9530285  DeMenocal    Did tropical atmosphere-ocean circulation change near 2.8
              Ma?  African precipitation and Atlantic upwelling are linked at annual  and
              orbital time scales through insolation forcing of West African  monsoon. ODP
              site 662, off west Africa, will be studied for winter  dust input within
              equatorial Atlantic upwelling system. Freshwater  diatoms and nannofossils will
              be used to monitor variations in  African precipitation and tropical upwelling.
              The study will help  answer the question about circulation changes in the mild
              Pliocene.
