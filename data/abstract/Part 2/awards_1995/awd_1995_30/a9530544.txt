Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry  
              Program provides continuing support to research on the mechanism of   oxidation
              reactions of organometallic compounds by Dr. James M. Mayer of   the Chemistry
              Department, University of Washington.   The formation of   carbon-oxygen bonds
              using a metal-oxo group as the oxygen source is the   focus of the
              investigation.   The migration of aryl and alkyl groups from   a metal center
              to an oxo group--an important step in the reaction   mechanism--will be
              explored in detail.  A variety of reactions involving   intra- and inter-
              molecular nucleophilic attack at oxo groups will be   studied.  The
              rhenium-oxo-hydridotris(pyrazolyl)borate system will be   used to generate,
              isolate, and study migrations involving electrophilic   oxo groups.  The
              oxidizing rhenium(VII) compounds are formed by oxygen   atom transfer to stable
              rhenium(V) compounds.  Other studies will explore   the range of these
              reactions, including alkyl, alkene, arene, and   thioether oxidations. 
              Oxidation is an important commercial process in applications ranging from  
              pharmaceutical synthesis to waste treatment, but the ability to control  
              oxidation reactions is limited.  This project addresses fundamental   issues
              concerning mechanisms of oxidation of organic substances and will   have impact
              on the ability to control organic oxidations.  .
