                                              Thinned CCDs for the UH 8192 x 8192 mosaic
              camera    The University of Hawaii has built a CCD mosaic camera with 
              8192x8192 pixels.  The mosaic is a close-packed 4x2 array of  3-edge-buttable
              2048x2048 CCDs with 15 micrometer pixels.  The camera was designed primarily
              for use at the prime focus  of the Canada France Hawaii Telescope, but can be
              used with  other telescopes as well.    The CCDs which were available for use
              in this instrument are  prototypes of rather low quality with several serious 
              limitations.  This project will replace the original CCDs in  the existing
              camera with high-quality, high sensitivity  (peak QE > 80%), thinned CCDs. 
              Improved CCDs will increase  the sensitivity of the instrument by at least a
              factor of  two in the red and by a factor of many in the blue.  Furthermore,
              the new CCDs will be of superior cosmetic  quality, and the reduced dark
              current and resulting low  noise will make low background imaging projects
              possible.
