Abstract    :
              9530292  MEAGHER   At the invitation of their respective Society Presidents,
              representatives from the American Society of Naturalists, the Society for the
              Study of Evolution, the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution, the
              Ecological Society of America, the Society of Systematic Biologists, the
              Genetics Society of America, the Animal Behavior Society, and the
              Paleontological Society met in Indianapolis on April 22-23, 1995, to discuss
              the preparation of a report defining the challenges and opportunities facing
              the study of evolution.  The representatives agreed to proceed toward the
              formulation and dissemination of a document that would  1) describe the content
              and aims of evolutionary biology;  2) document some of its accomplishments,
              including its contributions to biological science in general and to social
              needs in areas such as health science, agriculture, and environmental science; 
              3) outline important future contributions of our science to the biological
              science and to social needs;  4) identify areas of particular challenge and
              opportunity;  and  5) suggest mechanisms by which such challenges and
              opportunities may be pursued.  This document would inform science
              administrators and other representatives of society of the role of evolutionary
              biology in the progress of basic biological science and its applications to
              social needs, and would identify promising areas of future work.  A working
              group of eighteen (18) scientists representing major disciplines in
              evolutionary biology has been established and will meet over the next two years
              to draft a working document to be presented to the memberships of their
              respective societies.  The workshop series will include a meeting of the
              working group to establish an outline for the document, a meeting of the
              working group to revise a draft document, and a meeting of the working group to
              incorporate input from the scientific societies.  The workshop series will be
              followed by publication and dissemination of the finished document.
