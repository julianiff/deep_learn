Abstract    :
              9530041  Geronimo    This award will provide partial support for ImageTech, a
              Conference   on the Mathematics of Imaging and Applications, to be held at the 
               Georgia Institute of Technology from March 17-20, 1996.  Support   will be
              provided for graduate students and recent doctoral recipients.    The
              conference will bring together researchers who will present recent   advances
              in the mathematics of imaging, including fractal, wavelet,   and other
              technologies.  New developments in image compression and   analysis have led to
              an increased cooperation among researchers in   areas such as speech and video
              compression, image enhancing, target   acquisition, and many others. 
              Participants will include researchers   from both academia and industry.  The
              program will include both   plenary lectures and a technical program, including
              both invited talks   and contributed papers.
