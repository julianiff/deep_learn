Abstract    :
              The PI requests funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in  support of
              NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be used  aboard the R/V Thompson, a
              274 foot vessel that is owned by the  University.  Both ships are operated by
              the University in support  of basic oceanographic research efforts.  NSF-funded
              scientists are  the primary users of both ships.    Instrumentation requested
              includes computer hardware and network  upgrades, a set of 12-position
              carousels, meteorological sensors  for the R/V BARNES, thermal graphic
              recorders, and upgrades to the  side-scan sonar system.  The instrumentation
              requested is required  for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard the THOMPSON
              and the  BARNES during 1996 and will enhance the scientific capability of  the
              vessels in the future.
