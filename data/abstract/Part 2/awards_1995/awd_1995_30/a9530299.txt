Abstract    :
              9530299  Perfit    The Juan de Fuca Ridge has been the site of an extensive
              study of  volcanology and hydrothermal activity. The segment that appears to 
              be most volcanically active (known as the Coaxial segment) has had  two
              eruptions since 1981. The PI has been involved in the  collection of basalts
              from this ridge for several years and wishes  to analyze these rocks to
              investigate the compositions of the lavas  and how they change with time. This
              work would be synthesized into  a map that contained the data from the rocks,
              the hydrothermal  vents, and photos.
