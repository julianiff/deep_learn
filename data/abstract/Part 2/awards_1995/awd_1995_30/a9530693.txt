Abstract    :
              9530693  Knox       This award provides funding to purchase shipboard 
              instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research.  The  instruments will be
              used aboard the R/Vs MELVILLE, a 279  foot vessel, NEW HORIZON, a 170 foot
              vessel , and the  SPROUL, a 125 foot  vessel.   The MELVILLE is owned by the 
              Navy, while the NEW HORIZON and the SPROUL are owned by the  University.  All
              the ships are operated by the Institute in  support of oceanographic research
              funded by a variety of  Federal, state and private organizations, although NSF
              is  the primary user of all the ships.    Instrumentation requested includes
              both shared-use equipment  for specific ships and shared-use instrumentation
              that will  be maintained by the central Ocean Data Facility(ODF) and  used
              aboard a variety of SIO and non-SIO ships.  The  instrumentation requested is
              required for support of  NSF-  funded cruises aboard the MELVILLE, NEW HORIZON
              and SPROUL  during 1996 and will enhance the scientific capability of  these
              vessels in the future.  ***
