Abstract    :
              9530300  Honjo         This research project is part of the US Joint Global
              Ocean  Flux Study (JGOFS) Southern Ocean Program aimed at (1) a better 
              understanding of the fluxes of carbon, both organic and  inorganic, in the
              Southern Ocean, (2) identifying the physical,  ecological and biogeochemical
              factors and processes which  regulate the magnitude and variability of these
              fluxes, and (3)  placing these fluxes into the context of the contemporary
              global  carbon cycle.       This work is one of forty-four projects that are 
              collaborating in the Southern Ocean Experiment, a three-year  effort south of
              the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone to track the  flow of carbon through its
              organic and inorganic pathways from  the air-ocean interface through the entire
              water column into the  bottom sediment.   The experiment will make use of the
              RVIB  Nathaniel B. Palmer and the R/V Thompson.       This project will make
              direct measurements of the downward  flux of particulate matter through an
              array of bottom-mounted  sediment traps.  These traps will be maintained for an
              eighteen  month period, and have a sampling resolution of seventeen days,  with
              higher resolution during the intense summer phytoplankton  bloom.  The total
              export fluxes of organic carbon, nitrogen,  biogenic silicates, and calcium
              carbonate that can be obtained  from these measurements represent the basic
              core variables of the  JGOFS program.  ***
