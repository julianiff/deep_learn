Abstract    :
              9530634  Ruoff    This  research project will extend the static pressure range 
              on  molecular solids to above 460 GPa - from 230 GPa  -  and  will  provide a
              study of new forms of hydrogen, oxygen,  and  nitrogen  as well as alkali
              hydrides.  The objective  is  to  make  and  study solid atomic metallic
              hydrogen, oxygen  and  nitrogen.  The study of hydrides has the intent of 
              learning  more about the nature of the hydride ion.  X-ray diffraction  and 
              optical  studies,  Raman,  absorption,  and  reflection  spectroscopy  will  be
              used.  Microminiaturization  will  be  emphasized with diamond anvil tips
              reduced to 20 micrometers  and  initial sample hole diameters in the refractory
               gasket  material of 6 micrometers.  %%%  This  research  project plans to make
              solid atomic  metallic  hydrogen  that  has been predicted to be a high 
              temperature  superconductor.  Solid atomic metals of oxygen and  nitrogen  are 
              also  planned  to be formed during this  project.   The  intent  is  to 
              provide a strong fundamental basis  for  the  understanding of these unique new
              metals.  To achieve  these  goals  this  project plans to double the pressure 
              range  to  which  molecular solids have been studied to reach  460  GPa  (or 
              4.6  Mbar or 4.6 million atmospheres) which is  greater  than the pressure at
              the earth's core.  An objective of this  research  is  to  determine whether 
              metallic  hydrogen  can  persist at atmospheric pressure.  If this objective 
              is  met  there may follow some unique applications.  ***
