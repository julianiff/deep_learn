Abstract    :
              9600311  McFadden      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour  months of
              research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research  visit which will support Dr. Christopher F. McFadden to
              work  with Professor Nicholas D. Spencer at the Swiss Federal  Institute of
              Technology in Zurich, Switzerland.        This project will focus on
              investigating the ability of  chiral adsorbed organic species to provoke the
              formation of  screw dislocations in a metal overlayer.  The objective is  to
              characterize via various surface spectroscopies, the  structure of metals
              deposited onto chiral organic  substrates.  The hope is to produce
              heterogeneous catalysis  materials selective for the synthesis of chiral
              molecules.  ***
