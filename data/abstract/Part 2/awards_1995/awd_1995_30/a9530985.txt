Abstract    :
              The   goal  of  this  research  is  to  develop  appearance-based 
              representations  of three-dimensional scenes that  permit  images 
              corresponding to a continuous range of views of the scene  to  be  synthesized
              by adaptively combining a set of basis images.  These  steerable appearance
              models analytically model the effects  of  a  moving  camera  on scene
              appearance.  The approach  is  based  on  decomposing  scene  appearance into 
              three  separate  components:  epipolar  motion,  visibility, and photometric
              properties,  which  together  determine  how  the scene will  appear  from 
              arbitrary  viewpoints.    Each   component  is   represented   and   steered 
              independently  before  being combined to  produce  views  of  the  scene.   The
               components are directly computable from  the  basis  images    under   certain
                conditions,   avoiding    traditional  difficulties caused by ill-posed
              problems and complex  3-D  scene  recovery tasks.  The research centers around
              the dual problems of  measurability and steerability, which provide a formal
              basis  for  designing  and  evaluating  the  proposed  models.  Measurability 
              defines  the conditions under which it is possible to  recover  a 
              representation   from  a  set  of  basis  images.    Steerability  specifies
              the range of views that may be reconstructed as well as  the  mechanism  for 
              producing them.  Results  should  provide  a  better  theoretical 
              understanding  of  the  dynamic  effects  of  viewpoint   on  scene 
              appearance.   Potential  applications   of  steerable appearance models will be
              investigated, such  as  three  dimensional   object  recognition  based  on 
              viewpoint-dependent  grayscale  appearance,  and visual map  construction  of 
              unknown  three-dimensional environments by active exploration.
