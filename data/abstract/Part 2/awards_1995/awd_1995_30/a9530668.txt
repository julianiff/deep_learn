Abstract    :
              9530668  Claffy  NSF would like to foster a robust multiple provider network 
              environment where IP providers can secure sufficient and useful  understanding
              of workloads imposed by their customers.  NSF will  use this workshop to bring
              together those who use high speed  network equipment with those who design it. 
              The recent deployment  of the vBNS (very high speed Backbone Network Service),
              an NSF  cooperatite agreement with MCI for an OC-3 wide area network 
              connecting the NSF supercomputer centers, will also provide an  ideal platform
              to investigate statistics collection and analysis  technologies.
