Abstract    :
              9530529  Shearer    This grant provides $120,000 as three years  partial salary
              support of a computer technician  whose responsibilities would include
              maintenance  and operation of the Institute of Geophysics and  Planetary
              Physics' (IGPP) computer network of 125  workstation and 131 PC's.  The
              addition of a full-  time network manager for this group will allow the  PI's
              to focus on their research on global,  regional and marine seismology
              (including seismic  detection of nuclear detonations), mantle  dynamics,
              geomorphology and space geodesy as  opposed to the ever increasing need for 
              maintenance of their expanding network of CPU's,  mass storage devices and
              other peripherals.  ***
