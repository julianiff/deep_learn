Abstract    :
                This project's goal is the study of approximations for  Steiner minimum trees
              (SMTs) and related problems.  This  study extends the PI's research, supported
              under CCR-92-  08913, on the analysis and the designs of polynomial-time 
              approximations for SMTs.  The project includes finding new  techniques to solve
              or make significant progress in both the  analysis and
              construction/implementation of the following  problems in the area of SMTs: (1)
              Open problems on the  Steiner ratio (such as, Chung-Gilbert's conjecture,
              Graham-  Hwang's conjecture, and Smith's sausage conjecture); (2) 
              Determination of the performance ratios for various  approximations (such as,
              Chang's approximations, Smith-Lee-  Liebman's approximation, and Kahng-Robin's
              approximation);  (3) New approximation algorithms using the variable metric 
              method; (4) Investigation of a conjecture about SMTs  approximations and
              hardness of finding approximate SMTs; (5)  Establishment of significant lower
              bounds for the performance  ratio of polynomial-time approximations; (6)
              Improvement of  the analysis of approximations of Zelikovsk's; and (7) 
              Construction of good approximation algorithms for related  problems.***
