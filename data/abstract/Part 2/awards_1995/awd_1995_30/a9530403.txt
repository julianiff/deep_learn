Abstract    :
              9530403  Freed  Theoretical research will continue on developing theories  for
              calculating the thermodynamic properties of polymer  melts, blends, block
              copolymers, glasses and liquid  crystals.  A main and novel feature of this
              theoretical  approach involves the combined treatment of monomer  molecular
              structures, local correlations, and  compressibility.  The principal
              investigator will continue  this work by extending his lattice cluster theory
              to include  semiflexibility in order to describe polymer glasses and  liquid
              crystals.  Another aspect of the proposed research  will involve continued
              studies of the influence of short  chain branching (and semiflexibility) on the
              miscibility of  polymer blends (with special focus on polyolefin blends)  and,
              if time permits, on their interfacial properties.  Other phenomena to be
              studied include the pressure  dependence of polymer blend miscibility and glass
              transition  temperatures.  The accurate description of polymer blends  and of
              polymer liquid crystals with models containing  complex monomer structures will
              require the inclusion of  contributions from long range correlations,
              contributions  that only can be evaluated with the aid of sophisticated 
              computer-based combinatorial algorithms which will be  devised and applied to
              this project.  %%%  This theoretical research involves both analytical and 
              computational components.  The research will determine a  variety of properties
              of polymers and their mixtures using a  formalism developed by the principal
              investigator.  Modifications to this formalism will be made in order to  model
              more realistic situations.  ***
