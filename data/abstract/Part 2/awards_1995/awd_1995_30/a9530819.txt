Abstract    :
              95-30819  DAGG  This research project is part of the US Joint Global Ocean  Flux
              Study (JGOFS) Southern Ocean Program aimed at (1 ) a  better understanding of
              the fluxes of carbon, both organic  and inorganic, in the Southern Ocean, (2)
              identifying the  physical, ecological and biogeochemical factors and processes 
              which regulate the magnitude and variability of these fluxes,  and (3) placing
              these fluxes into the context of the  contemporary global carbon cycle.   
              Large phytoplankton, especially diatoms, typically grow  slowly in the
              permanently ice-free regions of the Southern  Ocean, including the Antarctic
              Polar Front Zone (APFZ),  because of micronutrient (Fe) limitation or light
              limitation  or limitation associated with deep mixing. It is hypothesized  that
              under these conditions the growth of large phytoplankton  is approximately
              balanced by grazing from the copepod  community. When growth of large
              phytoplankton is enhanced by  Fe inputs or improved light conditions, it is
              hypothesized  that the additional growth is mostly absorbed by the  functional
              response of the copepod community. Larger  enhancements of phytoplankton growth
              however, will saturate  the grazing on diatoms increases the Si:C ratio of
              sinking  matter because approximately 70% of ingested carbon is  assimilated
              across the copepod gut wall but Si is digestively  inert. These relationships
              will be addressed by shipboard  experiments designed to measure the feeding
              rates of large  copepods on large phytoplankton of the APFZ, and by 
              measurements of the ratio of carbon to biogenic silica in  copepod fecal
              pellets and in sediment trap materials.
