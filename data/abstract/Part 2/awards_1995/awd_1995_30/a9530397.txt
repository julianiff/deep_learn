Abstract    :
              AST 9530397    Globular Cluster Evolution.    The goal of Dr. Chernoff's
              theoretical research program is to  find plausible evolutionary models for
              globular clusters,  incorporating the most important physical processes with 
              sufficient accuracy to make meaningful comparisons with  observations.  Dr.
              Chernoff will model the evolution of globular  clusters including the effects
              of 1) collisional relaxation; 2) a  stellar mass spectrum; 3) stellar
              evolution; 4) Galactic tides;  and 5) binary stars.  The main tool for the
              modeling is a Monte-  Carlo code which follows particles through a global
              potential and  approximates the effects of collisions via random forces.
