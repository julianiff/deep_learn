Abstract    :
              OCE-9530687    The PI requests funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in 
              support of NSF-funded research.  The instruments will be used  aboard the R/V
              ENDEAVOR, a 177 foot vessel, which is owned by NSF  and operated by the
              University.  Instrumentation funded includes  CD-ROM data recording systems, a
              SeaBird CTD system, adapter rings  for the water sampling carousel, transducers
              for the CHIRP sonar  system, a flowmeter, and a GPS based time code generator. 
              The  instrumentation is requested for support of NSF-funded cruises  aboard the
              ENDEAVOR during 1996 and to enhance the scientific  capability of the vessel in
              the future.
