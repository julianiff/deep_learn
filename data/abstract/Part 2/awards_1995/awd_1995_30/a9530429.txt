Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at Ohio State University to acquire an
              upgrade of the console of an existing 500  MHz NMR spectrometer.  This
              equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the  following:
              (1) The structure-function relationship of tumor suppressors, (2)
              Perforin-mediated cytolysis,  (3) Chemistry and biochemistry of Vitamin A and
              its metabolites, (4) Reactions via ion-paired transition  states, (5)
              Structure/property relationships in inorganic oxide glasses, (6) NMR
              conformational studies  of glycosidase inhibitors, and (7) Compact domains in
              proteins.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful
              tool available to chemists for the  elucidation of the structure of molecules. 
              It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific  arrangements
              of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
              molecules  in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is
              essential to chemists who are carrying out  frontier research.  The results
              from these NMR studies will be useful in areas such as polymers, catalysis, 
              and biology.
