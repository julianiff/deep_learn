Abstract    :
              9530094  Mix  Researchers from Oregon State University will undertake a research
              cruise to sample sediments from the South American margin from Chile to Peru in
              an investigation of the climatic and oceanographic history of the Eastern
              Pacific Ocean.  Their specific objectives will test hypotheses which 1) relate
              the oceanographic circulation of the eastern Pacific Ocean to winds and mixing
              processes in the Southern Ocean off Antarctica and 2) examine the symmetry of
              ocean currents along the continental margin between the northern hemisphere
              (California Current) and southern hemisphere (Humboldt Current).  The piston
              cores which will be collected during this project fill a large geographic void
              in samples, and are important to the broader understanding of ocean-wide
              circulation and climate questions in the Pacific Ocean.  They will also collect
              seismic reflection and detailed seafloor bathymetric data in the vicinity of
              each of their 11 planned coring sites to prepare detailed pre-drilling plans
              for their highly-ranked proposal for drilling this region in the future with
              the JOIDES Resolution, the drilling platform for basic marine geological
              research managed for an NSF-led international consortium of 18 nations by the
              Ocean Drilling Program.    ***
