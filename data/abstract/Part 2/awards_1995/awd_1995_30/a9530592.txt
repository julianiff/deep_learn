Abstract    :
              9530592  Ergas  Biofiltration is a low cost and effective method for controlling
               emissions of biodegradable volatile organic compounds (VOC's)  from chemical
              and process industries.  Studies and field  applications of these systems,
              however, have been limited to  inlet VOC concentrations of less than 1,000
              ppmv.  At high inlet  concentrations, microbial growth results in plugging of
              biofilter  media pore spaces.  In addition, these systems are of limited use 
              where degradation results in the formation of acidic metabolites  or where
              cosubstrates must be added to induce enzymes required  for cometabolism.    To
              overcome the limitations described above, biological treatment  systems for VOC
              control must be developed which: 1) incorporate  mass transfer of VOCs across a
              media with high specific surface  area and low diffusion length, 2) incorporate
              high biomass  concentrations to maintain high biodegradation rates, 3) provide 
              a method for wasting biomass to prevent clogging, and 4) provide  a method for
              addition of pH buffers, nutrients, and/or co-  substrates to support the
              microbial population and neutralize  acidic metabolites.  A specially designed
              bioreactor is under  investigation which has the potential to meet these
              requirements  and achieve high VOC removal efficiencies in small reactor 
              volumes.  The reactor utilizes hydrophobic microporous hollow  fiber membranes
              for mass transfer.  Gases containing VOCs are  passed through bundles of hollow
              fiber membranes.  Soluble  compounds in the gas phase are transferred through
              the membranes  to the surrounding liquid nutrient media.  Compounds in the 
              liquid phase are then available for biodegradation.    The proposed project
              will further investigate the use of  microporous hydrophobic hollow fiber
              membrane systems for  biological treatment of gas phase VOCS.  Specific
              objectives  include: investigation of factors controlling mass transfer and 
              biodegradation; investigation of conditions for use in  cometabolism of the
              model chlorinated VOC, tr ichloroethene;  refinement and testing of
              mathematical models of mass transfer  and biodegradation.
