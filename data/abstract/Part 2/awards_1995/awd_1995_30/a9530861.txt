Abstract    :
              9530861  Buessler         This research project is part of the US Joint Global 
              Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) Southern Ocean Program aimed at  (1) a better
              understanding of the fluxes of carbon, both  organic and inorganic, in the
              Southern Ocean, (2)  identifying the physical, ecological and biogeochemical 
              factors and processes which regulate the magnitude and  variability of these
              fluxes, and (3) placing these fluxes  into the context of the contemporary
              global carbon cycle.       This work is one of forty-four projects that are 
              collaborating in the Southern Ocean Experiment, a three-  year effort south of
              the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone to  track the flow of carbon through its
              organic and inorganic  pathways from the air-ocean interface through the entire
               water column into the bottom sediment.   The experiment  will make use of the
              RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer and the R/V  Thompson.       The objective of this
              component is to provide a  quantitative estimate of upper ocean export fluxes
              of  particulate organic carbon on spatial and temporal scales  relevant to
              understanding biological and physical  processes.  The approach is to measure
              the concentration of  thorium-234, a particle reactive tracer with a half-life
              of  24.1 days, and its ratio to particulate organic carbon  (POC) and
              particulate organic nitrogen (PON) in order to  derive the appropriate export
              data.       The research activities include the collection of  thorium-234 and
              POC samples on cruises spanning the  seasonal production cycle in the Antarctic
              Polar Front  Zone.  The results will be used to constrain the upper  ocean
              sinking fluxes and to derive relationships between  production and export
              across physical gradients (i.e.  fronts) during seasonal transitions between
              low and high  productivity.  The sensitivity of these rate estimates to  model
              assumptions and data quality will also be examined.  ***
