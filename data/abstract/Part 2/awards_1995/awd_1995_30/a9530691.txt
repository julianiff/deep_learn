              Abstract  ATM-9530691  Conway, Howard  University of Washington  Title:
              Relationships Between Climate and Glacier Variations in             Western
              North America    This award will support a study designed to establish what
              climate  information can be extracted from the glacial record on the west 
              coast of North America.  Glaciers contain a non-linear  transformation of past
              meteorological conditions and a systematic  comparison of the behavior of these
              glaciers has potential to  reveal considerable new information about past
              climate in the  region.  The Aleutian Low in the north Pacific has a steering 
              effect on storm tracks such that condition are dry in Washington  and wet in
              Alaska during years when the Pacific-North America index  is positive; there is
              a negative correlation between the mass  balance of Alaskan and Washington
              glaciers.  The intensity and  frequency of the Aleutian Low.  This study will
              improve  understanding of atmosphere-glacier processes.  Although many high 
              resolution meteorological observations are needed to accurately  model
              atmosphere-glacier processes over short (annual) time scales,  two or three
              variables should be sufficient to explain behavior  over longer (decadal) time
              scales.  Sensitivity studies will  explore glacier response to climate (both
              mass changes and  subsequent dynamic response) through physical models of
              decreasing  complexity and establish the simplest workable model that 
              accurately simulates behavior over decadal time scales.  The  objective is to
              reduce the dimensionality of the problem and build  a realistic module that can
              be linked to the output of a global  model.
