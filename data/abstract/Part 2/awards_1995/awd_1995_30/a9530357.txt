Abstract    :
              Abstract  CTS-9530357  Hunt, Melany L.    The PI proposes to study heat transfer
              and frictional heating in the flow of granular materials.  Two experimental
              apparati, one involving channel flow and the other treating annular flow, will
              be constructed to model these phenomena.  A discrete-element computer
              simulation will be used to track the trajectories of individual particles and
              their interactions.  Granular flow is important in the food processing
              industry, in the chemical industry, and in a variety of other applications,
              such as the flow of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and gunpowder.
