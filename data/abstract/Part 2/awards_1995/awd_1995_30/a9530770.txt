Abstract    :
                  Measurement of Stellar Parallaxes and Proper Motions.    Dr. Upgren will
              continue a program of high precision measurement  of parallaxes and proper
              motions of selected stars.  The results  of these measurements will be combined
              with broad-band photometry  for the study of young and old stars with low mass.
               Through this  program the physical properties of these types of stars will be 
              better calibrated.  ==============================================
