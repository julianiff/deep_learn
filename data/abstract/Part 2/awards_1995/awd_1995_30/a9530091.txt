Abstract    :
              This Research Planning Grant will be used to develop an algorithm to adapt
              broad-coverage AVHRR (Advance Very High Resolution Radiometer) satellite data
              to examine urban microclimatology, by connecting results from the more easily
              correctable but less available ATSR (Along Track Scanning Radiometer) data from
              the European Remote Sensing Satellite.  The correction will make use of the
              ATSR's dual-track viewing angle, which allows a correction of  temperature
              measurements by considering the absorption of infrared radiation by atmospheric
              water vapor, even with the emissivity variations of land sites.  By linking the
              more frequently captured AVHRR data to the ATSR data, the PI will be able to
              determine the proper algorithm needed to convert AVHRR data to surface
              temperatures.  This would allow the PI to propose a more accurate and
              wide-ranging study of the physical processes that yield the urban heat-island
              effect.    The proposed correction will be difficult to achieve.  If the PI can
              do it, this should allow the widely available AVHRR data to be used in a
              greater range of research applications.  The future work proposed by the
              investigator is on energy exchange in the atmosphere directly above urban
              areas.  This is itself important to the understanding of human-systems'
              influence on the physical environment as a direct measurement and because it
              affects our interpretation of more macro-scale measurements of temperature
              fluctuation.
