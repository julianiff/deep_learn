Abstract    :
              95-30749  Fomenkova    Dr. Fomenkova and her Co-Principal Investigator, Dr.
              Barbara  Jones, will carry  out a three-year project of infrared (IR) imaging
              and  spectroscopic  observations of comets during perihelion passage.  The 
              objective is to  determine (1) the physical characteristics of cometary  nuclei
              -- size,  rotation, surface properties, composition, and mechanisms of  coma
              formation,  (2) physical and chemical alterations of dust grains in the  inner
              coma, and  (3) the extent of heterogeneity of individual comet nuclei  and from
              one comet  nucleus to another.    One comet the investigators intend to study
              in detail is  comet O1 Hale-Bopp,  which is currently approaching the inner
              solar system and  will reach  perihelion in April 1997.    The observations
              will be carried out with the investigators'  imaging camera  mounted on the 1.5
              meter telescope at the Mt. Lemmon  Observatory and the new  Long Wavelength
              Spectrometer of the Keck telescope.  The Mt.  Lemmon  Observatory is jointly
              operated by the investigators' home  institution (the  University of California
              in San Diego) and the University of  Minnesota.  ***
