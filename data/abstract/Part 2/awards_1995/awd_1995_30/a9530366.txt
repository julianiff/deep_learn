Abstract    :
                        9530366      This award supports the research of Professor Klee in
              combinatorics.  During the proposed research period, the emphasis will be in an
              area that has in recent years been called "Computational Convexity".  It forms
              an interface that involves aspects of convex geometry, discrete mathematics,
              computer science, and operations research.  In essence, it is the study of the
              computational and algorithmic aspects of high-dimensional convex bodies,
              especially polytopes.      This research is in the general area of
              Combinatorics.  Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how
              discrete collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete
              systems is extremely important to modern communications.  For example, the
              design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the
              design of algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of objects,
              and this makes use of combinatorial research. In addition, the type of 
              enumerative information being sought in this project has been of use in the
              design of geometric algorithms for problems in robotics and motion planning.
