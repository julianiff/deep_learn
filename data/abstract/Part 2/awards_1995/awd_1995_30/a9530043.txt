Abstract    :
              9530043  Cargill    This small grant for exploratory research (SGER) supports a 
              study of strain and composition gradients associated with  electromigration in
              passivated polycrystalline aluminum - 5%  copper conductor lines. The objective
              is to apply a new  experimental approach to the long standing problem of 
              electromigration in order to improve understanding and test  theories
              concerning the origins, control, and consequences  of strain and composition
              distributions in polycrystalline  metallization structures undergoing
              electromigration. The  program integrates capillary optics with X-ray
              diffraction  apparatus and energy dispersive X-ray detection.  One of the 
              challenges in the work is to achieve the necessary spatial  resolution in
              microdiffraction measurements while having  sufficient incident X-ray flux to
              make accurate diffraction  measurements in a practical time period.  %%%  This
              research provides a demonstration of the approach  described above, and should
              permit the first direct ,  spatially resolved measurements of strain gradients
              during  electromigration in passivated conductor lines.  It should  advance
              scientific understanding and industrial design  practice.  ***
