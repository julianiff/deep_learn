Abstract    :
              9530160  Ryan    Ships from numerous agencies, oceanographic institutions, and 
              nations are mapping the ocean floor with sophisticated sonar. These  maps can
              be combined with other data such as rock type, animal  type, and hydrothermal
              vent locations to created new maps that are  extremely useful to scientists,
              teachers, and the business  community. This approach has been successful and
              offers even more  potential applications and broader distribution via the
              Internet.  The principal investigators intend to maintain the current database 
              and to add multibeam bathymetric data and gridded gravity data in  order to
              expand the usefulness and completeness of the database.
