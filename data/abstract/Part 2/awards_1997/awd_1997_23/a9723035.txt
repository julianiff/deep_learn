Abstract    :
                   Sehgal, Amita   IBN-9723035         Sleep-wake and other activity cycles,
              the maintenance  of body temperature, and the secretion of several hormones 
              are just a few examples of physiological processes that are  periodic and tied
              to the 24 hour daily cycle. The timing of  all these processes is determined by
              a master circadian (24  hour) clock within the body. The body clock is usually
              set  by the day:night cycle of light and dark. The clock is  genetically
              determined, and some of the genes that are part  of the clock have been
              identified. This project focuses on  one of these genes, the "timeless" gene,
              which was recently  isolated and shown to control a component of the body's 
              clock function. The protein made by the timeless gene is  destroyed by light,
              which is part of the mechanism by which  the body clock synchronizes to the
              day:night light cycle.  This project identifies the important parts of the
              timeless  protein and determines how they mediate the clock function's 
              sensitivity to light. These studies provide insight into the  mechanisms used
              by organisms to adapt to their environment,  and provide information important
              to understanding the basis  for daily rhythms in normal physiology, cognition,
              and  behavior.
