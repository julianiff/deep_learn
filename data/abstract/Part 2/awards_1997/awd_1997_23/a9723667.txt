Abstract    :
                      Lindsay   9723667    Following fertilization, the egg extracellular
              matrix is modified to prevent further sperm contact with the egg, thus
              maintaining the diploid state of the zygote. Using Xenopus laevis as a model
              system a block to polyspermy mechanism has been identified which involves the
              limited proteolysis of extracellular matrix (egg envelope) glycoproteins by
              proteases released from the activated egg. The known molecules involved are: 1)
              an envelope glycoprotein component which undergoes limited proteolysis at
              fertilization (gp69); 2) a chymotrypsin-like protease (ovochymase), which is
              localized to extracellular matrix fibers within the perivitelline space of the
              egg (the space between the plasma membrane and the overlying envelope); and 3)
              a trypsin-like protease released from the egg which activates ovochymase. In
              the last grant period, ovochymase and gp69 were cloned, the trypsin-like
              protease was purified, and it was revealed that ovochymase is not directly
              responsible for gp69 hydrolysis as originally hypothesized. Specific objectives
              for the proposed research are to: (1) Purify and characterize the egg protease
              directly responsible for gp69 hydrolysis; (2) Determine the role of ovochymase
              in the protease cascade; (3) Clone the trypsin-like protease for
              structure/function studies; (4) Immunolocalize the trypsin-like protease within
              the inactivated egg; and (5) Determine the function of gp69 hydrolysis in sperm
              binding and/or envelope hardening. The results of this study will provide an
              increased understanding of the regulation of sperm-egg interactions through
              proteolytic processing of the extracellular matrix, a mechanism which is
              fundamental to animal development.
