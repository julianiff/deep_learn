Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   Program 
              will assist the Department of Chemistry at Purdue University in   acquiring a
              CCD Detector System. This equipment will enhance research in   a number of
              areas including the following: (1) homogeneous arene   hydrogenation catalysts,
              (2) trinuclear nickel cluster electrocatalysts   for the reduction of carbon
              dioxide, (3) total synthesis of natural and   unnatural products, (4)
              pharmaceutical applications of a CCD detector on   a rotating anode, and (5)
              structural studies of zeolite inclusion   compounds    The X-ray diffractometer
              is used to make accurate and precise   measurements of the full three
              dimensional structure of a molecule. The   information obtained gives the
              precise values of all the bond distances   and bond angles of a given molecule
              and it gives accurate information   about the spatial arrangement of the
              molecule relative to the neighboring   molecules.
