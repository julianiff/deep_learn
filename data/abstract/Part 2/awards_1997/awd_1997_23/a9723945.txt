Abstract    :
              9723945  McCarty  In photosynthesis light energy is converted to chemical
              energy, much of it in the form that can be used as food.  The synthesis of
              adenosine 5?-triphosphate from adenosine 5?-diphosphate and inorganic phosphate
              is an essential reaction in photosynthesis.  This energy requiring reaction is
              catalyzed by a remarkable enzymatic machine, known as the ATP synthase.  This
              enzyme is an aggregate of nine different proteins and a total of about 20
              polypeptide chains.  Using biochemical and biophysical approaches as well as
              site-directed mutagenesis, the functions of the proteins in the chloroplast ATP
              synthase will be probed.  For example, the involvement of specific proteins in
              catalysis and in regulation of activity will be further defined.  Insights into
              the structure of the ATP synthase will also be obtained.  The ATP synthase is
              very stable, despite its complexity.  Noncovalent protein-protein interactions
              are responsible for this stability.  Which interactions among the proteins
              contribute most to the stabilization of the enzyme will be studied.    The
              proposed work has significance beyond reaching a further understanding of
              photosynthesis.  Mitochondria and the plasma membrane of some bacteria contain
              an ATP synthase that is similar to the chloroplast enzyme.  Thus, studies on
              the chloroplast ATP synthase are directly relevant to those on oxidative
              phosphorylation.  The investigation of the stability of the chloroplast ATP
              synthase also assumes importance in that it is an excellent model system for
              the study of protein-protein interactions.  Protein-protein interactions are
              fundamental to all of life?s processes.
