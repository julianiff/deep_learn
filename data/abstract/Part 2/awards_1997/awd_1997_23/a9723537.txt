Abstract    :
              Gilmour   9723537  A new approach for investigating the function of
              transcriptional activators in living cells will be developed. A collection of 6
              factors and RNA polymerase II compose the general machinery that is required
              for initiation of transcription but the activity of the general machinery is
              regulated by DNA sequence-specific binding proteins called activators. Genomic
              fingerprinting provides a way to monitor protein-DNA interactions in living
              cells and recently a new method using permanganate has been developed in this
              laboratory to monitor the interactions of TFIID and RNA polymerase II on
              promoters that have been transformed into Drosophila. Permanganate footprinting
              of a transformed promoter can be done in intact salivary glands that have been
              dissected from larvae, providing a true picture of an in vivo situation. The
              specific aims of this project are: 1) to use available fly stocks to determine
              if a GAL4 based approach can be used to investigate how an activator affects
              the promoter interactions of TFIID and RNA polymerase II in living cells 2)to
              determine how Gal4-VP16 and Gal4(10147) affect target promoters carrying
              various numbers of Gal4-binding sites 3) determine what changes occur in
              promoter interactions when the activator is switched on or off by using
              derivatives of the Tet-repressor.    New insights into determining mechanisms
              for the regulation of transcription in living cells will result from this work.
              Although tremendous progress has been made in the identification and
              biochemical characterization of factors involved in transcriptional regulation
              of gene expression, much of the work has been done using artificially contrived
              systems or by indirect analysis. The ability to analyze such interactions in
              living cells should be useful in obtaining a more complete understanding of how
              gene expression is regulated.
