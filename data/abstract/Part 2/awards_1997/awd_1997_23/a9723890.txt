Abstract    :
                    9723890  Sponsel  Originating from a population of ABA-insensitive mutant,
              mutagenesis has produced stem-length dwarf mutants that are unresponsive to
              gibberellins.  The work will characterize a group of mutants which are either
              rescued by external GA, or are unresponsive to external GA.  This work includes
              mutant complementation, gene cloning and characterization, and biochemical
              characterization of enzymes in the GA biosynthesis pathway which are indicated
              as potentially defective by the phenotypic behavior of the mutant plants.
