Abstract    :
                Postawko  9723927    This project continues work begun by Susan Postawko and
              Mark  Morissey  in 1994 with funding from the East Asia and  Pacific Program. 
              The simple goal of the project is to  gather rainfall data on the ground from
              multiple sites  throughout the Pacific island nations and territories.  This 
              unique data is made available to meteorologists and other  interested parties
              over the Worlwide Web and through  standard databases.  It has been used in
              several major  studies of global climate including NASA WETNET's  Precipitation
              Intercomparison Programs I and II.  Nearly all  the data is collected by
              students in all levels of education  across the Pacific. The program started
              with 25  participating schools and has grown to 145 schools at the  present
              time representing approximately 30% of the total  number of Pacific Island
              sites now reporting daily rainfall.  Therefore, this project is much more than
              a data-gathering  exercise.  It is a major pan-Pacific educational endeavor 
              which gives students across the Pacific an opportunity to  participate in
              scientific research.
