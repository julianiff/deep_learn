Abstract    :
                      9723333  Weeks  The primary goal of the research is to elucidate
              components and mechanisms of regulation of the carbon concentration mechanism
              in this alga. The work originates from the detection of gene CAH3 through
              genomic complementation of a high CO2-requiring mutant strain. Additional genes
              are being isolated following this screen. A C02-responsive promoter will be
              used to construct a gene cassette that allows screening for a selectable marker
              in another approach to defining mutants in the signal transduction chain
              leading from CO2 sensing to gene expression. These mutants will be
              characterized.
