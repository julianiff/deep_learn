Abstract    :
              IBN-9723798  PI:  Sorensen  Pheromones are molecular compounds that are detected
              as odors, but produce effects like hormones in stimulating particular
              reproductive behavior and physiological changes.  Some insect pheromones that
              act attract mates are well known, but we still do not have a case in any
              vertebrate species where we know the precise identity and behavioral correlates
              of a pheromone.  This project continues to develop the goldfish as the first
              vertebrate model system to specifically address this issue, because the
              goldfish shows responses to a preovulatory pheromone with at least three
              steroidal components.  Behavioral, and biochemical tests are used to identify
              all the goldfish pheromone components that are part of the natural mixture, the
              ability of the fish to distinguish among different mixtures, and whether the
              natural signal is species-specific.  Electrophysiological recordings also will
              test whether the pheromonal signal in the olfactory system has a distinct
              spatial or temporal pattern.  This model system will provide fundamental
              advances in our understanding the sensory mechanisms for distinct pheromone
              actions, and will have impact beyond sensory science to endocrinology,
              comparative physiology, and likely lead to applications in aquaculture.
