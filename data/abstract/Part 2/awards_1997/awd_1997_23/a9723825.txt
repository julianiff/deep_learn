Abstract    :
              9723825  Riggs  Technical  The project focuses on the hemoglobins (Hbs) of
              chicken and lamprey which exhibit a deoxygenation-dependent self association. 
              The PI seeks to determine by X-ray crystallography the conformational changes
              in chicken Hb that result in tetramer-tetramer dimers.  The oxygen equilibria
              of chicken and lamprey Hbs will be measured as a function of concentration, and
              the self association will be measured by light scattering and sedimentation
              equilibrium.  The self association of lamprey Hb will be studied with the aid
              of four mutants already constructed that will be used to test three different
              hypotheses concerning the nature of the interface responsible for self
              association. The Hb of the hummingbird will also be studied to determine
              whether the Hbs have evolved to have an enhanced supercooperativity to meet the
              extraordinary metabolic demands of hummingbird flight.    Non technical  The
              physiological function of proteins is often modulated by close interactions
              between proteins that form a complex.  Thus, complex formation alters the
              properties of the protein.  It is central to the understanding of this process
              that one determine the nature of the protein-protein interface responsible for
              the altered properties.  This will lead to an understanding of the
              extraordinary physiological adaptation that enables self-associating
              hemoglobins to deliver as much as 30% more oxygen to the tissues than would
              otherwise be possible.  This is an important adaptation in birds and in the
              primitive lamprey that greatly increases the quantity of oxygen that is
              delivered to the tissues.
