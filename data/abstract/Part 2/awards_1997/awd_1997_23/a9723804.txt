Abstract    :
                   A rapid technique for computing electrostatic  desolvation effects on the
              interactions between biological  molecules in a water environment is to be
              developed.  It is  based on a model in which the biomolecules are taken to be 
              low-dielectric objects containing atomic charges, the  surrounding water is
              assigned the bulk dielectric constant  of water, and the boundary between these
              two dielectrics is  determined by the atomic coordinates and radii of the 
              biomolecule.  The electric potential is then found by  solving the relevant
              equation of macroscopic eletrostatics,  typically the Poisson equation, using
              finite numerical  methods.  Models of this kind are much less computationally 
              expensive than simulations in which water molecules are  represented
              explicitly, and they have been used successfully  for calculating a variety of
              chemical and physical effects  in biomolecules, such as pKa shifts, solvation
              energy and  protein stability.
