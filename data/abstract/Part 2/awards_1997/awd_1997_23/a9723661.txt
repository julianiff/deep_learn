Abstract    :
              9723661  Golbeck.  The aim of this work is to understand the molecular
              mechanisms which lead to the high quantum yield and high thermodynamic
              efficiency of light-to-chemical free energy conversion in Type I (iron-sulfur)
              photosynthetic reaction centers.  To achieve this level of understanding about
              the intermediate electron acceptor A1, the ligands which bind the phylloquinone
              whether one or both of the phylloquinone pathways is utilized in electron
              transfer, and if it is possible to manipulate the amino acids so that quinones
              with altered redox potentials can be exchanged into the site, must be
              determined.  The issues regarding the mutants of FA and FB include using
              substituted aryl thiolates to modify the midpoint potentials of the iron-sulfur
              clusters, using thiolated viologen derivatives to function as kinetic probes of
              electron transfer, and using viologen derivatives with different tether lengths
              to investigate the effect of distance on electron transfer rate.  The work on
              the low molecular mass polypeptides PsaE through PsaM includes measurements of
              a possible electron transfer pathway through PsaE, and whether the PsaF, PsaI,
              PsaJ, PsaK or PsaM provide links for energy spillover from light absorbed by
              phycobilisomes.  The overall goal of this work is to study the structure,
              function and organization of the photosystem I reaction center in cyanobacteria
              and plants.  A combination of organic chemical synthesis, site-directed
              mutagenesis and spectroscopic characterization including time-resolved optical
              and EPR, will be employed to probe these issues.   ***
