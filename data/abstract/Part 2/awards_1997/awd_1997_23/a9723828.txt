Abstract    :
              9723828  Bagley  Low temperature infrared difference spectroscopy will be used
              to delineate the molecular mechanism of hydrogen binding and activation in
              hydrogenases.  Previous infrared spectroscopic studies on the  NiFe 
              hydrogenases have shown that this class of enzymes display anomalous, intense
              infrared bands arising from one intrinsic carbon monoxide molecule and two
              intrinsic cyanide molecules coordinated to the active site Fe ion.  These
              anomalous infrared signatures will be used for further study of the various
              redox states of the enzyme; for exploration of the nature of the similarities
              in the active sites of the  NiFe  and  Fe  hydrogenases as detected using
              infrared spectroscopy; determination of the nature of carbon monoxide binding
              in the  NiFe  and  Fe  hydrogenases; and examination of the role amino acids
              play in the activation of hydrogen.  The overall goal of this work is to
              understand the mechanism underlying the hydrogenases' ability to split
              molecular hydrogen into protons and electrons.  Understanding this process has
              important consequences for the development of cheap and stable catalysts for
              use in hydrogen production and fuel cells.  In addition, the development of
              methodologies for handling infrared samples under strictly anaerobic conditions
              as required in this research should prove of general utility in infrared
              studies of other oxygen sensitive metallo-proteins.  The research will involve
              participation of undergraduate students.  Participation in this project will
              afford undergraduate chemistry students a unique opportunity to apply skills
              and knowledge they have learned so far while contributing to a project in
              modern physical biochemistry.  ***
