Abstract    :
              Lay Abstract    PI: Currie, Scott  Proposal Number: IBN-9723973    Coordinated
              movements are characterized by precise temporal  sequences of  muscle
              activation, referred to as "motor patterns."  These  motor pattern  sequences
              are produced by networks of neurons (nerve cells),  called "central  pattern
              generators" (CPGs) in the central nervous system.  This project  examines the
              neuronal mechanisms that are utilized by a  spinal cord CPG  network to
              generate rhythmic and coordinated movements of  the  hindlimb.  The excitatory
              and inhibitory chemical  transmitters utilized within  this CPG will be
              investigated, as well as the intrinsic  cellular properties  of CPG neurons. 
              These experiments permit the investigation  of cellular  mechanisms
              contributing to the construction of complex,  coordinated limb  movements.  The
              mechanisms revealed will provide fundamental  information  about vertebrate
              spinal cord function, and may eventually  contribute to the  understanding of
              human movement disorders.
