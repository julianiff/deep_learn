Abstract    :
                Abstract for NSF proposal:  IBN - 9723871        A significant problem for
              biomedical research of nerve  tissue is the local stimulation of dendrites with
              bioactive  substances such as neurotransmitters.  The methods for  electrical
              stimulation that are commonly used  can only  reach electrically excitable
              membranes and cannot directly  activate the receptors of neurotransmitters.
              There exist  chemically inactivated and photolabile substances that allow  for
              adequate chemical stimulation. These so called caged  compounds can be
              activated by disruption of their molecular  cage with a flash of ultra-violet
              light. However, current  photolysis systems used for this purpose lack speed
              and/or  spatial accuracy.  Multisite photolysis with high spatio  temporal
              resolution of caged compounds would permit  experiments in isolated nerve
              tissue that closely resemble  the situation in the intact nervous system. This
              capability  would add a new dimension to neuroscience and related  biomedical
              fields.  It is proposed to develop an optical  stimulation system to locally
              release caged bioactive  compounds by means of a pulsed, scanning UV laser
              beam. This  novel system will make use of a scanning principle that  allows for
              ultrafast, accurate, and computer-controlled  random-positioning of laser
              beams. The proposed solution  will exceed the capability of previous photolysis
              systems in  its flexibility and spatio-temporal resolution by using 
              acousto-optical effects to control position and intensity of  the laser beam.
              With such devices, positioning and  modulation times are in the microsecond
              range, permitting  simultaneous multi-site release of caged compounds and thus 
              multi-site stimulation.
