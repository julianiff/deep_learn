Abstract    :
                PI: Steve Bressler    Visuomotor Control by Large-Scale Distributed Cortical 
              Networks    The aim of this research project is to understand how  different
              parts of the brain work together to allow us to  move based on what we see. 
              These scientists are designing  sophisticated computer analysis techniques to
              measure  properties of brain signals that occur when the brain must  interpret
              visual patterns and use the information to make a  movement.  Previous results
              from this project showed that  brain waves from many parts of the cerebral
              cortex,  including but not limited to visual and motor parts, briefly  become
              aligned when the brain is deciding how to respond to  a visual pattern. This
              suggests that the alignment of  wavelike signals from many parts of the cortex
              is important  for brain function.  The objectives of this project are: (1)  to
              observe how the normal brain processes visual input  signals and transforms
              them into motor command signals, and  (2) to advance our general understanding
              of similar large-  scale integration problems which arise in many engineering 
              applications.
