Abstract    :
              Cumming    9723393        Mycorrhizal fungi form a beneficial relationship with
              the  roots of trees, increasing the aluminum (Al) tolerance of  the tree hosts.
              However, little is known about the influence  of elevated A1 on ectomycorrhizal
              community and population  structure or the mechanistic basis of A1 tolerance in
              these  organisms. The proposed research will fill this void by: (i) 
              determining the extent to which soil Al influences  communities and populations
              of ectomycorrhizal fungi; and  (ii) elucidating mechanisms of Al tolerance in 
              ectomycorrhizal fungi. Reclaimed coal mine soils differing  in acidity and
              available A1 will be used in these  investigations. Population studies will
              assess species  richness as a function of soil A1. Genetic studies will 
              utilize DNA fingerprinting to analyze biodiversity in  populations from low and
              high A1 sites. Physiological  studies will investigate the operation of
              potential Al-  detoxification systems. Finally, the capacity of selected  fungi
              to confer A1 stress tolerance to Pinus strobes  seedlings will determined.
              Together, these studies will  indicate whether Al influences biodiversity in 
              ectomycorrhizal fungi and what physiological mechanisms are  selected for in
              acid soils. Isolation and identification of  genotypes tolerant of Al may
              provide an aid to the future  reforestation and reclamation of mined sites.
