Abstract    :
              Feder  9723298         A major issue in ecological and evolutionary physiology
              is  the relationship among the traits of complex organisms, organisms'  ability
              to exploit diverse environments, and species' persistence  in time. The
              proposed investigation examines the heat-shock  protein Hsp70 in Drosophila to
              address this issue. In response to  heat or other stresses, nearly all
              organisms express heat-shock  proteins (Hsps), highly-conserved proteins that
              contribute to  stress tolerance by functioning as molecular chaperones.
              Research  supported by a previous NSF award has established that  experimental
              manipulation of copy number of the hsp70 gene of  Drosophila, which encodes
              Hsp70, is sufficient to cause changes in  thermotolerance. The proposed
              research will build upon this  finding to examine three related issues whose
              simultaneous  resolution is possible in few other systems: (1) The
              physiological  mechanism of Hsp70 function; i.e., how thermal stress disrupts 
              function and how Hsp70 protects against heat damage or aids  recovery from it.
              This issue will be examined in the larval gut of  Drosophila, which is
              especially susceptible to heat damage. (2)  The fitness consequences of Hsp70
              expression, which will be  examined by comparing survival and offspring
              production when  Drosophila strains differing in Hsp70 expression are exposed
              to  natural thermal stress. (3) The evolutionary basis for variation  in Hsp70,
              which will be examined by measuring Hsp70 expression,  hsp70 copy number, and
              the temperature threshold for Hsp70  expression in natural and experimental
              populations. To accomplish  these goals, the proposed research will examine
              genetically  engineered and natural variation in Drosophila. The projected 
              outcome of the proposed research has immense potential to  integrate molecular,
              genetic, functional, and evolutionary  perspectives to advance understanding of
              adaptation.
