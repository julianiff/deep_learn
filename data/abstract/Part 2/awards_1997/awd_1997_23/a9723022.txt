Abstract    :
                The main focus of this project is to develop statistical  methods for mapping
              genes affecting polygenic and multi  factorial traits (referred to below as
              Quantitative Loci or  QTL) in large, complex pedigrees.  The project has three 
              interrelated objectives:  (i) We are expanding our QTL  mapping software to the
              analysis of multi-generational  pedigrees, to choice among models with
              different numbers of  QTL polymorphism, and to discontinuous but polygenic 
              (disease) phenotypes; (ii) we are comparing and providing  tolls for model
              checking and choice for Bayesian analysis of  Generalized Linear Mixed Models
              (GLMMs) in general and QTL  models in particular, as well as investigating
              alternative  sampling algorithms necessary to implement these methods,  and
              (iii) We are investigating strategies for the fine  mapping of QTL to enable
              positional cloning of important QTL  and to increase the efficiency of
              marker-assisted selection  in livestock.    The availability of mderate
              resolution maps in livestock an  high resolution maps in humans has created a
              substantial  demand for statistical methods and tools which make optimum  use
              of the available data and are capable of handling large,  complex pedigrees,
              unknown number of QTL, and unknown nature  of genetic variation at QTL. 
              Current  methods do not yet  have all of these capabilities.  However, the
              importance of  methods and software extends far beyond livestock.  They are 
              critical to understanding and mechanisms and evolution of  polygenic and
              multifactorial traits, designing more  effective breeding regimes for
              domesticated plants and  animals, and understanding and treating inherited
              human  diseases.  This work is supported by the Computational  Biology Activity
              and the Program Population Biology (Bio).
