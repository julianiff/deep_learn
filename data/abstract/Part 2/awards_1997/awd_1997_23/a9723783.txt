Abstract    :
              IBN-9723783  PI:  Hempleman  Specialized chemosensory cells in the walls of
              blood vessels leading to the head of terrestrial vertebrates form receptor
              organs called the carotid bodies.  These nerve cells respond when the oxygen
              content of the blood is too low, the condition called hypoxia.  Birds and
              mammals with high metabolic rates depend on successful reflexes to maintain
              high blood oxygenation, and these reflexes are particularly needed when
              adapting to high altitudes with low oxygen availability.  In mammals it is
              known that the cellular responses to hypoxia depend on a membrane channel for
              potassium ions.  In birds we know very little, although some high-flying birds
              function at altitudes where most vertebrates would be unconscious.  This
              project uses cellular electrophysiological techniques and calcium-sensitive
              dyes to investigate the chemotransduction mechanisms for blood oxygen in birds.
               Results will provide the first analysis of oxygen transduction mechanisms in
              non-mammalian carotid bodies, and will have an impact beyond sensory systems to
              evolutionary and comparative physiology, and to understanding environmental
              adaptations.
