Abstract    :
                        97-23778   Newman  EST sequences have provided the most immediate and
              versatile sequence information on expressed genes. The Arabidopsis EST sequence
              databank will be expanded through this work. In order to improve the impact of
              the sequence information in the 12,000 EST that are already available, the 3?
              ends of these clones will also be determined, thus providing information on
              gene copy numbers. In addition, novel transcripts will be obtained by selecting
              and screening of cell-, tissue-, and developmental stage-specific libraries. It
              is expected that an additional 5,000 unique sequences can be provided during
              the award period as a service to the community.
