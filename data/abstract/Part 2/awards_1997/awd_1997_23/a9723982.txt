Abstract    :
              9723982  Hirsch  In contrast to the Rhizobium-plant symbiosis which has been
              studied extensively, the association of mycorrhizal symbioses is less well
              known.  Mycorrhizae enable plants to colonize phosphorus-poor soils, are
              ubiquitous, and contribute significantly to plant productivity. The project
              originates from the recognition of VAM-fungi inducing the expression of genes
              in plants where these genes are also induced by Rhizobium. Alfalfa plants will
              be studied for their early responses to the VAM fungi. After inoculation, the
              infection process will be followed and the timing and expression pattern of
              several selected plant genes will be analyzed. It is proposed using the
              expression of early nodulin genes as molecular markers for developing a
              bioassay to detect the putative Myc-factor, i.e., a chemical signal that
              induces plant gene expression in VA-mycorrhizal roots, and is involved in
              establishing the symbiosis.
