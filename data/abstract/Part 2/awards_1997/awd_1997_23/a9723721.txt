Abstract    :
                  Abstract  9723721  Butler         Observations made in chickens, sheep,
              swine and cattle suggest  that many paradigms of B cell and antibody repertoire
              development  established in laboratory mice and humans are not applicable to 
              all species and in fact may be the exception rather than the  rule.  The
              proposed research will characterize the ontogeny of  the antibody producing
              cells in fetal piglets and determine how  these cell generate the antibody
              repertoire available to the  newborn piglet at birth through rearrangement and
              somatic  mutation of the genes which encode them.  A detailed analysis of  this
              developmental process in the fetal piglet model, will  provide valuable
              insights into this mechanism.  These studies  will broaden out knowledge of the
              development of the immune  system in higher vertebrates.  %%%      In order to
              respond to many different harmful agents to which an  organism is exposed,
              primates and rodents recombine genetic  components which  code for these
              different antibody molecules.  Other organism have developed different
              mechanism to generate a  large number of different antibodies, and in these
              studies fetal  piglets will be used to determine they system which the pig uses
               able to make these diverse antibodies.          ***
