Abstract    :
                9723489  Wang    This award supports the initiation of collaborative research 
              between Zhi-Qiang Wang, Utah State University, and Li  Shujie, Institute of
              Mathematics, Chinese Academy of  Sciences. The research concerns the
              development of new  methods in calculus of variations, critical point theory, 
              and Morse theory, and the application of these techniques to  nonlinear
              differential equations.  The project will bring  together two groups in
              nonlinear analysis to work on a  problem that requires the strengths of both
              groups to  address.    The Chinese co-PI has over forty research papers in
              relevant  areas, and is responsible for the initiation of the concept  of local
              linking, which is a powerful tool in critical point  theory to deal with
              multiplicity results. The US PI has  expertise in variational techniques and in
              the theory of  Morse. The complementary expertise of the two groups should 
              enable new insights into this field. Support on the Chinese  side will be
              provided by the Chinese National Natural  Science Foundation.
