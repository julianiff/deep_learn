Abstract    :
              9723360  Szauter      Meiosis is a complex cellular process common to all
              sexually reproducing eukaryotes. The first division of meiosis has two unique
              features: recombination and the reductional segregation of homologous
              chromosomes. These processes are related, in that chiasmata are the result of
              recombination and are required for proper chromosome segregation. They are held
              together by a structure called the synaptonemal complex  A mutation which
              eliminates recombination and synaptonemal complex assembly was found in
              Drosophila melanogaster and the chromosome region containing the mutation,
              c(3)G, was isolated. The gene will be localized within the cloned region and
              tested by complementation. When isolated, the gene will be sequenced. A working
              hypothesis, that c(3)G is a DNA repair gene, if confirmed will support the
              model which suggests that the formation of recombination intermediates is a
              prerequisite for synapsis in Drosophila.     Despite extensive studies of
              meiosis in Drosophila, the underlying mechanism(s) involved   is still not
              known. Drosophila has a life cycle more closely resembling those of other
              sexually reproducing multicellular eukaryotes than does yeast, (which is the
              other model organism for this process) and so information gained from this
              system may be more generally applicable to higher organisms.
