Abstract    :
              Chuong  9723889      The long term objective of this laboratory is to understand
              the molecular mechanism of pattern formation in embryonic development.  Along
              these lines, Dr. Chuong has been using feather morphogenesis as a model and
              studying its molecular mechanism.  In this pilot proposal,  he will focus on
              signals involved in periodic patterning of feather primordia.  He suggests that
              initial cell aggregates form randomly and are unstable.  Through a reaction
              diffusion mechanism, only some aggregates survive to become feather primordia. 
              The final number, size, and inter primordia space reaches an equilibrium
              regulated by positive and negative signals.  Preliminary data suggest that FGFs
              may be candidates of positive signals, while BMPs may be candidates  of
              negative signals.  Candidate molecules for these events will be tested using
              novel feather reconstitution procedures and retroviral infection.  The role of
              cell density on feather bud density, size and interbud spacing will be
              analyzed.  The corollary of the reaction diffusion mechanism is that the
              primary row and sequential propagation of feather primordia is not essential. 
              This will be tested using DiI labeling of feather primordia followed by
              dissociation and reconstitution.  The work will shed new light on the molecular
              basis and modeling of periodic pattern formation for feathers and other organs.
