Abstract    :
              Weigel    9723823    Complementary molecular and genetic approaches will be used
               to identify and characterize new components in floral induction in
              Arabidopsis. Floral induction is the transition to flowering which is
              controlled by a poorly understood process involving at least three major
              pathways: a long-day dependent pathway, a gibberellin (GA)-dependent pathway
              and an autonomous pathway. Specifically a putative GA-response element in the
              prometer of the LEAFY gene, a critical component of flower initiation in
              Arabidopsis will be identified and characterized; new signal transduction
              factors in the GA-dependent floral induction pathway will be identified; new
              genes affecting floral induction will be sought through a gain-of-function
              screen and at least two of the genes identified in that screen will be
              characterized. One gene has already been found and  characterized as a homolog
              of a known regulator of the LEAFY gene and that gene will be analyzed in
              detail.    The importance of flowers for human sustenance cannot be overstated.
              They are organs of plant reproduction and their immediate products are fruits
              and seeds, including cereal grains, which provide the majority of calories
              consumed by humans. Thus, an understanding of how plants regulate the formation
              of flowers is likely to have long-ranging practical applications.
