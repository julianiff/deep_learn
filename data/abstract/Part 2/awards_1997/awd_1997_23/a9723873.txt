Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the application of geographic  information science
              concepts and methods to the modeling and  analysis of genome data. The primary
              objective of the  research is to develop a data model for genomes that 
              supports the graphical exploration of the higher order  spatial arrangement of
              genome features through spatial  queries and spatial data analysis tools. The
              spatial genome  model formalizes topological and order relationships among 
              genome features (before, after, overlap), uses metric  properties to refine
              spatial topologies, and includes  representations of features that have
              uncertain metric  properties. The genome spatial model enhances the 
              integrative and comparative potential of genome data by  providing the
              foundation for more powerful spatial reasoning  and inferences than can be
              achieved by data models that  incorporate only a small subset of possible
              temporal-spatial  relationships among genome features (e.g. order and 
              distance). The research represents a logical extension from  current "feature
              by feature" analytical approaches of genome  studies to one that allows
              biologists to ask questions about  the contextual and organizational
              significance of the  spatial arrangement of genome features. These functional 
              capabilities should, in turn, aid in the automation of  repetitive analytical
              tasks associated with the mapping of  genome features and drive the discovery
              of biologically  significant aspects of genome organization and function.
