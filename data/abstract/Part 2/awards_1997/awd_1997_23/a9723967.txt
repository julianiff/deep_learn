Abstract    :
              IBN-9723967  PI:  Swadlow     The undisputed role of the cerebral cortex in
              perception, action and higher cognitive processes has led to an intense effort
              to understand the functional properties of this tissue.  Major goals of this
              effort have been to understand the mechanisms whereby individual cortical
              neurons obtain their unique repertoire of response properties and how ensembles
              of cortical neurons interact to produce global perceptual and behavioral
              capabilities.  The proposed research is aimed at understanding the mechanisms
              governing cortical function in the intact, awake thalamocortical somatosensory
              system.  This work is aimed at understanding the transformations performed upon
              inputs to the cortex by the intracortical circuitry, the role of inhibitory
              interneurons in producing these transformations, and how these transformations
              lead to parallel and distinct efferent outflows.  The activity of
              thalamo-cortical projection neurons, cortico-cortical and corticofugal efferent
              neurons and putative inhibitory interneurons will be simultaneously recorded,
              and inferences of connectivity derived from these methods will be further
              tested using microstimulation of presumptive presynaptic elements.  Special
              emphasis will be placed on elucidating rules governing the strength and
              specificity of functional connections among the populations of thalamocortical
              and cortical neurons under study.     The data obtained from these experiments
              will offer a unique view of the physiology of individual cortical neurons
              studied under natural conditions, and will provide insight  into interactive
              networks of cortical neurons and their varied functional properties.
