Abstract    :
              Lay Abstract    PI: Kleinhaus, Anna  Proposal Number: IBN-9723137    This
              project examines the neural mechanisms underlying  feeding behavior as a model
              for examining how the nervous  system switches between behaviors in an
              adaptive, goal-  directed fashion. Feeding in most organisms includes an 
              appetitive phase and a comsumatory phase. The appetitive  phase includes
              detection of food and arousal, followed by  directed locomotion. This aspect of
              the behavior is  dependent upon the integration of signals from multiple 
              sensory systems that provide information about the external  environment. The
              consumatory phase consists of ingestion of  the meal. This aspect of the
              behavior is generated by the  orderly activity of interconnected neurons the
              activity of  which yields the coordinated activity of muscles. This  project
              identifies the individual neurons responsible for  these behaviors and way they
              are connected to generate the  behaviors associated with different phases of
              feeding.  Experiments determine whether the same neurons are involved  in both
              aspects of feeding or whether there are separate  neurons for each phase. The
              project furthers the  understanding of the way that the nervous system uses and
               adapts neurons to different functional roles and switches  from one class of
              activity to another as complex behavior  unfolds.
