Abstract    :
                    9723573  McIntosh  Plant mitochondria have two terminal oxidases,
              cytochrome oxidase and the alternative oxidase and a choice of pathways for
              energy flow.  Alternative oxidase is encoded by a small nuclear gene family and
              appears to link mitochondrial energy balance and biosynthetic carbon
              metabolism, especially under stress condition.  The goals of this study are to
              investigate nuclear/mitochondrial communication in plants using synthesis and
              activation of the alternative oxidase, and to investigate carbon/energy balance
              function of the alternative pathway respiration employing transgenic plants. 
              The goal will be approached using genetic, molecular, biochemical and
              physiological analysis of plants in which the alternative oxidase is altered
              and in in-vitro assays.
