Abstract    :
              IBN-9723562  PI:  Saidel     Some animals live at the interface between the two
              different environments of air and water and demonstrate sensory specializations
              for detecting signals from the two environments.  One such example is a fish
              that lives just below the water surface and feeds at the surface, while needing
              to escape predators (such as birds) that strike from above the surface.  This
              project investigates how different objects above the fish may be lead to
              behaviors of feeding or of escape, depending on size, motion, and presence in
              the visual field of both eyes.  Videotaping of behavioral responses to diverse
              targets will be used to characterize the features important to these opposite
              responses.  Anatomical studies suggest that this fish has an unusual visual
              pathway connecting to a special visual center in the brain, and this work will
              examine the details of connections of this visual pathway from and to other
              visual centers.     This integrated multi-disciplinary approach to a novel
              visual system will have impact on our understanding how brain structure is
              related to behavior, and by being in the category of Research at Undergraduate
              Institutions it will have a substantial impact on getting undergraduates
              interested and trained in high-quality research in neuroscience.
