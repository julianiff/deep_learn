              Lay Abstract    PI:  Trimmer, Barry A.  Proposal Number: IBN-9723507    The
              objective of this research is to understand how reflex  movements are modified
              and adapted for different tasks so  that they are appropriate for different
              behaviors. Detailed  analysis of movement is combined with electrical
              recordings  from muscles both before and after different training  regimes.
              Once the changes are described, the central nervous  system mechanisms that
              mediate these changes are  investigated by recording the electrical activity of
               individual nerve cells and by manipulating the chemical  receptors on those
              nerve cells during behavioral training  and during sensory stimulation. This
              research links adaptive  changes in behavior with the cellular mechanisms
              underlying  learning and plasticity. Its results contribute to  understanding
              how basic rhythmic movements, such as those  involved in walking, are modified
              as a result of experience  so that the behavior can be appropriately expressed
              in a  variety of situations and challenges.
