Abstract    :
                    9723172     Bender  The work will study tryptophan biosynthesis in
              Arabidopsis.  Genes for this pathway are induced by starvation, wounding,
              pathogen attack and this results in the increased production of the amino acid
              and, eventually, secondary metabolites which are important to adjusting
              development or preventing damage by pathogens. The goal of the work is to
              characterize the molecular factors that control tryptophan gene expression.
              Most experiments will focus on regulation of the first gene/ enzyme in the
              pathway, ASA1. Mutants (ATR) that affect ASA1 expression have been isolated
              which will be characterized in an attempt to identify regulatory genetic loci.
              Other experiments will use biochemical techniques and transgenic reporter gene
              expression for the study of transcriptional and translational control. The
              characterization of ATR1 will elucidate the role of this factor in connecting
              environmental signals with control of tryptophan gene expression.
