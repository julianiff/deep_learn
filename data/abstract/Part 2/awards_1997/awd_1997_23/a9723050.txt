Abstract    :
                                                   Rees    9723050    Conditions of low oxygen
              (hypoxia) in fresh, brackish and marine  waters are brought about by both
              natural processes and human  activity. Since many important metabolic processes
              require  oxygen, a decrease in oxygen availability is a potentially 
              life-threatening situation for the organisms that live in these  environments.
              One way to compensate for a decrease in oxygen is  to shift to metabolic
              pathways that do not require oxygen. This  research will evaluate this response
              in a common inhabitant of  coastal estuaries, the Gulf killifish, Fundulus
              grandis. The  activities of enzymes (the protein molecules that catalyze the 
              reactions of metabolism) will be determined in fish exposed to  hypoxia in the
              laboratory. These measurements will show whether  these enzymes change in a
              manner that reflects an increased  reliance upon oxygen-independent metabolic
              pathways. If the  initial phase of this work shows a change in enzyme activity,
               then the later phase will investigate the mechanism of this  change. This
              research will lead to a better understanding of how  this species, and
              potentially other, commercially important  species, respond to environmental
              hypoxia.
