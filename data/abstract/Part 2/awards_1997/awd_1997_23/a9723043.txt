Abstract    :
              Fadem  9723043         Sex differences in reproductive behavior in mammals are 
              determined not only by the genes and by hormones produced in  adulthood, but
              also by steroid hormones secreted by the  gonads during perinatal development. 
              Although it is known  that testicular androgens play an important role during 
              perinatal development, androgens are metabolized into  estrogens within
              specific brain cells.  Determining whether  an androgen or its estrogenic
              metabolite is the  differentiating hormone is complicated since placental 
              mammalian fetuses have systems which actually "protect" them  from maternal
              estrogen.  Thus, getting estrogen to the fetus  and quantifying the amount of
              estrogen acting on the fetus  is extremely important yet almost impossible to
              achieve.  Dr. Fadem has developed a marsupial model to examine the  role of
              estrogen.  The newborns are born at a developmental  stage equivalent to that
              of a 13-day fetal rat or 8-week  human embryo.  Because the newborn marsupial
              is essentially  an external fetus, studies utilizing marsupials can give 
              unique information about the effects of hormones on  reproductive development. 
              Dr. Fadem will modulate the  hormonal environment of the newborns and then
              assess the  effects on behavior, morphology and physiology in adulthood.  The
              results from these studies will contribute to a better  understanding of
              various human birth disorders that result  from insufficient or excess steroid
              hormone exposure during  development.
