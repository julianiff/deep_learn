Abstract    :
              Kim, Sung-Hou  9723352         The goal of this research is to develop a
              computational  method for predicting the folding class for any protein 
              sequence without a clearly identified function or  significant homology  to
              known sequences.  This approach  would provide an alternative and complementary
              scheme to  sequence homology based methods for a solution to the  inverse
              protein folding problem.  This computational method  will be used on a large
              scale as automatic software of high  accuracy for the prediction of the folding
              class for new  genomic sequences, generated by human and microbial genome 
              projects.
