Abstract    :
              Garland  9723758              The proposed research will test hypotheses
              concerning the  morphological and physiological determinants of interspecific 
              variation in locomotor performance of lizards. This will  constitute one of the
              first integrative, multilevel studies of  locomotor abilities in any group of
              animals. It will provide  unique information concerning the mechanisms
              underlying the  origin of biological diversity in performance abilities. It may
               also provide important clues as to how adaptation can overcome  potential
              morphological and physiological constraints. Because  the lizards to be studied
              are fairly generalized in their  locomotor modes, the results will also provide
              an important  baseline for future investigations of other tetrapod groups.     
               Members of the North American family Phrynosomatidae will be  emphasized
              because this group is readily accessible and exhibits  a remarkable diversity
              of ecology, behavior, locomotor abilities,  and morphology. Endurance running
              capacity will be measured on a  motorized treadmill. Maximal sprint running
              speed will be  measured both on a photocell-timed racetrack, an established 
              method, and on a high speed treadmill. A range of traits that  probably affect
              speed, endurance, or both will be studied for  approximately 19 species of
              Phrynosomatidae and 11 outgroup  species, including body size, fimb and tail
              proportions, body  temperature, and muscle fiber type composition.
