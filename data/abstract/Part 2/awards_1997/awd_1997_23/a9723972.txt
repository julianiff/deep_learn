Abstract    :
              ***  9723972  Adami  A new multipurpose "artificial life" software system will
              be  developed, to model several aspects of evolution in simple  systems in
              "computational evolutionary biology".  This will  include studies of molecular
              evolution near the error  threshold, and the "directed mutation" hypothesis. 
              The  results of the computer studies can be compared with the  evolutionary
              processes observed in simple biological systems  involving strains of E.Coli.
