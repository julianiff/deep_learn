Abstract    :
              97-23171     Sun  Gibberellins are a large family of diterpenoid compounds, many
              of which are growth regulators in plants which affect diverse developmental
              processes, such as germination, stem elongation, leaf expansion, or flower and
              fruit or seed development. The proposed work focuses on the perception of
              gibberellins by cells and the signal transduction pathway that leads to the
              known responses of the hormone resulting in changes in gene expression and the
              developmental and physiological reactions that are well described. Little, in
              contrast, is known about gibberellin perception and signaling. The proposed
              will characterize the gene, RGA, which very likely encodes a gibberellin
              receptor, and study mutants in Arabidopsis which are defective in different
              aspects of gibberellin signal transduction.  The work includes genetic
              analysis, gene cloning and the traditional techniques for characterizations of
              genes, cell-specificity of expression and, finally, biochemical analyses for a
              functional description of genes. While the work is principally designed for
              obtaining an understanding of hormone signaling, the application aspects of the
              work for crop improvement, for example, are considerable.
