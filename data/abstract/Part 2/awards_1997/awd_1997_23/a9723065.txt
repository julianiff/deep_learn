Abstract    :
                                   Boily  9723065    The basal metabolic rate is the energy
              expenditure of adult  animals while fasting and resting at a comfortable
              temperature.  It's a very important physiological variable because of its 
              large (3080%) component of average daily metabolic rates (total  daily energy
              expenditure of an animal). Yet, the adaptive  significance (how it affects
              survival and fitness) of variations  in basal metabolic rates that naturally
              occur in animal  populations is unclear. One hypothesis suggests that
              variations  in basal metabolic rates reflect a balance between two 
              evolutionary forces: one to increase basal metabolic rates to  favor a high
              maximum metabolic rate (critical for athletic  performance), the other to lower
              basal metabolic rates for  energy conservation. In this project, we will obtain
               measurements of basal, maximal and average daily metabolic rates  in wild
              armadillos to test this hypothesis. Armadillos are  perfect animals for this
              study because females always give birth  to genetically identical quadruplets,
              which will simplify our  investigation of the genetic component of metabolic
              variations.  While this research is mainly aimed at investigating basic 
              biological principles, it also has potential applications in  wildlife
              management (population energy budgets), conservation  biology ("value" of
              biodiversity), and nutrition science  (control of energy expenditure in humans
              and domestic animals).
