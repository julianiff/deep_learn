Abstract    :
              9723469  Bryant  The cyanobacterial Photosystem I reaction center is a
              light-driven oxidoreductase catalyzing the transfer of electrons from reduced
              cytochrome c553 (or plastocyanin) to oxidized ferredoxin (or flavodoxin).  The
              long-term goal of this research program is to understand the biogenesis of this
              complex enzyme, as well as the structural and mechanistic details that allow it
              to catalyze the above mentioned reaction with a quantum yield approaching 1.0
              and a very high thermodynamic efficiency (~45%). Taking  advantage of knowledge
              gained during the prior funding period, powerful methods of site-directed
              mutagenesis, protein overproduction, biochemical resolution and reconstitution,
              chemical rescue and modification, and kinetic optical and EPR spectroscopies
              will be used to produce and analyze PS I reaction centers with novel
              properties.      Photosynthesis in plants, algae and cyanobacteria is the major
              source of biological energy and oxygen on the earth. The investigator's work
              will increase the knowledge of photosynthesis and will provide information that
              can potentially be used for genetic manipulation of photosynthesis in crop
              plants
