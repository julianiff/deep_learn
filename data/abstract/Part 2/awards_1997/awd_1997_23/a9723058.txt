Abstract    :
              9723058  Sheridan    Somatostatins are a relatively diverse family of peptide
              hormones known to affect a wide array of biological processes, including
              growth, development, and metabolism.  Despite the significance of the group of
              hormones, little is known about their evolution or about the mechanisms which
              control the genes that encode them.  With this project, the PI will use a
              simple model system, rainbow trout, to examine fundamental aspects of
              somatostatin gene expression.  He will provide for the first time a definitive
              analysis of the polygenic origin of somatostatins.  He will characterize the
              expression of alternate forms of somatostatins and investigate how somatostatin
              gene expression is controlled by various environmental and endogenous (i.e.,
              other hormones such as insulin) factors.  While this research pertains
              specifically to fish, it will provide important new insight into the evolution
              of the somatostatin gene family and yield novel information with board
              relevance to the understanding of somatostatin-mediated control of growth,
              development, and metabolism.
