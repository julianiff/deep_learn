Abstract    :
              9723060  Tummala    This award is for partial funding to establish two complete
              advanced packaging system prototype facilities at the Engineering Research
              Center for Packaging Research at the Georgia Institute of Technology.  The
              facilities are being used in research aimed at exploring the limits of
              packaging technologies in design, test, materials, and processing.  The
              facility will expose students to product development methodologies. 
              Undergraduate and graduate students will work in teams with faculty and
              industry to explore next generation prototypes from concept to design, to
              development, to testing, to operation of a system.  The cost of the facilities
              are shared by the State of Georgia and industry.    Engineering Research
              Centers normally involve studies in research that involves proof-of- concept
              testbeds.  This facility will be the first of its kind in an Engineering
              Research Center and in a university where the students will have the potential
              to go beyond proof-of-concept testbeds, to prototype production through a
              systems-level engineering project.  This extends their education from study of
              concepts to include the effects of manufacturing constraints on their results.
