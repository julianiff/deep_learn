              9723595  Title:         Hierarchical Parallel Algorithms for  Simulating Plant
              Response to            Environmental Stress    Physiologically-based process
              models are powerful tools for  assessing plant responses to multiple
              environmental  stresses.  They capture the intricate behavior of systems 
              governed by non-linear feedbacks, hierarchical constraints,  and interacting
              environmental factors.  Devising efficient  algorithms for simulating systems
              defined by thousands of  individual elements, however, is a formidable
              challenge to  computational biology.  The investigators are developing a 
              series of parallel algorithms for managing multiple  computational streams to
              simulate growth of leaves, stems,  and roots over a multi-computer network. 
              Using the inherent  hierarchical nature of plant systems, concurrent 
              physiological processes logically nested within the three-  dimensional
              architecture of shoot and root systems.
