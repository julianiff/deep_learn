Abstract    :
              9723602  Stillman  The meeting on Eukaryotic DNA Replication will be the 6th
              meeting held on this subject and follows the highly successful meetings that
              were held in September 1987, 1989, 1991, 1993 and 1995. The meeting will be
              devoted to fundamental research topics related to chromosome duplication,
              structure and function, and will include important areas of biological research
              in the areas of cell cycle and growth control, DNA replication,
              replication-associated gene regulation, genome amplification, drug resistance
              and cancer research. The need for this meeting is evidenced by the rapid
              advances made in this field over recent years. The meeting will ensure that
              recent results will be communicated and discussed in an atmosphere of
              face-to-face contact, which should enhance progress. The participation of
              younger investigators and women scientists will be encouraged.  The areas to be
              covered by the 1997 meeting will include studies on (1) the replication of
              virus chromosomes, including SV40, polyomavirus, cytomegalovirus, herpesvirus,
              papillomaviruses, Epstein-Barr virus; (2) chromosomal replication and gene
              amplification in organisms as diverse as yeast, Drosophila, Xenopus and
              mammalian cells; (3) control of DNA replication; (4) structure and function of
              chromosomal elements such as telomeres; and (4) control of cell cycle
              progression and S phase specific gene expression.  ***
