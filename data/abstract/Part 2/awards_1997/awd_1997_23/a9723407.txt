Abstract    :
                                                           This two-day training workshop,
              "Data and Information       Management in the Ecological Sciences," will
              address       environmental information management challenges identified by    
                research scientists of the Ecological Society of America and the      
              Organization of Biological Field Stations (OBFS). The workshop       will be
              held in conjunction with the 1997 annual meeting of the       Ecological
              Society of America in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The       workshop is endorsed
              by ESA's Long-Term Studies Section, OBFS,       and the National Center for
              Ecological Analysis and Synthesis,       and will be additionally supported
              (logistics) by the Long-Term       Ecological Research Network Office at the
              University of New       Mexico.              Workshop participants include
              directors of field stations       and marine laboratories or their appointed
              representatives,       individuals or organizations engaged in long-term
              ecological       studies, and individuals directly involved in the management
              of       ecological data and information. Workshop objectives are to      
              introduce attendees to data and information management concepts,      
              protocols, and relevant technology. Specific topics include:       hardware,
              software, communication and networking strategies,       data entry, quality
              assurance/quality control, scientific       databases, metadata, data archival,
              World Wide Web, site       implementation strategies, managing climate data,
              data analysis       and scientific visualization tools, as well as a series of 
                   roundtable discussions of related issues. In addition to       seminars
              and hands-on training at the workshop, relevant       materials and workshop
              proceedings will be collated and       "published" via the World Wide Web to
              ensure broad dissemination       of information.  In addition, all
              organizational, agenda, paper       abstract information, etc. will be on the
              WWW by the time of the       workshop, August 8, 1997.  See www.lternet.edu for
