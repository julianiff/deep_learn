Abstract    :
                  PI:  Schneider, J.  IBN-9723938  Many people overeat and gain too much
              weight, while other people eat too little and experience serious problems such
              as malnutrition and infertility.  Leptin is a newly discovered protein that is
              naturally made and secreted by body fat cells, and is thought to play a role in
              the regulation of eating, body weight and fertility.  This proposal is designed
              to understand how leptin influences eating, body weight and reproduction.  We
              will study Syrian hamsters because, unlike other animals, they have a reliable,
              4-day ovulatory (estrous) cycle that is very sensitive to leptin treatment, a
              short period of fasting, and increased exercise.  We will look for clues as to
              where in the body and by what mechanism leptin affects body weight, eating and
              estrous cycles.  For example, in order to find where leptin acts, we will
              compare the effects of  leptin injected into the body to effects when leptin
              treatment is restricted to a small area of the brain.  Some of the effects we
              will examine will be body weight, food intake and length of the estrous cycle. 
              We will also treat hamsters with  leptin and determine which parts of the brain
              become active.  In addition, we will determine whether particular parts of the
              brain are critical for leptin's effects by examining the effects of  leptin in
              hamsters with small lesions of these exact brain areas.  Knowledge of leptin's
              mechanism and site of action may provide important clues to how body weight,
              eating and fertility are regulated as well as how to treat obesity or anorexia
              nervosa.  This work may have more general importance for understanding a
              variety of behavioral problems that involve effects of metabolism on the
              nervous system.
