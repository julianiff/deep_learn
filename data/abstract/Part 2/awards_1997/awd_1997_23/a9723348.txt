                Lay Abstract  PI:  Caron Dean-Bernhoft, Ph.D. Proposal Number:  IBN-9723348 
              The changes that take place in the heart and  blood vessels to maintain blood
              pressure under a  number of conditions are different, since the  requirements
              of the body are not always the  same.  For example, during confrontations,
              heart  rate and blood flow to the active muscles must  go up but blood flow to
              the kidney can be  reduced.  On the other hand, when it gets cold,  blood flow
              to the skin decreases while flow to  internal organs increases to retain heat. 
              These  types of changes in heart rate and blood flow  are regulated by a
              specific part of the brain  called the RVLM.  This study examines how these 
              nerve cells of the RVLM coordinate nerve  activity to regulate the
              cardiovascular system  during different behavioral states.  Particular 
              attention is paid to the characteristics of the  chemical substances released
              from cells in this  area that modulate the activity of this center,  and thus
              change the pattern of cardiovascular  activity. The results from this study
              contribute  to understanding how blood flow and blood  pressure are adjusted to
              meet the needs of the  body under different or emergency situations.  Such
              information is fundamental to a deeper  understanding of how blood pressure is 
              controlled.
