Abstract    :
              Lay Abstract    PI: Siwicki, Kathleen K.  Proposal Number: IBN-9723920    From
              our own sleep-wake cycle to the chirping of crickets on  summer evenings,
              examples of circadian (daily) rhythms in  behavior are abundant in nature.
              These rhythms are driven by  internal biological clocks in the nervous system
              that are  synchronized with the daily cycles of light and temperature  in the
              environment. In the past decade, researchers have  deciphered the basic
              mechanism by which biological clocks  keep time: the clock's central gears are
              genes that turn on  and off every day. While rhythmic behaviors and clock genes
               have been identified in a variety of organisms, the cellular  mechanisms by
              which clock genes produce their behavioral  effects are relatively obscure.
              This project examines the  mechanisms by which clock genes act within cells and
              tissues  to produce circadian rhythms of behavior. Experiments allow  for
              direct studies of cells regulating rhythmic behavior and  how the properties of
              those cells are regulated by the clock  genes within them. These studies
              represent a significant  step towards understanding the physiological
              mechanisms by  which clock genes and the cells that express them can  interact
              to generate circadian rhythms in behavior.
