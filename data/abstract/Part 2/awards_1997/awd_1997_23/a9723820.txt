Abstract    :
                9711872   Smyth    This project will study the effects of wave saturation in
              governing the form and evolution of the Equatorial Undercurrent.  Specifically,
              it will 1) apply linear stability analyses to identify the factors that govern
              the wave radiation; 2) use the linear results to define length scales for use
              in the LES; 3) improve the resolution and test of LES; and 4) use the LES model
              to evaluate the wave-mean flow interactions in maintaining the EUC.
