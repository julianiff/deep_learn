Abstract    :
              IBN:  9723978  PI:  Greer  The chemical senses include not only smell and taste,
              but some other chemical senses (the 'burning' or 'coolness' of spices such as
              pepper or mint, and the 'tingle' of carbonation).  The International Symposium
              on Smell and Taste (ISOT) meets only once every four years, for nearly a week,
              bringing together researchers from all over the world to discuss current
              research results and plan future projects and collaborations.  Partial support
              for this conference will help defray travel expenses for some of the invited
              speakers, and for an outreach program to involve the local San Diego area
              schools in workshops that will lead to more understanding chemosensory science.
               The symposium proceedings will become a published volume. Given past history,
              some aspects of this conference will be important to fields beyond chemosensory
              work alone, and these symposia will have an impact on the field for years to
              come.
