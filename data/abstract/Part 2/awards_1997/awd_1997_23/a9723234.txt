Abstract    :
              9723234  Baskin    This award is in partial support of the 16th Annual Missouri
              Symposium,  entitled "Signs   and Roadways: Protein Traffic and the
              Cytoskeleton," April 16-19, 1997 on the campus of   the University of Missouri,
              Columbia MO.   The purpose of the Symposium is to bring   together plant cell
              biologists working in the separate areas of plant cytoskeleton and plant  
              intracellular membrane compartmentation.  Although the scientists working in
              these areas   generally meet separately to share information, these two areas
              of cell biology are   conceptually related, since they both deal with how
              things move from one place to another   within the cell, and they are beginning
              to converge as the role of the cytoskeleton in   intracellular membrane
              trafficking is beginning to become appreciated.   Thus, bringing   these two
              groups together is a good and timely idea, and it is anticipated that they will
                learn from and interact with each other and thereby enrich each field.  ***
