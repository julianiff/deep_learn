Abstract    :
              Thomas  9723770      Marine  invertebrates often spawn eggs directly into the
              water  column  exposing  the eggs to extremes of physical stress. The proposed
              research  will  explore how egg characteristics modulate the negative  effects 
              of  physical   stress   on  reproduction.  This  research   will   integrate 
              biomechanics,  electron microscopy, and a phylogenetic  analyses.  Three 
              primary hypotheses will be addressed: ( 1 ) egg properties do not affect 
              diffusion/dilution  rates of eggs; (2) egg properties  do  not  increase 
              survival  of  eggs  after spawning; (3) there is no causal  relationship 
              between  gamete  properties  and physical  stress.  This  research  will 
              examine a little examined constraint on the reproductive success  of  an 
              economically important group of invertebrates, the echinoids.    Understanding
              the factors that influence production of embryos, in  this  group, is
              fundamental to developing appropriate life history models  and  fisheries
              management plans.
