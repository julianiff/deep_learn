Abstract    :
              9723815  Abut                                      This is a 24-month award
              proposed by Dr. Huseyin Abut, San  Diego State University, collaborating with
              Dr. Abdul Rahim  Layman, the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. 
              Dr. Abut request funds for travel, supplies and student  support to carry out a
              cooperative project with his  counterpart at the Singapore Nanyang
              Technological  University to study the use of higher-order statistics to  find
              an optimal way to  prescribe radiation dosage for tumor  regions without
              exceeding the radiation tolerance of  surrounding normal tissues and radiation
              sensitive organs.  Dr. Abut and his Singapore counterpart are competent, 
              experienced and  respected in this field.  This study  addresses a practical
              question of using a statistical method  for optimal signal and image processing
              analysis.  The  result of this analysis could have great potential for 
              contributing to the development of  an improved application  of radiation
              therapy for cancer treatment.  The proposed  project combines theory, algorithm
              development and testing,  and application to real data and  provides an
              excellent  opportunity for a graduate student to learn image processing  and
              medical imaging.
