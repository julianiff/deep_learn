Abstract    :
              9723527  Casagrand    This  research will yield new information on the  ways 
              that  nerve  cells of the brain determine the location  of  sounds  from the
              information provided by sound receptor cells in the  ears.  This  study will
              use an animal model,  the  auditory-  evoked  escape  response  of  the 
              goldfish  to  study  this  problem.  The studies will evaluate the auditory 
              activation  of  the  large reticulospinal neurons called Mauthner cells,  which
                 previously    have   been   important    in    many  neurophysiological 
              studies.  Reticulospinal   neurons   are  crucial  for producing coordinated
              locomotor behavior,  such  as  walking  and  orientation in all vertebrates, 
              including  humans.  Yet,  little  is  known about  the  nature  of  the 
              acoustic  inputs  which provide one of the most  influential  excitatory 
              inputs  to  these neurons. Recent  technological  advances  now  make  feasible
              studies of these  inputs.  The  proposed  work  will  analyze how  acoustic 
              information  is  transmitted to, and processed by, the Mauthner neurons.  The 
              experiments  will:  1) Characterize the  types  of  acoustic  (pressure  and
              acceleration) inputs to the Mauthner  neuron;  2) Localize the site(s) of
              connections between the afferents  and    the    Mauthner   neuron;   3)  
              Describe    critical  morphophysiological   features   important    in   
              auditory  processing   by  the  Mauthner  neuron;   4)   Construct   a 
              morphologically and neurophysiologically realistic  computer  model  of  sound 
              processing by  Mauthner  neuron  to  allow  evaluation of hypotheses and
              improved understanding  of  how  the   auditory  inputs  interact.  These  four
               experimental  approaches   will   permit  a  comprehensive   analysis   of 
              directional sound processing by the Mauthner system. The new  information
              resulting from the proposed work will be used to  further   understand  how 
              neurons  in  general,   and   the  reticulospinal system in particular,
              integrates its  sensory  inputs to produce coordi nated outputs.
