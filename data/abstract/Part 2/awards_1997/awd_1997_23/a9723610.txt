Abstract    :
              9723610  Sheen  The proposed work extends the analysis of how sugars influence
              gene expression in plants and hence control plant development. Nutrients are
              central regulatory signals controlling physiology, metabolism, cell cycle,
              development, and gene expression in all organisms. In plants, it has been shown
              that sugars control a number of processes, with a most significant effect on
              the regulation of photosynthesis through changes in gene expression and
              signaling leading to gene expression. In the proposed work, sugar responses
              will be defined which are mediated through hexokinase as a sugar sensor.
              Included is an analysis of the mechanism through which hexokinase functions and
              how the signal is transmitted. In addition, cross-talk between the sugar
              signaling pathway and other signaling pathways will be studied.  The work
              includes the use of Arabidopsis mutants which are insensitive to glucose as a
              major component. The information gained through this work will enhance our
              ability for manipulating plants genetically for biotechnological purposes.
