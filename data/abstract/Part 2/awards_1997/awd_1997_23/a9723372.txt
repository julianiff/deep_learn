Abstract    :
                  9723372  Koshland  This project is designed to change the specificity of an
              enzyme by substitution of amino acids at the active site or in other parts of
              the protein by site-directed mutation or by random mutation.  The purpose is to
              create an enzyme that has the same catalytic power but a very different
              specificity from the original enzyme.  The enzyme chosen for this study is
              isocitrate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in the Krebs cycle  and it is to be
              changed into an alkylmalate dehydrogenase, a change that alters the active site
              from a polar,  negatively charged chain to a non-polar,  hydrophobic side
              chain.  To change the specificity of an enzyme is of great significance both
              for research and applied practical problems.  To apply enzyme catalysis to
              practical problems such as  cleanup of toxic wastes, it will be important to
              direct the catalytic power of an enzyme  towards specific compounds such as
              man-made polutants that  need removal.  ***
