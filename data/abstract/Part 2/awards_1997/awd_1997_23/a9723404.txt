Abstract    :
              Animals lose water through a variety of avenues, including evaporation from the
              skin surface, fecal water loss, urinary water loss and respiratory water loss. 
              This last pathway, respiratory water loss, can be particularly important in
              small animals and in dry environments. It has long been realized that insects
              may be particularly vulnerable to rapid water loss due to their small size and
              their occurrence in dry environments (e.g. stored grain, desert habitats,
              saline lakes, etc.) .  The PI is examining the rates and pathways of water loss
              in a very small insect, the fruit fly.  The PI's goal is to understand how such
              water loss occurs and what the relation is to the insect's breathing pattern. 
              Such work may be very helpful in developing new non-toxic insecticides and
              insect control strategies.
