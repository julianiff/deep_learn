Abstract    :
              Ronald Olson  This proposal supports a cooperative experimental-theoretical
              effort between the   University of Missouri-Rolla and the University of
              Groningen, The Netherlands.  The   effort will be headed by Robert DuBois and
              Ronald Olson on the US side, and by   Reinhard Morgenstern and Ronnie Hoekstra
              from The Netherlands.  The project will   investigate, both theoretically and
              experimentally molecular fragmentation induced by   strongly non-perturbative
              interactions involving slow to intermediate energy projectiles.  The
              experimental techniques and expertise associated with molecular fragmentation  
              available in Groningen will be combined with electron spectroscopic studies at
              the   University of Missouri-Rolla to develop methods of measuring the
              differential electron   spectra associated with specific molecular dissociation
              channels.  The proposed   approaches offer real prospects for making
              significant headway in understanding the   dynamics of molecular fragmentation
              induced by slow-to intermediate-energy ionic   projectiles.
