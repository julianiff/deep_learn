Abstract    :
                  This research effort is directed at examining the engineering process
              variables on the mechanical properties of aromatic polyesters and copolyesters.
               The proposal was submitted in response to NSF 96-4, NSF-CONACyT Collaborative
              Research opportunities.  It is an extension and augmentation of an already
              successful cooperative research program in polymer engineering between the
              University of Tennessee and the Universidad Autonoma de San Luis Potosi.  Basic
              research studies will be under taken to determine the relations between
              morphological control variables and critical mechanical properties and to
              extend those results to the processing characteristics of the materials.  It is
              proposed to determine the behavior of the polymers and copolymers as a function
              of cooling rate and nucleating agents and to relate the structures generated to
              the mechanical properties.      Successful completion of the effort will
              increase the basic knowledge on the control of the mechanical properties during
              industrial processing.  The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has agreed to
              participate in the project by conducting specific analysis.
