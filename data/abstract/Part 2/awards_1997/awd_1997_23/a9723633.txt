Abstract    :
              9723633  Kretsinger  The structures of
              3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase (DAHPsynthase) and
              3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate-8-phosphate synthase (KDOPsynthase),  will be
              determined by X-ray crystallography at atomic resolution, alone and in complex
              with substrates, inhibitors and regulators. The enzymes share 19% sequence
              identity and have secondary structures that resemble one another.  The enzymes
              differ in their use of metal ions and  regulation by feedback inhibition. Thus
              the ultimate goal of these studies is to determine the similarities and
              possible homologies between these enzymes.  These enzymes catalyze the
              condensation of  phosphoenol pyruvate with a sugar molecule containing four
              (erythrose-4-phosphate) and five (arabinose-5-phosphate) carbons, respectively.
               In both cases, an unusual cleavage occurs, in that the carbon-oxygen bond of
              phosphoenol pyruvate is cleaved and not the oxygen-phosphorus bond.  Both
              enzymes are at important points of a biosynthetic pathway, one leading to
              aromatic end products, the other leading to the lipopolysaccharide of the outer
              membrane in Gram negative bacteria.  The overall goal of this structural
              investigation by X-ray crystallography is to understand the similarities and
              differences in substrate binding and mechanisms of action of these two enzymes,
              and whether these two enzymes are homologues or have arisen by convergent
              evolution.  ***
