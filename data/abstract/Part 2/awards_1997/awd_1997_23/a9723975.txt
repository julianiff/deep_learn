Abstract    :
              Many endocrine glands and neurons release complex compounds that contain a
              "main" secretion, and co-secretions whose roles are poorly understood.  The
              identification of these co-secretions and their functions is of great urgency: 
              (1) malfunctions of neurons and endocrine glands due to co-secretions could be
              involved in so far unexplained pathologies; (2) an understanding of the
              co-secretions may pave the way the new treatments of neural and endocrine
              diseases.  The goal of the present investigation is to clarify the roles of
              co-secretions in the release of the stress hormones adrenaline and
              noradrenaline, and of their suspected antagonist dopamine.  Plasma adrenaline
              and noradrenaline derive from chromaffin cells.  It appears that their release
              is controlled (a) by a cocktail of co-secretions released by the chromaffin
              cells themselves, and (b) by a cocktail released by the fibers that innervate
              the chromaffin cells.  Plasma dopamine derives from the wall of large blood
              vessels, and its release is affected by adrenaline, noradrenaline and opioid
              substances.  Using economic and highly efficient model systems, the chromaffin
              cells and blood vessels of the eel, the studies will focus on co-secretions
              such as messenger peptides, amines and endogenous codeine and morphine.
