Abstract    :
                      9723999  Cohen  Indole-3-acetic acid is found in plants in free and
              conjugated forms.  One of the less well studied forms of conjugated IAA are a
              class of peptides/proteins that are modified by the amide linkage of IAA to the
              protein.  The work will address several problems of this class of IAA
              conjugates.  Occurrence of the conjugates will be studied during fruit and seed
              development in particular, and in other organs of the plant during vegetative
              development.  IAA peptides will be isolated and immunological and peptide
              mapping studies will be conducted.  Transcripts for proteins from which these
              peptides derive will be obtained, based on the mapping data and these
              transcripts will be used for the analysis of expression of the genes during
              development.  The studies are expected to provide an understanding of the,
              possibly multiple, roles of this class of modified proteins in relationship to
              growth regulator biology.
