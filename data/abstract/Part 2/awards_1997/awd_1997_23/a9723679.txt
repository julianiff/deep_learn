Abstract    :
                      9723679  Williamson  The gene Meu1 confers resistance to the potato
              aphid in tomato.  It is tightly linked to Mi, a single, dominant locus that
              mediates resistance to root-knot nemotodes.  The projects starts from the
              recognition that the two genes are close, but separated by about 300 kb.  The
              project will isolate Meu1 and characterize the gene product genetically and
              through transgenic plant analysis in a multidisciplinary approach.  The gene
              will be obtained by positional cloning.  Action of the gene will be analyzed
              through assessment of the aphid response to resistant plants and the response
              of resistant plants to aphid feeding.  Included is an analysis of the effect of
              Meu1-mediated resistance on virus transmission by aphids.  This approach unites
              two laboratories with emphasis on aphid biology and molecular biology.
