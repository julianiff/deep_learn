Abstract    :
              IBN:  9723178  PI:  Rodman  The primary visual cortex of the brain is known to
              be an important center for conscious visual perception, but there are other
              parts of the brain that also handle visual information in quite complex ways,
              though perhaps less "consciously."  If the visual cortex is severely damaged,
              subjects are for most purposes considered blind.  However, special tests can
              show that there is some kind of residual ability to detect visual targets and
              some properties about their location, movement and other features.  This
              phenomenon is called "blindsight."  It offers an unusual opportunity to study
              how visual activity in the brain can be separated from conscious visual
              perception.  It is interesting that the degree of recovery from cortical loss
              is greater in early life, and may actually include some awareness of visual
              stimuli.  This project utilizes testing of blindsight capabilities to
              understand differences between visual capabilities in early and in later life. 
              Anatomical and physiological techniques will be used to see whether cells and
              their projections from a subcortical center called the thalamus still convey
              normal visual signals to remaining areas of visual cortex, and whether there
              are compensatory connections that develop between the thalamus and other brain
              regions.  Results will be important to developmental neuroscience and cognitive
              psychology as well as to visual neuroscience, to enhance our knowledge of the
              organization and development of the visual system.
