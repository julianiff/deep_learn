Abstract    :
              IBN-9723250  PI:  Schafer  Voltage-gated calcium channels control the entry of
              calcium into neurons and muscle cells.  As such they serve as key regulators of
              calcium-dependent processes such as muscle contraction, communication   between
              neurons, and learning.  The importance of voltage-gated calcium channels for
              nervous system function is underscored by the fact that several devastating
              genetic and autoimmune diseases, such as sporadic ALS, are caused by calcium
              channel defects.  Yet despite the scientific and medical importance of these
              channels, several key questions about calcium channel biology remain
              unanswered.  For example, the functions of the individual proteins that make up
              the channel are not completely understood, nor is it clear how these proteins
              are assembled to make a working channel. The mechanisms through which calcium
              channel activity is regulated also remain largely uncharacterized.   In the
              proposed studies, these questions   will be addressed in the roundworm
              Caenorhabditis elegans using a combination of genetic and biochemical
              approaches.  C. elegans has a simple and anatomically well characterized
              nervous system that is highly amenable to genetic analysis.  Mutants defective
              in the genes for the calcium channel subunits will be used to define the roles
              of these proteins in the assembly, localization, and functional activity of the
              calcium channel. Mutant worms will also be identified that will define new
              genes required for regulation of calcium channel activity.  These studies
              should provide important insights into general mechanisms for the regulation of
              voltage-gated calcium channels in neurons.
