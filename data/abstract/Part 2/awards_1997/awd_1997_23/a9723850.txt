Abstract    :
              9723850  Stanley  The XIV International Symposium on Glycoconjugates will be
              held in Zurich, Switzerland, September 7-12, 1997. The Symposium, which is
              sponsored by the International Glycoconjugate Organization, is the major
              international meeting of scientists in glycoconjugate research. In order for
              junior scientists to attend and present their data and further exchange on the
              international level, it is necessary to obtain travel funds for them. A review
              of submitted requests by a panel consisting of members of the Board of
              Directors of the Society of Glycobiology will be used to rank the applicants.
              This ranking will be based on individual accomplishments and quality and impact
              of the research to be presented at the meeting.    Scientific progress proceeds
              as the result of exchange of ideas among investigators at conferences.  It is
              important that junior scientists be exposed to national and international
              conferences where the exchange of ideas will have great impact on their career
              development. This award will supply funds to support the travel of junior
              scientists to an international conference.  The award of funds to this
              conference is particularly appropriate because the Society of Glycobiology has
              chosen to make the awards to junior investigators in a competition. This will
              not only raise the quality of the work presented and supported by the travel
              award but it will assure that the awards will go to junior investigators who
              are the most competitive within their field and who will later become prominent
              scientists.   ***
