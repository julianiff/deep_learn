Abstract    :
                    9723671  Martienssen  In a few years, the DNA sequence of the Arabidopsis
              genome will be known.  However, there will be many coding regions for which we
              do not know a function and the developmental context and location in which they
              are expressed will not be known.  The goal of the project is to generate new
              lines of Arabidopsis each carrying a gene trap or enhancer trap transposon and
              to sequence the genomic DNA flanking a number of the trapped insertion sites. 
              This work will form the basis for a larger database which can eventually be
              merged with the genomic sequences, to provide data on cell-specificity and
              developmental specificity of unknown genes.  The collection will become a
              powerful resource for fine-mapping and positional cloning as well as for local
              saturation mutagenesis.
