Abstract    :
                9723583  Pilskaln    This award supports a visit to China by U.S .researchers 
              Cynthia Pilskaln, Fei Chai, and Richard Barber to plan  future research
              collaborations in the Southern Ocean.  The  trip will allow the U.S. P.I.s to
              develop a joint U.S.-China  research program in the Southern Ocean, taking
              advantage of  annual cruises by the Chinese to their Antarctic Research 
              Station.  The Chinese counterpart is Dong Zhaoqian, Director  of the Polar
              Research Institute, Shanghai.  During the  planning visit, the P.I.s will meet
              with Chinese scientists  and government officials to discuss and develop mutual
               scientific interests and devise a joint research plan.  The  P.I.s will also
              visit the newly constructed polar research  vessel, Xue Long, to see first hand
              the research  instrumentation available and to discuss sampling and at-sea 
              analysis procedures with the ship's crew and technicians.    The Southern Ocean
              is comparatively unsampled; this lack of  data is an obstacle to improved
              understanding of global  climate.  Use of the regularly scheduled Chinese
              research  vessel trips to the Antarctic could provide an important  additional
              platform for data acquisition, but arranging such  joint programs requires face
              to face meetings and  development of detailed understandings.  This planning
              visit  is an important initial step in a potentially valuable  cooperation.
