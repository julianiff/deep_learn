Abstract    :
                 This award to an organization called Women in Endocrinology provides   funds
              to help support travel to beginning women endocrinologists who are   presenting
              their work at the annual meetings of the Endocrine Society.  By   having a
              small but stable base helping to defray travel costs for these young  
              investigators, the organization will increase the participation of women in the
                main annual event in this field.  It provides an excellent opportunity to
              enhance   the human resource infrastructure by increasing accessibility to a
              major scientific   meeting by young women, particularly from under-represented
              groups, to   establish important professional contacts, and the emphasis is on
              supporting   young researchers, rather than clinicians, in line with NSF's
              mission of   supporting basic research.  The organizers have planned to use the
              NSF   contribution to leverage increasing matching funds from other sources for
              future   years.     This award will have a substantial impact on the career
              development of the   many young women who receive the assistance, to become
              known as active   basic researchers in this important and growing field.
