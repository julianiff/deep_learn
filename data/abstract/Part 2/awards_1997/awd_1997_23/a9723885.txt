              behaviors can occur under a variety of internal and  external conditions.
              Because of this, movements may vary  from time to time to support the behavior
              in an appropriate  way. It is now clear that the nervous system networks that 
              underlie rhythmic behaviors can each produce a variety of  outputs, allowing
              for this flexibility. These changes in  output are largely controlled by
              chemicals called  neuromodulators, which are released from nerve cells. There 
              are many such neuromodulators, each of which can alter  behavior in different
              ways. This project investigates how  nervous system output, and hence rhythmic
              movements, are  altered when several neuromodulators are present in the  system
              at the same time, as well as the how such  neuromodulators can alter the way
              nerve cells communicate  with each other over a long time period. These studies
               increase the understanding of the roles of central nervous  system chemical
              substances in generating behavioral  flexibility on a number of levels, as well
              as increasing the  understanding of the way the brain controls rhythmic 
              movements so that they are most appropriate for a given  situation. Such
              movements are fundamental to such important  behaviors as walking, hand
              movements, speech, and visceral  functions.
