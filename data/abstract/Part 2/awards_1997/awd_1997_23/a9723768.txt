Abstract    :
              Biknevicius  9723768              The skeletal system of mammals is affected by
              a variety of  factors, including body weight, locomotor forces, and limb 
              posture. Whereas scientists are beginning to understand how these  factors
              interact to determine skeletal form in adult animals with  regards to bone
              stress levels, very little data is available to  assess whether this mosaic of
              mechanical factors is equally  important in determining skeletal structure in
              growing mammals.  Preliminary data generated in my laboratory show that limb 
              function changes with age during the first few weeks of locomotor  function.
              The results of the proposed study will be used to test  two distinct questions:
              how similar are the locomotor dynamics in  adult and juvenile dogs ranging in
              size and shape when gaits are  standardized, and are levels of bone stress
              comparable in  juvenile and adult dogs. The general principles derived from
              this  study will have practical uses in veterinary medicine, for  clinical
              evaluations of the effects of orthopaedic treatments in  young dogs, as well as
              evolutionary biology, because ontogenetic  patterns established in living
              species often provide clues to the  evolution of form-function complexes.
