Abstract    :
              Abstract  9723749  Maddock          In order to understand how cell growth and
              division occur, it is necessary to determine how proteins that normally control
              the timing of cell division work.  Central players in this process are
              GTP-binding proteins.  These proteins act as cellular switches, receiving input
              signals and then transmitting the signal to downstream proteins.  The activity
              of the GTP-binding proteins is usually modified by other specific proteins. 
              Recently, a new family of GTP-binding proteins has been found in many different
              kinds of organisms.  This evolutionary conservation between distantly related
              species suggests that this family of GTP-binding proteins has a fundamental,
              though currently unknown, cellular role(s).  The goal of this research is  to
              understand the cellular role of this GTP-binding protein and to define the
              relationship between this protein and interacting proteins.  These studies will
              be in the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus.  Caulobacter is the ideal model
              system to dissect the role of this protein since cell cycle studies are easily
              performed and all of the molecular and genetic advantages of a bacterial system
              can be exploited.   Due to the conservation of these GTP-binding proteins this
              work is likely to have application in other systems.  %%%    This research is
              looking at the function of an essential protein, a GTPase, which is conserved
              from archea and bacteria to humans.  The evolutionary conservation suggests
              that this protein has a fundamental role, and the objective of this research is
              to determine that role.    ***
