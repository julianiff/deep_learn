Abstract    :
                  For many animals, vibrations transmitted by air or water  provide
              information about the local three-dimensional environment.  Often there are
              extremely complex mechanosensory systems  integrating extremely complex
              stimulus fields.  This collaborative  research project exploits a small aquatic
              crustacean, a copepod,  as a novel model system that can be considered much
              simpler than  the insects and large crustaceans used in other analyses.  The 
              copepod brain has fewer than 1000 neurons and lives in a simple  flow
              environment where the animal creates a feeding current across  the antennae. 
              This current has some local turbulence in the open,  but is converted to a
              smooth laminar flow field across the  antenna.   Microscale hydrodynamics,
              receptor neurophysiology and  behavioral studies are used to clarify the
              mechanisms that  transduce the 3-D information of natural signals into a neural
               signal, and underlie behavior such as feeding or escape from  swimming
              predators detected by this small but sophisticated  mechanosensory system.     
              Results will be important for understanding 3-D processing in  mechanosensory
              systems, and there is potential impact beyond  neuroscience to biological
              oceanography because of the importance  of copepods in the food web, and
              potential impact on the design of  biosensors and robotic sensory technology.
