Abstract    :
              IBN:  9723542  PI:  ATEMA     Smell and taste are senses that detect chemicals
              in the environment, but they do not work in isolation.  In the aquatic
              environment with high viscosity compared to air, chemical "plumes" are carried
              in currents and can have complex spatial and temporal structure over long
              distances.  Animals in the water are subject to hydrodynamic stimulation by
              water currents as well, and it is largely unknown how the tactile stimulation
              from a swift current may affect the chemosensory input, compared to the same
              chemosensory signal in gently drifting water.  This project uses a
              multidisciplinary approach incorporating hydrodynamics, ultrastructural anatomy
              and electrophysiology on a crustacean as a model invertebrate chemosensory
              system.  Morphological types of sensory cells in the appendages such as the
              antenna will be identified, and tested for physiological sensitivity to
              combinations of chemosensory signals and mechanosensory stimuli.     Results
              will help determine how peripheral integration of multimodal signals might
              occur, will be important beyond chemosensory science to sensory neuroscience in
              general, and will have potential applications for technological development of
              robotic sensory devices.
