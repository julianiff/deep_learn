Abstract    :
              9723244  Momany  The overall goal of this research project is to develop novel
              crystallization strategies based on the design of self-assembling matrices
              (SAMs).  To create these SAMs, sophisticated molecular techniques and
              combinatorial libraries will be used to engineer antibody fragments and other
              relevant macromolecules that crystallize with large voids that can accommodate
              additional target macromolecules.  The target for which a structure is desired
              would be carried into the lattice though specific interactions selected though
              Phage Display panning.  A SAM-based method of crystallization will
              significantly increase the rate of crystal structure determinations and thus
              make practical crystallography associated with genome-projects.  The approach
              is ideal for crystallizing macromolecules such as peptide hormones,
              carbohydrates, RNA, DNA, and membrane-bound or glycosylated proteins that have
              resisted standard empirically-based crystallization strategies in the past.  By
              creating a mechanism that avoids empirical crystallization screens, this
              SAM-based approach can have a significant impact on the entire field of
              structural biology.  ***
