Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   Program
              will assist a junior faculty in the Department of Chemistry at   Tufts
              University to acquire an upgrade of an existing 300 MHz NMR   Spectrometer.
              This equipment will enhance research on elucidating the   structures ( both
              `primary structures` and three-dimensional structures)   of peptide-DNA
              hybrids, porphyrin-DNA hybrids, and substituted   porphyrins.  Nuclear Magnetic
              Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool   available to chemists
              for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.   It is used to identify
              unknown substances, characterize specific   arrangements of atoms within
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of   interactions between molecules in
              solution. Access to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to
              chemists who are carrying out frontier   research. The results from these NMR
              studies are useful in the areas such   as polymers, catalysis, and in biology
