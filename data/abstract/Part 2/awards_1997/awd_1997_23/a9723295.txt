Abstract    :
              Lay Abstract    PI: Fanselow, Michael S.  Proposal Number: IBN-9723295    When
              information is first learned, the brain stores this new  memory in a form that
              is very susceptible to disruption.  Over time, one particular part of the
              brain, the  hippocampus, acts to consolidate these memories into a more 
              indelible form. If the hippocampus is damaged or disrupted  before
              consolidation of a particular experience is complete,  there is an amnesia for
              that experience. While it is known  that this memory consolidation goes on for
              a very long time,  very little is known about what causes consolidation to 
              occur or what factors control the duration of this process.  This project
              provides crucial information about how memory  consolidation is accomplished.
              There are  two lines of  investigation. The first examines several
              environmental  manipulations that prevent this amnesia or shorten or extend 
              the period of consolidation. These experiments provide  information on the
              mental processes that cause the brain to  consolidate its experiences. The
              second line of research  determines how the various parts of the hippocampus
              are  involved in the consolidation process. Together the two  parts of this
              project provide information about how the  brain operates on our experiences to
              create permanent  memories.
