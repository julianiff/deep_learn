Abstract    :
              Guo, P.  MCB 9723923  Technical  A virus-encoded RNA (pRNA) is required for the
              packaging of phage phi29 dsDNA into a preformed procapsid during maturation.
              Packing of DNA also requires the DNA packaging protein gp16, ATP and Mg++.  A
              highly sensitive in vitro assembly system has been established to study phi29
              DNA package.  With the aid of pRNA and cloned gene products, DNA can be
              packaged in vitro with up to 90% efficiency and up to 108 plaque forming units
              per ml of infectious virions can be assembled without background.  In the
              presence of MG++, 6 pRNAs bind to the protal vertex of procapsids (the site of
              DNA entry) and are released after DNA packaging is completed.  It is known that
              the pRNA has two functional domains, one for procapsid binding and one for an
              unknown but essential role. The requirement of the pRNA for ATPase activity of
              the DNA packing protein suggests a role for the pRNA in the energetics of
              package.  The hypothesis being tested is that the pRNA, acting as part of a DNA
              packing ATPase, undergoes a series of conformational changes during DNA
              packaging.  The conformation of the pRNA in the presence of ATP is investigated
              by chemical and nuclease probing and crosslinking.    Non technical  The study
              of pRNA conformational changes as it relates to phage phi29 DNA packaging is to
              provide basic information regarding viral assembly, RNA structure,
              bioenergetics, and molecular motion.  As the involvement of the phi29 pRNA in
              DNA translocation is unique among known RNA functions, investigation of the
              structure and function of this molecule has broad significance to the
              mechanisms of RNA/ATP, RNA/Mg++, RNA/protein, RNA/DNA, and RNA/RBNA
              interactions.  Additionally, the study of the phi29 DNA translocation process
              may have relevance to other DNA translocation enzymes, such as helicase, as
              both processes can utilize ring-shaped structures with six-fold symmetry.
