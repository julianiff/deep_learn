                  Lay Abstract    PI: Friesen, Otto; and Mellon, DeForest  Proposal Number: 
              IBN-9723320  Much is known about the complex neuronal circuits that  control
              rhythmic movements such as walking, flying in  insects, and swimming in
              different species.  A major source  of neuronal complexity arises from tight
              coupling between  neuronal oscillators that are integral components of larger 
              brain circuits.  These larger circuits then generate  purposeful, coordinated
              movement patterns.  Another source  of complexity is sensory input, which can
              alter the activity  of the oscillators.  The experiments funded by this award 
              are designed to advance the understanding of coordination  and sensory
              modulation of neural circuits underlying  movement patterns. The specific
              functions of sensory  feedback in setting the patterns of rhythmic activity in 
              nervous system circuits are determined. This information is  then combined with
              the results of experiments investigating  the way different circuits interact
              to generate larger, more  complex rhythmic movements. Computer models of
              nervous  system function are developed and tested based on the  experimental
              data. Because of the functional unity of  rhythmic movements in all animals,
              analytical tools  developed by, and insights gained from, this research will 
              be widely applicable to the understanding of the control of  movement in all
              organisms, including humans, and will  contribute to the base of information
              important for the  development of artificial movement control systems.
