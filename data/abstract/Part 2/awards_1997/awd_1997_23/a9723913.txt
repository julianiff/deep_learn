Abstract    :
               Evans  9723913      Anthropogenic activity is having a dramatic impact on 
              ecosystem nitrogen dynamics. Nitrogen is the element that  most often limits
              growth, and species-specific responses to  changes in nitrogen dynamics can
              alter species composition  and decrease biodiversity. Natural variation of
              stable  isotopes of nitrogen ('5N; IN) can provide new insights  into dynamics
              of plant nitrogen use. The forms of nitrogen  absorbed by plants have very
              different isotopic  compositions (FIN), so plant of N may be a powerful tool to
               quantify acquisition of nitrogen from different sources. A  common assumption
              is that foliar oven depends solely on the  own of the nitrogen source, but it
              is now apparent that  variation in foliar 6~sN can also result from
              physiological  processes within the plant. This study will provide a 
              mechanistic understanding of the factors that control plant  own and outlines a
              physiologically-based model that can be  used to quantify absorption of
              nitrogen from different  sources. The significance of the proposed research is
              that  a mechanistic understanding of the factors controlling  plant 6~sN in
              combination with a physiologicallybased model  will provide a tool to quantify
              acquisition of nitrogen  from different sources within the environment,
              enabling us  to increase our fundamental understanding of plant nitrogen 
              dynamics.
