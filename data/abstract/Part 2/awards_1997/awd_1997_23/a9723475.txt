Abstract    :
                                        Abstract                                              
                                      An next-generation molecular graphics data 
              representation, associated molecular scene repository, and  collaborative
              visualization software tools are proposed.  Collectively we refer to these
              components as a Molecular  Interactive Collaborative Environment (MICE).  More 
              specifically, MICE consists of:         Molecular Scene Description Language
              (MSDL) which uses    an extension to the well established International Union
              of    Crystallography STAR/CIF format to fully describe the    molecular scene.
                    Molecular Scene Gallery which collects scenes described    in MSDL and
              which can be queried with respect to features of    the molecular scene, and
              not just text-based descriptions of    the molecule.       Molecular Scene
              Collaborative Software part of which    has already been prototyped and which
              allows one user to    manipulate the molecular scene while other remote users
              look    on.  Any of the remote users can take control via a console    that
              synchronizes user access.  The molecular scene can also    invoke an external
              application viewable to all users    participating in the collaboration.
