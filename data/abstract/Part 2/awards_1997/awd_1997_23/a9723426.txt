Abstract    :
                    9723426    Chrispeels  Based on cloned genes for insect alpha-amylase and
              bean alpha-amylase inhibitors, the work will use crystallography, biochemical
              analysis, and site-directed mutagenesis for obtaining a structure model, and an
              understanding of  active site  requirements for a productive interaction
              between the two proteins. Considering the economical importance of crop
              protection, in this case insect predation of harvested biomass, the work must
              be rated highly significant from a biotechnological perspective.
