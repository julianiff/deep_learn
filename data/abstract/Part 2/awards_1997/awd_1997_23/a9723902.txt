                                     REVIEW SUMMARY                             Form 7     
              The International Brain Research Organization (IBRO) was  founded in 1960 to
              bring together neuroscientists from many  different countries, and provide some
              means of fostering  international collaborations in the area of brain research.
               IBRO supports symposia, workshops and visiting lectureships  around the world,
              and holds a quadrennial Congress to  highlight the frontiers of international
              neuroscience  research.  This award supports the continuing international  dues
              payment and its administrative costs for the U.S.  National Committee, as a
              part of the U.S. National Academy  of Sciences, to represent the United States
              neuroscience  community to IBRO.     This support will have an impact on
              fostering the  international relations that can lead to fruitful 
              collaborations in all areas of neuroscience research and  training.
