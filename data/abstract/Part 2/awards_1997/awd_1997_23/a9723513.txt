Abstract    :
              Lay Abstract    PI:  Givens, Bennet  Proposal Number: IBN-9723513    The
              hippocampus is a structure in the brain known top be  important for memory
              formation, but the precise mechanism by  which new information is acquired by
              the hippocampus is  unknown. The electrical activity of the hippocampus 
              occasionally oscillates in a rhythmic fashion, and this  oscillation, called
              the theta rhythm, synchronizes with the  arrival of new information. One
              hypothesis for memory  formation is that this synchronization is important for 
              stamping in new information. This project examines both the  behavioral
              determinates of the theta rhythm synchronization  and the neural systems that
              generate and control the  rhythmic activity in order to establish the mechanism
              by  which the hippocampus encodes new information. The results  from this
              project significantly advance the understanding of  how information is
              processed and stored in the brain.
