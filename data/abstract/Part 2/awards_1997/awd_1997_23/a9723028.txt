Abstract    :
              Haber  9723028  The 1997 FASEB summer research conference on Recombination is
              the seventh bi-annual meeting on mechanisms of exchange of DNA strands in
              recombination and in DNA repair.  This meeting has been one of the most
              over-subscribed of the FASEB meetings, but to ensure a high level of
              interaction among participants, the number of participants is limited to 200. 
              The meeting includes speakers who are the leaders in the study of the
              biochemistry, molecular biology and genetics of homologous, site-specific and
              nonhomologous mechanisms of recombination.  The major topics of discussion are:
               bacterial recombination mechanisms; DNA replication, recombination and repeat
              instability; homeologous and ectopic recombination; meiotic recombination;
              mammalian recombination and gene targeting; immunoglobulin gene rearrangements;
              site-specific recombination; mechanisms of recombination; protein structures in
              recombination; and a broad survey of genome rearrangements associated with
              development.  Funds are being used to help partially defray the costs of this
              meeting and to permit the participation of individuals from under-represented
              groups.
