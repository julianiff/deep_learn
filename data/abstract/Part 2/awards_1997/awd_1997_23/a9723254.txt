Abstract    :
              Dighton  9723254         The PIs understanding of how biodiversity and
              ecological function  are linked is not well understood. Ectomycorrhizal
              (plant-fungal)  associations of tree roots provide an ideal model to study this
              linkage  because ectomycorrhizal fungi are (i) widespread, (ii) may have
              different  potentials to acquire nutrients and (iii) are affected by
              anthropogenic  stresses, such as pollution.       This project will be the
              first to detail effects of species  diversity and composition of
              ectomycorrhizal fungi on tree seedlings  growth and nutrient uptake. The PI
              will compare the ability of single and  multiple infections of ectomycorrhizas
              to take up essential nutrients and  determine whether this capacity is
              influences by mycorrhizal community  structure.       In this initial phase of
              the work the PIs' will prove their ability  to use the two main proposed
              methodologies, that: (i) measuring the  kinetics of P uptake into
              ectomycorrhizal mycelia in culture and on  infected root tips; and (ii)
              production of tree root systems with defined  community structures of 1, 2 and
              4 species combinations of  ectomycorrhizal fungi. Under the current budget, the
              PI will use only  radioactive 32p in the uptake studies as it can be measured
              using on-site  facilities Also because the PI can not purchase a
              climate-controlled  growth cabinet, results from the initial trials may show a
              greater  variability than originally intended.
