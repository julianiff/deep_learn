Abstract    :
                 This award supports participation of graduate and postdoctoral students to  
              present their research at the Summer Neuropeptide Conference.  Neuropeptides  
              are molecular compounds that are known in many cases to have effects on  
              modulating the activity of the brain and behavior.  The meeting is not huge,
              and   so it represents an excellent opportunity for young scientists to make
              important   contacts with other scientists doing related work, to exchange the
              latest   information on theories and techniques, and to develop new
              collaborations,   including international ones.  The NSF joins several other
              donors and agencies   in giving partial support to this meeting, with an
              emphasis on the NSF mission of   promoting infrastructure to develop the
              careers of young scientists.     The travel awards will have a substantial
              impact on the careers of the young   scientists who are able to attend.
