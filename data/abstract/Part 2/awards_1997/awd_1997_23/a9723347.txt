Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for the Southern California Geometric
              Analysis Seminar, an annual two-day conference at the University of California,
              Irvine, which is  designed to promote interaction among the members of the
              Southern California mathematics community who work in the field of Geometric
              Analysis and related areas. The major goals of this project are to bring
              graduate students and young researchers together with top-ranking senior
              researchers in the field and to serve as a conduit for the flow of ideas.  In
              the past, these meetings have led to new collaborations and new results whose
              impact grows in significance long after the conference is concluded. The
              importance of such conferences is heightened in the area of Geometric Analysis
              because this is a field which cuts across many areas of mathematics, both pure
              and applied, and thus requires its practitioners to come in frequent contact
              with a wide variety of ideas and methods.  Topics covered in the past include
              gauge theories, Riemannian geometry, sympletic geometry, evolution equations,
              and curvature flows.
