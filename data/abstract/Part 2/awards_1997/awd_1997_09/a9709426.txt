Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research  is to produce statistical tests and methods for
              the construction of confidence regions that are valid for the general
              k-endogenous variable, overidentifying instruments, model.  In addition there
              are several subsidiary goals.  First, the work will be extended to the general
              GMM framework.  It is very likely that the distribution of test statistics
              carries over to nonlinear and nonspherical models, but works needs to be done
              on those details which rely on the significance of the first stage simply
              because the standard GMM approach doesn't have a separately identified first
              stage. Second, the distinction between included and excluded exogenous
              variables needs to be clarified in computing the degrees of freedom for the
              `switched-LR` and `switched-LM` statistics.  Third, recent work by others will
              be extended which provide diagnostics for finding `weak instruments.`  It is
              clear that simple tests of first-stage significance are inadequate.  Fourth,
              the practical significance of the methods developed will be demonstrated by
              applying them to real data.  In particular, the widespread adoption in labor
              economics of natural experiments as a source of instruments should provide a
              good `test bed.`  Inference using the above  methods will be compared to the
              traditional methods currently employed.
