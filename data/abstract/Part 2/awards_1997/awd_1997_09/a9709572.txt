Abstract    :
              9709572  Mao         This award provides partial (76%) funding for the
              acquisition  of equipment (a solid state germanium detector and two argon ion 
              laser tubes) to be used in conjunction with high-pressure  experiments on
              materials of the Earth's mantle and core. The work  is to be carried out by the
              Geophysical Laboratory of the Carnegie  Institution of Washington (CIW), and
              CIW is committed to providing  the remaining funds necessary for the
              acquisition. The equipment  will be incorporated in experimental systems used
              to investigate  the elasticity (leading to seismic velocities) and the
              equations of  state of the important mineral perovskite, a magnesium-iron 
              silicate considered to be the dominant phase in the mantle. The  resulting
              measurements will be used to interpret seismic data in  terms of models of the
              structure and dynamic processes of the  Earth's deep interior.  ***
