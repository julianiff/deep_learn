Abstract    :
              Haida, a Native American language spoken on the Queen  Charlotte Islands in
              British Columbia and in one community  in Southeastern Alaska, is in critical
              condition.  The  remaining handful of speakers are all old and in ill health.  
              This is the critical period for making a permanent record of  the language,
              which is little known but significant both for  its grammatical uniqueness and
              for the light it sheds on  historical relations with other languages in the
              Northwest  Coast.  The PI studied Haida from 1975 to 1995, documenting  the
              sound system and grammar, preparing a dictionary, and  recording place names,
              personal names, oral narratives, and  music.  The goal of the project is to
              complete the second of  a two-volume study of Haida syntax (volume 1 was
              completed  in 1996).  Much of the second volume, which will equal the  first in
              size and scope, is drafted, although two years of  full-time work are required
              to finish it, during which  several month-long field trips will be undertaken
              to resolve  problems.  This study will be particularly significant for 
              linguists interested in comparative syntax and will be of  practical value to
              those Haidas who are working to save  something of their language for future
              generations.
