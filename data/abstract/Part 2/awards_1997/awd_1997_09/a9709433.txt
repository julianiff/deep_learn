Abstract    :
              This project will determine grain size and mass flux of  eolian particles
              collected in a series of sediment traps and  surface sediments from the
              northwest Indian Ocean.  Ancillary data from moored meteorological buoys,
              satellite  images, aerosol collectors, and particle geochemistry will  be
              provided by collaborators.  The goal is to quantify the  relationship between
              grain size and wind strength, taking  into account the effects of seasonal
              monsoons, atmospheric  and water-column seavenging, and bottom redistribution
              of  particles.  Resulting equations can be applied to quantify  direction and
              strength of winds during past climatic states,  an essential variable in global
              circulation models.
