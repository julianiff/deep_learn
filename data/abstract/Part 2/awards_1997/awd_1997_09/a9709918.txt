              Abstract  ATM-9708418  Overpeck, Jonathan T. and Miller, Gifford H  University
              of Colorado, Boulder  Marine-Terrestrial Variability of the Labrador Sea Region
              over Decadal to   Millennial Time Scales    Large scale variations in climate
              and vegetation are known to have taken place in the eastern Canadian/Greenland
              Arctic on time scales from years to millennia, and are likely to have had
              important links with the broader atmospheric and oceanic circulation. 
              Well-dated records of this change are just becoming available using preliminary
              networks of both annually-laminated (varved) and AMS radiocarbon-dated lake
              sediment records.  This award supports a project to collect and analyze lake
              sediment records around the Labrador Sea, and thus provide a comprehensive
              reconstruction of the decadal to millennial-scale environmental variability of
              this region.  This will generate a much improved understanding of how the
              Labrador Sea modulates ocean thermohaline circulation, as well as North
              Atlantic and Arctic climate, across  time scales relevant to assessing future
              climatic change in these regions.  This work will also provide the modern
              calibration data needed to quantify many existing proxy environmental records
              across the whole of the eastern Canadian Arctic/Greenland region, and thus
              provide improved quantitative space/time reconstructions needed to evaluate the
              ability of predictive models to simulate future Arctic and global environmental
              change.
