Abstract    :
              SBR-9709456  Haripriya Rangan  University of Kentucky    The research supported
              by this award addresses the issue of environmental sustainability of
              common-property land uses in post-apartheid South Africa.  Specifically, the
              investigator will study the ways in which the structures of the informal
              markets for resource-based commodities and of rural households influence which
              members (especially by gender) of which households make use of which
              common-property sites as sources of these commodities.  The commodities are not
              cultivated farm products, but rather, materials for crafts and medicines to be
              sold eventually in informal urban markets.      The investigator will determine
              which commodities to make the subject of study from preliminary comparison of
              commodities' market characteristics.  The research will proceed by tracing the
              social and economic linkages in the chain of production and marketing from
              urban, informal markets to rural households and land.  Through interviews with
              participants at each point in the chain, the investigator will construct these
              linkages and their relationship to the gender- and household-specific
              production of commodities.    The findings of the research will be important
              because of the large role that the marketing of non-cultivated commodities
              plays in the livelihoods of rural South African households, the importance of
              these land uses to the ultimate environmental sustainability of common lands,
              and the role that common lands play in agrarian and resettlement policies in
              post-apartheid South Africa.
