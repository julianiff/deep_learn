Abstract    :
              9709959  Dorgan  The aim of this research is to study the modification of 
              stainless steel surfaces by the adsorption of novel block  copolymers for the
              purpose of improving biocompatibility for  better cardiopulmonary products. 
              This research will be  carried out with collaboration between the principal 
              investigator's laboratory at the Colorado School of Mines  and COBE
              Cardiovascular Incorporated, a leading corporation  in the manufacture of blood
              oxygenators.  Also, the  laboratory of Professor M. Sefton in Canada will also
              be  involved in biocompatibility studies.  Funds will be used to  partially
              support one graduate student for one year, for  materials and supplies and for
              analytical instrument fees.  The rest of the student's support will be provided
              by COBE.  ***
