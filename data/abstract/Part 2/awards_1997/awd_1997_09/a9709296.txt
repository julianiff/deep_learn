Abstract    :
                970926  Blanchard    Profit shares and profit rates for the major OECD
              countries, which had decreased in the 1970s, have steadily increased since,
              often by a substantial amount.  The average profit share for the OECD-Europe
              has increased from a low of 30.5% in 1981 to a high of 38.1% in 1995.  The
              average profit rate (the profit share multiplied by the capital output ratio)
              for OECD-Europe has increased from a low of 11.0% in 1981 to a high of 14.9% in
              1995.  The U.S. rate has gone from a low of 12.3% in 1982 to a high of 19.5% in
              1995.  Much of the increase in the profit rate in the OECD countries seems to
              be explained by the decline in inflation.  The data strongly suggest that the
              lower the inflation rate, the higher the profit rate, controlling for the
              capital-labor ratio.  This project examines alternative explanations of this
              striking statistical relationship between the profit rate and inflation and it
              draws out the implications of these changes in income distribution on economic
              activity, from investment to unemployment.  The project also examines a number
              of explanations of the dynamics of  natural unemployment rates including firing
              restrictions, the loss of skills and work habits of the long-term unemployed,
              immigration, and family insurance of unemployed.
