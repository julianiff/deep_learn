Abstract    :
                  This project will examine coral records from the core of the  Western
              Pacific Warm Pool to determine whether there is  evidence of long-term changes
              in maximum temperature that  might indicate global warming.  Subannual sampling
              will also  address the question of decade-scale variability.  Two  Porites
              specimens spanning in the last 200-300 years will be  analyzed for stable
              isotopes and trace elements.  In  addition, the project will explore the
              utility of records  from the long-lived Diploastrea.
