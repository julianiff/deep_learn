Abstract    :
              ***  9709224  KOPPER  This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and
              Facilities   (CRIF) Program will assist the junior faculty in the Department of
                Chemistry at Hendrix College acquire a gas chromatography-mass  
              spectrometry-data system. This equipment will enhance research which is  
              focused on the development of transition metal-assisted organic  
              transformations in high-temperature and high-pressure water (pressurized  
              aqueous reactions above 100 C).    Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used
              to probe intimate structural   details and to obtain the molecular compositions
              of a vast array of   organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. The
              addition of the   technique of electrospray extends the range of MS to protein
              and nucleic   acid molecular weights far beyond any other technique. The use of
                electrospray ionization in combination with high resolution provides the  
              latest technique available in mass spectrometry. It affords the chemist   one
              of the most powerful tools available for the characterization of   compounds.
              The acquisition of this capability in mass spectrometry is   essential for the
              prosecution of frontier research in many fields of   chemistry.          ***
