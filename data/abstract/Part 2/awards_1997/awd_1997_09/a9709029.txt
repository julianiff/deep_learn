Abstract    :
              9709029  Mills    The primary creep response of polycrystalline TiAl is 
              examined as a function of the lamellar spacing and grain  size under a GOALI
              grant at Ohio State with interaction of  Universal Energy Systems and Wright
              Laboratories.  Single  lamellar colony crystals are prepared and creep tested
              in  several orientations to determine the effects of lamellar  orientation on
              the primary creep behavior.  The effect of  carbon additions on the creep
              response of both  polycrystalline samples and single crystal lamellar colony 
              crystals is determined.  The form of primary creep transient  is modeled
              quantitatively and compared to the hardening  behavior under constant strain
              rate conditions.  Stress  change, strain transient experiments are conducted to
               provide new insight into the mechanisms controlling  deformation during creep.
               Activation energies for transient  flow are determined by employing rapid
              temperature change  experiments.  Transmission electron microscopy is used to 
              study the deformation microstructures in both the major  gamma phase and the
              alpha 2 phase, slip transmission across  lamellar interfaces, and deformation
              mechanisms within the  interfaces themselves.  Observations are conducted as a 
              function of creep strain in order to develop an  understanding of the hardening
              and recovery processes during  creep. The graduate student will have the
              opportunity to  interact extensively with the technical staff at both 
              Universal Energy Systems and Wright Laboratories.  This  project is jointly
              funded by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities and the Division of
              Materials  Research.  %%%  Titanium aluminide alloys of the gamma and alpha 2
              phase  structure are considered for a variety of high temperature  applications
              where primary creep could be a critical factor  in their use.  This program is
              aimed at understanding the  effect of microstructural scale, lamellar
              orientation, and  composition on the primary creep transients in fully 
              lamellar TiAl.  ***
