              Abstract  ATM-9709563  Hughen, Konrad, and Overpeck, Jonathan T.  University of
              Colorado, Boulder  Radiocarbon, Ocean and Climate Change over the Last
              Deglaciation      Well-dated, high-resolution paleoclimate records offer the
              only opportunity to observe the behavior of the integrated climate system
              during the last deglacial, a period of abrupt change; but the use of such
              records is hampered by the lack of a reliable 14C versus calendar-age
              calibration curve for the period before 11,800 cal. yr. BP.  This award
              supports a project designed to provide a  3000-year extension of the
              atmospheric and marine radiocarbon calibration curves back through the entire
              deglaciation.  The project will create an atmospheric radiocarbon calibration
              data set from the highest deposition-rate, annually-laminated Cariaco Basin
              core PL07-58PC.  This will extend through the entire period of deglaciation
              with 14C sample resolution (one 14C date per 15-30 calendar years) comparable
              to that of the 11,800 cal. yr. BP tree-ring-based calibration record.  This
              will allow the correlation of 14C- and calendar age-dated paleoclimate records
              around the world, as well as calculation of accurate rates of change during
              abrupt events.  This project will also create a time series of the low- to
              high-latitude surface North Atlantic 14C gradient between the tropical Atlantic
              Cariaco Basin and high-altitude Atlantic Troll 3.1 cores that will serve as a
              record of high-latitude 14C reservoir age variations in this  region and
              provide the marine radiocarbon calibration data set needed to compare
              high-latitude North Atlantic paleoclimate records to their low-latitude
              equivalents and to terrestrial records.
