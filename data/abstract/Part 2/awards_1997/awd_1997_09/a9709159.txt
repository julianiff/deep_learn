Abstract    :
              9709159  Riechert  It is well known that behavior is influenced not only by the 
              design  of an animal's nervous system, but also by chemicals produced by  its 
              endocrine system (i.e., hormones). These two influences interact  in 
              determining individual behavior and both systems are genetically  determined.
              This study tests the validity of the Conflicting  Tendency  Model, proposed to
              explain the potential interaction between  factors  that operate
              antagonistically in determining the behavior of  individuals on  a continuum
              from 'fearful' to 'aggressive.' The PI has identified  a possible  genetic
              basis for territorial behavior in a well-studied animal  model system (the
              desert funnel-web spider Agelenopsis aperta),  in which the action of each of
              two antagonistic factors -  one controlling tendency to flee or 'fear', and the
              other  determining  tendency to attack or 'aggression' - can be separated
              through  selected  breeding experiments. By comparison of the behavior of
              spiders  from  populations that differ in tendency to escalate fights, respond
              to  predators  and attack prey, and selectively bred genetic lineages, the PI 
              will examine  genetically-based aggressive tendency. In addition to testing the
               hypothesis that  hormones may act in opposition to one another in determining 
              motivational states,  the work is important for the insight it provides into
              the genetic  bases of  such complex behavioral traits as fighting behavior,
              boldness  towards  predators, and attack responses towards prey.
