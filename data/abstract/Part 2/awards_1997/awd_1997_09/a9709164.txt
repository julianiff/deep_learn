Abstract    :
              ***  9709164  LE NOBLE  This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation
              and Facilities   (CRIF) Program will help the Department of Chemistry at the
              SUNY at Stony   Brook to acquire a fluorescence spectrometer. This equipment
              will enhance   research in a number of areas including the following: (1)
              binding and   fluorescence quenching experiments to probe partially folded
              states of   proteins, (2) the role of protein surface loops in the reaction
              catalyzed   by the interfacial enzyme cholesterol oxidase, and  (3) the
              mechanism of   the enzymes enoyl-CoA hydratase and acyl-CoA dehydrogenase.    
              The fluorescence spectrometer counts photons of light in the UV and   visible
              regions  and when a sample of material is illuminated by UV   light,  filtered
              to absorb the reflected UV light, then only visible   fluorescence is detected.
              The spectrometer is used in fluorescence   quenching experiments which occur at
              fast rates, and will allow   relaxation processes to be used at various
              temperatures.        ***
