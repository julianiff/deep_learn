Abstract    :
                This proposal seeks funding to develop a formal theory of parties as electoral
              institutions.  The project begins by showing the consequences of treating
              political parties as collections of self-interested actors whose goals are
              sometime in conflict, rather than treating them as unitary actors who always
              have the same interests.  The second part  of the project focuses on issues in
              which voters (and candidates) have similar, strong interests.  One way of
              conceiving those issues is that they are similar to core items that parties
              fold into their platforms.  Both parts of hte project enable the invesitgators
              to answer questions about the positions that a party adopts over time as it
              tries to anticipate it's opposing party's position.  The projects also enable
              the researchers to gain insights into which party members will be most loyal
              and whether party leaders can do anything to encourage party harmony.
