Abstract    :
              This project involves light scattering and absorbtion measurements on aerosol
              agglomerates as a function of particle size and diffraction indices.  The
              dynamics of agglomeration at various Knudsen regimes will be measured and
              evaluated.  The fractal optics and kinetics experiments will be compared with
              existing theories and a new model proposed by the P.I.   A multi-angle optical
              diagnostic technique for size and morphology of particle and aggregate in
              unsteady flows will be developed, with application to turbulent flows in
              flames.    If successful, the study will provide better understanding of the
              aerosol aggregation mechanisms, of light scattering and absorption processes
              from aggregates, and a new instrument to measure the aggregate size and
              composition in turbulent flows.  Application range from soot formation in air
              pollution studies to powders synthesis in flame reactors.
