Abstract    :
                      9709803  Peterson    This REU project will provide undergraduate
              students with an integrated field and laboratory research experience.  Students
              will tackle questions about the origins and evolution of mafic and ultramafic
              rock units of the Buck Creek and Lake Chatuge complexes, in the high-grade
              metamorphic belt of the Southern Appalachians of western North Carolina and
              northern Georgia.  The origins of Appalachian mafic and ultramafic rocks and
              their tectonic implications are actively debated.  Using detailed field
              observations, structural analysis and compositional information, the students
              will provide some new constraints on the origin of these rocks and their
              tectonic evolution.  The first half of the project will involve four weeks of
              field mapping, sampling and structural analysis using facilities at Western
              Carolina University.  In the second half of the project, students will use the
              analytical facilities of the University of South Florida to chemically analyze
              rock samples collected in the field.  The faculty will participate fully in
              research activities as guides, providing students with a detailed overview of
              the relevant geologic issues, and helping them identify and formulate the
              research questions; and as instructors, providing them with direction and
              training in field techniques, laboratory protocols, and the use of analytical
              instrumentation.
