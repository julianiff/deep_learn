Abstract    :
              9709427  Maksimovic/Phillips    One of the unexplained puzzles in financial
              economics is the periodic increases and decreases or "waves" in asset
              reallocations that have occurred over time.  This project models and tests the
              factors that influence partial-firm asset sales across and within industries in
              a industry equilibrium framework.   The project begins with a model of how
              assets are reallocated under perfect financial markets.  It shows how the
              amount of asset sales and the types of firms engaged in asset sales and
              purchases vary over time both within and across industries.  It identifies how
              the amount of asset sales and the types of firms engaged in asset sales and
              purchases vary over time both within and across industries.  The project
              identifies factors based on efficiency and industry characteristics that are
              important to asset reallocations and then asks if a firm's financial structure
              and financial structures of industry firms influence asset reallocations.  The
              project investigates two potential ways a firm's financial structure might
              influence the process by which assets are reallocated to firms: agency costs
              and cash flow shortages.  It uses plant- and firm-level data from the Bureau of
              Census.
