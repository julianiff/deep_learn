Abstract    :
              This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
              the University of Georgia, studying how Brazilian Amazon subsistence farmers
              adapt to ecological changes.  Fieldwork in a `blackwater` (ecologically
              impoverished) area will show how local farmers exploit different soil types
              (floodplain and non-flood zones and a particularly rich soil known as `black
              earth`) to accomplish their goals of sustainability.  The student will study
              four communities along a river, two on `black earth` and two on non-`black
              earth` soils.  The researcher will conduct soil analyses and fertility
              experiments, record crop regimes and labor inputs as well as in-depth analyses
              of the cognitive models farmers use to work the land. Botanical collections
              will also be made to document land use.   This research is important because
              the tropics represent a zone of enormous potential agricultural productivity,
              and this research will advance our understanding of how humans have learned to
              exploit the potential of different soil types.  The study will contribute to
              our understanding of human adaptive potential by analyzing the variation in
              agricultural exploitation in this important zone.
