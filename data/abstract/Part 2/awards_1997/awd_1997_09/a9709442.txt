Abstract    :
              9709442  Kenagy   This collection improvement project will assist a mammal
              collection that has experienced rapid growth (to a total of 40,000 specimens)
              in the past 15 years and has recently obtained strong new institutional
              commitments for activation of its programs of research and curation. Both
              physical and curatorial improvements are required to catch up with the growth
              in the size of the collection. Major accessions include 14,000 specimens from
              forest surveys, mainly  in old growth forests, in Washington, Oregon, and
              Alaska; 6,500 specimens from the private collection of Ernest Booth; and 4,500
              specimens from the Walla Walla College collection. Funds will be used to
              physically integrate all specimens into a systematic sequence and to catalog
              the 28,000 recent acquisitions. Seven large new specimen cases will be
              purchased to replace substandard cases and provide new holding space. Access to
              the specimens and their associated information, as well as the ongoing curation
              of the collection, will be greatly facilitated both by the physical integration
              and cataloging of the entire collection into an already established
              computerized data-base. The utility of the Burke Museum's mammal collection to
              the local research community and to regional and international scientists will
              be greatly enhanced by the proposed improvements.  This project is funded by a
              partnership among the University of Washington, state and federal agencies, and
              the NSF.
