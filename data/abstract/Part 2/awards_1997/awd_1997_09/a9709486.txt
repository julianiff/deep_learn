Abstract    :
              9709486  Chau  The aim of this project is to develop advanced techniques in  the
              study of cell cycle kinetics.  This involves:  (1) the  development of
              fluorescent in situ hybridization flow  cytometry (FISH-FC) using
              oligonuleotide probes such that  one can measure specific messenger RNA of the
              light of heavy  chains of immunoglobulin (2) the measurement of cell cycle 
              kinetic parameters from asynchronous serum-free or protein-  free cultures
              using FISH-FC (DNA and intracellulr  immunoglobulin distributions are also to
              be measured  simultaneously with multi-straining); ad (3) the development  of a
              population cell cycle age model which can describe  protein production and
              simulate flow cytometry bivariate  distributions.  Results of this project
              should lead to a  better understanding of the appropriate cell biology and 
              kinetic phenomena of monoclonal antibody production,  especially under
              serum-free and protein-free conditions.  ***
