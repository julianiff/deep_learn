Abstract    :
              This project will analyze planktic foraminiferal assemblage  and stable isotopes
              over the last full glacial/interglacial  cycle in ODP site 1002 from the
              Cariaco Basin.  Time slices  will be sampled at 100-year intervals to provide
              records of  century to millenial variability during glacial maxima  (Stages 2
              and 4) and the last interglacial maximum (Stage  5e).  Results will address
              millenial variation in the  tropics under extreme climate states, and can be
              directly  compared to high-latitude records from Greenland ice cores  to assess
              large-scale linkages.
