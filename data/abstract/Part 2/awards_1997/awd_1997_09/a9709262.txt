Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to conduct fieldwork on Czech  language use among
              third, fourth, and fifth generation Texas  Czechs in order to explore its
              significance for ethnic identity.  This research will contribute to our
              understanding of the place  of language change and language loss in the process
              of redefining  what it means to be a Texas Czech. It aims to reassess 
              historically motivated perceptions of Czechness among the  descendants of
              Moravian immigrants, and provide insight into  their reasoning about
              discontinued language transmission and  shifting definitions of Czech speakers.
              Such ethnolinguistic  study is especially timely because the current--and
              perhaps last-  -adult generations of Texas Czech speakers experienced the most 
              concerted attempts at purposeful public language revival,  allowing the
              researcher to examine its impact on their self- and  other-perceived identity,
              as well as their language skills and  attitudes. In order to retrieve community
              members' own views,  participant observation will combine discourse-centered
              and  sociolinguistic methods, using audiotaping of naturally occurring  and
              elicited speech, and ethnographic notes. This project will  contribute a new
              linguistic-anthropological perspective to the  study of the place of immigrant
              languages in American ethnic  communities.
