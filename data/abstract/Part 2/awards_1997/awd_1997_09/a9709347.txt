Abstract    :
                This Career Advancement Award is supported by the Analytical and Surface 
              Chemistry Program.  Professor Georgiadis and her students at Boston University 
              will study the interactions and properties of nucleic acids at interfaces using
               in situ two-color surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy.  Self-assembled 
              monolayers of oligonucleotides on surfaces and the factors that control 
              hybridization selectivity in DNA and peptide nucleic acid films will be
              studied.   This work has potential for developing extended DNA arrays that will
              be useful  in studies DNA-drug interactions.  Monolayers of biomolecules on
              surfaces will be studied by an extremely sensitive  surface spectroscopic
              method, surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, using two  colors of light. 
              This new method has been developed in this laboratory.  The  properties of the
              biomolecules as they interact with compounds that are  candidates for drugs
              will be measured and used to understand these chemical  reactions.  This
              information will also be useful in developing rapid nucleotide  sequencing data
              for DNA and other nucleic acids.
