Abstract    :
              9709783  Dilles    This grant provides $20,000 as partial support of the costs
              of  acquiring a heating/freezing stage coupled with a microscope and  video
              system for use in studies of the physical and chemical  properties of fluid
              inclusions. A recently funded research  proposal (EAR-9614683) will rely on
              data produced using this  instrument to constrain fluid inclusion trapping
              pressures to  augment isotopic and petrologic data in the interpretation of the
               temporal evolution of hydrothermal fluid compositions and  subsequent wall
              rock alteration that led to the formation of the  porphyry ore deposit at
              Butte, Montana.  In addition, this system  will be used in combination with
              isotopic analyses of primordial  helium contained in fluid inclusions trapped
              in mafic phenocrysts  and xenoliths to yield insight into the petrogenesis of
              mid-ocean  ridge and oceanic hot spot basalts.  Other projects that will 
              benefit from this system include, studies of fluid inclusions in  metasomatized
              evaporite deposits and studies of fluid inclusions  trapped in diagenetic
              quartz overgrowths in clastic sedimentary  rocks.  ***
