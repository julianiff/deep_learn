Abstract    :
              ***  9709233  DERVAN  This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and
              Facilities   (CRIF) Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at the
              California   Institute of Technology  to acquire a quadrupole ion trap mass  
              spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas  
              including the following:  (1) long -range electron transfer (ET)   reactions,
              (2) bimolecular and unimolecular reactions of peptides and   oligonucleotides,
              and (3) application of metal-peptide complexes for the   sequence-specific
              binding and reaction with double helical DNA.     Mass spectrometry (MS) is a
              technique used to probe intimate structural   details and to obtain the
              molecular compositions of a vast array of   organic, bioorganic, and
              organometallic molecules. The addition of the   technique of electrospray
              extends the range of MS to protein and nucleic   acid molecular weights far
              beyond any other technique. The use of   electrospray ionization in combination
              with high resolution provides the   latest technique available in mass
              spectrometry. It affords the chemist   one of the most powerful tools available
              for the characterization of   compounds. The acquisition of this capability in
              mass spectrometry is   essential for the prosecution of frontier research in
              many fields of   chemistry.        ***
