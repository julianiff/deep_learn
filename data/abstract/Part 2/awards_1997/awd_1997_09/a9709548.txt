Abstract    :
              This research examings the role of working memory (WM) capacity constraints and
              individual differences in WM capacity in the Payne/Bettman/Johnson framework of
              effort-accuracy tradeoffs in the processing of multiattribute information for
              the purpose of choice.  The P.I. will do so with the help of eye-movement data
              and with the help of theory that links WM load to pupil diameter, thus
              providing an on-line measure of effort.  The goal of the research is to analyze
              how changes in the difficulty of a choice task influence choice behavior.  The
              research develops a computational cognitive model of choice that includes
              working memory operations.  The proposal builds on the effort-accuracy approach
              to decision making and notes that there are individual differences in decision
              makers (e.g., in their aptitudes, working memory capacities, expertise,
              experience, etc.).   Thus, shifts in information processing behavior may be a
              function of  differences in capacity rather than a trade off between accuracy
              and effort.
