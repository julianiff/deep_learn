Abstract    :
                This proposal examines the campaign finance advantages held by incumbent
              Members of Congress.  The disparity between incumbents' and challengers'
              campaign resources is commonly thought to reflect incumbents' positions and
              activities with the legislature.  However, the sources of incumbents' campaign
              finance advantages are poorly understood.  Through a series of
              quasi-experiments, this project ascertains the extent to which incumbents'
              financial advantages stem from office-holding, from positions or activities in
              the legislature, or from politicians' personal abilities and resources.  By
              using turnover among members, both within office and within specific positions
              in Congress, this proposal isolates those factors that influence the
              distribution of campaign funds.  The project develops a twenty-year data base
              of all contributions and legislative positions and activities.  Data on
              contributions from specific Political Action Committees and individuals to
              candidates are drawn from the files of the Federal Election Commission.  Data
              on the legislative positions of incumbents and activities in Congress from the
              Library of Congress Information Service and other public documents.  The data
              set, with all the pairings of data, will be made available to the wider
              political science community.  This project will add detailed information to
              debates over campaign finance.
