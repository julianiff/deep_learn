Abstract    :
              This project consists of  two part which are of roughly equal magnitude.  The
              first part  involves empirical research on business fixed investment.  The aim
              here is to estimate and interpret dynamic models of investment.  Models and
              solution techniques will be developed for analyzing the response of investment
              to movements in interest rates, wages, taxes, and productivity.  The model for
              investment will be embedded in a larger macroeconomic model, to study the
              economy-wide links between investment on the one hand and business cycles and
              economics policy on the other.  The second part of  the project involves
              theoretical econometrics, with substantive empirical applications.  The main
              effort here concerns optimal instrumental variables estimation in the presence
              of conditionally heteroskedastic disturbances.  The author will develop and
              evaluate, via simulations, feasible estimators, applying the estimators to
              weekly data on exchange and interest rates.  A related but smaller project will
              continue ongoing work on inference about out-of-sample predictions, by
              developing regression based tests and allowing for a broader class of measures
              of predictive ability.
