Abstract    :
              9709009  Nadler  The University of Califomia Davis Nematode Collection (UCDNC)
              is known world-wide as having one of the largest and most comprehensive
              collections of plant parasitic, free-living soil, freshwater, and marine
              nematodes. The type slide collection includes more than 11,000 specimens,
              including 3,454 primary types representing 930 species and 14 of the 18
              recognized orders. The general slide collection includes more than 53,000
              specimens representing 2,221 species and 16 orders. Thus, the collection
              conserves original specimens from descriptions of new species, voucher
              specimens associated with nematology research, and specimens from surveys
              throughout the world. These specimens are used by scientists studying nematodes
              for research in comparative morphology, taxonomy, evolution, ecology,
              biological control, and agriculture. Efficient collection resources are
              essential for nematology research, not only because nematodes are among the
              most diverse and abundant multicellular groups of organisms, but because they
              have significant impact on human activities (e.g., plant parasites and
              agriculture, vertebrate parasites and animal husbandry, human health). As a
              large reference source of identified specimens, the UCDNC is extremely useful
              for precise identifications in nematology-related research. This project will
              provide a new system for storing slides to decrease the frequency of specimen
              damage, facilitate monitoring of slides for deterioration, and increase access
              to specimens for research purposes. The storage system to be employed has
              proved to be very efficient (in other nematode collections), and is necessary
              to ensure the long-term conservation of the specimens.
