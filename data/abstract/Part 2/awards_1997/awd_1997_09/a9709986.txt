Abstract    :
              This dissertation project examines a sixteenth century dispute in Spain over
              navigation and cartography, which pitted educated cosmographers against
              practical pilots in arguments about the relative value of theoretical knowledge
              and practical utility.  The researcher will use legal records preserved in
              Seville, writings on navigation, and maps and navigational instruments to
              explain the goals and positions of the main factions in this debate -- the
              pilots who navigated the ships, the cosmographers their examiners, and the
              instrument makers who mediated between them --as well as those of one man,
              Sebastian Cabot, who affiliated himself at various times with all three groups.
               The researcher will use the dispute to probe the reasons for the consistent
              misunderstandings between pilots and osmographers.  The dissertation will look
              beyond the pilots' conservativism and ignorance, invoked in most of the
              historiography, to explore their reasons for rejecting the new knowledge and
              techniques of the cosmographers.  The dissertation will also explore the vastly
              different conceptions the pilots, cosmographers and instrument-makers had both
              of what constituted valid knowledge and of why one would want to acquire it. 
              By examining the different goals of the pilots and cosmographers, and by
              focusing attention on the ways the pilots chose what methods to adopt, the
              researcher hopes to understand the problems inherent in trying to make
              theoretical knowledge practically useful.
