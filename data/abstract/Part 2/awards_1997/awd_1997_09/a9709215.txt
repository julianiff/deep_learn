Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              (CRIF) and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) will help the
              Department of Chemistry at Princeton University acquire  a  x-ray
              diffractometer equipped with a CCD detector. The equipment will enhance
              research in a number of areas including the following: (1) new oxides and
              chalcogenides with unusual electronic and magnetic properties, (2) oxidation
              catalysis related to the chemistry of cytochrome P450, and vectorial molecular
              self-assembly in model phospholipid,  (3) reactive intermediates, (4) design of
              compounds which increase the absorption of polar molecules, (5) synthetic
              inorganic chemistry, and (6) unusual structure and bonding in aromatic
              molecules.    The X-ray diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise
              measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule. The
              information obtained gives the precise values of all the bond distances and
              bond angles of a given molecule and it gives accurate information about the
              spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.
