Abstract    :
              9709141  Deitz  This project will allow the expansion of the regionally
              important North Carolina State University (NCSU) insect collection
              significantly, allowing for better curation and scientific access.  It will
              provide space for the collection to incorporate an important collection of
              Collembola, which are not common in insect collections. It also provides for
              the incorporation of a Coleoptera collection that is currently housed in
              substandard materials.  Both of these collections are at present difficult of
              access and endangered by their mode of storage.  This award will provide
              archival-quality storage for the specimens, permit the integration of the
              collections into existing holdings, and facilitate scientific study of the
              specimens.  This award, though small, represents a strong partnership between
              the awardee institution and the NSF, because NCSU has provided additional space
              for the collection and 10% of the purchase price of the equipment needed for
              the project.    DEBpop:RCSE:FY97:Spring:abstracts:9709141.txt
