Abstract    :
              9709871  Levent  The objective of this SGER award is to create a  comprehensive
              hydrometeorological data base for the recent  flooding events that occurred in
              Northern California during  December 1996 through January 1997.  This data base
              will  include the watersheds draining into San Joaquin River, the  Russian
              River, the Sacramento River, the Feather/Yuba River  and the Truckee River. 
              The Hydrologic and atmosheric data,  collected in time and space, will be
              obtained from Federal,  State and local agencies and organizations.  This data
              base  then will be complied in an ARC/INFO Geographic Information  System and
              stored in special 8mm tapes so that it can be  accessible to any researcher or
              practitioner interested in  developing improved methods for the prediction and 
              control/management of floods.  ***
