Abstract    :
              9709491  Engel    This project addresses one of the central questions in
              international finance: how consumer and producer prices respond to nominal
              exchange rate changes, and how those responses relate to changes in import
              prices.  The implications for the behavior for real exchange rates if explored.
               The goal of the empirical work is to allow us to build models of goods pricing
              into macroeocnomic models of open economies.  The link between
              pricing-to-market theories and menu-cost pricing will be studied, and the
              consequences for foreign exchange rate volatility and possibly international
              market efficiency will be examined.    The first phase of the project involves
              reexamining currently popular methods of testing purchasing power parity of
              panel data.  A new model is proposed which generalizes existing work.  It
              allows for the speed of adjustment of prices to relate to several sources of
              price disequilibria.  It also constructs a model for the covariance of price
              shocks across locations that makes estimation of relatively large panels by GLS
              feasible.    The second phase of the project makes use of a new data set
              recently obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  It consists of consumer
              price data disaggregated into 44 sub-categories which together comprise over
              99.5% of the C.P.I.  The data is available for 27 U.S. cities.  Comparable data
              are obtained from Statistics Canada for Canadian cities.  The project uses the
              data to examine the behavior of prices between locations.  The thrust of many
              of the empirical studies is to distinguish between intra-location relative
              price behavior that is due to market segmentation owing to distance between
              locations and relative price behavior between cross-country location pairs that
              may also depend on nominal exchange rate behavior.  ??
