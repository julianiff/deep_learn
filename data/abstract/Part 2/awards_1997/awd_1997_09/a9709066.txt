Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) will   assist the
              Department of Chemistry at Columbia University to acquire a   low resolution
              triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. This equipment will   enhance research in
              a number of areas that include biomimetic chemistry,   synthesis of natural
              products, synthesis of helicene, elucidation of the   interaction between
              functional ligands and receptors, molecular   recognition and artificial
              receptors, and total synthesis of natural   products.   Mass spectrometry (MS)
              is a technique used to probe intimate structural   details and to obtain the
              molecular compositions of a vast array of   organic, bioorganic, and
              organometallic molecules. The addition of the   technique of electrospray
              extends the range of MS to proteins and nucleic   acid molecular weights far
              beyond any other technique. The use of   electrospray ionization in combination
              with high resolution provides the   latest techniques available in mass
              spectrometry. It affords the chemist   one of the most powerful tools available
              for the characterization of   compounds. The acquisition of this capability in
              mass spectrometry is   essential for the prosecution of frontier research in
              many fields of   chemistry.
