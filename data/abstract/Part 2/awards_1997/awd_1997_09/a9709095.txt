              Abstract  ATM-9709095  Jacoby, Gordon C.  Columbia University    Title:
              Long-Term, High Resolution Paleoclimate in the Wrangell  Mountain Range in
              Alaska    This award supports a study to develop the high-resolution, multi- 
              proxy paleoclimate potential of the Wrangell Mountain region of  Alaska.  The
              region contains proven paleoclimatic resources  documenting natural climate
              variability through much of the late  Holocene.  The tree-ring and glacial
              resources make this a  promising area where high-resolution, multi-proxy
              climate histories  may be developed.  Subfossil spruce preserved in glacial,
              alluvial  and volcanic deposits (much above or near modern tree line) could 
              potentially extend the tree-ring record back through the past three  millennia.
               With both ring-width and density parameters from the  trees and sampling dry
              as well as wet sites, annual and seasonal  information will be developed that
              will be directly comparable to  glacial fluctuations.  The generation of
              dendroclimatic data and  reconstructions together with high-resolution,
              tree-ring dating of  glacial fluctuations and geomorphic changes will lead to a
              better  characterization of the natural climate variability.
