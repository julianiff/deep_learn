Abstract    :
              ***  9709273  WILLETT  This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation
              and Facilities   Program (CRIF) will assist the Department of Chemistry at 
              Washington   State University acquire a scanning probe microscope (SPM). This  
              equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the study   of
              the kinetics of growth of self assembled monolayers, the evaluation of   forces
              at protein surfaces, the study of the enhanced deposition of   materials
              controlled on the nanoscale by precisely applied stress,   studies of molecular
              electronic materials, and determination of the   orientation of deposited
              molecular films.    The scanning probe microscope (SPM) enables researchers to
              image atoms   directly. The technique uses the piezoelectric effect which
              involves   bringing an extremely sharp metal needle within a few angstroms of
              the   sample surface. The distance is small enough for electrons to leak or  
              tunnel across the gap and generate a minute current. As the gap between   the
              tip and the sample increases, the current decreases. As then probe   crosses
              the sample, moving back and forth across its surface, it traces   out a contour
              map of the sample's surface atoms. The SPM is used in the   control of material
              used to fabricate semiconductor circuits.         ***
