Abstract    :
                This project explores a general theory of membership growth and political
              position-taking by interest groups.  The theoretical model represents the
              interaction of many individuals and interest groups in a large political
              landscape.  The driving force in the model is the extent to which interest
              group entrepreneurs adapt to and interact with prospective members.  The
              central research questions concern the evolution of an interest group system in
              which several groups may form and compete for members while attempting to
              accumulate resources with which to influence political outcomes.  The groups
              compete with one another by altering their policy positions, the magnitude of
              their recruiting efforts and other attributes of the group.  The model looks
              for patterns of stability while manipulating many of these parameters.  The
              research uses a combination of formal models and computational modeling.  A
              computer package called SWARM, developed at the Santa Fe Institute is used to
              conduct the simulations.  These simulations are used to generate hypotheses
              about group positions and membership and how these affect when individuals will
              join and stay in interest groups.
