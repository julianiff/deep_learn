Abstract    :
              
The New Madrid region provides one of the best opportunities in eastern North
              America to collect data that can help to resolve issues critical to seismic
              hazard assessment. Since 1988, Columbia University's Lamont Doherty Earthquake
              Observatory has operated a network of strong ground motion stations in the New
              Madrid Seismic Zone (NMSZ). The objective is to collect and disseminate seismic
              data for use in earthquake hazard mitigation.

The array produces data for
              studying wave propagation, and for addressing the issues relevant to the
              seismic hazard in the region. It also provides data regarding significant
              engineering problems; especially site response and attenuation.

This action
              is to supplement the existing USGS-supported stations with support for
              additional instruments, together with the associated operation, maintenance and
              communication costs. This will yield a 20-station configuration, with 8
              stations accessible via telephone. It also includes partial support to unify
              the data streams from both the NSF-supported and USGS-supported components of
              the network.
