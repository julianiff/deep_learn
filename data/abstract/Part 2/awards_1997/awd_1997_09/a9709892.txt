Abstract    :
              9709892  McHugh  The Department of Invertebrate Zoology at the Museum of
              Comparative Zoology (MCZ) of Harvard University houses some of the most
              extensive and historically important metazoan and protozoan collections
              available to researchers today. Among the approximately 307,100 lots (nearly
              one million specimens) in the collections are almost 10,000 type specimens. The
              spider collection is the second largest in the world; the crustacean collection
              is one of the largest in the U.S.; the cnidarian holdings are among the ten
              finest in the world; and the hexactinellid sponges probably represent the
              largest collection in the world. The steady use of the collections by the
              international scientific community and the large number of publications citing
              the collections attest to the valuable nature of these holdings. Currently, a
              severe shortage of space impedes routine curation of the invertebrate
              collections at the MCZ; only 2.7% of current shelving space is empty and
              available for collection reorganization and expansion. This project to install
              a compactorized storage system will make routine collection-related activities
              more efficient, allow for the integration of the sponge collection and recent
              acquisitions, and provide space for future acquisitions. These changes will
              directly improve service to the scientific community and will make future
              large-scale curatorial projects more feasible.
