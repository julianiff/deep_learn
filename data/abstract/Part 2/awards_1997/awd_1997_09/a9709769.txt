Abstract    :
              Abstract  ATM-9709769  Prell, Warren L.  Brown University  Title: Development of
              the Modern Analog Technique and the  Planktonic Foraminifera Data Base for
              Reconstructing Sea Surface  Temperature    This award supports a project
              designed to finalize, document and  provide the best possible, internally
              consistent, global data base  of modern planktonic foraminiferal calibration
              data for  reconstructing past ocean environments and reassessing the original 
              CLIMAP SST results.  Investigators will also complete and  disseminate and
              taxonomic users guide for the data base and the  software and user's manual for
              the series of MAT programs and their  environmental data and complete the
              reconstruction of the seasonal  SST and the thermocline structure of the LGM
              Indian Ocean.
