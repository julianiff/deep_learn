Abstract    :
              9709254  Ray    A topic of fundamental interest in economics is the cause and
              effect of inequality in assets and incomes.  This project studies the evolution
              of inequality and its effects on efficiency in the context of two different
              markets: land and labor.  The first part studies the causal links between
              property rights for land and growth in developing countries.  More
              specifically, the research examines conditions under which land tenure
              arrangements lead to wealth distributions characterized by widening inequality
              instead of convergence.  The analysis of land tenure is supplemented by
              examining the market for land sales, which affects the distribution of
              landholdings over time.  The project examines the conditions under which this
              market operates in a way that results in increased concentration of
              landholdings.  The second part of the project studies models of developing
              country labor markets in which nutritional status affects work capacity.
