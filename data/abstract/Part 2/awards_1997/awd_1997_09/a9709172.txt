Abstract    :
              9709172  Obstfeld    How can one reconcile the apparently very slow rate at
              which real exchange rate shocks damp out over time, with the extremely high
              volatility of real exchange rates?  On the one hand, it would seem hard to
              explain short-term exchange rate volatility without assuming that monetary and
              financial market shocks are predominant.  On the other hand, it is also hard to
              explain the apparently very long typical half life of deviations from
              Purchasing Power Parity - the consensus estimate is now roughly 2.5 to 5 years
              - unless real shocks predominate.  This time frame seems far beyond anything
              that can be attributed to the conventional sources of nominal wage or price
              rigidity.  This profound empirical puzzle plagues older models used in most
              policy research.  In their previous NSF project, the investigators developed an
              alternative integrative approach to sticky-price dynamic open-economy models,
              based on dynamic maximization subject to intertemporal budget constraints, and
              on price-setting behavior by firms.  The goal of this project is to develop
              variants of sticky-price intertemporal models that can explain this "purchasing
              power parity puzzle."  The approach taken will consider a variety of possible
              frictions, including trade restrictions and a broad array of possible commodity
              arbitrage costs.  One approach will involve a monetary version of a dynamic
              Ricardian model  developed under the previous NSF grant.  Another will involve
              incorporating pricing-to-market factors with endogenous markups.  These models
              will be used to re-examine a provocative empirical  literature arguing that
              real exchange rate volatility is largely benign.
