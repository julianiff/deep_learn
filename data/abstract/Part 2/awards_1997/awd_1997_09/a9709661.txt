              Abstract  ATM-9709661  Hughes, Malcolm K.  University of Arizona  Title: A
              Multimillennial  Temperature Reconstruction from Far North-Eastern Eurasia   
              This award supports the reconstruction of an annual resolution history of
              summer temperature in far north-eastern Eurasia.  This is at the center of the
              largest longitudinal sector of the Arctic lacking such a record.  The annual
              rings of larch trees from the Lena-Indigurka coastal lowlands contain a
              remarkably clear and strong summer temperature signal.  Approximately  66% of
              the variance of summer temperature is accounted for by the tree ring series,
              and there is reason to expect adding maximum latewood density data will
              increase this.  A tree-ring series for this region has already been established
              back to AD 1200, and a temperature reconstruction back to AD 1400.  Wood
              preserved in permafrost has been identified as being from several earlier
              periods, particularly the first  millennium AD and the first millennium BC. 
              Extending this reconstruction to two or more thousand years length will allow
              natural climate variability in Arctic summer conditions to be placed in the
              context  of time scales  from interannual to centennial.
