Abstract    :
              Abstract for Kudeki and Riggin proposals   ATM 9709251 & ATM 9709030    The
              investigators will conduct a series of experiments using two radars located at 
              Jicamarca near Lima, Peru, to study the gravity wave dynamics in the tropical 
              middle atmosphere over a three-year time span.  The objective is to study the 
              processes that produce the saturated wave spectrum in the stratosphere and 
              mesosphere from long periods to the shortest buoyancy waves.  One of the radars
              is  a mesosphere-stratosphere-troposphere radar and the other is called JULIA a
               subsystem of the large 50 MHz Jicamarca incoherent scatter radar.  JULIA will
              be  operated continuously for an entire month to measure stratospheric winds. 
              The  larger Jicamarca system will operate for a five-day campaign within the
              month to  measure winds over a wider range of heights.  Preliminary evidence
              from recent  experimental campaigns at Jicamarca suggest the presence of
              isolated wave packets.   The new experiments will allow the investigators to
              assess the contribution of these  isolated wave packs to the overall wave
              spectrum.  Other recent experiments suggest  that inertia-gravity waves with
              periods of 1-3 days may transport much of the  momentum that drives the
              quasi-biennial oscillation in the tropical stratosphere.  The  24-hour coverage
              of the JULIA radar will allow more comprehensive analysis of the  low-frequency
              waves and a more accurate determination of their intrinsic wave  parameters to
              provide guidance for large-scale models of the middle atmosphere.   This is a
              joint effort involving the University of Illinois and Northwest Research 
              Associates.  The University of Illinois investigators will be responsible for 
              experiment planning and data acquisition and analysis, while Northwest Research
               Associates will be responsible for modeling the implications on middle
              atmospheric  dynamics.
