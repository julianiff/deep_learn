Abstract    :
              9709420  Cochrane    This project consists of two parts:  1.  Theoretical and
              empirical investigation of the fiscal theory of the price level.   The fiscal
              theory states that the price level is determined by the ratio of the nominal
              value of total government  (or "outside") debt to the real value of (net of
              interest) fiscal surpluses that will pay off the debt.  This theory establishes
              a direct connection between fiscal events and the price level.  The fiscal
              theory may help resolve a host of empirical embarrassments of monetary
              economics.  These include exchange rates (another measure of the price level)
              that seem to have little to do with relative money stocks and a relation
              between monetary aggregates and the price level that is notoriously unstable. 
              This project adds long-term debt to existing theoretical treatments; finds
              conditions when news of future deficits can lead to inflation today, and when
              it leads only to a decline in the price of long-term bonds; solves for the
              optimal maturity structure of government debt that achieves price level
              objectives; and provides the first rigorous empirical tests of fiscal theory. 
              2.  "Good deal" asset pricing bounds.    Pricing by arbitrage, in which one
              learns about the price of a given payoff from prices of "nearby" payoffs, is
              very attractive to many practical and economic applications of asset pricing
              theory including investment theory, corporate finance and even environmental
              economics (the rainforest as an option on a cure for cancer).  Unfortunately,
              the absence of arbitrage tells us nothing about the price of a specific
              untraded financial instrument.  This project develops a new method for
              calculating tight upper and lower bounds for the "fair values" of untraded
              financial instruments from the prices of related assets and a little
              information about the underlying economics.    ??
