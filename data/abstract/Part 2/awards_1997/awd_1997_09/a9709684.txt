              Abstract  ATM-9709684  Clark, Peter U., and Glasmann, J. R.  Oregon State
              University  Origin of the Mid-Pleistocene Transition     This project is a
              collaborative effort that will test a hypothesis for the origin of the
              mid-Pleistocene spectral change seen in the (18O record at (0.8 Ma.  The
              central issue addresses two problems in explaining global ice volume variations
              driven solely by changes in insolation:  (1) a transition, in the middle
              Pleistocene, from low-amplitude, higher frequency (41 ka) to high-amplitude,
              lower frequency (100 ka) ice volume variations under essentially the same
              orbital forcing; and (2) the dominance of the 100-ka ice volume signal since
              the middle Pleistocene when the insolation forcing at that period
              (eccentricity) has essentially no power.  This award will support a test of the
              hypothesis that a significant change in the basal boundary condition of the
              Laurentide Ice Sheet occurred during the middle Pleistocene, resulting in a
              transition from an areally extensive, but thin, ice sheet underlain by soft,
              easily deformable sediment to a similarly extensive, but thicker, ice sheet
              underlain by a mixture of soft beds and hard bedrock.  The thinner ice sheets
              responded in a fundamentally different manner to the same climate (insolation)
              forcing than the thicker ice sheets, giving rise to the observed response of
              predominantly 41-ka cycles prior to the mid-Pleistocene transition, and
              predominantly 100-ka cycles thereafter.  The mineralogy of these sediments will
              be examined for a change suggesting a source from highly weathered and altered
              regolith (soft beds) to fresh crystalline bedrock (hard bed).  An array of
              models will be used to test the hypothesis that a change in the basal boundary
              condition gives rise to a fundamentally different response of ice sheets to the
              same climate forcing.  Support for this hypothesis will be significant in
              understanding the role of ice sheets in the climate system.
