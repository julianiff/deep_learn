              ABSTRACT      OPP-9709130       SWIFT, JAMES  UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA - SAN
              DIEGO    This project will utilize a Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker to conduct
              an oceanographic transect from the Alaskan coastline to a position in the
              Beaufort Sea (Canada Basin) where a large, multidisciplinary research program,
              Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean, will be conducted.  The goal
              of the transect will be to examine the origin and large-scale circulation of
              the water in the Canada Basin. Significant changes in the circulation and
              origin of waters in the Canada Basin have been observed and this project will
              determine the present conditions for comparison to the prior observations.  The
              changes observed over the past several years could be a harbinger of
              global-scale climate changes that are driving fundamental circulation changes
              or, simply, the interannual fluctuation of currents that is independent of
              long-term climate change. This project will add an important component to the
              understanding of global change on circulation in the Arctic Ocean.
