Abstract    :
                This research uses formal mathematical models and empirical tests to
              understand the dynamics of the political survival of regimes.  Using game
              theory the research points to the importance of domestic political survival on
              the part of leaders of regimes.  While such leaders are often concerned with
              external threats to the regime, they are even more concerned with internal
              (domestic) threats from rivals.  The work builds on the idea that leaders
              across all political systems care about various mixtures of policy and personal
              aggrandizement.  However, both are secondary to remaining in power.  Leaders
              have only a small set of instruments available to promote their political
              survival, namely public policies and private goods, and their incentives for
              particular allocations depends upon two basic aspects of the political regime: 
              the size of the politically active population and the size of the winning
              coalition.  The model developed here leads to specific hypotheses about the
              ways in which leaders allocate resources.  These models are tested under a
              variety of econometric models.
