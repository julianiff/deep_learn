Abstract    :
                   This research in the laboratory of Professor Lisa Kelly at the   University
              of Maryland Baltimore County Campus is supported by the   Inorganic,
              Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program under a   Research Planning
              Grant.   The research involves the use of ruthenium   complexes tethered to
              carbohydrates in order to explore carbohydrates as   electron-transfer (ET)
              mediators.  Boronic acid tied to bipyridine   chelating groups will be used to
              bind the metal centers to 1,2 and 1,3   diol functional groups.  Thermodynamic
              driving force and the length of   the intervening saccharide space will be
              varied.  If reductive   dissociation is competitive with charge recombination,
              the release of the   acceptor may introduce new strategies for increasing the
              efficiency of   charge separation.  A class of complexes involving the ET  the 
               donor/acceptor pair divided between the inside and outside of   cyclodextrin
              cavities will be investigated.      This research will extend our understanding
              of electron transfer   through biologically important materials.
