Abstract    :
              9709654  Horch  The long term goal of this project is to understand how  humans
              perceive and control finger movements.  It is known  that humans judge the
              position of their limbs using length  information derived from stretch
              receptors in the muscles  which move the joints.  The specific goal of this
              study is  to ascertain what kind of information about the position of  the
              finger is available from the lengths of the muscles that  activate it.  To do
              so, three questions will be addressed.    Is proprioception in the fingers
              degraded by the fact that  the extrinsic muscles of the hand cross multiple
              joints?    Despite slack trade-offs, can useful information about  finger tip
              locations, as distinct from joint angle, be  extracted from finger muscles?   
              Is the anatomy of the finger optimized to stabilize the  location of the finger
              tip with only two tendons?  ***
