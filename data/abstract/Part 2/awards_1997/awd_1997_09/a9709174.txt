Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) will   assist the
              Department of Chemistry at University of New Mexico purchase   of a 500 MHz
              NMR. This equipment will enhance research in a number of   areas including the
              following: (1) synthesais of biologically active   compounds, (2) mechanism of
              enzyme catalysis, (3) molecular routes to   inorganic materials, (4) organic
              photochemistry and mechanistic   enzymology, and (5) novel main group ring and
              cage chemistry.  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
              powerful tool   available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
              molecules.   It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific  
              arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of  
              interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art   NMR
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier   research.
              The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such   as polymers,
              catalysis, and in biology.
