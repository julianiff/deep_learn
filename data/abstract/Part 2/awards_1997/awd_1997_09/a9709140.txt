Abstract    :
                9709140  Nnaji  The Fourth Africa-USA International Conference on
              Manufacturing Technology is to continue the three previous ones in providing a
              forum for the exchange of information and ideas on contemporary manufacturing
              technologies and their applications. The participants will come mainly from
              Africa and USA.  Many topics on manufacturing technologies will be discussed. 
              Experts from Europe and the Far East are also to be invited to share their
              experiences on manufacturing research, education, technology transfer, and
              international collaboration. The conference also provides an opportunity for
              development of contacts and understanding of research interests between African
              and American researchers, which is valuable to developing long-term, mutually
              beneficial collaborative projects. This is the first Africa-USA International
              Conference on Manufacturing Technology held in the United States, since the
              previous three were all held in Africa. The formal part of the conference is
              scheduled for August 11-12, 1997 at the University of Pittsburgh, followed by
              two-day university and industry tours in the Pittsburgh area.   This conference
              enables researchers in manufacturing technology from Africa and USA to exchange
              ideas and research results and to make connections for possible future research
              collaborations. It has receive support from several African countries and
              companies in the Pittsburgh area.
