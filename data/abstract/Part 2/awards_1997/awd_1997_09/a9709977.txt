Abstract    :
              ***  9709977  SAMULSKI  This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation
              and Facilities   Program (CRIF) and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities
              (OMA) will   help the Department of Chemistry at University of North Carolina
              at   Chapel Hill acquire  a  single crystal x-ray diffractometer equipped with 
               a CCD detector. The equipment will enhance research in a number of areas  
              including the following: (1) structures of catalytic intermediates in   olefin
              polymerization reactions, (2) control of stereochemistry in   radical addition
              reactions, (3) structural studies of cluster chains and   mixed-valance cluster
              complexes, (4) enantioselective reactions of   coordinated ligands, (5) a
              fundamental study of the interrelationships   between alpha, beta, and gamma
              polarizabilities in metal chromophores,   and (6) structural studies of 13-15
              (II-V) monomers, chains, cycles and   clusters.    The X-ray diffractometer is
              used to make accurate and precise   measurements of the full three dimensional
              structure of a molecule. The   information obtained gives the precise values of
              all the bond distances   and bond angles of a given molecule and it gives
              accurate information   about the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative
              to neighboring   molecules.        ***
