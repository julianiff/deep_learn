Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at University of   California
              at Irvine to acquire a atmospheric pressure ionization (API)   quadrupole mass
              spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a   number of areas
              including the following:  (1)synthesis and integration of   non-natural amino
              acids into peptides and proteins for fundamental   structure/function studies,
              (2) polyguanidinium/polyamine containing   alkaloids, (3) structural
              determinations on macrolide antibiotics, (4)   oligonucleotides and synthetic
              ionomers, and (5) dearomatization   reactions of amino aids, peptides and in
              indolocarbazole glycoside   synthesis.   Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique
              used to probe intimate structural   details and to obtain the molecular
              compositions of a vast array of   organic, bioorganic, and organometallic
              molecules. The addition of the   technique of electrospray extends the range of
              MS to proteins and nucleic   acid molecular weights far beyond any other
              technique. The use of   electrospray ionization in combination with high
              resolution provides the   latest techniques available in mass spectrometry. It
              affords the chemist   one of the most powerful tools available for the
              characterization of   compounds. The acquisition of this capability in mass
              spectrometry is   essential for the prosecution of frontier research in many
              fields of   chemistry.
