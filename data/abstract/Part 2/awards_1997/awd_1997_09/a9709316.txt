Abstract    :
                This research develops formal, game theoretic models pertaining to
              international systems.  The research focuses on the problem of how states
              decide to join or avoid alliances.  The models suggest four types of findings. 
              First, international systems show tremendous stability in a bipolar context
              when the distribution of power reflects the distribution of territory held by
              the alliances.  Second, when other alliances are introduced then the concept of
              a `balance of power` becomes exceedingly complex and new forms of modeling the
              process are needed.  Third, the behavior of a nation is very sensitive to the
              distribution of power where there are three or more alliances in the
              international system.  Finally, because of the complex dynamic between states,
              the natural propensity of states is to jump on the bandwagon or hide out when
              there is an international crisis.  This latter finding is especially affected
              the amount of information nations have about the actions of others.  All these
              findings point to the need for a broader understanding of the complex relations
              among states where there is no bipolar balance of power.
