Abstract    :
                Abstract:    This award supports preliminary research in the area of algebraic
               geometric codes.  In earlier work, the principal investigator combined  the
              study of algebraic geometric codes with another active and fertile  area within
              coding theory by introducing algebraic geometric codes  over rings.  She proved
              several foundational results on these new  codes, thus laying the groundwork
              for applications.  These  applications will now be pursued.  In particular, the
              PI will begin by  deriving a good bound on the minimum Euclidean and Lee
              weights of  these codes, which should lead to the construction of new nonlinear
               binary codes with good parameters.  She will also investigate the  feasibility
              of defining algebraic geometric codes coming from abelian  schemes over rings. 
              In addition, the PI will begin research in a  different area within coding
              theory, that of decoding algorithms for  algebraic geometric codes coming from
              curves over finite fields.
