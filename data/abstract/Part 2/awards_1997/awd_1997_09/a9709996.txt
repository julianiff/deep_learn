Abstract    :
              9709996  Weidner    This proposal is to continue a collaborative project between
               seismologists and mineral physicists.  The project's goal is to  increase the
              understanding of the Earth's upper mantle and  transition zone  through an
              integrated, quantitative analysis of seismological and  mineralogical data. 
              During the first year of this project, the  PIs have completed two
              collaborative investigations of the fine  structure of the 410-km and 660-km
              phase transitions.  These  studies demonstrate that some of the details of
              these transitions  predicted by the laboratory data (e.g., finite width) can be
               resolved by seismic data on frequency-dependent reflection  coefficients and
              triplicated waveforms.  Moreover, it appears that the seismic data can
              constrain model  parameters that are only poorly determined in the laboratory. 
              In  the next phase of research, they will use a combination of  mineralogical
              and seismological constraints to derive a new  generation of regional
              upper-mantle models that should eliminate  some inconsistencies evident in
              their published models.  They  will also conduct new seismic experiments to
              resolve the fine  structure of the 410-km, 520-km, and 660-km transitions and
              use  these data to test hypotheses based on refined mineralogical  models.  ***
