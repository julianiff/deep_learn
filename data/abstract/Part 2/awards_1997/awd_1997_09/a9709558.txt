Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is to develop synthetic methodology using the  
              condensations of pentacovalent oxaphospholenes (P(V)'s) with various  
              electrophiles for the production of highly substituted phosphonates.  The  
              methodology will be be applied to the synthesis of phosphonate analogs of  
              biologically active organophosphates.   The reactivities of P(V)'s with  
              differing ligand on phosphorus and the mechanism(s) of  the condensations  
              between P(V)'s and electrophiles will also be explored.  With this   renewal
              award, the Synthetic Organic Program and the Office of   Mutlidisciplinary
              Activities are supporting the research of Dr. Cynthia   K. McClure of the
              Department of Chemistry at Montana State University.    Professor McClure will
              focus her work on developing methods for the   preparation of phosphonate
              containing compounds of biological interest as   antimetabolites and enzyme
              active probes.   Compounds of this type could   have medicinal value as
              antivirals, antibiotics, antiacidosis agents and   could exhibit herbicidal and
              insecticidal activity.
