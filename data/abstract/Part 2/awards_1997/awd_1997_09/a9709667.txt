Abstract    :
              University of Delaware   The objective of this investigation is to improve our
              knowledge of aerosols by estimating and examining atmospheric turbidity. 
              Turbidity represents the ability of aerosols to attenuate solar radiation.  The
              objective is to develop and apply techniques for estimating monthly and
              possibly daily turbidity from readily available surface-weather and
              remotely-sensed data, regardless of cloud cover.  Using a high resolution
              spectral radiation model, the investigators will parameterize clear sky beam
              irradiance and integrate the expression over the day to obtain an equation for
              estimating potential daily clear sky beam irradiation.  Using daily and monthly
              averaged data, the plan is to solve for turbidity at an array of sample weather
              station locations.  By evaluating data for the 1980s, the method will produce
              new and more useful estimates of turbidity trends and variability for the
              Southern Hemisphere.  Plans are to disseminate these to scientists over the
              Internet.
