Abstract    :
               The objective of this Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industries
              (GOALI) project is to advance the precision and functionality of computer
              numerical control machining centers by developing a sensor fusion methodology
              that integrates pre-process, on-machine, and post-process measurement and
              analysis technologies.  The developed sensor fusion methodology will be used to
              measure part quality variations.  Appropriate sampling techniques will be used
              in data acquisition to reduce measurement uncertainties.  Inspection analysis
              techniques will be used to identify part quality degradation factors.  Finally,
              an adaptive technique will be developed to monitor and control the process of
              precision machining.  The research efforts will be performed in collaboration
              with a national laboratory.     The research can contribute toward the
              development of smart machine technology.  It synergizes the research efforts of
              the institution and its collaborative partner.
