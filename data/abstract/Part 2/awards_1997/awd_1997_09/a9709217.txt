Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   Program
              (CRIF) will assist the Department of Chemistry at University of   Miami acquire
              a scanning probe microscope (SPM). This equipment will   enhance research in a
              number of areas including the following: (1)   monolayers of fullerene
              derivatives, (2)  electrochemistry of   supramolecular systems, (3) Langmuir
              and Langmuir-Blodgett films, (4)   scanning probe microscopic studies of
              triazine-barbiturate hydrogen   bonded self-assembled complexes, and  (5)
              chemical and enzymatic   synthesis of oligosaccharides-diacetylene lipid
              conjugates.   The scanning probe microscope (SPM) enables researchers to image
              atoms   directly. The technique uses the piezoelectric effect which involves  
              bringing an extremely sharp metal needle within a few angstroms of the   sample
              surface. The distance is small enough for electrons to leak or   tunnel across
              the gap and generate a minute current. As the gap between   the tip and the
              sample increases, the current decreases. As then probe   crosses the sample,
              moving back and forth across its surface, it traces   out a contour map of the
              sample's surface atoms. The AFM is used in the   control of material used to
              fabricate semiconductor circuits
