Abstract    :
              9709885  Staudigel    The Geochemical Earth Reference Model (GERM) initiative is
              a grass-roots effort with the goal of establishing a community consensus on a
              chemical characterization of the Earth, its major  reservoirs and the fluxes
              between them.  The long term goal of GERM is a chemical reservoir
              characterization analogous to the geophysical effort of the Reference Earth
              Model (REM).   Chemical fluxes between reservoirs are included into GERM to
              illuminate the long term chemical evolution of the Earth and to characterize
              the Earth as a dynamic chemical system.  In turn, these fluxes control
              geological processes and influence hydrosphere - atmosphere - climate dynamics.
               While these long term goals are clearly the focus of GERM, the process of  
              establishing GERM itself is just as important as its ultimate goal.  GERM is
              developed as an open community discussion on the World Wide Web
              (http://www-ep.es.llnl.gov/germ/germ-home.html),  mediated by editors and at
              professional meetings.  Funding is provided for development of a preliminary
              model and for the organization of a GERM workshop in La Jolla,   in March 1998.
