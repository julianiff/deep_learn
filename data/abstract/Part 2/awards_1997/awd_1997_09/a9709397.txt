Abstract    :
                  Teicholz      In recent years there have been very significant changes in 
              the way large owners of private and public facilities have  procured design,
              construction and facility management  services.  The conference will explore
              these changes, why  they have occurred and what has been learned from these 
              experiences.  The impact of new IT capabilities to provide  life cycle benefits
              will be explored.  The conference will  highlight the owner/operator's view of
              this issue with  presentations from large private and public organizations 
              that have initiated very significant innovations in their  relationships with
              outside vendors in the A/E/C industry.  There will also be presentations by
              some major engineering  and construction firms that have participated in these 
              relationships as well as presentation of some research  projects that are
              studying the impact of new approaches and  how these can be modeled.
