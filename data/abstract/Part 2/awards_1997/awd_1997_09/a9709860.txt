Abstract    :
              9709860  Panero  This project will complete data entry for the approximately
              100,000 specimens of Mexican Asteraceae that are housed in the Plant Resources
              Center at the University of Texas. This database is a collaborative project
              among the University of Texas (TEX-LL), the National Herbarium of Mexico
              (MEXU), and the Commission for the Understanding and Use of Biodiversity of
              Mexico (CONABIO), and will be freely available to all interested parties
              through the World Wide Web.  CONABIO is funding a portion of the data entry
              personnel and computer equipment, as well as providing monies to MEXU to create
              a similar database for their specimens. In addition, staff of MEXU, with funds
              from CONABIO, will add geographic coordinates to TEX-LL records, and correct
              any text and locality data that are in incorrect Spanish. NSF funding (provided
              by a partnership among the Research Collections in Systematics & Ecology,
              Database Activies, and International Programs) will be used to hire data-entry
              and supervisory personnel at the University of Texas. Specimen data will be
              entered into the database using the Microsoft Access application BIOTICA
              developed by CONABIO. All databased specimens will be barcoded to insure easy
              recognition of specimens in the database and expedite specimen handling. This
              database will foster research on the Asteraceae and on the Mexican flora by
              facilitating data retrieval, floristic checklists and floras, and the
              identification of areas high in endemism for their potential conservation.
