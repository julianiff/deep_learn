Abstract    :
              Sheridan  9709033    RESEARCH SUMMARY Communities of cyanobacterial species are 
              important in diverse ecosystems because they have the capacity to  convert the
              inert atmospheric gas nitrogen into ammonia  fertilizer. These cyanobacterial
              communities colonize habitats in  which they are exposed to high intensity
              ultraviolet light which  is increasing in intensity due to depletion of the
              ultraviolet  absorbing ozone layer. Studies proposed include the strategies by 
              which these cyanobacteria adapt to ultraviolet light. The PI has  presented the
              results of preliminary experiments that they employ  ultraviolet absorbing
              pigments which confer protection to cell  proteins from UV damage, and that
              communities of cyanobacteria  arrange the component species such that the UV
              resistant species  intercept UV with W sensitive species positioned in strata 
              beneath the upper screening species. When the stressor W is  removed, the
              community becomes disrupted resulting in severe UV  damage to the enzymes
              responsible for nitrogen fixation.
