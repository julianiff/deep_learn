Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) will   assist the
              Department of Chemistry at University of California at San   Diego to acquire a
              400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer.   This equipment will
              enhance research in a number of areas involving   projects in synthetic organic
              chemistry, organometallic chemistry,   inorganic and organic chemistry,
              molecular recognition, natural-products   chemistry, peptide chemistry,
              supramolecular chemistry, environmental   chemistry, and prebiotic chemistry.  
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool  
              available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.   It
              is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific   arrangements of
              atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of   interactions between
              molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is
              essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier   research. The results
              from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such   as polymers, catalysis,
              and in biology.
