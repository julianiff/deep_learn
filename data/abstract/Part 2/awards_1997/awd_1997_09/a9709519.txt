Abstract    :
              Gordon Allport's contact hypothesis holds a central place in social
              psychological work on interpersonal relations. The contact hypothesis holds
              that contact between members of different groups will reduce prejudice between
              members of those groups if four specific conditions are met. The contact
              hypothesis has inspired extensive research and received considerable support.
              Although it has been a very active area of research, the literature is
              disorganized and suffers from several theoretical problems. The current project
              proposes to use meta-analysis to help organize, refine, and extend the contact
              literature. Meta-analysis provides a set of statistical tools that have proven
              extremely useful in organizing and making sense out of a large collection of
              individual experiments and studies. The practical goal of the project is to
              organize the research literature. The theoretical goal is to clarify the
              importance of necessary conditions and to gain insight into the underlying
              processes that are responsible for contact effects. Intergroup contact offers
              strong potential for reducing the hostility and prejudice that social groups
              often display toward one another. The current project will lend some order to a
              research literature that seeks to develop ways of improving interpersonal
              relationships.
