Abstract    :
                This research asks whether local electoral structures have an impact on
              African-American office-holding and public policy outcomes.  The answer is
              important for two reasons.  First, knowing when and how electoral structures
              matter is important for minority groups wanting to increase their voice in
              local politics.  Second, knowing when and how political institutions matter is
              a broader question of importance within political science.  This research has
              two parts.  The first part examines large, cross-sectional data sets.  These
              data are used to determine the impact of local electoral structures on
              African-American office-holding on city council and school boards.  In turn the
              analysis shows the impact of changes in minority representation on policy
              outcomes such as redistributive spending by municipalities and minority hiring
              by school districts.  The second part of the research looks at the voting
              patterns of city council members in three northern and three southern cities,
              matched on population, over the period 1970 to 1995.  These data enable the PI
              to more carefully explore the impact of electoral structures on policy outcomes
              and bi-racial coalition patterns among white and African-American council
              members.
