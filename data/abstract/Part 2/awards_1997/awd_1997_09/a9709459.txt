Abstract    :
              9707459  Arzbecher  This research focuses on the development of an implantable 
              drug delivery device for the treatment of atrial  fibrillation by working with
              a postdoctoral fellow.  The  project will capitalize on the demonstrated
              leadership of  the principal investigator in the field of automated, 
              implantable drug delivery devices, as well as the experience  of the
              postdoctoral fellow in intracardiac waveform  analysis.  The research will be
              conducted in the form of an  academic-industrial collaboration, with the fellow
              based at  Pharma Target, Inc. (PTI) in Minneapolis and working with  the PI at
              the Illinois Institute of Technology.  ***
