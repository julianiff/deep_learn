Abstract    :
                This research compiles a data set of subsidies from national governments, for
              the period 1975 through 1995, by country and industry for members of the
              European Union.  These data are analyzed longitudinally to understand how aid
              levels changed in various European Union countries and industries after
              European trade liberalization.  The primary source for such information is
              published in the European Commission's `Official Journal.`  However, that
              source is very incomplete.  These data are assembled from materials resting in
              the archives in Brussels.  These data, in their complete form, allow numerous
              questions about the effect of state subsidies and trade liberalization on
              economic performance to be answered.  One such question is whether the European
              Union has had an impact on state aid.
