Abstract    :
              9709351  Ibers    This project aims at the synthesis, characterization, and
              study  of physical properties of solid-state metal  chalcogenides, which  are a
              class of materials that contain sulfur, selenium or  tellurium.  Among areas to
              be investigated are (a) ternary and  quaternary chalcogenides of the Group IV
              metals;  (b) quaternary  rare-earth chalcogenides;  (c) structural distortions
              exhibited  by these materials, and the corresponding band-structure 
              calculations;  (d) chalcogenides of rhenium.  Characterization of  the new
              materials will include structure determinations by single-  crystal X-ray
              methods and the measurement of transport  properties, especially electrical
              conductivity and magnetic  susceptibility.  %%%  Since it is felt that the
              chalcogenides may provide a rich source  of novel materials, it is important to
              expand the synthesis of  these compounds as a possible source of
              technologically relevant  new materials with predictable chemistry, structure
              and  property/structure relationships.  The ultimate goal is to  provide
              through the integration of research and education  students as future
              scientists and engineers able to provide novel  classes of solid-state
              materials that exhibit semiconductor,  insulator, or magnetic properties.  ***
