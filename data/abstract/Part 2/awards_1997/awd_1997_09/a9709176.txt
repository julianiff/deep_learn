Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at Columbia   University to
              acquire a high resolution graphics system for 3-D   visualization. This
              equipment will enhance research in a number of areas   that include
              visualization of peptide and protein structures, quantum   chemical
              wavefunctions and electron densities, classical electrostatic   fields, and
              molecular dynamics simulations of polymers and dense fluids.  A workstation
              network of fast , modern computer workstations is a new way   to satisfy the
              computing needs of chemistry departments. Such a `computer   network` also
              serves as a development environment for new theoretical   codes and algorithms,
              provides state-of-art graphics and visualization   facilities, and supports
              research in state-of-the-art applications of   parallel processing.
