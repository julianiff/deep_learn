Abstract    :
               9709944 Kou  This project addresses bulk crystal growth of electronic and
              photonic materials by modifications to the liquid-encapsulated Czochralski
              technique with emphasis on reducing dopant segregation.  The approach includes
              the study and introduction of a technique to achieve zone leveling for
              flattening the axial dopant profile; the idea is to maintain the growth melt at
              composition C0/k where C0 is the desired crystal composition, k, the
              segregation coefficient, and to supply additional material of composition C0 to
              the melt at the same rate as the crystal grows.   %%% The project addresses
              basic research issues in a topical area of materials science having high
              technological relevance to electronics and photonics.  The research will
              contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to bulk
              crystalline materials required for fabrication of electronic/photonic devices
              and integrated circuitry.  Additionally, the fundamental knowledge and
              understanding gained from the research is expected to contribute to improving
              the performance of advanced devices and circuits by providing a better
              understanding and a basis for producing improved materials, and materials
              combinations.  An important feature of the program is the integration of
              research and education through the training of students in a research area
              essential to the field of electronics/photonics. ***
