Abstract    :
               This project involves an anthropology graduate student from the University of
              Chicago conducting an ethno-historical study of 17th and 18th century religious
              practitioners in Mexico.  Consulting archives in Mexico as well as in Spain,
              France and Italy, the student will develop an interpretive model of the late
              colonial acquisition and transmission of knowledge about calendrical lore and
              ritual oral texts.  The study will examine the social transformation mechanisms
              of ritual practices from 1611 to 1819 in some Nahua and Zapotec communities via
              a comparative analysis of social (elite/non-elite) and spatial
              (local/regional/inter-regional) domains based on unpublished colonial
              documents.  The study will test the hypothesis that the social reproduction of
              Nahua and Zapotec ritual practices in non-public local domains influenced the
              emergence of local Christian cults and related socio-religious hierarchies in
              the early 17th century.  The possibility that these practices constituted an
              indigenous cultural response to growing population recovery and to integration
              into a regional economic and cultural domain will also be tested.  The data
              will be drawn from a comparison between relatively integrated Nahua settlement
              and relatively autonomous Zapotec settlements in central and northern Oaxaca
              with ethnographic research in the municipality of Cuetzalan, Puebla.  The new
              knowledge from this project will advance our understanding of how peripheral
              communities were integrated into a national hierarchy through the blend of
              indigenous and imported religious customs, a general process ongoing today.
