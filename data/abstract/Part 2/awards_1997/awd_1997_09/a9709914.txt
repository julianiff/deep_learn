Abstract    :
              Pennsylvania State U.   The proposed activity is a workshop which focuses upon
              the topic of the future of economic geography and its potential contribution to
              understanding the processes of globalization and social and economic change. 
              The workshop will bring together scholars from geography, economics and
              regional science to discuss the formulation of a new research agenda that
              builds upon the traditional strengths of this sub-discipline yet speaks to more
              contemporary concerns and views.  In addition to the goals of research agenda
              development and bridging the `old` and `new` realms of economic geography, a
              distinct objective is to consider and discuss the matter of methodologies and
              the role of teaching in advancing this area of inquiry.  The project will
              result in a conference report that will be broadly distributed to appropriate
              communities of scholars.
