Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   Program
              (CRIF) will assist the Department of Chemistry at University of   California @
              Riverside acquire a Raman spectrometer. This equipment will   enhance research
              in a number of areas including the following: (1) Raman   spectroscopy at high
              pressures, (2) Raman imaging of microelectrodes, (3)   Raman studies of
              conjugated molecules and polymers, (4) Binding of   vitamin D steroids to
              receptors, (5) Gas-chromatograph-matrix   isolation-Raman spectroscopy, and (6)
              Raman studies of molecular photonic   devices.   A Raman spectrometer can
              provide important information about chemical   reactivity from the scattered
              light as it passes through a transparent   medium caused by changes in
              rotational or vibrational energy of the   scattering molecules. Its use may
              enable breakthroughs in our   understanding of the properties of reactive and
              nonreactive molecules.
