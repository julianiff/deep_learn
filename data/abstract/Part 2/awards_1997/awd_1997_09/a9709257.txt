Abstract    :
              ***  9709257  DUNLAP  This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and
              Facilities   (CRIF) Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at the
              University   of South Carolina to acquire an upgrade of the data acquisition
              and   analysis system of an existing mass spectrometer. This equipment will  
              enhance research in a number of areas including the following:  (1) amino  
              acids modified by carbohydrate and lipid, (2) polythio- and   polyselenoether
              macrocycles of varying sizes useful as ligands for heavy   metals, (3) unique
              poly(pyrazolyl)borate coordination complexes, and  (4)   electrically
              conducting polymers of precise length and composition.     Mass spectrometry
              (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural   details and to obtain
              the molecular compositions of a vast array of   organic, bioorganic, and
              organometallic molecules. The addition of the   technique of electrospray
              extends the range of MS to protein and nucleic   acid molecular weights far
              beyond any other technique. The use of   electrospray ionization in combination
              with high resolution provides the   latest technique available in mass
              spectrometry. It affords the chemist   one of the most powerful tools available
              for the characterization of   compounds. The acquisition of this capability in
              mass spectrometry is   essential for the prosecution of frontier research in
              many fields of   chemistry.        ***
