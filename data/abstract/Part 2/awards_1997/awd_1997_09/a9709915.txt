Abstract    :
              9709915  Ruby   Gene expression in nearly all eukaryotes requires the excision
              of introns from nuclear pre-mRNAs to produce functional mRNAs. The introns are
              spliced out by the spliceosome, which is composed of five snRNPs and many
              proteins. These components assemble on the pre-mRNA before splicing begins.
              This project focuses on the role of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein Usa3p
              in the splicing pathway. Usa3p has previously been shown to interact with Snp1,
              a U1 snRNP-specific protein. Usa3p is essential for cell viability and splicing
              in vivo. Its deduced amino acid sequence has several interesting motifs,
              suggestive of its function in splicing. These include several SR, RE and RD
              dipeptides, which are hallmarks of known metazoan SR proteins that regulate
              constitutive and alternative splicing. In vitro assays will be utilized to
              determine the function of Usa3p in splicing. The roles, if any, of the SR
              dipeptides and of Usa3p phosphorylation in the regulation of splicing will be
              assessed by a combination of genetic and biochemical assays.   Pre-mRNA
              splicing is a process for gene expression in all eukaryotic cells. The
              long-term goal of this research is to understand the regulation of splicing at
              the level of splice site recognition and selection as well as at a more global
              level in coordinating splicing with other cellular processes. Yeast is used as
              the experimental organism because biochemistry and genetics can be used
              together to characterize complex transient molecular interactions.
