Abstract    :
                Project Abstract  This is a collaborative project with Dirk Bergemann
              (9709887).  This is a project to conduct three projects concerned with the
              realization and division of social surplus in dynamic matching environments
              under uncertainty.  Project I presents a dynamic and two-sided matching model
              when there is imper fect information about the value of the match on both sides
              of the match. The value of each match between two individuals given by a random
              variable.  More information about the true value of each feasible match can be
              acquired by repeated sampling. The project analyzes intertemporal pricing and
              match forma tion when there is competition in prices for the match partners. In
              an application to the labor market, sufficient conditions for efficient
              assignment of workers to tasks are identified.  Project II is concerned with
              dynamic bidding behavior under the assumption that the true value of the object
              is unknown to all parties at the outset, while the bidder that is awarded the
              object in each period receives additional (private) information about its true
              worth.  Project III continues research on a model of experience good diffusion
              in a market consisting of buyers with heterogeneous preferences. We study the
              decisions to adopt a new product by buyers that differ according to their
              disposable income and other characteristics. Different entry and innovation
              strategies are analyzed for environments where the new product presents (i) a
              potential improvement over the established product or (ii) is potentially a
              substitute of no higher value than the established product.
