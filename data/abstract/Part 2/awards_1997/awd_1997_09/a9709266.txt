Abstract    :
                IUTAM SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTATIONAL  METHODS FOR UNBOUNDED DOMAINS    This
              symposium will be held on July 27-31, 1997 at the University of  Colorado in
              Boulder.   Sponsored by the International Union of Theoretical  and Applied
              Mechanics and attended by sixty researchers from fifteen  countries, the
              symposium will focus on the use of non-reflecting computational  boundaries to
              address wave-propagation problems in unbounded domains.  Such  problems
              frequently arise in acoustics, aeronautics, electrical  engineering,
              meteorology, oceanography, ultrasonics, and seismology &  earthquake
              engineering.  The objectives of this symposium are to improve  communication on
              this topic across several scientific and engineering  disciplines, illuminate
              the performance characteristics of recently  developed methods, and facilitate
              the formulation of improved methods,  especially for highly challenging
              problems.  In pursuit of these  objectives, participants will propose and then
              agree on some generic benchmark  problems with which to compare the
              characteristics of existing methods, and  brainstorm promising approaches for
              the development new methods.
