Abstract    :
              9709717  Silverstein    Columbia University proposes to design a major outcomes
              study, heading a coalition of public and private institutions that provide
              laboratory experiences for K-12 teachers.  While enhancement of teachers
              through laboratory experiences is widespread and enthusiastically backed by
              many professionals, the evidence of impact of such experiences is primarily
              subjective self-reports by those organizing the experiences or by teacher
              participants.  Whether strong, outcome-oriented evaluation research can be
              carried out in this setting, with access to appropriate data, is a matter of
              conjecture.  This preliminary study will identify what information is available
              and how other data might be collected from various types of teacher enhancement
              providers.
