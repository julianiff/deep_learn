Abstract    :
              People are motivated for survival purposes to develop cognitive understandings
              of the world that are as accurate as possible. When their subjective sense of
              accurate understanding becomes strained (e.g., by unexpected events), people
              typically respond with an alerting response to the source of the uncertainty
              and they take some action to improve their state of knowledge. It is proposed
              that the most important source of a motivation for uncertainty reduction is
              one's potential failure to understand the relatively unchanging causes of
              events. When a person is uncertain about their ability to identify cause and
              effect relationships, it is expected to create doubt about one's perception of
              reality and one's ability to exercise effective control. The current research
              focuses on the concept of causal uncertainty beliefs. The experiments examine
              cognitive processes that are associated with causal uncertainty beliefs, and
              some of the motivational consequences of such beliefs. This research has
              important implications for understanding people's responses to adverse
              circumstances, the cognitive bases of human motivation, and individual
              differences in social information processing.
