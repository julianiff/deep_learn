Abstract    :
              9709570  Doddington  The objective of this activity is to continue an effort in 
              the area design projects for persons with disabilities and  expand this work by
              utilizing an existing capstone  engineering design course.  During the course
              of this  activity the investigators will explore mechanisms to offer  custom
              design service to health care agencies throughout the  state of Florida. 
              Examples of recent design projects  include: (1) a page turning device to
              enable spinal-injury  patients to scan through periodicals and paperbacks, (2) 
              custom bathing assist equipment for handicapped individuals,  (3) a baby
              carrier to appropriately restrain low-birthweight  babies during transportation
              to prevent injury in case of an  accident, (4) touch adjustable desks and
              tables to aid  wheelchair users in public places, and (5) a simple and 
              reliable door opener for persons with limited mobility and  strength.  ***
