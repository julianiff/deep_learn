Abstract    :
                  Glutamate receptors are proteins that are essential for  communication
              between brain cells (neurons), and function in  brain processes including
              learning and memory. Mammalian  glutamate receptors have evolved into a
              multi-gene family  containing subtypes with genetic,  functional and 
              pharmacological similarities. Glutamate receptors are  activated when they bind
              extracellular glutamate (ligand).  The binding to the receptor allows the
              protein to open a  channel (pore) through which ions flow across the neuron's 
              membrane; converting a chemical signal (glutamate) into an  electrical signal
              (membrane depolarization). The proposed  study will test the hypothesis that
              one region common to all  glutamate receptors (the M3-M4 extracellular domain) 
              participates in a common mechanism to relay the signal  between the ligand
              binding site and the pore (allosteric  signal transduction). Elucidation of a
              conserved functional  role of the M3-M4 extracellular domain would provide 
              important insights into how ligand-gated ion channels  function.
