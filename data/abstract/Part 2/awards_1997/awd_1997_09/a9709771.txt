              South - Paleohydrology and Geochemical Proxies    This award will support the
              investigation of climate proxies from evaporite-bearing sediment cores in
              closed drainage basins of the arid subtropical high Andes.  A 100-m-long core
              from the Atacama salt pan (salar) (2300 m elevation on western flank of the
              Andes) is available for detailed study, and cores from Rincon and Hombre Muerto
              salars in the neighboring Puna plateau (elevations above 3800 m) will also be
              evaluated.  Precipitation in the region is largely related to the behavior of
              the Amazonian monsoonal system and frontal systems sourced in the westerlies. 
              Temporal variability in climate throughout tropical and subtropical South
              America, including precipitation variations in the Puna/Atacama desert region,
              is related to ENSO patterns.  Paleoclimate fluctuations in the Atacama/Puna
              region would reflect changes in positions and strengths of all  controlling
              factors,  but dominated by the intensity and duration of past ENSO activity. 
              The paleoclimate record will be retrieved from closed basin sediments, which
              preserve a sensitive record of climate change and variations in ratio of basin
              inflow to evaporation.
