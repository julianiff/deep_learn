Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9709902    A workshop on high-performance computing in convective
              heat transfer is proposed.  This workshop would be held at the University of
              Nevada at Las Vegas from March 27 to 28, 1997.  The purpose of the workshop is
              to provide technical exchange, identify the state-of-the-art, and projection of
              future needs and trends.  Participants will include researchers from academia,
              industry, national laboratories, and software and hardware vendors.  The
              program will consist of five major sessions, with presentations given by the
              participants and keynote speakers.  Each session will focus on a specific
              topic.  There will also be opportunities for informal interactions through a
              social hour, two lunches and a dinner.  A final report in the form of a bound
              proceedings will be published.
