Abstract    :
                The investigators will establish a Center for Arithmetical Algebraic Geometry
              at the University of Arizona, in collaboration with the Universities of New
              Mexico, Southern California, and Texas.  The center will further the research
              of the principal investigators; provide a forum for studying, extending, and
              disseminating the latest results in arithmetical algebraic geometry and related
              fields; and enhance the education and professional development of graduate
              students and recent PhDs in mathematics.     Arithmetical algebraic geometry is
              a field of fundamental research which has its roots in classical problems of
              arithmetic and geometry, both highly abstract (such as expressing integers as
              sums of squares) and completely concrete (such as laying out fields for
              agriculture). On the other hand it has experienced tremendous advances in the
              twentieth century and is still vitally active today, as evidenced by such
              heroic advances as Faltings' resolution of the Mordell conjecture and Wiles'
              proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.  Moreover, it has retained its relevance to
              contemporary life through its connections with robot control, computer vision,
              RSA data encryption, efficient audio and video compression algorithms, and
              other aspects of information technology.
