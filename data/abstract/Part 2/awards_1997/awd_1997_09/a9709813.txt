Abstract    :
                This dissertation research support allows the student to explain the regional
              differences in economic liberalization policies in china between 1978 and 1994.
               Data collected concern the regional differences in the governmental policies
              toward non-sate owned industry and the political-economic characteristics of
              the provinces between 1978 and 1994.    The research applies the major
              political-economic theories to the variation in the national and provincial
              license registration, loaning, and taxation policies toward non-state-owned
              industry in thirty Chinese provinces.  Through the test of the validity of four
              explanations - - growth, revenue, political support, and interest group
              explanations the research explains why some provinces were more favorable
              toward non-state owned industry than the others.  In the test, the quantitative
              measurements for the national and provincial reform policies will be regressed
              on the political economic variables drawn from the hypotheses.  Several strong
              indicator variables are used to quantify the data on the national and
              provincial policies of economic liberalization.  The political-economic
              characteristics of the provinces, such as the size of the state-owned industry,
              are quantitative.  The research thus involves the collection of data on the
              national and provincial policies and on the political-economic characteristics
              of the provinces.  The student uses data collected at the major Chines
              collections in the US and China.  A data set on the national and provincial
              reform policies and on the political-economic characteristics of Chinese
              provinces will be produced and made available to other scholars interested in
              the topic.
