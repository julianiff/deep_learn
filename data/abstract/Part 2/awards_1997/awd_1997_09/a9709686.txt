Abstract    :
              9709686  Keigwin    This study will characterize Holocene variability in the 
              western North Atlantic by collection and analysis of  sediment cores from the
              Bermuda Rise, Laurentian Fan, and  continental slopes of the Carolinas and the
              mid-Atlantic  Bight.  Geochemical, sedimentological and microfossil  analysis
              will be used to test whether (1) production of the  lower component of North
              Atlantic Deep Water diminished  during the Little Ice Age and (2) warming and
              cooling  intervals such as the Little Ice Age and the Medieval Warm  period
              were widespread in the mid-latitude western Atlantic.  The project is funded
              under the Earth System History  component of the US GLOBAL Change Research
              Program.
