Abstract    :
              9709145  Markgraf    This project involves a 2-year pilot study, Phase 1, of the
               Patagonian Lake Drilling Project (PATO), a multi-disciplinary,  international
              effort to recover, for the first time, long  paleoenvironmental and
              paleoclimate records from three extra-Andean  closed lake basins in Argentina. 
              These basins lie along a transect  from the subtropical to the temperate
              latitudes of southern South  America.  Previous studies on shoreline features
              from the three  basins document major changes in lake levels during the late 
              Pleistocene, and suggest high sensitivity to climate change in the  accumulated
              sediments.  The objectives of the Phase 1 project are:   1)to survey and sample
              the modern lake and terrestrial environments  for climate calibration of the
              sediment record; 2) to undertake  seismic surveys of the sediments, to identify
              optimal core sites;  and 3) to collect and analyze short cores to determnine
              the  paleoclimatic potential of the records.    An international group of
              experts in the field of paleolimnology  and paleoclimatology is collaborating,
              from Argentina, Germany,  Switzerland, and the US.  In addition, substantial
              portions of this  collaboration are supported by other funding sources: Germany
               (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft); Switzerland (Schweizer  Nationalfond); the
              Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory; and the  Argentine Geological Survey.  PATO
              is a contribution to the long-  term collaborative effort of the
              Pole-Equator-Pole paleoclimate  transect of the Western Hemisphere
              (IGBP-PAGES-PEP 1).  ***
