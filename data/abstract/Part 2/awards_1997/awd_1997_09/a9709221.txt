Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at University of  
              California@Irvine acquire a CCD-based area detector system for single   X-ray
              structure analysis. This equipment will enhance research in a   number of areas
              including the following: (1) preparation of oligomeric   and polymeric
              ligand-bridged transition metal compounds, (2) synthetic   organolanthanide
              chemistry, (3) synthesis and reactivity of   silsesquioxanes, (4) luminescent
              and redox-active supramolecular systems,   (5)  design, synthesis, and study of
              artificial beta-sheets, and (6)   synthetic organic chemistry  The X-ray
              diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise   measurements of the full
              three dimensional structure of a molecule. The   information obtained gives the
              precise values of all the bond distances   and bond angles of a given molecule
              and it gives accurate information   about the spatial arrangement of the
              molecule relative to the neighboring   molecules
