Abstract    :
              9709245  Verosub         This grant provides three years of partial salary
              support for  a technician to oversee operation and maintenance, service user 
              requests and develop new analytical methods for the recently  acquired 2-G
              Model 755-R long-core cryogenic magnetometer at the  University of
              California-Davis.  This is a Phase I Technician  Support grant under the IF/EAR
              program.  Support of a technician  for this u-channel cryogenic magnetometer
              facility is intended to  allow easy access to this "first-of-its-kind"
              instrument in the  U.S. for both members of the U.S. paleomagnetic community
              and  other geoscientists interested in environmental paleomagnetism  and the
              secular variation of the geomagnetic field.  Support of  this position will
              also aid in the development of software to  adequately treat the large volumes
              of high-resolution  paleomagnetic data that can be easily generated with the
              Model  755-R.  ***
