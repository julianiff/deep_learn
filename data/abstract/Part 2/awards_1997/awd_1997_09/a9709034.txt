Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA)   will assist
              the Department of Chemistry at Kansas State University to   acquire a tunable
              ultrafast laser for time-resolved spectroscopy and   microscopy. This equipment
              will enhance research in a number of areas   including the following: (1)  the
              microscopic/spectroscopic   characterization of technologically important
              mesostructured thin film   materials and (2) the spectroscopic characterization
              of the physical   propoerties of proteins using the tryptophanyl residues as
              probes.     A laser can provide important information about chemical
              reactivity. Its   use may enable breakthroughs in  our understanding of the
              properties of   reactivity and non-reactivity of molecules.
