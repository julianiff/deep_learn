Abstract    :
              9709237  Casella  Studies show that not only Overseas Chinese but also many
              other ethnic groups living outside their countries of origin create formal or
              informal "societies" to which coethnic business people from both the host
              countries and the mother country have access.  The main purpose of these
              societies is to provide information about business opportunities and business
              contracts.  The operation and economic importance of coethnic societies has
              been especially well documented for the special case of trade between countries
              hosting recent immigrants and these immigrants' countries of origin.  The
              purpose of this research project is to build a general equilibrium model of
              trade where anonymous markets and networks of personal contacts interact, and
              to test the empirical implications that can be drawn from the model.  The
              project adds to the growing research on integrating network and market models
              of the economy.  Although economists and other social scientists believe that
              both forms of organizations play an important role in allocating economic
              resources, very few analyses treat explicitly how they interact.        ??
