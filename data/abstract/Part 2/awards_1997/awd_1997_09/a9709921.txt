Abstract    :
              The investigator continues studying middle atmosphere chemistry and dynamics by
              (1) analyzing and interpreting the extensive MesoD dataset on tides and gravity
              waves, and (2) deploying the Na wind/temperature lidar at the Starfire Optical
              range to study gravity wave momentum, heat and constituent transport.  His
              dataset covers tidal perturbations in middle atmosphere wind and temperature
              profiles, gravity wave propagation directions and their relationships to lower
              atmosphere sources and middle atmosphere winds, airglow gravity wave
              interactions, and sodium chemistry.  The Starfire Campaign focuses on sodium
              wind/temperature lidar measurements of gravity wave momentum, heat, and sodium
              fluxes, and the associated mean flow accelerations and cooling rates.
