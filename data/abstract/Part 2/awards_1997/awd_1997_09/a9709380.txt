Abstract    :
                 The  trend in electronic design is toward smaller, more powerful electronic 
              systems composed of many VLSI chips, and their design requires new automation 
              capabilities. This research is on the specific problem of modeling and 
              synthesizing electronic system level interconnect, and developing algorithms
              and  techniques that will be applicable to design automation of even broader
              systems.  The approach is to develop a general, but approximate, capability for
              modeling  inductive coupling of large scale system-level interconnect that is
              suitable for  front-end design. For example, the representation of inductance
              coupling as a  function of interconnect dimensions and spacing is being
              determined so that  performance vs. cost trade-off analysis can be obtained.
              Measures of interconnect  design goodness based on controlling the response
              damping, coupling noise, and  delay are being explored. Moreover, a general
              approach, which addresses the  complex problem of coupled lines, and includes a
              means of exploiting extraction  capabilities is being pursued. The results of
              this work will also be considered  for design automation of more general
              problems, such as electro-mechanical system  design.
