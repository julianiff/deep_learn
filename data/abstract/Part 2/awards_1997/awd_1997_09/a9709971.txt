Abstract    :
              OPP-9709971  Flanders    This project tests a method for integrating traditional
              ecological and scientific knowledge.  It describes the similarities and
              differences between traditional ecological and scientific knowledge for the
              western arctic caribou herd; measures the contribution of qualitative
              assessments, from both scientific research and indigenous knowledge, in
              predicting the population parameters of the caribou herd; and evaluates the
              importance of abiotic factors, particularly those that are aperiodic or
              episoidic, for the population parameters of the western arctic caribou herd.
