Abstract    :
              This award is partial support for a workshop entitled "Symposium on Interactive
              3D Graphics"  to be held in Providence, Rhode Island, April 27-30, 1997.  The
              focus of the symposium is on the topic "Where is the frontier today in real
              time, interactive 3D graphics?  The purpose of the symposium is to look at what
              research groups are doing with their high-performance, real-time, interactive
              graphics systems, to find out what special-purpose graphics engines and
              input/output devices are on the drawing board or being tested, and to discuss
              which are the most user-friendly paradigms for interaction with 3D graphics
              systems, including haptic and sonic capabilities.
