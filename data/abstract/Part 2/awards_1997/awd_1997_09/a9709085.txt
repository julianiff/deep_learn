Abstract    :
              This grant supports an REU site for undergraduates majoring in physics at the
              University of Alaska Geophysical Institute.  Research topics concentrate on
              space physics and aeronomy within the University,  also extending to
              atmospheric science, solid state physics and laser physics.  The PI aims to
              encourage the undergraduates to continue their education in graduate school and
              become scientists.  Through relationships with mentors, contacts with
              graduates, attendance at seminars, lectures, and field trips, interns gain a
              firsthand perspective on research scientists.
