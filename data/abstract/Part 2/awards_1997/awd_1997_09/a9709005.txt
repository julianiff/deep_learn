Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   Program
              and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities will assist the   Department of
              Chemistry at University of Wisconsin at Madison acquire a   CCD-Based X-Ray
              Diffractometer. This equipment will enhance research in a   number of areas
              including the following: (1) organosilicon chemistry, (2)   mechanistic and
              exploratory organic photochemistry, (3) enantioselective   synthetic chemistry,
              (4) electron transfer studies in intervalence   compounds, (5) minimum
              increments of hydrophobically induced folding and   (6) mechanistic
              organometallic chemistry    The X-ray diffractometer is used to make accurate
              and precise   measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a
              molecule. The   information obtained gives the precise values of all the bond
              distances   and bond angles of a given molecule and it gives accurate
              information   about the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the
              neighboring   molecules.
