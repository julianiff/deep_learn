Abstract    :
              9709218  Egbelu       Eleven United States delegation members will participate
              in a series of two USA-South Africa Workshops for Collaboration in
              Manufacturing Research and Education. The first workshop will be held in March
              1997 in Johannesburg, South Africa, and the second workshop will be held in May
              1997 in Arlington, VA. The purpose of the workshops is for the participating
              researchers and educators to discuss the current manufacturing research and
              education activities in the United States and South Africa, so as to identify
              priority areas and effective ways in which the universities in the two
              countries can collaborate effectively in manufacturing research and education. 
               The discussions in the workshops will address unit manufacturing processes of
              various kinds of materials, as well as quality control and system integration
              issues.  Topics of discussion will include industrial robotics, high-speed
              machining, automated welding, reconfigurable assembly, semiconductor
              manufacturing, printed circuit board processing, quality control, logistic
              management, and manufacturing education.          The workshop activities are
              an advancement of similar activities which have led to a significant increase
              in both quality and quantity of manufacturing research and education activities
              in South Africa.  It is expected that the activities of the workshops will
              result in a follow-up of real collaborative activities between the United
              States and South Africa, particularly among university researchers, thereby
              leading to advanced technology development, better manufacturing education, and
              improved cultural understanding for both countries.   ***
