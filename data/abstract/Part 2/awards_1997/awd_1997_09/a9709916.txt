Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for a conference on `Current Topics in
              Survey Sampling,` to be held at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln on 25-26
              October 1997.  Sample surveys are universally recognized as an efficient method
              of gathering information regarding populations of interest.  Due to a growing
              demand to solve various design and methodological issues of complex surveys,
              survey sampling has evolved into an extensive body of theory, methods, and
              operations over the past decade. This conference will enable an assessment of
              the current state of research on some of the important topics in surveys, pose
              many open problems, and foster cooperation among researchers in an effort to
              solve these problems.  Survey researchers will be given an opportunity to
              present and disseminate their research findings in a forum that encourages
              interaction among researchers from government, industries, and academia.  The
              conference will also provide a stimulus to junior researchers and advanced
              graduate students working in survey sampling.
