Abstract    :
              ***  9709014  KOPPANG  This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation
              and Facilities   (CRIF) Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at
              University of   South Dakota upgrade their computer and  network multi-user
              spectroscopic   instrumentation. This equipment will enhance research in which
              the   primary applications will center in the following areas (1) imaging  
              surface-bound fluorescent tags within microscopic domains, (2) a  
              complementary experimental and theoretical study of energy transfer  
              mechanisms for isolated lanthanide(III)-ion pairs in CsM(II)X3 hosts, (3)  
              studies of the enolization of carbonyl compounds, partucularly    structural
              effects and electrophilic catalysis, and (4) spectroscopy and  
              characterization of novel self-assembled isocyanide monolayers on gold.     A
              network of fast, modern computer workstations is a new way to satisfy   the
              computing needs of chemistry departments. Such a "computer network"   also
              serves as a development environment for new theoretical codes and   algorithms,
              provides state-of-art graphics and visualization facilities,   and supports
              research in applications of parallel processing.        ***
