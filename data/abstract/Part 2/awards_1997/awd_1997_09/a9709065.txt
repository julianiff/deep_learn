Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) will   assist the
              Department of Chemistry at University of Wisconsin at Madison   to upgrade an
              existing Bruker AM-360 8.46 tesla nuclear magnetic   resonance (NMR)
              spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a   number of areas
              involving mechanism of organometallic reactions,   organolithium reagents,
              organosilicon chemistry, electron transfer in   radical cations,
              characterization  of homogeneous catalysts, and   fundamental studies of
              molecular structures and dynamics in liquids.  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy is the most powerful tool   available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules.   It is used to identify unknown
              substances, characterize specific   arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
              to study the dynamics of   interactions between molecules in solution. Access
              to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are
              carrying out frontier   research. The results from these NMR studies are useful
              in the areas such   as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
