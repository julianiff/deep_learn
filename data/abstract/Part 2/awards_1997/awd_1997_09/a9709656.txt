Abstract    :
              Mark A. Smith of the University of Arizona is supported by the   Experimental
              Physical Chemistry Program to continue his studies on the   mechanism and
              dynamics of gas phase chemical reactions at temperatures   between 1 and 300K. 
              The primary goal is to further the understanding of   very low energy collision
              phenomena and to obtain absolute reaction rates   and product branching ratios
              needed for the modeling of planetary   atmospheric, cometary, circumstellar and
              interstellar chemical   environments.  He will investigate radical-molecule and
              molecule-molecule   collision processes near 1K using a free jet-based flow
              reactor, and   measure rates, branching ratios and product identities over a
              wide range   of temperatures and pressures using laser-induced
              fluorescence-based and   mass spectrometer-based Laval flow reactors.   The
              wide temperature range of these studies encompasses those prevalent   in
              interstellar clouds, and many of the reactions to be investigated are  
              particularly important in that environment.  For example, there is an  
              enhancement of deuterium atoms in molecules in these regions, which may   be
              due to grain mechanisms, fractionation in ion-molecule reaction   pathways or
              neutral fractionation.  Reactions must be studied to   determine which
              alternative is viable.  Our general knowledge of   intermolecular interactions
              at low energies is poor because experimental   methods have not previously
              existed to permit studies at temperatures   below about 250K.  These studies
              will break new ground in physical   chemistry at low temperatures.
