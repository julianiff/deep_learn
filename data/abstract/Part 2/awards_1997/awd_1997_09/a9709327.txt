Abstract    :
                This collaborative investigation researches the extent of issue-based and
              economic-based voting in advanced industrial democracies using new innovative
              discrete choice models.  The research has both substantive and methodological
              components.  The investigators employ an integrated model of vote choice which
              allows them to study the degree of issue- and economic-oriented voting in a set
              of eight nations.  The model also allows investigation of  the movement of 
              political parties in issue space, the removal of parties from electoral
              competition, and changes in the economic context of the election. 
              Methodologically the investigators employ an important discrete choice model
              new to political research.  The researchers argue that past work on voter
              choice in multiparty democracies has been done using statistical models which
              impose very restrictive assumptions on how voters make their decisions amongst
              parties in multiparty systems.  Of particular concern is the independence of
              irrelevant alternatives assumption.  Their model, for this project, does not
              impose this assumption on voters, and it also provides a very flexible way to
              model multiparty  elections empirically.   This project will substantially
              enhance our understanding of the topic and will inform the methodological and
              theoretical debate about it.
