              Affiliation:                       University of Virginia        This grant is
              awarded through the Separations and Purification Program sub-element of the
              Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of the Chemical and Transport
              Systems Division. The principal investigator is Dr. Giorgio Carta of the
              University of Virginia. The research is concerned with the characterization of
              diffusional transport of proteins and other macromolecules in gel-composite
              ion-exchangers and with the use of these materials in protein chromatography.
              The materials are obtained by synthesizing functionalized polymer gels within
              the pores of a rigid support matrix such that an essentially complete filling
              of the pores is achieved. The gel is thus stable to mechanical forces and to
              changes in solution conditions, allowing chromatographic operations at elevated
              flow rates of the mobile phase.    This research addresses the development of 
              new technologies for process scale protein chromatography. The fundamental
              understanding of protein transport in gels will aid development of new protein
              separation technologies, especially those oriented to high volume rapid
              separations.
