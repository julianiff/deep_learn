Abstract    :
                This study proposes to assess the importance of alternative pathways in the
              carbon and sulfur budgets of Arctic phytoplankton and to determine whether
              nutrient limitation and temperature control the size of the different organic
              pools of the carbon and sulfur budgets as well as the production rate of these
              different mineral pools.  Phytoplankton may act as a sink for carbon dioxide
              and act as a source of dimethylsulfide.  Large phytoplankton biomass
              accumulates during spring blooms in Arctic waters, where algal taxa such as
              diatoms and other algae dominate.  Previous work by the PIs indicated that
              polar phytoplankton can be strong producers of dissolved organic carbon and
              sulfur than previously thought.  The widespread distribution of these species
              in highly productive waters of the polar seas makes understanding the
              variability of this system highly critical.  The PIs propose to differentiate
              between the production of algal mucilage and dissolved carbon pools and
              determine their relative importance to the total excretion of photosynthetic
              fixed carbon, to determine the role of Phaeocystis and diatomaceous algae in
              carbon and sulfur pathways, to examine the changes in partitioning of carbon
              and sulfur during exponential and stationary growth, and to study the role of
              nutrient limitation on organic carbon and sulfur production.
