Abstract    :
                  Symposium:  Ioann Veniaminov in Alaska and Siberia and His Contributions to
              Arctic Social Science    This symposium on Ioann Veniaminov's contributions to
              the development of arctic social sciences, to be held in December 1997 in
              Fairbanks, Alaska, brings together Russian and North American scholars.  It
              complements related activities that have taken place in Russia celebrating the
              bicentennial of his 1797 birth.  Veniaminov was a 19th century Russian Orthodox
              cleric who pioneered ethnographic studies of Aleut and Tlingit peoples,
              developed language writing systems for Aleut, Alutiiq, Tlingit, and Yup'ik
              languages, developed a bilingual/bicultural educational system, advocated and
              contributed to the study of the Alaska environment by keeping records of
              temperature, wind, and other climate variables, and contributed to the earliest
              publication on the natural history of the Aleutian Islands.
