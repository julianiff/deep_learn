Abstract    :
              9709604  Pfister  This project will upgrade the bryophyte and lichen collections
              and their curatorial management at the Farlow Herbarium (FH) of Harvard
              University Herbaria. The FH holdings of non-vascular autotrophs and fungi
              amount to about 1,325,800 specimens of worldwide representation. Of these,
              440,800 are bryophytes and about 178,000 are lichens. There are high
              proportions of exsiccatae, and historically significant and type collections.
              Currently, the 76 steel cabinets for bryophyte specimens and 60 cabinets of the
              lichen specimens are nearly filled to capacity and there is no space in the
              Farlow building for the addition of new cabinets. During this project, a system
              of compactor shelving units will be installed in the basement of the Farlow
              building where the bryophyte collections are currently housed. These moveable
              units will increase the storage capacity by 62% and will allow for the
              expansion and shifting of the overcrowded bryophyte and lichen herbaria. As an
              improvement in curatorial operations, the two large and frequently consulted
              moss collections, i.e., the Bartram moss herbarium (about 64,000 specimens) and
              the general moss herbarium (about 179,200 specimens) will be integrated and
              reorganized. This project is a part of continuing efforts to upgrade the
              collections of non-vascular autotrophs and fungi at the Harvard University
              Herbaria. Harvard University is committed to collection improvement and, as
              cost-sharing with NSF, will finance the expenses incurred in major structural
              work associated with compactorization.
