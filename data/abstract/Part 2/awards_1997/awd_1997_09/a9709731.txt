Abstract    :
                PROJECT ABSTRACT  A central question in economics is how markets coordinate
              the behavior of decision makers in a many person decentralized economy. The
              formal study of equilibria in abstract games has not provided a convincing
              explanation of the origin of mutually consistent behavior, because it does not
              provide a useful coordination theory. It assumes what coordination theory seeks
              to explain. Consequently, coordination theory is an essential complement to
              equilibrium theory.  This project provides an empirical foundation upon which
              to construct a useful coordination theory, that is, one that makes effective
              prescriptions, true descriptions, and accurate predictions. Rather than using
              introspection, the experimental research attempts to determine how people
              actually use the strategic details of their environment.  This project
              encompasses three projects: the first project tests models of routine learning,
              especially exponential fictitious play, using extant data sets; the second
              project attempts to discover emergent conventions based on deductive selection
              principles in scrambled payoff perturbed (but strategically similar) bargaining
              situations, and the third project continues our research on market statistic
              games.  The project also includes a component that will improve the conduct and
              delivery of our research results.  During the period covered by the proposal we
              will be putting primary data sets from prior NSF support up on the world wide
              web and moving to a new laboratory.   Both activities are intended to improve
              the infrastructure of economic science.
