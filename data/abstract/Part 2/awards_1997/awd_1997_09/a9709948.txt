              Abstract  ATM-9709948  Song, Jie  Northern Illinois University  Title:
              Modification of Current Surface Models to Determine the  Impact of Irrigation
              on Regional and Continental Precipitation  Change in a Transient Increase of CO
              Scenario    This proposal is for a research planning grant.  In the proposed 
              stage, the PI will 1) collect existing micro-meteorology,  hydrology, and
              biology data from two Long Term Ecological Research  (LTER) sites to obtain
              data necessary to quantify five basic  components of the land surface models
              and their inter-  relationships, and 2) to calibrate and validate the modified
              land  surface models with the help of collected data.    The overall goal of
              the proposal is to investigate the impact of  potential increase in irrigation
              in a transient CO2 increase  scenario.
