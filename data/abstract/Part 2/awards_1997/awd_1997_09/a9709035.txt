Abstract    :
              9709035  Rigsby    Because it is Lake Titicaca's only distributary, the Rio 
              Desaguadero plays a key role in our understanding of paleoclimate  on the
              Bolivian Altiplano.  This SGER research project is designed  to delineate the
              changes in fluvial conditions that occurred in the  Rio Desaguader valley
              during the latest Pleistocene and Holocene  and to correlate those changes to
              changes in the level of Lake  Titicaca.  As such, this study will establish the
              relationship  between the history of river sedimentation and the history of
              Lake  Titicaca and the lakes and salars of the Southern Altiplano.  These 
              relationships will be determined through detailed stratigraphic and 
              sedimentologic analysis of the strata preserved in the flood plain  deposits of
              the modern Desagadero.
