              University   The research will assess the possible relations between pattern
              and process by using a spatially explicit simulation model that produces
              spatial patterns which will be compared to patterns recorded by Landsat
              imagery.  The work will allow testing of the effects of different positive
              feedback strength, seed rain, and environmental gradient on the abundance of
              tree species at an ecotone.  A sample of 30 to 40 rectangular hillslopes will
              be identified for this purpose in Glacier National Park.  The patterns observed
              on the landscape and simulated in the model runs will be quantified using
              common metrics of landscape pattern.  Further a hybrid metric will be generated
              which best describes the dominant variation among the sampled units.  A model
              to predict the observed metrics will be fit from the simulation
              parameterizations.  The outcome will be a deeper understanding of the basic
              ecology of ecotones through a stronger conceptualization between pattern and
              process.  The work is also germane to the notion of ecotones as indicators of
              the impacts of climate change.
