Abstract    :
              This project will examine changes in North Atlantic Deep  Water (NADW) flow at
              the highest possible age resolution  during the most recent interstadials 
              (Oxygen Isotope Stage  3) in a core from the Bermuda Rise.  230Th will be used
              to  determine sedimentation rate and adjust age control, and  Cd/Ca in benthic
              foraminifera will be used as a tracer for  NADW.  The goal is to determine
              whether there were millenial-  scale variations in NADW and, if so,  whether
              they correlate  in timing and magnitude with variations previously  identified
              in ice cores from Greenland.  A positive answer  would tend to support the
              hypothesis that changes in  thermohaline flow are linked to high-latitude ice
              growth.
