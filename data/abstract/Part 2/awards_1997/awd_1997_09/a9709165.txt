Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University   of
              Rochester in acquiring a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)  
              spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas  
              including the following: (1) bioorganic chemistry, (2) mechanisms of   organic
              reactions involving reactive intermediates, (3) reactivity of ion   radicals,
              (4) parahydrogen induced polarization, and (5) photoinduced   electron transfer
              reactions.   Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful
              tool   available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.
                It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific  
              arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of  
              interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art   NMR
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier   research.
              The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such   as polymers,
              catalysis, and in biology.
