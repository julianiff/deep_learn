Abstract    :
                This research investigates the processes people would like to see in their
              government.  Much handwringing has taken place lately, both in academic and in
              popular circles, about the public's negativity toward politics.  This
              negativity cannot be understood without investigating attitudes toward how the
              government goes about its business.  The public is less upset with what the
              government does than with how it does it.  This part of the public mood has not
              been accorded serious attention by those interested in public opinion.  This
              project relies on focus groups and a national survey to tap citizen attitudes
              toward government processes.  This project explores the extent to which people
              want political institutions to give power back to the people; explains why some
              people have more of a `populist` bent than others; and ascertains whether
              people's dissatisfaction with how government operates has consequences in terms
              of their approval of government, their support for the political system, their
              tendency to comply with laws produced by the system, and their enthusiasm for
              various proposals to reform political processes.
