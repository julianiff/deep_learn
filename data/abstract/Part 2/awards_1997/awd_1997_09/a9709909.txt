Abstract    :
              ***  9709909    Because of the world-wide nature of modern science and
              engineering, it has become essential for U.S. scientists and engineers, as well
              as their professional organizations, to remain in close touch with the
              activities and plans of their foreign counterparts, in part as a means to
              facilitate the development of collaborative programs.  Additionally, gaining a
              better understanding of many important problems, such as those associated with
              the global environment, data quality and access, and the training and
              utilization of research personnel, require cooperative efforts on a
              multilateral basis.  An increasing number of such problems either cut across,
              or transcend, individual scientific disciplines.  The oldest and most extensive
              mechanism for facilitating world-wide communication between U.S. scientists and
              engineers and their foreign counterparts is the array of non-governmental
              international disciplinary unions and cross-disciplinary committees that
              together comprise the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU), a
              multilateral organization comprised of non-governmental adhering organizations
              in over 90 countries.  This award will permit the National Academy of Sciences
              to continue to manage U.S. participation in the ICSU complex.  It provides dues
              payments to ICSU and 20 international disciplinary unions, and funds to support
              the activities of the 21 committees of U.S. scientists and engineers who
              represent U.S. interests in ICSU and its disciplinary unions.
