Abstract    :
               The project is focused on the development of a PC-based thermal stress modeling
              program that can be used to estimate materials behavior for the heat treatment
              of large forging process.  The knowledge of stress profile in large forging
              process could prevent the reproduced forging from cracks during the heat
              treatment process.    The project has a balance between theory and practices. 
              Students will gain great technical insights from the validation of the
              developed thermal model in the research activities.
