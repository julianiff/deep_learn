Abstract    :
              9709712  Drake    Recent identification of the deep origin of some inclusions
              from  diamonds opens a way to constrain the mineral and chemical  composition
              of the deep mantle through direct observation of  these samples.  The PIs
              propose to determine the origin of  selected inclusions by matching their major
              and trace element  chemistry in experiments under the P-T conditions of the 
              transition zone and lower mantle.  They hope to identify the  original
              assemblages and thus place constraints on the chemistry  of the source region. 
              In addition, they will develop a rapid in-  situ X-ray technique for
              identifying inclusions in diamonds from  the deep mantle and thus obtain new
              samples for the future  studies of their origin.  The proposed research is
              likely to  increase substantially our understanding of the composition of  the
              deep mantle and its structure.  ***
