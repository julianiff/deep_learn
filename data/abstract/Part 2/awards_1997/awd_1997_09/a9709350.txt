Abstract    :
              Professor Brenda Kesler, Department of Chemistry, San Jose State   University,
              is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Program of the   Chemistry
              Division under a Research Planning Grant to explore the   synthesis of chiral
              sulfonium and selenonium reagents, and examine their   use in asymmetric
              synthesis.   Methods developed for the synthesis of   chiral sulfur derived
              salts will be extended to the synthesis of   analogous selenium compounds.  
              Optically active compounds will be   achieved through face selective activation
              of isolated double bonds by   these reagents with the appealing possibility of
              chiral catalysis through   regeneration of the chiral sulfur and selenium
              compounds.   A Research   Planning Grant at this stage in Professor Kesler's
              career will allow her   to explore a methodology for asymmetric synthesis that
              will form the   basis for a competitive NSF proposal in a timely area. 
              Addition across a double bond directed by a nearby functionality has been   a
              fundamental method of achieving chiral compounds.   Systematic studies   will
              be undertaken to elucidate the abilities of chiral sulfonium and   selenium
              compounds to discriminate between the different faces of   isolated double
              bonds in organic compounds.   In contrast to the previous   methodologies, face
              discrimination affords a wide variety of optically   active compounds in a more
              straight forward manner.
