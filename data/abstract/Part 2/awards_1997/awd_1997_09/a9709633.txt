              Abstract  ATM-9709633  Sugita, Shinya  University of Minnesota  Title: Modeling
              Regional Paleovegetation of the Holocene in Eastern  United States; Upper Great
              Lakes    Climate and vegetation in the Upper Great Lakes region have been 
              influenced not only by continental-scale movement of air masses but  also by
              substrate and regional physiographical features such as  Lakes Superior,
              Michigan and Huron.  Retreat of the continental ice  sheet and subsequent
              isostatic rebound dramatically altered sizes  and shapes of the Great Lakes and
              Lake Agassiz during the late-  glacial and early Holocene, which undoubtedly
              affected the regional  climate.  Shifts in the location of the prairie-forest
              border are  likely to have had further feedback effects on the regional 
              climate.  This award supports an examination of Holocene  climate/vegetation
              interactions in the Upper Great Lake region,  and the preparation of regional
              models of climate (RegCM2) and  flora/vegetation models as simulations of the
              present and of 11 k,  6 k and 3 k calibrated yrs.  A pollen
              dispersal/deposition model,  will link regional vegetation predicted by the
              vegetation models to  pollen assemblages in lakes, which can be compared with
              observed  fossil pollen from the regional database.  Through this model/data 
              comparison, the effectiveness of simulations which couple regional  climate and
              vegetation models will be evaluated.  The density of  good-quality, well-dated
              pollen records in the Upper Great Lakes  region is now extremely high, allowing
              a more spatially detailed  model/data comparison than would be possible in most
              other regions  of the globe.
