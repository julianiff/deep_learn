Abstract    :
              9709976  Lo    If price and quantity are the fundamental building blocks of any
              theory of market transactions, the importance of trading volume in
              understanding the behavior of financial markets is clear.  However while many
              economic models of financial markets have been developed to explain the
              behavior of prices - predictability, variability, and information content- far
              less attention has been devoted to explaining the behavior of trading volume. 
              This project expands our understanding of trading volume by developing
              well-articulated economic models of asset prices and volume and empirically
              estimating them using recently available daily volume data for individual
              securities from the University of Chicago's Center for Research in Securities
              Prices (CRSP) from 1962 to 1996.          ??
