Abstract    :
              9709338  Ohlsen    The nonlinear dynamics of equatorially trapped waves and 
              their interactions with complicated topography  and basin boundaries will be
              studied in the laboratory.  The  new experimental technique utilizes the 
              magnetic body force of ferrofluids to achieve the full  spherical geometry of
              geophysical flows.  A  complimentary finite-difference numerical model of
              shallow  water waves on a sphere will be used to aid  in interpreting the
              laboratory results.
