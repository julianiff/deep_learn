Abstract    :
              This project examines the impact of neighborhood change (moving from
              high-poverty, predominantly minority neighborhoods into more affluent
              neighborhoods) on low-income parents and their children. Following a federal
              court order to remedy long-standing racial segregation in public housing and in
              schools, the city of Yonkers, NY built 200 units of low-rise public housing in
              mostly white, middle-income neighborhoods. Subsequently, a group of very
              low-income, mostly African-American and Latino families was moved into this
              housing between 1992 and 1994. This project would comprise a 2-year follow-up
              study of these families, who will be re-interviewed to examine short-term
              adaptation to their new neighborhoods. This project will permit a closer
              examination of the human capital and other social factors thought to mediate
              the impacts of neighborhood on the social attainment of families. Several
              factors make this an exceptionally rich longitudinal data set for analyzing
              neighborhood effects: the project combines the best outcome measures of
              previous survey studies on housing mobility with social process and social
              interaction measures highlighted in a long tradition of ethnographic research
              on neighborhoods; a quasi-experimental design is used to minimize selection
              bias; a large breadth of measured variables is employed; a high survey
              completion rate (90%) was attained at baseline; multiple levels of data
              collection (parents, children and youth) are used; detailed neighborhood
              ecology data beyond the census data typically used in this form of research is
              available; and the inclusion of a significant sub-population of Latinos and
              African-Americans is possible. The project is relevant to a number of the
              research priorities central to the Human Capital Initiative, especially those
              related to workforce, neighborhoods and families.
