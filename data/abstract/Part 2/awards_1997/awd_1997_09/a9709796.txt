Abstract    :
              ECS-9709796  Kumar    This project is motivated from a comprehensive and formal
              study of operationally embedded avionics software systems that are used in
              automated control of aircraft systems.  Such automated control systems are
              hybrid-possessing both continuous and discrete states.  A Moore machine type
              formal representation of the operational procedures of the avionics software
              will be developed and it will be used to check consistency and completeness of
              the software.  Requisite extensions will be also made to include hybrid
              characteristics of the system. Verification of properties of hybrid systems is
              accomplished by hybrid automaton representation of the system and the
              specification.  We propose to develop a modular and hierarchical hybrid
              automata modeling framework of complex hybrid systems.  Next a theory of
              interaction of such hybrid systems will be developed by extending the theory of
              prioritized synchronization of discrete event systems. This theory will then be
              used to design the required interface logic between multiple interacting hybrid
              systems.  Finally, tools and algorithms for the verification and synthesis of
              hybrid systems will be developed in the proposed framework, specifically we
              propose to develop a method of successive hierarchical verification and
              synthesis.
