Abstract    :
                   This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic   Chemistry
              program with a contribution from the Mathematics and Physical   Sciences Office
              of Multidisciplinary Activities for instrumentation   supports research in the
              laboratory of Alvin L. Crumbliss in the   Department of Chemistry at Duke
              University.  The proposed work will   explore the effects of second sphere
              coordination on the chemistry   (transport properties, reduction potentials and
              substitution kinetics) of    iron siderophore complexes.  Siderophore complexes
              are responsible for   transporting iron from the environment into bacterial
              cells.  Through a   collaborative effort, pendant ligands would be attached
              onto a number of   siderophores or synthetic hydroxamic acids in order to study
              specific   second-sphere effects.  Complexes will also be enclosed into
              micelles in   order to mimic the effect of cell membranes.       The chemistry
              of iron siderophores provides insight into how iron is   transported into cells
              in the environment.  This research explores how   interactions through ligands
              that are not directly attached to the iron   affect the uptake, release and
              transport across cell membranes of this   essential element in all living
              systems.
