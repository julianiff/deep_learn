Abstract    :
              9709199  Kolen  The objective of this project is to develop a system based  on
              magnetic sensors for real-time, high-resolution  kinematics imaging of human
              motion.  The system would  utilize the earth's magnetic field as a common frame
              of  reference.  It is proposed that during the first two years  of this
              research a 16-sensor system utilizing surface mount  technology would be
              assembled and tested.  In addition to  hardware, software would concurrently be
              developed to  support real-time data acquisition and sensor array 
              linearization, compensation and error correction.  The third  year of the
              research would be directed towards the  construction of at least three complete
              systems  incorporating multichip modules for additional  miniaturization.  ***
