Abstract    :
              ***  9709182  IBERS  This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and
              Facilities   (CRIF) Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at
              Northwestern   University to acquire two IBM workstations with associated
              software. This   equipment will enhance research in which the primary
              applications will   center in the areas of electronic structure, both in the
              development of   new codes using density function, relativistic and ab-initio
              methods, and   in applications to problems ranging from chemical dynamics
              through   electron transfer and molecular spectra to embedded clusters.       
              A workstation network of fast, modern computer workstations is a new way   to
              satisfy the computing needs of chemistry departments. Such a "computer  
              network" also serves as a development environment for new theoretical   codes
              and algorithms, provides state-of-art graphics and visualization   facilities,
              and supports research in state-of-the-art applications of   parallel
              processing.        ***
