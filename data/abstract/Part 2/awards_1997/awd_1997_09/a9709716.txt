Abstract    :
                In this project, we plan to perform research on inference of  change-points in
              longitudinal data.    We propose to apply a mixed-effects regression model to
              include  between- and within-subject variation as well as effects of 
              covariates.  Then likelihood methods will be used to estimate  model parameters
              including the change-points and the EM algorithm  will be used for computation.
                 For an early detection of a change in sequentially observed data,  we plan
              to generalize a cusum procedure to incorporate covariates  and unrestricted
              covariance structure.  When there are only a few  repeated measurements taken
              for each subject, repeated confidence  intervals will be derived.
