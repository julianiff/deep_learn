Abstract    :
                This research proposal is an integral component of the international North
              Water (NOW) polynya project, a Canadian led effort to characterize the
              open-water ecosystem in the northern portion of ice-covered Baffin Bay.  The
              region is of significant geopolitical interest due to commercial fisheries,
              shipping access to the Arctic, and to the native Inuit people who depend upon
              the extraordinary biological production in the NOW for their livelihood.  Of
              parallel scientific interest is the fate of pelagic primary production exported
              from the system: i.e., whether sinking particulate materials remain available
              to support higher trophic levels or are recycled microbially at depth.  This
              research is designed to test the hypothesis that cold temperature limits
              midwater microbial activities; it also examines specific enzymatic responses as
              predictive indicators of the autotrophic versus heterotrophic nature of the
              overlying ecosystem, within the context of the flow field.  The PIs will test
              these and other questions by deploying a combination of particle sensors and
              collectors throughout NOW in the summers of 1997 and 19998.  These will include
              long-term sediment traps secured to current-meter moorings, transmissometry
              measurements, in situ camera assessments of large-particles, and shipboard
              settling-column collections.
