              Abstract  ATM-9709117  Barron, Eric  Pennsylvania State University  Title:
              Evaluation of the Role of Climate-Vegetation Interaction  During Earth History 
                Vegetation distribution an d character are largely viewed as a  function of
              climate in most paleoclimate studies.  For this reason,  vegetation has been
              specified as "globally uniform" in the majority  of paleoclimate model
              experiments.  However, previous studies  indicate that inclusion of a dynamic
              surface vegetation is a  critical factor in climate model experiments.  This
              award supports  a project to utilize the wealth of exiting information and
              models  on biosphere-atmosphere interaction, modified explicitly to  maximize
              their application to earth system history, in order to  improve climate model
              simulations of past climates and to assess  climate sensitivity.  The major
              components of the study: (1)  evaluation of the climatic significance of
              vegetation character and  distribution, (2) evaluation and then selection of a
              vegetation  model, appropriate for paleoclimate study, for coupling to a 
              General Circulation Model (GCM), (3) development of a dynamic  interaction
              scheme for the climate-vegetation model, (4) evaluation  of the coupled model
              for modern climates, and (5) assessment of  model results for a variety of past
              climates.  This project  focusses on the assessment of three different types of
              vegetation  models, and will apply them to the Last Glacial Maximum, the 
              Miocene, the Eocene and the mid-Cretaceous.  This project will  enhance our
              ability to apply climate models to the study the earth  history, explicitly
              examine the importance of the terrestrial  system as a factor influencing
              climate, and contribute to our  knowledge of both past and future climate
              change.
