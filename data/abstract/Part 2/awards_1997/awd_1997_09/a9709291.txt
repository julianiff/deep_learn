              Abstract  ATM-9709291  University of Minnesota  Johnson, Thomas C.  Title:
              Paleoclimate Variability Recorded in Varved Sediments of  Lake Malawi, Tropical
              Africa    The award supports the collection of sediment cores from four sites 
              in northern Lake Malawi, to establish a robust, high-solution  record of past
              climate change that spans the entire Holocene.  The  cores will be dated by
              Pb-210, AMS C-14, and varve counts.  The  sediments will be analyzed for weight
              per cent biogenic silica and  for light and dark layer thickness of the varves.
               Biogenic silica   abundance is believed to reflect primary productivity, which
              is a  function of upwelling intensity, related to wind strength and  seasonal
              cooling.  The light layers in the varve couplets are  diatom ooze, also
              reflecting primary productivity during the dry  windy season (June - August). 
              The dark layers consist of  terrigenous silts and clays with admixtures of
              diatoms.  These  reflect the intensity of river runoff during the rainy season
              in  the austral summer (Dec. - March).  The varve thickness records  (light
              layer, combined) will be subjected to evolutionary spectral  analysis, paying
              particular attention to ENSO-scale variability  through the Holocene.  Pilot
              studies on the sediments will include  redox-sensitive elemental analysis,
              organic matter isotopic  composition, and diatom assemblage composition.  This
              research will  be in collaboration with the Malawi Global Environment Facility 
              (GEF) program funded by the World Bank, which will provide ship  time,
              logistical support in the country, and Pb-210 analyses of the  sediments.  This
              will be a collaborative effort with scientists  from Malawi, Canada and Norway.
               This paleoclimatological  investigation on Lake Malawi will be conducted as
              part of the  International Decade for the East African Lakes (IDEAL).  IDEAL is
               a multi-disciplinary, multinational program of research and  training on the
              large lakes of East Africa.
