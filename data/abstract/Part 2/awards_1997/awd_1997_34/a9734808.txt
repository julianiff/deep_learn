Abstract    :
              James Anderson of Penn State is supported by a grant from the Theoretical   and
              Computational Chemistry Program to predict molecular structures and  
              properties using quantum Monte Carlo methods.  Applications of his   fixed-node
              technique employing effective core potentials include metcars,   fullerenes,
              and diamond.  For test systems, all-electron calculations   will be performed
              to assess the performance of the effective core   potentials.  Methodological
              developments consist of computing trial   wavefunction corrections directly,
              and combining this correction method   with the released-node technique. 
              Practical, economical, and reliable methods for predicting molecular  
              structure and properties are necessary in accurate models of combustion,  
              materials, and biochemistry.  Monte Carlo calculations have yielded the   most
              accurate quantum mechanical results for small molecular systems, and   thus
              provide reliable standards against which to test other computational   methods
              in molecular electronic structure theory.  This project will   provide
              additional benchmarks and also develop more efficient Monte Carlo   methods
              applicable to larger molecular systems.
