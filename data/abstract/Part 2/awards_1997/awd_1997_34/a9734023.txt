Abstract    :
              ***  9734023  Tyson  This project explores the interaction between code 
              transformation performed  during compilation and instruction set design. 
              Several  modifications in  instruction set design are under investigation, each
              of  which attempts to  improve overall processor performance by increasing the 
              amount of compile  time information transmitted to the hardware at runtime. 
              Some modifications, such as probabilistic prefetch or branch  table indexing,
              amount to hints that may improve performance  without requiring all
              implementations of an architecture to  use the information.  Others, such as 
              imposition of FIFO semantics on one or more register  identifiers, enable
              compilers to schedule resources and  require that all implementations comply
              with the scheduling.  Each of the modifications will be explored using both 
              classroom projects for graduate courses and individual  research by graduate
              students.  Simulation and other tools  arising from this project will be 
              introduced into the undergraduate curriculum.  ***
