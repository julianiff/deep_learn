Abstract    :
                Jones  9734429  This is an award to support a project proposed in accord with
              the  Guidelines for Submission of Proposals to the Faculty Early  Career
              Development (CAREER) Program, NSF 97-87.  The Principal  Investigator's
              research objective is to conduct work that will  investigate innovative
              procedures to make membranes as components  of processes for treatment of water
              and wastewater that are not  subject to fouling.  She plans on using an ion
              implanting  technique to impart a permanent charge to membrane surfaces.  The 
              electrostatic barrier produced by this technique may provide a  barrier that
              decreases the accumulation of solutes on the  membrane surface.  This is
              expected to assist in preventing  fouling of the membranes.    In accord with
              NSF 97-87, the Principal Investigator plans on  using the results of her
              research as a platform for teaching both  technical and nontechnical
              problem-solving skills to  undergraduate and secondary school students.  She
              expects to do  this by incorporating innovative teaching techniques into 
              classroom lectures, development of a web-based course in  environmental
              engineering and development of an effective  outreach program targeted to
              attract and retain minority students  in educational programs that lead to
              competence in environmental  engineering practice.  ***
