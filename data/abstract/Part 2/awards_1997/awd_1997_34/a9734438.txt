Abstract    :
              Program: Physical Foundations of Enabling Technologies    CAREER Competition   
              Proposal Number:  ECS-9734438  Principle Investigator: Ann Mescher    Title:
              CAREER: Discovery and transfer of knowledge enabling manufacture of polymer
              materials with specialized optical characteristics          Abstract    The
              proposed research is related to numerical modeling and experimental
              characterization of polymer optical fibers.  Through strong collaboration with
              industrial sponsors, the PI will receive specific processing conditions to
              simulate the manufacturing process and to verify experimentally numerical
              predictions regarding to the refractive index profile and bandwidth of the
              polymer fiber. The educational plan includes the development of an
              interdisciplinary graduate course, and to establish collaboration with the
              ECSEL coalition and an outreach effort to women and minorities in engineering. 
                This proposal is recommended for a CAREER award at $200,000 for 48 months.
