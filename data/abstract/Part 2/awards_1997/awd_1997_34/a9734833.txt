This award provides partial support for US participants to
              attend an international workshop on nonlinear model predictive control to be
              held in Ascona, Switzerland, June 3-5, 1998.  The co-organizers are Zhi (Alex)
              Qiang Zheng of the University of Massachusetts and Frank Allgower of the Swiss
              Federal Institute of Technology.  The purpose of the workshop is to gather
              researchers from the US and Europe to assess and discuss current status and
              future research directions in nonlinear model predictive control and to
              identify areas for future international collaboration.   Three areas will
              constitute the main topics of the workshop:  theory of estimation, stability
              and robustness; computation; and applications in all areas including chemical
              and manufacturing processes.
