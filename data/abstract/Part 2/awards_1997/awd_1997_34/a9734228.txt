              Title:  CAREER:Scanning Probe Microscopy of Photonic and Electronic Materials. 
                Abstract        The proposed research is related to the used of scanning
              probe microscopy to characterize, understand, and help improve materials issues
              in optelectronic devices.  Properties such as dopant distribution and the
              electronic and optical properties on a nanometer scale will be measured and
              characterized using in situ Scanning Probe Microscopy techniques. The
              measurement techniques and tools developed in this work will have significant
              impact in the area of materials characterization on a nanometer scale, and it
              may leads to the understanding of new phenomina and the development of novel
              devices. The PIs connection with outside groups who will provide him with
              materials was noted.  The educational component of the proposed work including
              the development of Junior/Senior Lab courses, and the supervision of
              undergraduate students projects is also considered adequate.  In general, it is
              felt  that  the PI is highly qualified to successfully perform the proposed
              work. It is because of the expected high impact of the proposed research and
              educational activities that this proposal was highly recommended by the panel. 
                Based on the panel discussion and the potential merit, this proposal is
              recommended for the CAREER award at $200,000 over 48 months.
