              Title: CAREER: Al-free vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) for
              reliable, high-single-mode output power      Abstract     This proposal is
              aimed at (1) developing aluminum-free, InGaAsP/GaAs-based vertical cavity
              surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) for high reliability and high single-mode
              output power, and (2) to integrate III/V compound semiconductor device design
              principles and fabrication into the undergraduate course curriculum at the
              University of Wisconsin-Madison.    This proposal is recommended for a CAREER
              award at $200,000 for 48 months.
