Abstract    :
              9734102  Large software projects produce many documents of many  different types
              that, together, describe the plans for,  implementation of, and experience with
              the program. Ensuring  that these documents do not have serious conflicts with
              each  other is a critical task in any real software system, but  requires a
              level of integration among the different types of  software documents that is
              not possible with current  development tools. This research project is working
              to  identify the document representations, software tools, and  user interface
              services that are required to integrate  program source code and all other
              software documents into a  seamless, interconnected whole. The project is
              producing a  prototype development environment that allows arbitrary 
              multimedia documentation and hyperlinks inside program  source files and
              additional tools for managing and  understanding the relationships between
              software documents.  This research is significant because it is breaking down
              the  barriers that currently exist between program source code  and the natural
              language documents that motivate, evaluate,  and explain it. The educational
              component of this CAREER  project seeks to attract students from
              underrepresented  groups to the study of computer science through outreach and 
              a summer program curriculum and is also enhancing the  department's software
              curriculum through new graduate course  offerings.  ***
