Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    Proposal Number: CTS-9734384     Principle Investigator:  Bonazza   
              This is a Career Award to conduct experiments to study the evolution of the
              instability developing at a fluid interface accelerated by strong shock-waves
              (up to M = 4 in atmospheric air).  The experiments will be carried out in a new
              vertical, square shocktube of large (25 x 25 cm) cross section.  The time
              evolution (at both the early, linear and late, non-linear stages) of interfaces
              with various density ratios will be studied, for several values of the incident
              shock's Mach number.  Both continuous (gravitationally stratified) and
              discontinuous (membrane-based) interfaces will be studied.  The study of the
              evolution of the interface (with particular emphasis placed on the growth rates
              of its perturbations and thickness) will be based on high spatial resolution,
              quantitative imaging of planar, vertical cross sections of the interface. 
              Diagnostic techniques will include planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) and
              Rayleigh scattering, both to be implemented with a pulsed ND:YAG laser.  This
              topic represents an important unresolved problem  in fluid mechanics.  It is
              related to the overturn of supernova cores, reactive and non-reactive mixing
              processes in industrial settings and laser-implosion of microtargets in
              inertial-confinement fusion experiments.
