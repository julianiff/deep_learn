Abstract    :
                  This project investigators scheduling protocols for the  transmission of
              multimedia traffic in a network.  Specifically,  the research covers the
              following areas: point to point  transmission of general multimedia objectsthe
              support of  multicast communications fault-tolerance.  The goals of the 
              project are the development of strong theoretical foundations for  the study of
              such problems and subsequently finding protocols  that perform well in
              practice.
