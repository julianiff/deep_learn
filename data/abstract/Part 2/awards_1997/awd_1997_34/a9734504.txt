Abstract    :
              This  research examines telepresence, "the sense of being present  at  a  remote
              site," which has been identified as a design  ideal  for  teleoperators and
              virtual environments.  It is  intended  to  resolve extant confusion as to the
              origins of telepresence and to  develop a plausible and parsimonious
              telepresence model.  This is  to  be  accomplished by empirical investigations
              of teleoperation  system  and  human  factor  effects  on  subjective  measures
               of  telepresence  along with studies of physiological  variables  and  mental 
              constructs, including attention and situation  awareness,  for objectively
              representing telepresence.  The research involves  developing  a descriptive
              model of telepresence in attention  for  understanding  the  phenomenon  and 
              predicting  its  effect   on  teleoperation  performance.   Design  guidelines 
              for   synthetic  environment configuration are also to be formulated based on 
              the  model.   The  effort  is  expected to  serve  as  a  vehicle  for 
              promoting  the  effective transport of human  perceptuo-cognitive  capabilities
              into remote environments through unique teleoperator  applications, such as the
              exploration of Mars, by encouraging  in  operators a sense of being at the
              remote site.  Outcomes  of  the  work  are  anticipated to be applicable to
              design of the spectrum  of  teleoperators and virtual environments and will be
              integrated  in  graduate student education in cognitive engineering  for  the 
              21st Century.
