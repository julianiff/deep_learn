Abstract    :
              Ludwik Adamowicz is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and  
              Computational Chemistry Program to develop a state-selective   multireference
              coupled-cluster approach to electron correlation in   quantum chemistry.  This
              method produces accurate potential energy   surfaces of both ground and excited
              states, including bond making and   breaking processes.  This method will
              handle complete-active-space   reference functions, incorporate spin adaptation
              and first-order   response, and execute via an efficient production code. 
              Additionally,   several applications of the new methodology will be pursued,
              including   the photophysics of nucleic acid bases, carbon clusters, and
              silicon   clusters.  One of the major goals of theoretical chemisty is the
              computation of   potential energy surfaces of molecular excited states, of
              sufficient   accuracy to describe the dynamics of transformations such as bond 
               breakage and formation.  Excited state processes play a major role in  
              photochemistry, and thus have relevance in astrophysics as well as  
              ultraviolet-induced reactions of nucleic acids.
