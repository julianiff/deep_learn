Abstract    :
              9734478  Spalding  Ion channels are protein molecules that conduct electrically
              charged atoms or groups of atoms (ions) across the oily, lipid bilayer of
              cellular membranes.  Recent research has shown that ion transport by channels
              is an important component of the mechanisms plants use to detect signals such
              as hormones, light, gravity, and temperature.  Dr. Spalding proposes
              experiments that will test whether a gene the PIs have recently cloned encodes
              the chloride channel that the PIs have found to function in the detection of
              light cues important to seedling growth and development.  The cloning of such a
              gene would enable the amalgamation of molecular genetic and biophysical
              techniques,  creating unique opportunities to advance the PI's understanding of
              how the environment influences the growth and development of plants.  The
              seedling root will be the focus of the present work because the chloride
              channel just mentioned is also necessary for the formation of root hairs,
              specialized cells important to the task of absorbing nutrients and water from
              the soil.  Also to be performed are experiments designed to determine the role
              of the AKT1 channel in the uptake of potassium, an essential element, by roots
              of the Arabidopsis plant.  A mutant plant lacking the AKT1 gene will be used in
              an unprecedented combination of genetic and biophysical studies of this
              agronomically important uptake process.  For the educational component of this
              proposal, Dr. Spalding will develop laboratory exercises that will enhance the
              teaching of ion channels and membrane transport in the plant physiology
              curriculum.  A reference manual will be prepared and distributed freely to
              interested educators.
