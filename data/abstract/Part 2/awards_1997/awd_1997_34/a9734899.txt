Abstract    :
              9734899  Roth    "Evaluation of Reliability of the Earth Resistivity Method  in
              Thinly  Mantled Karst"    Sinkhole occurrences in areas of thinly mantles karst
              are a  common  cause of cost overruns during construction and failures of 
              structures  during their useful life.  The frequency of these failures  can be 
              reduced by improved geotechnical site investigation prior to  construction. 
              The objective of the proposed study is to  investigate  and demonstrate the use
              of resistivity methods to increase  the  reliability of foundation design in
              karst areas with clay  soils.    At the present time, methods of site
              investigation in karst  areas with  clay soils are generally limited to borings
              and other types  of  intrusive probes.  The reliability of these methods for 
              locating  conditions which may lead to the formation of sinkholes is  poor. 
              The  research activities in this study will evaluate the  reliability of the 
              earth resistivity method as a tool for site investigation in  these  areas and
              demonstrate its use as a method to improve  foundation  reliability.    In this
              study, two areas of known subsurface voids and  frequent  sinkhole formation
              will be investigated.  Line surveys at a  number of  different spacings will be
              conducted using an earth  resistivity meter  with multiple electrodes. 
              Anomalies indicated by the data  will be  confirmed using boring methods or
              excavation.  The results  of the  testing will be used to develop relationships
              between line  and node  spacing and the probability of detecting an anomaly of
              a  given size.  ***
