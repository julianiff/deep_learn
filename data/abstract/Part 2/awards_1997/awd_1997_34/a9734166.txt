Abstract    :
              The use of proprietary designs (reusable cores) as part of VLSI systems on a
              chip  depends on having reliable and efficient techniques for intellectual
              property  (IP) protection. This research investigates techniques for such
              protection. It  includes a watermarking (signature hiding) approach for
              protecting CAD tools,  reusable cores, and embedded software. Also being
              explored is a fingerprinting  scheme, and a covert channel-based technique for
              the efficient detection of  misappropriated (stolen) IP. The watermarking
              approach is the addition of design  and/or timing constraints in the design
              specification which encode the author's  signature. Fingerprinting techniques
              are meant to deter people from illegally  distributing IP by enabling the
              author of the IP to uniquely identify the  original buyer of a resold copy. The
              concept of covert channels is the basis for  techniques which convey to the
              author information without alerting an illegal  owner of IP. The effectiveness
              of the proposed techniques and algorithms will be  demonstrated on industrial
              strength designs.  The educational plan includes the  development and use of
              watermarking techniques and video games for teaching IP  protection techniques
              and other material.
