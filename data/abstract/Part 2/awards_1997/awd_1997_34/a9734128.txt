Abstract    :
              The objectives of this research and educational program are to develop new
              formalisms   and methods for artificial intelligence by combining a sound
              theoretical approach with a   principled experimental component, to provide a
              practical evaluation of the proposed   models and relate them to real-world
              applications and challenges, and to educate the next   generation of computer
              science students about the ambitious and challenging goals of   artificial
              intelligence.  To develop successful applications, general search and reasoning
              has   been avoided in recent years by  explicitly incorporating large amounts
              of domain-specific   knowledge.  Such a knowledge-intensive approach has been
              successful in, for example,   expert systems; but in areas such as general
              planning or reasoning, progress has been   disappointing, and specific
              knowledge acquisition is often difficult and expensive.    However, recent
              advances in general methods combined with faster hardware and better 
              implementations provide strong evidence that a compute-intensive approach is
              not only   suitable for dealing with the combinatorial nature of many AI
              formalisms, but may also be   required to supplement domain-specific knowledge.
               This research studies fast general   reasoning and search methods, with an
              emphasis on stochastic procedures, which are a   promising recent development
              for solving computationally hard problems.  It also  investigates the various
              sources of complexity in hard problems, using both theoretical and  
              experimental methods, exploring interesting connections between computer
              science,   artificial intelligence, and statistical physics. In addition, it is
              studying issues in problem   representation, including robustness of encodings,
              abstraction, compilation, and   approximation methods.  The result is expected
              to be new general approaches to artificial  intelligence that are applicable to
              a wide variety of problems in such areas as planning,   operations research,
              and computational biology.   http://simon.cs.cornell.edu/home/selman/
