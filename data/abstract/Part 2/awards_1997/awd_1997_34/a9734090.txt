              Berkeley  Title: CAREER: A Framework for Resource Allocation in Wireless
              Networks with Multi-User Receivers 
              ________________________________________________________________      A central
              problem in the design of wireless networks is how to use the limited resources
              most to meet the quality-of-service requirements of applications. Two
              particular classes of techniques have received much attention: 1) at the
              physical layer, development of novel multi-user receiver structures which
              mitigate interference between users; 2) at the network layer, dynamic
              allocation of resources such as transmit power, bandwidth and bit-rates in
              adaptation to channel conditions. While the networking aspects for conventional
              multi-access techniques are well understood, the same cannot be said for
              problems of resource allocation and power control in the context of these
              multi-user receivers.     In this project, we propose to establish a coherent
              framework to study problems of dynamic resource allocation for multi-user
              receivers in an integrated manner, drawing on information theory as a
              fundamental basis for performance evaluation.  The specific topics we will
              study in the proposed framework are: 1) linear multi-user receivers: system
              capacity under optimal power control; 2) optimal resource allocation for
              Shannon capacity-achieving multi-user receivers; 3) capacity gain from the use
              of adaptive antenna arrays; 4) impact of multipath fading on achievable
              capacity; 5) resource allocation for cellular networks with multi-user
              receivers.    The solution of problems in resource allocation and QOS
              provisioning in wireless networks requires a marriage of networking and
              physical layer concepts. With this in mind, my education plan aims to
              accomplish the more general goal of providing a solid theoretical basis to our
              students in networking and communications, as well as the more specific goal of
              highlighting the interplay between networking and physica l layer concepts in
              wireless networking.  These goals will be implemented by course development in
              four subjects.
