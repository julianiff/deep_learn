Abstract    :
              New digital information resources necessitate the creation of new tools for
              resource discovery. Users must negotiate a large number of collections of
              information, such as new digital libraries and the collections of traditional
              libraries and museums. The distribution of resources into separate domains
              prevents optimal searching, and users must search multiple systems sequentially
              in order to perform exhaustive searches. The solution to this problem is to
              provide an integrated control of resources so users can locate information
              without regard to its location. The focus of this project is to investigate
              user behavior in the selection of diverse information resources from
              distributed collections using qualitative field work methods. A prototype
              system which integrates various types of metadata and forms networks of
              linkages is used to determine how users select resources. The educational
              component of this project is to develop a broad interdisciplinary program that
              integrates various theories in information retrieval. The curriculum is
              intended to provide students with a technological grounding and a theoretical
              framework for addressing significant problems relating to networked information
              resource discovery and retrieval. The results of this project will provide
              insight into the integration of digital and traditional collections, and the
              optimal retrieval of resources from them. The findings will also provide for
              the design of diverse types of information retrieval systems, including search
              agents that seek out resources among distributed collections, and present an
              integrated view for user consultation.
