Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Support for International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis  This
              three year grant to the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis
              (IIASA), a multilateral research institute located near Vienna, Austria, will
              provide partial, continuing support for a policy-relevant research program
              related to environmentally sustainable economic development.  Within this
              context, research will focus on three themes: (1) global environmental change,
              (2) global economic and technological transitions, and (3) systems methods for
              the analysis of global issues.  Particular emphasis will be placed on the
              topics of transboundary air pollution, land-use change and land-cover change,
              links between greenhouse gas emission and other environmental factors,
              population-environment interactions, the dynamics of technological change, and
              impediments to growth in the transition economies of Central and Eastern
              Europe.  Research will result in publications in peer-reviewed journals,
              international conferences and workshops and, where appropriate, will provide a
              scientific basis for international policy making on the issues associated with
              global change, economic transitions, and sustainable development.  The United
              States is one of 17 countries that provide support for IIASA through their
              national member organizations.  Other national members include organizations in
              Japan, Russia, and several other European countries.
