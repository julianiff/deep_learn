Abstract    :
              This project will develop fast and accurate numerical algorithms  for linear
              algebra problems arising in engineering computations.  One class of such
              problems concerns matrices with displacement  structure.  This is a general
              algebraic concept and includes the  well-known classes of Toeplitz, Hankel,
              Vandermonde and Cauchy  matrices.  In practice there is the need for solving
              rapidly and  accurately, both exactly-determined and over-determined linear 
              systems involving such matrices.  Furthermore, in some  applications like
              inverse scattering for geophysical problems,  there is also the need for the
              rapid factorization of such  matrices.  Another related class of problems
              arises in adaptive  filtering applications, where there is a need to solve
              rapidly  and accurately a sequence of structured linear problems that are 
              related by low-rank changes.  In a different vein, the  computation of the
              eigenvalues and eigenvectors of symmetric  pencils is another important
              problem.  It frequently arises in  finite-element analysis of engineering
              structures and associated  model-reduction problems.  New models and fast
              algorithms for the  analysis of linear algebra problems with large bounded 
              uncertainties will also be developed.
