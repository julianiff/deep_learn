              Proposal: DMS-9734866  Principal Investigator: Christopher D. Sogge    Abstract:
              Sogge will work on various problems in Fourier analysis and nonlinear wave
              equations. He would like to concentrate mainly on two types of problems. First,
              he is interested in proving local and global existence theorems for nonlinear
              wave equations in various settings, including wave equations outside of convex
              obstacles.  For this, the main analysis involves proving a suitable "Strichartz
              estimate." Such estimates in the situation where there is a boundary are much
              more delicate than in the case without boundary; however, some preliminary
              results have already been obtained in joint work with Hart Smith.  Sogge is
              also very interested in studying maximal averages over curves and  especially
              interested in trying to establish such estimates in the curved space setting.  
               Sogge has been intrigued for some time by certain questions in nonlinear
              partial differential equations and Fourier analysis. Such issues arise
              naturally in many contexts.  For instance, the equations of general relativity
              are just nonlinear wave equations. One of the main things Sogge would like to
              do is to show that such equations have solutions in the region outside of an
              obstacle. This might be thought of as a model for equations describing black
              holes, where the obstacle plays the role of the black hole. Sogge is also
              interested in basic problems in Fourier analysis. Since its introduction in the
              pioneering work of Fourier himself on problems of heat conduction, Fourier
              analysis has been the main tool to study differential equations, which
              constitute the formal language of physics.
