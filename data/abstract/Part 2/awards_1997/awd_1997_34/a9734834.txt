Hiscock
Dr. Hiscock's research group will continue their work on
              semiclassical effects on black hole geometries, with particular emphasis on
              whether zero-temperature black hole "remnants" (representing possible endpoints
              of black hole evaporation) are possible within semiclassical gravity, and on
              semiclassical effects on the causal structure of black hole interiors.

While
              it is widely accepted that semiclassical gravity is at best an approximation to
              some as yet ill-defined full theory of quantum gravity, it is nevertheless the
              best present tool available for the study of quantum effects in strong
              gravitational fields, such as around black holes and near the Big Bang.  The
              present work will extend our knowledge of semiclassical effects in these
              regimes, and act as checks for calculations in proposed fundamental theories of
              quantum gravity.
