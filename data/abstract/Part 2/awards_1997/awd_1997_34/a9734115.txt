Abstract    :
              9734115  Model checking is emerging as a practical tool for automated  debugging
              of complex reactive systems. In model checking, a high-  level description of a
              system is compared against a logical  correctness requirement to discover
              inconsistencies. This CAREER  research aims to enhance applicability and
              efficiency of this  paradigm by pursuing three objectives in research and
              education.  First, to make results in computer-aided verification more 
              accessible to nonspecialists, a modeling method called "reactive  modules" is
              developed as a unified framework. In addition, an  analysis tool that supports
              a combination of techniques, a  standard textbook on computer-aided
              verification, and an advanced  course on computer-aided verification will all
              be created.  Second, to develop techniques that can analyze systems beyond the 
              reach of existing tools, two new topics, open systems and  heterogeneous
              systems, are investigated. An open system is a  reactive system interacting
              with an unspecified environment, and  for analysis of such systems, novel
              specification paradigms such  as alternating-time temporal logics are studied.
              For analysis of  systems consisting of components with different synchrony 
              assumptions and described in different source languages, the  utility of
              reactive modules as a common semantic framework is  investigated. Finally, to
              integrate concepts in formal methods  into undergraduate education at Penn,
              changes to existing courses  in theory and systems are proposed.***
