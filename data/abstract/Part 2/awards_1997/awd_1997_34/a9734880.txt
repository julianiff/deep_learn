Abstract    :
              Stochastic and population-based search methods (simulated  annealing,
              metropolis, WalkSAT, genetic algorithms) have been  successful as optimization
              heuristics in a number of application  areas.  However, very little is known
              about which problems they  succeed at, which instances they do well on, or how
              to make  implementation choices to tailor the method to a given  application. 
              To address this, recent theoretical work on  population-based methods will be
              used as a guide in an  experimental study of the structure of search spaces. 
              Population-  based algorithms (in particular go-with-the-winners local 
              optimization, will be used to sample uniformly from the part of  the search
              space that meets a certain minimal standard of  optimality.  Such samples will
              be used to discover combinatorial  characteristics of search spaces, and then
              to predict and improve  the performance of optimization heuristics.  Social
              Impact:  There will be collaboration between theorists and experimenters.  This
              will help forget ties between the two research communities.  Graduate students
              will learn to balance theoretical skills,  programming institution, and concern
              for applications
