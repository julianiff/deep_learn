Abstract    :
              With the anticipated ability to build chips containing one billion transistors, 
              a larger amount of memory and functionality may be available on a single chip. 
               One challenge is how to manage and configure all these resources for optimal 
              performance and power dissipation.  This research explores the problem of 
              determining optimal use of all available resources on chip on an application by
               application basis.  Where reconfigurable logic is available for use (either on
               chip or off) synthesis tools can be used to determine optimal
              hardware/software  partitioning of the application as well as to
              architecturally synthesize the  hardware portions onto reconfigurable logic. 
              Tools are being developed to  produce high-performance power-conscious designs.
               Various applications are being  explored to determine the effectiveness of
              these tools. The applications are  being run on reconfigurable computing
              platforms designed at Brown's computer  engineering laboratory. The topics of
              low-power and high-performance computer  design, and advanced computer
              architecture design are being introduced to the  curriculum via new courses and
              the modification of existing ones. Approaches to  advising and mentoring
              students at levels from pre-college to graduate are being  developed. Emphasis
              is in mentoring and outreach services to young women just  entering a career in
              science or engineering.
