Abstract    :
              This research is on asynchronous, or self-timed, design.  Such designs eliminate
              the global synchronizing clock, thus  permitting higher performance,
              scalability, and lower power.  The project is investigating problems in
              datapath design:  (1) the design of high-performance and low-power datapath 
              components, and (2) a system-level application to compressed-  code embedded
              processors. In (1), a technique, "speculative  completion", for designing
              asynchronous datapath components  which give high performance, yet have little
              area and power  overhead is being developed. This technique allows use of 
              existing synchronous components, with small amounts of added  circuitry and a
              multi-slotted completion signal, to allow  early completion. As part of this
              research, (a) the  technique is being applied to design fast adders, 
              multipliers, and comparators; and (b) new optimizations are  being developed,
              which target statistically-skewed (i.e. non-  random) input data that appear in
              real-world applications.  In (2), research activity being carried out is
              focused on a  system-level application: the design of embedded systems  with
              compressed memories. The investigation includes (a)  exploration and evaluation
              of a variety of memory  compression techniques; (b) design of a small and fast 
              asynchronous decompression circuit, which can decompress  such memories, on the
              fly, at acceptable rates.
