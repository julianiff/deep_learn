Abstract    :
              Proposal Number: ECS-9734829    Principal Investigator: Dennis Deppe    Title:
              GaAs-based quantum dot vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers for 1.3 micron
              wavelength    Abstract    The proposed research is to develop quantum dot
              vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) and resonant cavity devices,
              which operate in the 1.3 micron wavelength region, based on strained layer
              InGaAs quantum dot (QD) structures grown on GaAs, and selective oxidation
              processes.
