Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Weitz will investigate coordinatively unsaturated metal
              carbonyls using transient infrared spectroscopy.  He will focus on the kinetics
              and mechanisms of a number of reactions of coordinatively unsaturated metal
              carbonyls with an emphasis on catalytic processes.  Proposed studies include
              mechanistic studies relevant to olefin isomerization induced by iron and group
              VI carbonyls; manganese carbonyl-olefin complexes; H2Fe(CO)3(C2H4) reaction
              kinetics and the hydrogenation of olefins; hydrosilation of olefins;
              determination of bond dissociation energies; and formation of compounds by
              oxidative addition processes.  Infrared laser absorption spectroscopy with time
              resolution will be used in these studies.

In this project real time
              information about a number of catalysis reaction processes will be obtained,
              and the important kinetic steps in their mechanisms will be elucidated.  This
              information is important for being able to understand and improve on many of
              the industrial processes which involve these types of reactions, and so it will
              be of widespread interest to both pure and applied chemists.
