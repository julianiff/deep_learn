Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of a system in which the  
              interactions of lipid A and derivatives with other molecules can be   directly
              observed and characterized.  The association properties of the   lipid A
              derivatives will be studied via microtitration calorimetry.  The   first lipid
              A binding molecule to be studied will be the peptide   antibiotic polymyxin B. 
              The focus of the educational activities is on   the preparation of short
              animations of organic reactions based on high   level semi-empirical and ab
              initio calculations.With this Faculty Early   Development (CAREER) award, the
              Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry   Program is supporting the research and
              educational activities of Dr. Paul   B. Savage of the Department of Chemistry
              at Brigham Young University.     Professor Savage will focus his research
              efforts on developing a system   in which association of lipid A and
              derivatives with other molecules can   be directly measured and
              thermodynamically characterized.   Lipid A, a   primary component of the outer
              membrane of Gram-negative bacteria,   adversly affects the lives of hundreds of
              thousands of people each year   in the United States.   A primary focus of the
              educational activities is   to develop visual materials for undergraduate
              teaching.
