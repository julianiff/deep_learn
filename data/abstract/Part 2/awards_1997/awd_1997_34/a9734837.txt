Abstract    :
              This project covers two themes in the field of atom interferometry.  The first
              involves the development of improved atom interferometric techniques with a
              view toward applying them to the demonstration of a high precision Sagnac
              effect gyroscope.  In the second quantum optics interferometry techniques will
              be extended to atomic sources.  The goal is to develop new techniques in
              quantum measurement, to use direct atom counting methods to study the quantum
              statistical nature of degenerate and chaotic atomic sources, and to generate
              and characterize degenerate Fermi sources.
