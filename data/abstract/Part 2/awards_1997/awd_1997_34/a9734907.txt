ABSTRACT

Basic
              research is performed on the dependence of the composition, microstructure,
              topography, and nano-mechanical properties of ultra-thin carbon overcoats on
              plasma deposition conditions and the nano-tribological properties of these
              films. The processing parameters studied, based on a factorial design of
              experiments approach,
 are the RF power, chamber pressure, substrate bias
              voltage, and deposition rate. Correlations developed in this research lead to
              the identification of optimum film processing parameters and provide insight
              into micro-scale tribophenomena. The results help to enhance the technological
              basis for the design of anti-friction, wear-resistant interfaces of
              leading-edge technologies such as high-density magnetic recording.
