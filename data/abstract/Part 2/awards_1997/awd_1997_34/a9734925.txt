Abstract    :
              DMI-9734925  Smith  In many manufacturing operations, particularly in the
              aerospace industry, large amounts of material must be removed from workpieces
              by milling. Frequently the onset of chatter is a limiting factor in the
              productivity of such operations. Previous attempts to improve the metal removal
              rate have assumed that the dynamic characteristics of the tool are fixed, and
              the cutting parameters are manipulated to account for them. In this project,
              the spindle performance characteristics are considered as fixed, and the
              dynamic characteristics of the tool are manipulated so that both the tool and
              the spindle perform best at a speed. The results of this effort will be a set
              of cutting tools for machining operations with adjustable dynamic
              characteristics and a procedure for quickly and easily making the adjustment or
              selection.  At least four methods for adjusting the dynamic parameters of the
              tool will be explored: 1) Tool length adjustment, 2) Adjustment of the axial
              position of an internal mass or external mass, 3) Material removal from the
              interior of the tool, and 4) Material removal from the exterior of the tool. 
              Successful completion of this project will lead to a way to produce a set of
              optimally tuned tools for machines. The ability to tune a set of tools to
              perform well in a narrow spindle speed range will greatly simplify future
              high-speed spindle development because the spindle will only need to operate in
              that narrow speed range.
