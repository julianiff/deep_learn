Abstract    :
              The promise of the information age is the delivery of more information than has
              ever been available before.  Unfortunately, human ability to manage and process
              information remains mostly unchanged. The result of this mismatch is
              information overload.  This project extends one approach to alleviating
              information overload--collaborative filtering--to provide a new way to assist
              individuals in personal information selection.  Collaborative filtering uses
              the opinions of member of a community about information objects to recommend a
              subset of those objects to each individual in the community.  The technique
              works well for small communities in which each user has evaluated many of the
              information objects.  This project uses sophisticated statistical and
              computation techniques to extend collaborative filtering to communities with
              millions of users who may have evaluated only a fraction of a percent of the
              available items.  As part of this work, the researchers are developing measures
              of confidence to help users determine how much faith to place in a particular
              recommendation.  This research project will allow an already booming
              personalization industry to move from niche markets into mainstream communities
              and markets; at the same time, it will provide the measures needed for other
              researchers to evaluate new filtering algorithms and techniques.
