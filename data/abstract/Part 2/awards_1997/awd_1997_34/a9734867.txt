Abstract    :
              The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Prof. Veronica   Bierbaum
              of the University of Colorado-Boulder in her continuing studies   of the
              kinetics, mechanisms and thermochemistry of gas phase ion-molecule   reactions.
               Dr. Bierbaum will carry out research in the following areas:    1)  the study
              of symmetric SN2 reactions of methyl chloride as a function   of pressure,
              buffer gas and isotope substitution, and SN2 reactivity at   neutral nitrogen
              in the gas phase; and 2) experimental and computational   studies of ion
              thermochemistry to systems of atmospheric relevance.  In   addition, she will
              pursue two new projects:  3) the study of reactions of   ions with nitrogen and
              oxygen atoms; and 4) chemical ionization detection   of biogenic emissions. 
              The PI will employ a tandem flowing   afterglow-selected ion flow-drift tube
              coupled with a triple quadrupole   detector to carry out the reactions and
              monitor products.    The experimental results from this research program will
              contribute to   our fundamental understanding of reaction kinetics, mechanism,
              and   thermochemistry, as well as provide valuable comparison with theory.   
              Much of the thermochemical data has relevance to important combustion and  
              atmospheric processes.  The characterization of biogenic emissions   addresses
              a critical problem in atmospheric chemistry:  the sources of   high
              concentrations of oxygenated hydrocarbons in the earth's troposphere   are not
              currently understood; however, their impact on atmospheric   chemistry is
              significant.
