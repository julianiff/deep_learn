Abstract    :
              The UMAB REU Site will provide students an intensive summer research experience,
              focusing on issues of conservation biology, ecology, and biodiversity. 
              Consistent with the mission of the University, the project aims to involve a
              diverse group of students, including non-traditional students from urban
              environments, minorities underrepresented in science, and women.  Twelve
              undergraduates, recruited locally and nationally, will participate in research
              with ten faculty sponsors in the Department of Biology.  The two complementary
              components of the program are (1) intensive individual research projects, in
              which each student works closely with an advisor/mentor, and (2) weekly group
              discussions for all students.  Potential research topics include the
              physiological ecology of Lepidoptera, the diversity of bacteria, the genetics
              of endangered plants, and the genetic diversity of deep-sea molluscs.  Each
              student will prepare a report and present research results in a student
              research symposium.  The group meetings will address the theory and practice of
              research and its conduct and implications, including ethical issues.  The
              ethics component will focus on the research process.  Participants will also
              visit two or more field sites and learn directly about each other's projects. 
              A hands-on workshop on molecular techniques will demonstrate the great
              potential of such methods for ecology.  An end-of-session retreat at the
              University Field Station on Nantucket Island will serve to articulate
              impressions and bring cohesion to the summer experience.
