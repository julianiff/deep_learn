Abstract    :
              Mathematical constraints provide a flexible and uniform way to conceptually
              represent and manipulate diverse data capturing spatio-temporal behavior,
              complex modeling requirements, partial and incomplete information etc., and
              have been used in a wide variety of application realms. The CCUBE project deals
              with incorporation of successful constraint technology (involving arithmetic
              constraints over reals, interval constraint propagation, and combinatorial
              optimization over finite domains) with database technology, in the framework of
              Constraint Databases (CDBs) aimed especially at two broad application areas:
              (1) Spatial and temporal applications that require manipulation of complex
              objects in low (up to 5-6) dimensional space, movement of objects in 3D-space,
              transformations among various coordinate systems, and patterns of behavior in
              space over time. These applications include CAD/CAM systems, GIS and
              environmental systems, and spatio-temporal data fusion and sensor management.
              (2) Applications requiring combinatorial optimization in presence of large
              amounts of data, in which database set-at-a-time processing, indexing, and the
              ability to store large intermediate results are being exploited for search.
              Applications here include manufacturing and warehouse support systems,
              financial systems such as electronic trade, and traditional mathematical
              programming problems involving large amounts of data. The technology being
              developed in the CCUBE project has the potential to provide an
              order-of-magnitude productivity gain in building software systems in the target
              domains. Furthermore, it is suitable to become an integral component of future
              database management systems, as well as optimization productivity tools.
              Finally, the CCUBE project is being utilized as an important educational
              device, being used by students in graduate-level courses for real-life
              applications, and stimulating their early involvement in research.
