Abstract    :
              9734368  Saif    This proposal is focused on experimentally studying one of the
              commonly occurring failure modes in MEMS and micro electronics, namely
              debonding between interfaces, often referred to as decohesion.  The interface
              formed by submicron films of a metal (aluminum) and an insulator (silicon
              dioxide) will be studied.  To carry out the experiments, micro instruments will
              be developed based on MEMS devices.  These instruments will initiate debonding
              in test specimens designed for interfacial studies.They will also self
              calibrate, and will allow measurements of Angstrom to nanometer scale
              displacements of the specimens.  The micro instrument and the test specimens
              will be simultaneously designed, patterned and cofabricated.  ***
