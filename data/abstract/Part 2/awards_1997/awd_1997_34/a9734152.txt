Abstract    :
              Many database applications today are no longer I/O bound but memory bound -
              during transaction processing applications, the CPU wastes approximately 80% of
              its cycles waiting for fetches from memory. Thus a 5 fold speed up is possible
              if cache misses are eliminated entirely, and with clock speeds continuing to
              grow, the available speed up will grow as well. Thus the goal of this research
              is to build significantly faster database management systems (DBMSs) by (1)
              developing analytical models of the interaction between different database
              structures (i.e. indexes, tables) and the memory hierarchy, (2) identifying
              those structures that are causing the most stalls, (3) synthesizing new
              structures and algorithms that are more "cache friendly", and (4) verifying the
              new designs through low level performance studies on a real system. The results
              of this project will help ensure that database performance scales with the ever
              increasing speed of processors and density of memory chips. The educational
              goal of this project is to develop a project based curriculum for database
              systems. Instead of using a scaled down "teaching" system, students learn to
              use and extend commercial DBMSs through standard interfaces like JDBC and OLE
              DB, which gives them practical skills as well as teaches them to write and
              debug code that is part of a large complex system.
