Abstract    :
              Abstract - Wooldridge      This is an investigation of particle formation and
              growth in gas-phase combustion synthesis as used for the production of various
              materials.  The evolution of particle composition in combustion synthesis
              flames is characterized using laser spark spectroscopy.  Parametric
              experimental studies detail the burner conditions that affect particle
              composition and morphology.  The aerosol dynamic equation is used as the basis
              modeling particle growth and in refined as necessary to model single component
              and multicomponent particle synthesis.  Laser scattering experiments provide
              data on particle size and number density for comparison with the models.   
              Evaluation and control of particle composition in gas-phase combustion
              synthesis is important, particularly when several condensed-phase species are
              present in the flame.  The nanocomposite particles created by these systems can
              exhibit a variety of morphologies and chemical compositions.
