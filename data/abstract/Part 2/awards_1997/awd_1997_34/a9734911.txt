Abstract    :
              Current theory does little to predict, explain or analyze  the empirically
              observed success of search and optimization  heuristics for some domains of
              NP-complete problem and their  failure for others.  Without such a theory,
              implementers of  heuristics have no guidance as to whether a particular 
              heuristic method is suitable for a particular problem  domain, what kind of
              performance to expect, or how to set  the various parameters for better
              performance.  Implementation is often done in a haphazard way based on  little
              more than guess-work or trial-and-error.  The  following inter-related lines of
              theoretical research will  be explored to address this gap: (1) Extending
              average-case  complexity to consider reductions to and between problem 
              distributions that arise naturally ( in real-life, testing,  cryptanalysis or
              combinatorics). (2) Extending average-case  analysis techniques to a more
              general characterization of  the relevant combinatorial properties of random
              problem  instances from naturally arising distributions.  In  particular, the
              properties of associated search spaces for  such problems. (3) For
              experimentally successful heuristic  methods, identify the combinatorial
              characteristics of  problem instances that determine their performance. (4) 
              Investigate more efficient worst-case algorithms for NP  complete problems,
              identify those NP complete problems with  nontrivial worst-case algorithms, and
              explore the connection  between lower and upper bounds.  Although the
              techniques  used are solely mathematical, the motivation and  justification
              come from the experimental literature.
