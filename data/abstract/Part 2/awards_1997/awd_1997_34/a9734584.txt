The free-living nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, is one of the
              best-characterized metazoans and it is amenable to many of the most powerful
              genetic technologies available. It is, therefore, an appropriate experimental
              organism for the study of many developmental processes, including meiosis.
              There are a number of cytological differences between male and female meiosis.
              In male meiosis, spermatocytes normally undergo two equal divisions leading to
              the formation of four spermatids. In females, on the other hand, the meiocytes
              undergo unequal cell division leading to the formation of an ovum and the polar
              bodies. The biochemical basis for these differences is not known. Several
              mutation screens have identified a large number of mutants defective in
              spermatogenesis. Morphological characterization of these mutants led to the
              identification of a group with defective primary spermatocytes that failed to
              complete meiotic division. The mutants fall into ten different  complementation
              groups (early acting Spe genes). The specific aims for this proposal are to
              genetically, phenotypically and molecularly characterize the spe-25 gene, a
              gene which preliminary characterization suggests is one of the earliest acting
              Spe genes. It has been mapped to a well-characterized region of chromosome III
              that should optimize the molecular characterization.

The analysis of these
              genes in a model organism will enhance our knowledge of the male specific
              meiotic event in a metazoan organism. Moreover, the proposed experiments are
              particularly suited for the involvement of undergraduate students in a
              "hands-on" laboratory environment.
