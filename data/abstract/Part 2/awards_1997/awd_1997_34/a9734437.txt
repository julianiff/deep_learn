Abstract    :
              This research focuses on improving WWW proxy caching in  order to sustain the
              continued growth of the Web on the  Internet. Caching is one of the most
              important techniques  that can be used to increase the salability of the Web. 
              The  research targets four major problems that currently plague  Web caching
              systems: lack of strong cache consistency, no  support for server control on
              cache accesses, inflexible  caching algorithms, and poor performance.  In order
              to solve  these problems, this project will explore  means to include  strong
              cache consistency maintenance in WWW via lease-based  invalidation protocols,
              active cache architecture that  supports server-supplied processing upon cache
              access, Web  caching strategies that adapt to network conditions and  utilize
              the unique capabilities of large proxy caches to  reduce network  congestion,
              and high-performance scalable  proxy architectures and cache sharing 
              protocols.  Combined,  these efforts promise to qualitatively improve the 
              scalability and availability of the Web, and to support the  increasingly
              important role that the Web plays in our  society. The educational activities
              include developing the  mini-scale Internet emulator, nurturing the "crash and
              burn"  lab, and other initiatives aimed at increasing the research  involvement
              of undergraduate students.
