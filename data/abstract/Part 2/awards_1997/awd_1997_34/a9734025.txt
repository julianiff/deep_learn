Abstract    :
              The purpose of the research project is to  design simple, efficient, and robust
              mechanisms to   improve the performance of Transmission Control  Protocol (TCP)
              in mixed wired/wireless and ad hoc  communication networks.  The basic approach
              is to   study how the soon-to-be-standardized Selective   Acknowledgment (SACK)
              feature of TCP, together with  knowledge of the statistical behavior of
              wireless  links, can be used to decouple the error recovery and  flow control
              functions of TCP by distinguishing between  transient and persistent packet
              loss.  The network  will be modeled within a stochastic framework,  guided and
              validated by computer simulation.  Rigorous  mathematical techniques, as well
              as extensive computer  simulation, will be employed to design and analyze the  
              performance of each mechanism.  In order to accurately   evaluate the
              performance of the mechanisms, they will   be implemented experimentally under
              a wide variety   of real-world conditions using channel emulation hardware. 
              The education plan can be summarized as one of utilizing   the vast resources
              at the University of Michigan,   participating in several initiatives in
              curriculum   development, involving undergraduate students in research,   and
              developing Web-based Matlab modules.
