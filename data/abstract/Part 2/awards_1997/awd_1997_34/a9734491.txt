Abstract    :
              9734491  Wang  This research project is supported under the Early Career 
              Development (CAREER) program.  This premier program emphasizes  the importance
              the National Science Foundation places on the  early development of academic
              careers dedicated to stimulating  the discovery process in which the excitement
              of research is  enhanced by inspired teaching and enthusiastic learning.  It 
              combines in a single program the support of research and  education of the
              highest quality and in the broadest sense.    The research activity involves
              the use of ultrasound-modulated  optical tomography (USMOT), a novel system
              combining an  ultrasonic transducer and a laser system, to study the acousto- 
              optical effects in liquid and gel turbid media (e.g. biological  tissues).  The
              specific tasks of the activity include: 1)  computer modeling of turbid
              acousto-optics; 2) effects of the  ultrasonic wave on the ultrasound modulation
              of light; 3) effects  of the light source on the ultrasound modulation of
              light; 4)  effects of the relative configuration between the ultrasonic wave 
              and light on the ultrasound modulation of light; 5) effects of  the acoustic
              and optical properties and geometry of the media;  and 6) characterization and
              optimization of images of turbid  media.  The educational plan aims to directly
              involve students in  the research, with specific goals including the
              development of a  new course in Optical Imaging, expansion of an existing
              course in  Medical Imaging, and outreach to pre-college students through the 
              Texas A&M Summer Student Program.    It  is  conjectured that the development
              of turbid acousto-optics  as a new field in optical engineering may lead to
              applications in  medicine, underwater detection, and atmospheric optics.  ***
