Abstract    :
              This research focuses on elucidating the mechanisms by which   metallocarbenes
              of the group-six triad undergo hydrolysis and facilitate   nucleophilic
              additions.   Electron donating and accepting properties of   the coordinated
              carbene will be varied through systematic modifications   of the groups
              appendant to the carbene carbon and correlated with the   kinetic and
              thermodynamic acidities of the complexes to develop   structure-reactivity
              relationships.   Graduate students and postdoctoral   research associates
              carrying out the experiments will be introduced to   the synthesis of
              organometallic carbene complexes and to the procedures   used to elucidate the
              general patterns of their chemical reactivity.     With this award, the Organic
              and Macromolecular Chemistry Program   supports the research of Dr. Claude
              Bernasconi of the Department of   Chemistry at the University of California at
              Santa Cruz.   Dr. Bernasconi   will focus his research on correlating the
              reactivity of chromium,   molybdenum and tungsten carbene complexes with the
              structure of the   attached carbene.  These complexes, which contain an
              unusual, reactive   form of carbon, facilitate certain organic transformations
              and are finding   an increasing use in synthetic organic chemistry.    Dr.
              Bernasconi's   educational activities include the training of graduate and  
              postdoctoral students in organometallic syntheses and the procedures used   to
              elucidate their chemistry.
