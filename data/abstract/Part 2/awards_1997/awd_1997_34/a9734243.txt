Abstract    :
              This project explores the use of physically secure coprocessors  and
              cryptographic techniques to solve the remote execution  problem.  This is
              exemplified by issues arising from mobile code,  e.g., active network capsules
              and mobile software agents that  autonomously move among servers.  The primary
              focus of this  project is on mobile agent systems.  Remote execution
              exemplifies  mutual distrust: not only must the servers be protected from 
              potentially malicious agents, but agents must also be protected  from
              potentially malicious servers.  This latter agent security  problem is much
              harder, since without a trusted computing base at  the serve (1) the agents
              have no guarantee that they will actually  run at all once they arrive there,
              and (2) agents cannot keep any  secrets (e.g., cryptographic keys) from the
              server.  The objective  of this work is to resolve the agent security problem
              and explore  the security engineering issues involved in building a mobile 
              agent system.  To achieve protection from hostile servers, this  project will
              explore using secure coprocessors to provide a secure  execution environment, a
              "sanctuary", within the server.  Additionally, cryptographic techniques such as
              Perfect Forward  Integrity and other new schemes will be developed to enhance
              the  security of agents when no sanctuary servers are available.
