Abstract    :
              CTS-9734136  Marr, David W. M.  Colorado School of Mines    Structure at small
              length scale arises as the material microscopic components interact and
              assemble themselves into mesoscopic-sized morphologies.  This project will
              investigate the link between molecular interactions and the properties of
              interfaces that develop during morphology evolution.  A combination of dense
              colloidal model systems probed by new optical techniques that can manipulate
              such systems, and statistical mechanical modeling methods will be applied.  A
              new experimental device will be constructed that uses a rapidly scanning
              optical trap to build arbitrary optical potential wells. The technique of
              confocal microscopy which can characterize, in situ, the relatively dense
              colloidal structures will be developed.  The study of nucleation in systems
              using nuclei of various structure and the templated growth of colloidal
              crystals will be two areas of focus.      The education goal is to bring the
              physical insights obtained in this study to the classroom at both undergraduate
              and graduate levels by developing new courses and adding molecular level
              material to current coursework.  In addition, new pedagogical techniques
              including the World Wide Web, browsers used to access the web, as well as
              state-of-the-art computer languages will be used to enhance the educational
              environment.    Understanding the link between microscopic interactions in
              colloidal systems and macroscopic properties is an essential step in the
              synthesis of new materials with specifically designed microscale morphologies.
