Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to develop machine-learning approaches for
              integrating additional  resources into the inductive-learning paradigm and to
              apply these new approaches to numerous real-world  problems. Many scientific
              and industrial problems can be better understood by learning from samples of 
              the task under consideration.  For this reason, the machine learning and
              statistics communities devote  considerable research effort in generating
              inductive-learning algorithms that try to learn the true concept  of a task
              from a set of its examples.  Often times, however, once has additional
              resources readily  available, but largely unused, that can significantly
              improve the concept that these learning algorithms  generate.  These resources
              include prior knowledge describing what is currently known about the domain as 
              well as available computer cycles.  The focus of this proposal is to extend and
              apply a successful learning  system that consists of utilizing a novel
              combination of inductive learning (focusing on ensembles, genetic  algorithms,
              and neural networks), anytime learning, and background knowledge.  Natural
              applications of  this framework include information filtering, object
              recognition in digital images, drug design, as well  as many other domains
              traditionally tackled with expert systems.
