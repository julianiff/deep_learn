Abstract    :
              9734265  Palsberg  The goal of the project is to develop type inference
              algorithms  for object-oriented software which are practically useful for  tool
              developers and language designers. An example application is  tool support for
              transforming a dynamically typed prototype  application into a statically typed
              product. The currently known  algorithms do not handle the combination of
              features found in  commonly used languages, and none of the algorithms are
              known to  scale well. The project will develop new type inference  algorithms,
              it will perform large scale experiments with them,  and it will investigate new
              language designs where type inference  is smoothly integrated. Along with this,
              a hands-on course on  programming languages is being developed, focusing on the
               similarities and differences between object oriented and  functional
              programming.  ***
