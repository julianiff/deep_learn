Abstract    :
              9734026  Reinhardt  The boundary between hardware and software in computer
              system design   constantly changes with advances in technology.  This project
              includes both   research and education at this boundary.  Research will include
              new   techniques for software cache management:  cache hardware that permits  
              additional software control, instruction pipeline enhancements that enable  
              low-overhead execution of cache management software, and software  
              implementations of new cache management policies.  Education at the  
              hardware/software boundary will include introduction of field-programmable  
              gate arrays (FPGA) in the undergraduate laboratories, involvement of  
              undergraduates in research, and incorporation of recent research into the  
              graduate curriculum.  ***
