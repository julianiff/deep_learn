Abstract    :
              9734496  Good  This career program has two goals: (1) to further the 
              development of the study of biomedical engineering within  the chemical
              engineering discipline; and (2) to form a  partnership with secondary schools
              in the region to both  enhance the science skills of the teachers within those 
              schools and to increase the awareness by teachers of career  possibilities in
              engineering.  To meet the first goal, one  research project is to investigate
              the role of protein  aggregation in the mechanism of transmissible spongiform 
              encephalopathies.  An undergraduate and graduate course  under development is
              to use material obtained from this  project as well as other ongoing research
              projects.  To meet  the second goal, a four year project is to bring 24 
              secondary school science teachers to Texas A&M for an annual  five week teacher
              enhancement program.  Teachers are to  visit several manufacturing facilities
              and remediation sites  within Texas where engineering is practiced and attended
               seminars on engineering career opportunities and engineering  research
              programs.  ***
