Abstract    :
                IBN 97-34350  MEL       Neurons, the computing cells of the brain, typically
              possess  extensive, highly branched tree-like structures called dendrites  onto
              which tens of thousands of input connections from other  neurons are formed. 
              In contrast to the classical conception that  the brain's computation power
              lies primarily in the "neural  network", i.e. in the richly interconnected
              network of nerve  cells, evolving understanding over the last 40 years and
              including  modeling work in Dr. Mel's laboratory, among several others, has 
              established that computations carried out within the dendritic  trees of
              individual neurons can contribute in significant ways to  the computing
              functions of neural tissue.  One of the important  principles to emerge from
              this modeling work is that different  computations may be carried out
              simultaneously in different  "subunits" of  the dendritic tree, which could
              dramatically  increase the computational capacities of individual nerve cells. 
              A second principle is that the learning and memory may involve  changes not
              only in the absolute potency of cell-to-cell  connectivity but in the spatial
              arrangements of input connections  onto the dendrites of individual neurons as
              well.    Whether parallel subunit computations actually occur within the 
              dendrites of real neurons remains to be determined.  However, the  design of
              experiments to answer these questions is complicated by  the fact that the
              measured physiological responses of neurons can  be due to either to internal
              operations of individual cells or the  combined effects of networks of cells. 
              In this work, Dr. Mel and  his colleagues will model the roles and interaction
              of single-  neuron computations and those carried out by the embedded network 
              of interconnected neurons, in order to guide experimental  approaches relating
              to critical questions of neural processing.
