Abstract    :
              Configurable computing systems combine programmable hardware with programmable 
              processors to produce an adaptive high-performance system.  High-performance 
              customized digital circuits execute on the programmable hardware, while
              flexible  software executes on the processor.  This project is developing a
              partial  evaluation approach, in which some parameters of specific computations
              are  programmed into the hardware.  For some problems, such as combinatorial 
              optimization or factoring, this approach may accelerate performance.  Research 
              in this project concentrates on use of a small number of parameterized macros
              for  each type of problem.    The UCLA Electrical Engineering Department is
              introducing a Computer Engineering  option into the undergraduate degree.  The
              PSIC effort will be integrated into  the capstone design class for this option.
               This will combine all aspects of  computer system design in a focused
              environment.  Students will be attracted to  the course material because of its
              integration into an advanced research program.
