Abstract    :
              9734892  Rawson  This award to Columbia University will provide instrumentation
              for oceanographic research for use on R/V Maurice Ewing, a research vessel
              operated by the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory as part of the
              University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific
              instruments to be acquired include data storage devices, network computers and
              a printer, all for shipboard use.  The shared-use instrumentation supported
              here will assist marine scientists conduct studies from R/V Ewing throughout
              the world ocean in 1998 and future years.  ***
