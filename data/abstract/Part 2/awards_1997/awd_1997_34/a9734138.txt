Abstract    :
              9734138  Barvinok    The purpose of this project is to investigate applications
              of higher-dimensional phenomena in Banach Geometry, such as measure
              concentration, to optimization and algorithmic problems.  The following
              particular problems will be considered:  efficient computation of mixed
              volumes, mixed discriminants, and permanents of non-negative matrices,
              efficient approximate counting, and approximation algorithms via semidefinite
              programming.  The investigator will also be creating new interdisciplinary
              courses in convexity and optimization.  The National Science Foundation
              strongly encourages the early development  of academic faculty as both
              educators and researchers.  The Faculty Early  Career Development (CAREER)
              Program is a Foundation-wide program that provides for the support of junior
              faculty within the context of their overall career development.  It combines in
              a single program the support of quality research and education in the broadest
              sense and the full participation of those traditionally underrepresented in
              science and  engineering.  This program enhances and emphasizes the importance
              the Foundation places on the development of full, balanced academic careers.
