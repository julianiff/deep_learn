Abstract    :
              Traditionally, building knowledge-based systems has been a process involving
              professional knowledge engineers.  While this process works for well-defined
              tasks in limited domains, it is too expensive for domains where the
              representation must change frequently and is not feasible for problems where
              experts' understanding of the domain and task changes during the course of
              problem solving.  The alternative approach investigated in this project is one
              of "incremental  formalization." This approach allows users to initially enter
              their understanding of their domain, task, and solutions in less formal
              representations and provides computer support for the gradual  formalization of
              this knowledge.  The project includes: (1) designing knowledge representations
              and interfaces for capturing emergent understandings and enabling incremental 
              formalization, (2) developing mechanisms for recognizing implicit structure
              within informally represented information, (3) investigating interfaces for
              suggesting formalizations, uses of automated  formalization, and trade-offs
              between suggesting and automating  formalization, (4) creating tools which aid
              the development of shared languages and support collaborative
              knowledge-building tasks, and (5) improving understanding of knowledge-building
              processes and the relative merits of prototypes through observations of
              individual and collaborative tasks requiring domain modeling.
