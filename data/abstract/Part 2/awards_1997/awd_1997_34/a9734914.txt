Abstract    :
              DMI-9734914  Tu  High speed machining is a technology that has the potential of
              drastically reducing machining time, improving product accuracy and surface
              finish, and eliminating some finishing processes. One of the major problems in
              high-speed machining is the development of spindles with sufficient reliability
              to afford the high machining speed. The objective of this GOALI project is to
              develop a high-performance spindle prototype which is inherently reliable with
              high forgiveness for production error, and to study issues related to its
              implementation to high-speed, high-reliability processes.  The research tasks
              include: 1) Development of an electro-thermo-mechanical model of an entire
              motorized spindle system for design sensitivity analysis, 2) Development of an
              inherently reliable spindle prototype using the model and new designs, and 3)
              Development of a Multiple-sensor based spindle/process monitor. The project
              will be performed jointly by Purdue University and Cincinnati Milacron Inc. 
              The project is expected to have significant impact on the design of
              next-generation, high-performance machine tools.  The knowledge of spindle
              dynamics, thermal behavior, and process factors critical to spindle reliability
              obtained from the project could reduce the cost of lost production, spindle
              inventories, and spindle rehabilitation due to unexpected premature failures.
