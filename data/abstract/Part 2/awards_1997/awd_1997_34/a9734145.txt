Abstract    :
                    Abstract    On today's Internet, packets are delivered in a best-effort
              manner.  The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is standardizing support 
              for realtime packet delivery on the Internet. The viability of  relaxed, as
              opposed to hard guarantees, realtime services depends  fundamentally on the
              ability of its measurement-based admission  control algorithms to determine
              which connection can be admitted to  the network without violating service
              specifications.  Previous  research has demonstrated the viability of
              measurement-based admission  control algorithms and relaxed realtime services. 
              However, two  important questions remain.  First, independent of any specific 
              algorithm, what traffic characteristics can serve as primary  indicators to
              guide the setting of an algorithm's parameters?  Second,  can global
              inefficiencies resulting from the local nature of  independent admission
              decisions be minimized?  This research proposes  to use equivalent token-bucket
              filter of aggregate traffic to guide  the setting of the admission control
              algorithm's parameters, and to  apply a market-based approach to global
              resource allocation.  While  there is a sizeable body of literature in the
              application of  market-based control to the allocation of computing resources,
              no previous  work on distributed resource allocation that involves multiple 
              resources and takes into account transaction costs, i.e.~the cost to  negotiate
              and execute a transaction, has been reported.  Further  information on this
              project is available from
