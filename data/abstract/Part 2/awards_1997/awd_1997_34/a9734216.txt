Abstract    :
              This research addresses the need to consider details of the  analog behavior of
              digital circuits and interconnect in  order to ensure correct functionality.
              Specifically it  focuses on analysis of timing and noise in deep submicron 
              circuit designs. All noise sources in a digital integrated  circuit are being
              considered - coupled and ringing noise on  signal lines, power supply noise,
              and noise from the  circuits The effect of noise on delay is being considered
              in  performance verification. Because many of the emerging  timing and noise
              problems are associated with on-chip  inductance, techniques for practically
              extracting on-chip  inductance will be developed. The question of how the 
              complex time-domain responses that result from inductive  interconnect can be
              used in static timing and noise analysis  is being investigated. Additional
              explorations are on using  the complex time-domain responses that result from
              inductive  interconnect for static timing and noise analysis. Other  areas of
              investigation include a static solution to on-chip  power grid integrity
              analysis and noise considerations in  synthesis and circuit tuning.  The
              educational plan includes building a VLSI CAD research  laboratory, and
              development of courses in hardware design  using FPGAs.
