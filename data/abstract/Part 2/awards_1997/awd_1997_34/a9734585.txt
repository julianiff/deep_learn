Abstract    :
              New Traffic Models for Internet Connections  and VBR Video Traffic      This
              project examines new models for application and connec-          tion  level 
              traffic  on  the  Internet. The objective is to               better understand
              the impact  of  this  traffic  on  network               congestion.   Features
               of Internet traffic such as its non-  Poisson statistics and long range
              dependence are a point  of               departure from typical traffic on
              circuit switched networks.               As packet traffic progresses from the 
              user  application  to               its  destination across a network, it
              undergoes a variety of               transformations.  These linear and/or
              nonlinear  transforma-               tions  give rise to structural features in
              an otherwise ran-               dom traffic stream. The result is high 
              variability  in  the               network traffic mix.  Identifying and
              controlling the source               of these traffic features is important in
              real-time resource               allocation and network traffic engineering.
              The work in this               project uses measured network data to identify 
              the  feature               space  required  to model Internet usage. Traffic
              generation               from end users, network protocols and video-coders are
               con-               sidered.   Non-linear  time-series  models  will  be used
              to               characterize connection and application level traffic. These  
                          models  have  the  flexibility to address a range of traffic       
                     types from short-range  dependent  stochastic  processes  to            
                those  with  self-similar and deterministic features. At the              
              application level, particular attention is paid to the  gen-              
              eration  of layered variable bit rate video and into the in-              
              fluence of encoding parameters on  traffic  characteristics,              
              model  parameters  and performance. The time-series modeling              
              framework will be used to  design optimal rate control  algo-              
              rithms  with perceptual and network driven cost constraints.        The traffic
              models obtained will allow one to assess  and   control  end  systems  and
              provide network level control for               problematic traffic sources.
              The results will  also  provide               quantitative  evaluation of what
              types of traffic can be su-               perposed to yield suitable
              statistical  multiplexing  gains.               In  conjunction with the
              research effort, a graduate and un-               dergraduate curriculum in the
              network performance area                 will be  developed. The  courses  and 
              projects will support the               development of end-to-end problem
              solving skills. The aim               is to integrate  research and
              interdisciplinary ideas from               engineering and  physical  sciences 
              into  the  solution  of               telecommunications related problems.
