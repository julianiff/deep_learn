Abstract    :
              The proposed research involves the development of new synthetic methods  
              involving organocopper intermediates used at catalytic concentrations.   
              Reactions will include 1) Fleming's silyl cuprate chemistry, 2)the use of  
              lanthanide and other rare earth cocatalysts, 3) alkylations of   functionalized
              Zn and Zr reagents with vinyl and aryl   triflates, and 4)1,4-reductions of
              alpha,beta-unsaturated   carbonyl compounds using copper hydride complexes.
              Raman and   IR spectroscopy, and electrospray mass spectrometry, will be   used
              to determine organocuprate compositions and structures   in solution.        
              With this renewal award, the Organic and  Macromolecular   Chemistry Program
              provides continuing support for the   research of Dr. Bruce Lipshutz of the
              Department of   Chemistry at the University of California at Santa Barbara.    
              The research involves the developmentof synthetic methods   for preparing
              organic compounds under mild conditions and   with high selectivities.  The
              work will provide valuable   training to graduate students and post-doctoral
              fellows in   organic synthesis and the spectroscopic identification of  
              reaction intermediates.
