Abstract    :
              This CAREER project develops a general framework for the  design of a new
              generation of high performance robust  control algorithms, their integration in
              actual sensor and  controllers, and application of the integrated design to 
              control electro-hydraulic servo-systems and linear motor  driven
              high-speed/high-accuracy positioning systems. The  controllers combine the
              positive features of both adaptive  control and robust control, and their
              implementation leads  to high performance and energy-saving in hydraulic
              machines  such as those developed by Caterpillar, Inc. an industry  with which
              the PI has developed a collaborative research  relationship. The education plan
              includes the integration of  proposed research in existing control courses;
              involvement  of undergraduate and graduate students in research;  developing
              continuing education and short courses for  practicing engineers to facilitate
              technology transfer; and  development of two new courses--one at the
              undergraduate and  the other at graduate level. The project is aimed towards 
              developing a solid foundation for designing high performance  robust
              controllers to meet the industrial needs for high  productivity and high
              quality products, and introduce to the  engineering students and practicing
              engineers a strong  analytical background in this area.
