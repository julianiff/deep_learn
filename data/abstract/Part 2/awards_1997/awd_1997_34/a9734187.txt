Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of affinity transfer   alkylating
              reagents (ATAR) for labeling the phosophodiester of nucleic   acids.  Using
              quinone methide chemistry, the ATAR will be agents for the   covalent,
              chemoselective modification of the phosphodiester group in   nucleic acid
              polymers.  The educational focus will include the   development of a course to
              educate journalists, development of a   laboratory course stressing individual
              creativity and extending this   approach to secondary science education and,
              developing apprentiship   style laboratory experiments for `real life` problem
              solving with   community based industry.  With this Faculty Early Development
              (CAREER)   award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is
              supporting the   research and educational activities of Dr. Kenneth D. Turnbull
              of the   Department of Chemistry at the University of Arkansas.   Professor  
              Turnbull  will focus his research efforts on developing innovative,   chemical
              means to covalently deliver  a variety of reporter groups or   proteins to DNA.
               The ability to site-specifically attach such moities to   DNA would allow
              various genetic based, biological studies to be conducted   and provide a new
              means for efficient diagnostics, therapeutics and   biological control at the
              genetic level.  The educational focus of the   project stresses course and
              curriculum development with an emphasis on   public science literacy, real life
              problem solving and secondary science   education.
