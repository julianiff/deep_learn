Abstract    :
              This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported by the  
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focuses on very fundamental   studies
              of the behavior of water at electrochemical interfaces.    Professor Borguet
              and his students at the University of Pittsburgh will   use optical second
              harmonic generation (SHG) and sum frequency generation   methods to probe the
              orientation, structure, and dynamics of the   interfacial water layer at metal
              electrode interfaces.  The respective   roles of electrolyte concentration and
              electrode potential will be   evaluated.  This CAREER project will seek to
              improve science literacy for   non-science majors by developing a unified
              course inclusive of most of   the science disciplines.  Outreach to high school
              students will be   undertaken by Professor Borguet through greater use of
              modern   instrumentation in the University of Pittsburgh Chemistry Van Program.
               The interaction of water with metallic surfaces is of great technological  
              importance, but is still not well understood on a fundamental level.   
              Professor Borguet and his students at the University of Pittsburgh will   use a
              suite of optical techniques to study the physical structure of   water
              molecules at electrode surfaces.  This CAREER project provides   graduate
              students with a system which intimately ties fundamental   chemical reactivity
              with a topic of great technological importance;   corrosion.  Professor Borguet
              will make contributions to improving the   scientific literacy of non-science
              majors through curriculum development   and capturing the interest of high
              school students through participation   in the University of Pittsburgh
              Chemistry Van Program.
