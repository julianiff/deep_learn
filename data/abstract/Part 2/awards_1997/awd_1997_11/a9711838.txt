Abstract    :
                  9711838  Ritchie  PI proposed to organize the International Conference on 
              Fracture (ICF part of  IUTAM) to take stock of the major  achievements in broad
              field of fracture and to reflect on  future directions.  Major conference
              themes include failure  analysis, remaining life assessment, extension and
              repair,  theoretical and computational fracture mechanics,  interfacial
              fracture mechanics, high strain rate fracture  and new directions.
