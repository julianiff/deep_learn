Abstract    :
              9711738  Johnson    This award provides funds to the Engineering Research Center
              at the University of Colorado, Boulder/Colorado State university, Fort Collins,
              entitled Optoelectronics Computing Systems Center to develop cross-disciplinary
              B.S./M.S. degree options in optical engineering in the electrical and computer
              engineering department at the University of Colorado, Boulder.  Students will
              receive BS/MS degrees in electrical and computer engineering with an emphasis
              in optical engineering.  The degree options will be structured so that students
              can complete both degrees, with an emphasis in optical engineering, in five
              years.  This proposal will develop and produce systems-level multimedia
              education modules, based on the Center's system-based research, to be
              integrated into selected optics/optoelectronic courses for these degree
              options.
