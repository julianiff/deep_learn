Abstract    :
              9711464  Carey    Funds are provided for the support of core and rock sample 
              repository at University of Rhode Island that is maintained  for the benefit of
              marine geological community at large.  The prime criteria for continued funding
              of these facilities  remain the extent and types of studies supported by the
              core  and rock samples and steps taken by the institutions to  maintain and
              archive the materials in pristine condition for  future use.  Funds will
              support the URI facility for three  years and allow it to provide continued
              service to the  marine geoscience community.
