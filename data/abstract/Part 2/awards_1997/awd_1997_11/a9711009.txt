Abstract    :
              The  TRAINS research group at the University of Rochester and the  Graflog 
              research group at the Institute for Electrical  Research  in Cuernavaca, Mexico
              will collaborate to produce general purpose  models for spoken dialogue
              systems.  This effort will demonstrate  the  use  of  these models in the
              TRAINS English-language  spoken  dialogue system and the Graflog
              Spanish-language dialogue system.  This  will  be a test of the domain
              independence of the  dialogue  and  reasoning  models  of Graflog, the  ability
               of  the  TRAINS  grammatical  and dialogue formalisms to adapt to  Spanish 
              usage,  and  the  use  of  the parsing and interpretation components  for 
              Spanish.   As  a  result,  better domain-independent  models  are  expected
              that will improve the generality and performance in both  the Graflog and
              TRAINS domains.
