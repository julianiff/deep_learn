Abstract    :
              Abstract - Zhang        The proposed work is to develop a model to simulate
              columnar solidification.  The model will incorporate mathematical descriptions
              of macroscopic transport phenomena and microscopic development.  The transport
              equations composed of the mass, momentum, and energy equations will be solved
              at both the macroscopic and microscopic levels subject to appropriate kinetic
              constrains.  A microscopic cellular model, which takes into account melt
              undercooliing and non-equilibrium kinetics will be developed to predict the
              shape, size, and spacing of cells.  A numerical method that employs grid
              clustering and migration will be used to track the solidification front. 
              Experiments for Bridgman solidification and single droplet solidification will
              be conducted under both transient and steady-state conditions.  Measurements of
              the micro-structural characteristics will be compared with predicted results.
