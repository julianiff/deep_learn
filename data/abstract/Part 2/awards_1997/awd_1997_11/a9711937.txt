Abstract    :
              Najjar (OCE-9711937)       Najjar       9711937              Marine scientists
              are hampered by their ability to directly  measure many important
              biogeochemical parameters such as new  production and remineralization,
              particularly on regional and  global scales.  Recent analyses by the PI,
              Najjar, and colleagues  of existing oxygen data archived at the National
              Oceanographic  Data Center (NODC) show that there are significant annual cycles
               of oxygen that can be resolved on a global scale.  No other  chemical species
              has been measured as extensively in the oceans  as oxygen has, and the cycling
              of oxygen can yield significant  information about organic carbon cycling.  In
              this proposal,  Najjar proposes to use the climatological oxygen data, combined
               with a three dimensional marine biogeochemical model, to quantify  regional
              and global scale estimates of new production,  remineralization and DOC
              cycling.  Improved biogeochemical models  will be tested and updating and
              revisions to the NODC oxygen data  set are planned.  This approach will also
              include an error  analysis of the oxygen field and resulting fluxes.  The
              results  from this proposal will represent a significant advance in our 
              understanding of marine biogeochemical processes on large scales  and thus
              advance our understanding of how these processes relate  to global change.
