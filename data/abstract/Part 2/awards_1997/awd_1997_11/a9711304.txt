Abstract    :
              Abstract - 9711304  Brisson, John G.      The principal investigator proposes to
              develop a cold-cycle dilution refrigerator (CCDR) for cooling below 100 mK. 
              Conventional dilution refrigerators dilute 3He into 4He at a low temperature to
              achieve sub-Kelvin cooling.  An inefficiency of this process is related to the
              circulating of the 3He component from 0.6 K to room temperature and back again.
               In the proposed design, the compressor distills and pumps the 3He component of
              the mexture at 0.25 K (rather than at 300 K in conventional dilution
              refrigerators) and directly returns the 3He component to the mixing chamber. 
              The compressor will be maintained at 0.25 K using a superfluid Stirling
              refrigerator.  The project will also involve the development of low-loss,
              low-temperature compressor valves.  The resulting CCDR will have improved
              efficiency, small size and cost.
