Abstract    :
              As our closest relatives in the primate order, chimpanzees are an important
              source of insight into the behavior of our earliest ancestors, the
              australopithecines.  Chimpanzees are imperfect analogues, however, because
              australopithecines lived in drier habitats than those in which extant
              chimpanzees are typically found.  All working chimpanzee research stations are
              in relatively wet habitats.  In this project I aim to start a new study site on
              chimpanzees that live in an unusual grassland/riverine- forest habitat in the
              Semliki Valley Wildlife Reserve, Uganda.  The particular focus of this research
              is the origin of bipedalism.  There is little agreement among researchers about
              the selective forces that resulted in bipedalism, or about the course of its
              evolution.  Earlier research suggested that bipedalism evolved as an adaptation
              to feeding on small fruits found in diminutive trees, trees found mostly in dry
              areas.  Although not habitual bipeds, chimpanzees do engage in this form of
              locomotion on occasion.  As chimpanzees are habituated to human observation at
              Semliki, I will observe the contexts of their bipedalism to understand better
              why our ape-like ancestor first adopted this unusual locomotor behavior.  Study
              of these chimpanzees will assure their survival as well as helping us
              understand the evolution of the australopithecines.
