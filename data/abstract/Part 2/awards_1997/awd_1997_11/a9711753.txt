Abstract    :
              Algorithms for learning by interaction, or reinforcement learning, typically
              ignore all structure in the   environment and consequently tend to scale
              poorly. The goal of this research is to develop novel, efficient,   and
              theoretically well-founded algorithms and architectures for learning by
              interaction in structured   environments. Three kinds of environmental
              structure are considered: factorial structure in states and   actions, additive
              structure in payoff functions, and hierarchical structure in states and
              actions. Such   structure is common because many environments are composed from
              multiple, weakly interacting,   components that are often organized
              hierarchically. The approach consists of exploiting this structure by  
              learning separately for the different components and then compensating in a
              structure dependent manner   for the approximation so introduced. The results
              of this research will elucidate many different interesting   and useful
              structures common in learning by interaction problems and provide new
              reinforcement   learning algorithms that make it possible to solve
              significantly larger structured problems than possible   with the traditional
              approach. Possible applications include large-scale, dynamic, resource
              allocation   problems intelecommunications, networking, and scheduling, as well
              as multi-agent problems from   distributed control and artificial intelligence.
