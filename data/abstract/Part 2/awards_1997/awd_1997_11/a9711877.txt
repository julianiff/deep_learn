Abstract    :
                Early  high-temperature  metamorphism  and  deformation   of  oceanic gabbros
              record the evolution of the lower crust near  mid-ocean   ridges.  Deciphering 
              this  record  has   proven  difficult   for  two  reasons:  (1)  imprecise  
              temperature  estimates for metamorphism, and (2) uncertainties about  the 
              equilibrium state of mineral assemblages. This study employs  a  combination of
              experimental, analytical, and  statistical  methods to address these issues. 
              Experimental studies focus  on  the temperature and time dependence of
              secondary mineral  compositions using natural metamorphosed gabbros  formed  at
               the  East  Pacific  Rise.  The  petrologic  and  statistical  component of
              this project will determine metamorphic mineral  compositions from a suite of
              gabbros from ophiolites and mid  ocean  ridges.  This study will yield a better
              understanding  of  the  time scales and spreading-rate dependence of  lower 
              crustal processes near mid-ocean ridges.
