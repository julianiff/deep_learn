Abstract    :
              This  project  probes the nature of psychological representations  of  discourse
              and applies the results to a computational model of  "who  knows what" in text
              about multiple agents.  Many  kinds  of  inferences and pragmatic effects
              depend on knowing who has access  to  which  information,  as  well as who 
              shares  common  ground.  Computational and psychological models of text
              understanding have  largely  ignored the ramifications of multiple agent 
              sources  on  the   representation  and  use  of  textual   information.    Our 
              objectives  are:  A) to examine how people process and  represent  the 
              distinct  knowledge states of agents depicted or  quoted  in  both constructed
              and naturally occurring texts, B) to investigate  how  readers' 
              representations  of  texts  are  affected  by  the  perspectives they bring to
              these texts, as well as by how sources  are  presented,  and C) to apply these
              empirical results  to  the  construction   of  a  partly-automated  system  for
                extracting,  representing,  and coding "who knows what" in a large  corpus 
              of  naturally  occurring texts - news stories from  The  Wall  Street  Journal.
                This  research  will  contribute  to  practical  goals  concerning the
              modeling and extraction of information  from  text  and  reported speech, as
              well as to theoretical goals  concerning  how people process and represent
              texts about multiple agents.
