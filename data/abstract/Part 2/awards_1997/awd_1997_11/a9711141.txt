                Through NSF Interactive/Intelligent Research Laboratory an infrastructure  
              is being established to support the development of a competitive integrated  
              research and student training program in computer science.  For a long-term  
              impact, the research activities are being organized under thrusts of
              intelligent systems, display systems, and distributed parallel systems. The
              related synergistic research is being conducted via fifteen projects on topics
              such as recognition/detection systems, data mining, visual problem solving in
              robotics and medical technology, virtual reality (sense of presence), and
              efficient distributed parallel computing models and their dynamic
              reconfiguration.    The laboratory is planned to focus on key activities to
              have an unprecedented impact on the state of minorities in the computer science
              field.  Through this effort, Clark Atlanta University is expected to develop
              its computing science research capabilities and a viable base of PhD caliber
              minority students, paving the way for an eventual doctoral program.  It is
              hoped that through the efforts of the laboratory, the nation is helped in
              building a better racially and ethnically balanced technological enterprise for
              the benefit of its present and future generations.
