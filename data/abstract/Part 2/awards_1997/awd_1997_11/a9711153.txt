Abstract    :
              This grant provides travel funds for about 40 US students from  different
              institutions to attend ACM's 16th SIGOPS  Symposium  on Operating Systems
              Principles, to be held in France in  October 1997. This symposium is being held
              for the first time  outside  of US. This symposium is well recognized as the 
              premier conference for the leading-edge research in the field.  In the past it
              has been attended by a large number of US  students, as it has served in
              broadening the experience of  promising young researchers and enriching their
              careers. The  students will be selected through an open competition based on 
              their research performance, potential to enrich the symposium,  and diversity
              considerations.***
