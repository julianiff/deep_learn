Abstract    :
              This is a collaborative research project between Prof. N. Asgriz of SUNY Buffalo
              (USA) and Prof. A. Manchaca-Rocha of UNAM (Mexico) in the area of collisional
              dynamics of liquid drops.  The objectives are to investigate the influence of
              drop shape and drop internal circulation, and to develop a criterion for the
              fragmentation of collided drops.  This is a combined computational-experimental
              study, where the U.S. participant will focus on numerical simulations, and the
              Mexican counterpart will contribute with the experimental investigation. 
              Several simplifying assumption are adopted in the volume tracking simulations,
              such as neglecting of the interstitial gas because of high inertial effects.   
              Fundamental understanding of complex droplet collisions for a large range of
              variation of  the collision Weber number, as well as obtaining practical
              fragmentation correlations, are expected.  The project has relevance to a
              variety of technologies and natural processes, including spray technology, fuel
              combustion, nuclear physics and rain drop dynamics.  This project is in
              response to the NSF-CONACyT initiative announcement.
