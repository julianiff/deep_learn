Abstract    :
              9711185  Hung, Chih-Cheng  Alabama A&M University    MII:  Development of a
              five-year plan for the enhancement of the computer science program at AAMU   
              This award supports the planning and development of a comprehensive five-year
              project to enhance the research and academic activities of the graduate and
              undergraduate programs in the Computer Science division at Alabama A&M
              University.  The plan of action includes: faculty development, laboratory
              expansions, developing advanced computing and research facilities,
              establishment of institutional linkage, outreach to local industry, course and
              curriculum development to incorporate technology advancements, and mentoring of
              minority students.    The main objective of this project is to plan and
              establish a Center for Research and Educational Excellence in Advanced
              Computing that caters to the needs of the local industry and provides excellent
              educational and research opportunities for the minority students in southern
              region.  The proposed   center will be of great potential in designing and
              developing state-of-the-art research and educational outreach in advanced
              fields of computing such as Image Analysis, Distributed Databases, Computer
              Security, High Performance Distributed Computing, and Visual Tools.  The
              project has the potential ultimately to attract and significantly increase the
              number and quality of  minority students in computer science.
