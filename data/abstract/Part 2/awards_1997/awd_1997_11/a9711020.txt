Abstract    :
                This award is made under the high performance connections portion  of NCRI's
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides partial
              support for the installation and operation of  a DS-3 ATM connection to the
              nearest MCI POP for access to the  Very High Performance Backbone Network
              Service (vBNS).    Applications include:  - Reliable Multicast: TMTP Protocol 
              - The Unify System  - Computational Materials Science Research  - Materials
              Engineering Research  - Molecular Dynamics Study of Large Scale Real Materials 
              - Computational Particle Physics  - Computational Fluid Dynamics  - Numerical
              Analysis of Infrared Spectrometry for Medical Diagnosis  Collaborating with:  -
              Oak Ridge National Lab  - National Energy Research Supercomputer Center  -
              National Center for Supercomputing Applications    The award provides partial
              support of the project for two years.
