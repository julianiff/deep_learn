              Abstract  ATM-9711602  Marland, Gregg  DOE - Oak Ridge Operations    Title:
              Modeling the CO2 Emissions Implications of Land-Use Change  and Forest
              Management Alternatives    This proposal is aimed at further developing a
              mathematical carbon  accounting model, GRAZ/Oak Ridge Carbon Accounting
              Modeling  (GORCAM).  Its primary focus is to better represent materials that 
              are harvested from the landscape and to better parameterize the  range of
              materials substitutions that can occur.  The proposal  attempts to trace the
              effect of a policy action to store CO2 a step  or step beyond the site specific
              effects.  This information is  important and necessary for policy makers in
              assessing the impact  of management practices on national and global carbon
              budgets.
