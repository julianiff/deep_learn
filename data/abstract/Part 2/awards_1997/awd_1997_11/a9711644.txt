Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9711644  TANSIK      This proposal outlines the function that the
              National Science Foundation Evaluator will perform in the Center for
              Microcontamination Control (CMC).  The proposal discusses the CMC, and
              summarizes the roles the Evaluator will enact, namely qualitative and
              quantitative evaluations of Center activities, participation in semi-annual
              meetings, attendance at NSF Evaluator activities, and exit interviews with
              departing companies.
