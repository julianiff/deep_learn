              This award provides funding for a 1997 FutureCar Challenge Faculty Advisor
              Award to develop and disseminate undergraduate engineering curriculum materials
              based on the design and construction of this team-based, student vehicle
              competition.    The FutureCar Challenge is a competition for undergraduate
              students teams to design and build a mid-size, production-ready vehicle which
              can get up to 80 miles per gallon while still maintaining the performance,
              safety, and affordability of existing cars.   This competition is sponsored by
              the Department of Energy and USCAR, a research venture between Chrysler, Ford,
              and General Motors.   Curriculum will be developed to incorporate this vehicle
              competition into undergraduate engineering curriculum that combines advanced
              automotive technology, business skills, problem-solving, marketing, management,
              teaming, and leadership.
