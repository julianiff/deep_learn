Abstract    :
                                          ABSTRACT    There  is  mounting evidence that the
              very low oceanic inputs  of  some  essential trace elements may limit the
              ability  of  primary  producers to acquire major nutrients and grow.  This this
              project  the  principal investigator will test the hypotheses that (1) low 
              zinc  concentrations in the surface oceans may limit the rate  of  inorganic 
              carbon uptake by phytoplankton; (2) that  cadmium  and  cobalt may substitute
              for zinc in some species; and that (3)  the  relative  availability of carbon,
              zinc, cadmium, and  cobalt  may  effect  differentially the growth of diatoms
              and coccolithophores  and  thus  influence  through the so-called rain  ratio 
              (calcium  carbonate/organic carbon export to the deep sea), the  efficiency  of
               the  biological  carbon dioxide pump and  hence  the  partial  pressure of
              carbon dioxide in surface seawater.  These hypotheses  will  be  studied using
              laboratory experiments with  diatoms  and  coccolithophores  and  groundtruthed
              through  a  small  sea-going  field program.
