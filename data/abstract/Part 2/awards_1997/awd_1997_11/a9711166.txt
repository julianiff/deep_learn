Abstract    :
              The field of partial evaluation has matured greatly in  recent years, with a 
              wide variety of applications in a  diversity of areas.  However, most of the 
              work on partial  evaluation, to date, relies on using knowledge about data 
              values to guide specialization of program code.  This  project will 
              investigate the use of partial evaluation for  the dual optimization, of  using
              knowledge about a program  to guide the specialization of data representations.
               The  project will develop, implement, and evaluate techniques to  formulate
              low level data representation optimizations in  terms of partial evaluation of
              enhanced interpreters, as  well as techniques to incorporate pragmatic concerns
              such as  placement of representation conversion operations in the  residual
              code.
