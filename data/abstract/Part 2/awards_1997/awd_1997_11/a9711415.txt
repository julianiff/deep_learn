Abstract    :
              DeJong and Heron  9711415    The objective of this study is to provide a deeper
              understanding of the socioeconomic adaptation to the U.S. of West Indian
              immigrants, an increasing demographic, political and economic force in the U.S.
               Specific research questions concern differences in occupational attainment
              between men and women in the immigrant population and between the immigrant
              population and various native populations; the influence of local labor market
              conditions on the process of occupational attainment; and the influence of
              different national sociopolitical contexts, represented by the U.S., Canada,
              and Britain on the process.  The analysis will apply various multivariate
              techniques to national census data.    ***
