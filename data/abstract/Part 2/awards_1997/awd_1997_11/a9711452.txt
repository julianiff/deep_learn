Abstract    :
              9711452  Seim    This project will carry out a modeling study of the benthic 
              front in an upwelling regime.  Using numerical modeling and  the analysis of
              existing observations from Florida Strait,  the study will examine how mixing
              parametrization, variable  forcing and stratification, advection of momentum
              and three-  dimensional topography influence the development and  evolution of
              a benthic front, and its interaction with the  ocean interior.  This study
              expands existing one-dimensional  theories of arrested boundary layers to areas
              of changing  slope and closed cross-sections.
