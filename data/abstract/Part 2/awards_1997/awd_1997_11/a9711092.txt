Abstract    :
              This award supports a three year project to promote greater industry 
              cooperation in architecting and managing the global Internet  infrastructure. 
              It addresses global engineering concerns that are highly  dependent upon
              cross-ISP coordination, particularly those requiring  measurement of Internet
              metrics.  It addresses ISPs' emerging need for  technical meahnaisms to
              facilitate service guarantees and financial  settlements between providers. 
              Specifically, the CAIDA endeavors to:      identify, develop and deploy
              measurement tools across the Internet;    work with commercial providers to
              provide them with a neutral,  confidential vehicle for data sharing and
              analysis;    provide networking researchers and the general Internet community
              with  current data on Internet traffic flow patterns;    assist in the
              introduction/deployment of emerging Internet technologies  such as multicast,
              Ipv6, web caching, bandwidth reservation protocols, etc;  and    enhance
              communications between commercial Internet service providers and  the broader
              Internet communities.    The goal is to have both government and industry
              participate in the  project's creation and operation.  The project is
              envisioned as a  supporting framework for active tasks to be defined by
              researchers in  conjunction with CAIDA members.  Tasks will be defined through
              proposals by  CAIDA researchers to one or more CAIDA sponsoring members;
              jointly proposed  by CAIDA researchers and CAIDA sponsoring members; or
              solicited by one or  more sponsoring members of CAIDA.  It is expected that the
              government's  role in funding the project will diminish as industry support
              increases.
