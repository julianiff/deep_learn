Abstract    :
              Increasing computerization of the process of acquiring and storing diagnostic
              images requires more sophisticated approaches to image retrieval in order to
              optimally use the images for improved health-care delivery, physician education
              and research. A content-based image retrieval system is being developed that
              takes a human-in-the-loop approach, because completely automated approaches are
              not feasible for radiological images in which the clinically useful information
              may consist of gray level and texture deviations in highly localized but
              difficult-to-segment regions of an image. In this approach, a physician
              manually delineates the pathology-bearing regions in an image. The CBIR system
              then analyzes these regions for their properties and uses a graph
              representation, augmented with the spatial relationships of the pathology
              bearing regions to anatomical landmarks, to index the images into a database
              and retrieve similar images typically with known diagnoses. This project
              focuses on the domain of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) images in
              patients with a variety of lung diseases. Regarding scientific goals, the
              project addresses: (1) the computational complexity of retrieval and its
              mitigation by the use of appropriate heuristics; (2) selection of similarity
              criteria to use for comparing the pathology-bearing regions of the query and
              indexed images; and (3) the design of a physician-friendly software
              architecture that allows for extension to other disease categories.
