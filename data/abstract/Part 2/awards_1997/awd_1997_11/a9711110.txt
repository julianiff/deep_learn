Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion  of NCRI's
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides partial
              support for an DS3 ATM connection to the Very  High Performance Backbone
              Network Service (vBNS).  This connection  will be made through the proposed
              Boston Area Gigapop which will  be connected the the vBNS with an OC-3c
              circuit.    Applications include:  - Magnetosphere Modeling  - Satellite Data
              Research and Analysis  - Parallel I/O  - High Performance Distributed
              Simulation  - Analysis of Multimedia Information  - Transportable and
              Intelligent Agent Systems  Collaborating with:  - Brown University  -
              California Institute of Technology  - Goddard Space Flight Center  - Harvard
              University  - MIT  - Naval Research Laboratory,  - University of Maryland   
              The award provides partial support of the project for two years.
