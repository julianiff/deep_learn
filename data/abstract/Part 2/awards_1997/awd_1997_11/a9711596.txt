Abstract    :
                  9711596  Hatcher     The role of macromolecular organic matter will be
              examined with respect to the long-term stabilization or sequestration of
              protein nitrogen in marine systems using the combined application of
              geochemical and biochemical tools.  The study will focus upon samples already
              obtained from a natural mineral-matter depleted marine sediment (Mangrove Lake,
              Bermuda), oceanic organic-rich sediments from the Peru upwelling zone and the
              Santa Barbara Basin, oceanic sediment trap material, and on samples obtained
              from laboratory degradations of algae grown to enrich them in 13C and 15N. 
              Electrophoretic techniques and NMR will follow the fate of protein in
              laboratory incubations during its incorporation into the macromolecular pool. 
              Protein's role in forming macromolecular organic matter which resists
              degradation in sediments over the long term will be studied.  To address this
              issue, a novel dual/selective labeling experiment will be used to examine any
              cross-coupling of carbon and nitrogen from each of two parallel but selectively
              labeled pools of algae during degradation.     Understanding the mechanisms and
              processes involved in the formation of refractory nitrogen-containing organic
              material in sediments and sediment-trap material will improve our understanding
              of nitrogen cycling in marine systems and will also provide a conceptual
              framework for improved predictive models of global nitrogen cycling.
