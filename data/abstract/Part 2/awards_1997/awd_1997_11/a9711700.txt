Abstract    :
                  9711700  Webb         This is a seismic study of Axial volcano and the 
              central JdF ridge using 16 OBSs and 4 OBHs deployed over an  8-month period. 
              Data from earthquakes recorded during this  time will be used to investigate
              the crust building process  on the central JdF (1) by using the temporal and
              spatial  patterns in seismicity and fault-plane mechanisms to infer  along and
              across-axis variations in the stress field and to  investigate the thermals
              tructure fromt he depth of the  brittle-ductile transition, and (2) by using
              the travel  times from a subset of the events to perform a tomographic 
              inversion for the 3D velocity structure of Axial volcano.
