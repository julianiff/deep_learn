Abstract    :
              Abstract - Dwyer        This is a study of fundamental processes in chemically
              reacting hydrocarbon droplet groups and spray systems.  Numerical simulations
              are performed with a simplified droplet dynamics flow system that incorporates
              many features of a more complex spray system but allows for a physical
              interpretation that can be and is confirmed experimentally.  Emphasis is on
              those physical and chemical processes influencing pollutant formation, notably
              nitric oxide, excess hydrocarbons, and soot.  The simplified flow system is
              fully three-dimensional and relies on multiple line droplet arrays in
              configurations that involve interactions with cold walls and the formation of
              droplet clouds.  The program is designed to give the basic flowfield
              information needed by statistical models of diesel engine sprays such as the
              KIVA computer code and also to give fundamental information on the vaporization
              and ignition of droplet groups.    This program is designed to provide
              information needed to reduce major pollutants produced by spray systems in
              diesel engines.
