Abstract    :
              This research pertains to theory and observation of equatorial plasma
              irregularities and equatorial aeronomy.  The PI (and one student) will make
              several sets of short-term observations with the Jicamarca radar, following up
              with long-term observations using JULIA.  Using the PI's coherent scatter radar
              imaging technique at Jicamarca, the PI will assess and evaluate a number of
              breaking theories of equatorial F-region plasma irregularities, like why
              large-scale plasma depletions bifurcate, what coherent scatter Doppler spectra
              signify, and how shear flow affects the evolution of bottomside spread F waves.
               The PI will devote another portion of this project to continuing operations of
              the JULIA radar for E and F region plasma irregularity studies.  JULIA data has
              shown:  (1) gradient drift waves in the electrojet are sometimes modulated by
              tides propagating into the lower thermosphere, (2) evidence of storm-time
              effects on equatorial electrodynamics and irregularity generation, and (3)
              F-region irregularities frequency emerge in the early morning, contrary to
              conventional wisdom.  The PI will develop new analytic theories to more
              precisely account for these phenomena.  Finally, he will develop a new mode for
              incoherent scatter measurements, incorporating an alternating phase-coded pulse
              for making for sensitive temperature and composition experiment in the topside
              region.
