Abstract    :
                This technology development project deals with acoustic travel-  time current
              meters (ACMs) that are widely used in oceanography   and the atmospheric
              sciences to measure boundary layer   turbulence.  These sensors infer velocity
              by measuring the   difference in time required for acoustic pulses to travel
              both   ways between opposing transducers separated by a distance L.  The  
              response of such a device to turbulence having spatial scales   equal to or
              smaller than L should be attenuated, and a simple   model of the ACM response
              function based on this idea has been   known for almost 30 years.  However,
              recent field and laboratory   measurements of the spatial response of
              ultrasonic ACMs to   turbulence in water show that measured velocities are less
                attenuated than this simple model predicts. Research will be   conducted to
              test whether anomalous behavior of ACMs is due   either to flow distortion or
              to spatial variations in the   amplitude and phase of the acoustic field, and
              to distinguish   between these alternatives. It is expected that an improved  
              understanding of the spatial response of ACMs will considerably   enhance their
              usefulness as turbulence sensors in the ocean, and   should lead to improved
              sensor design and performance.
