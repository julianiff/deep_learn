Abstract    :
              9711431  Parker    Meandering channels of large submarine fans have a planiform 
              expression that is similar to subaerial meanders but cross  sectional shape
              differs.  Levees are more prominent and  asymetrical in the submarine channels.
               Pis will delineate  the connection between channelized sediment-driven flows
              on  the submarine fans and the evolution of submarine channel  meandering. 
              They will also develop a numerical model for  the submarine meanders, where
              their vast experience in  subaerial meanders, channels and floodplains will be
              very  useful.  The study will lead to a better understanding of  these little
              known morphological features offshore major  river systems.
