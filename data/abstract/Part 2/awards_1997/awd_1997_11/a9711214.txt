Abstract    :
                The effect of polymer adsorbtion on model colloid particles will be
              investigated using total internal reflection microscopy (TIRM) to detect
              particle dynamic interactions and small-angle light scattering (SALS) to
              determine the flocculation rate.  Comparison between the predictions based on
              the two measurements will be made, and fundamental aspects concerning
              interparticle forces will be obtained.  TIRM was previously developed by the
              author.  The TIRM measurements in dynamic conditions will be compared to those
              performed with the atomic force microscope (ATM) in equilibrium conditions.   
              If successful, the research will improve fundamental understanding of the van
              der Waals and dispersion forces, with immediate application to evaluation of
              colloidal stability and production of colloidal particles coated with polymeric
              macromolecules.
