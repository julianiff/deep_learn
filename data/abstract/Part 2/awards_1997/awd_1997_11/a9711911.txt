Abstract    :
              This pilot study will analyze  stable isotopes in planktic  foraminifera in
              sediment cores off the coast of Peru for the  Holocene interval.  In many
              regions of the world the early  Holocene is believed to have been a time of
              warmer-than  modern temperatures.  Data derived from Peruvian middens  give
              conflicting evidence as to whether this period was  somewhat warmer or cooler
              than today.  The foraminiferal  data should provide a record of sea surface
              temperatures and  seasonal upwelling along coastal Peru throughout the 
              Holocene, including the period of human coastal settlement.
