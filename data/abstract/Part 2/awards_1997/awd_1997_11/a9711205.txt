Abstract    :
              9711205  Fornes    The aim of this work is to understand interactions between 
              macroions and small counterions.  The specific focus is to  measure counterion
              transport in solutions of  polyelectrolytes to (1) establish experimentally the
               dependence of transport on linear charge density; (2) to  elaborate a
              comprehensive and practical model for the  combined effect of electrostatic
              interaction and complex  formation; and (3) to determine experimentally the
              effects  of polyelectrolyte morphology.  Charged colloids and  micelles will
              also be investigated, as ill the  electrochemical kinetics of reduction of
              metal ions bound to  macroions.  %%%  Improving the ability to predict the
              behavior of natural  systems of macroions, and designing and controlling their 
              behavior in materials systems consisting of charged  polymers, colloids, or
              assemblies of charged species such as  micelles are important to both nature
              and commerce.  Examples include the transport of nutrient ions by clay 
              particles in plants, and the ion binding properties of the  polyelectrolyte
              DNA.  Paints, cutting fluids, drug delivery  systems, adhesives and lubricating
              coatings are all examples  of important industrial uses for macroions.  ***
