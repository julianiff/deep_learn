Abstract    :
                  SummerScape is a two-week science and engineering summer experience targeted
              to middle school girls and teachers .  It is designed to help girls experience
              confidence and success in science and engineering tasks and to provide teachers
              with equitable teaching methodologies.  Before and during the camp experience,
              teachers methodologies will be assessed.  While at camp, they will be provided
              with experiences designed to build equitable science teaching pedagogy and
              practice. Single sex and mixed sex environments will be used to assess
              difference in quality or quantity of teacher-student interactions during the
              two weeks of camp. Data will be collected to determine if  the training makes a
              difference in attitudes and achievement of middle school students and in
              teaching practices after the summer experience.
