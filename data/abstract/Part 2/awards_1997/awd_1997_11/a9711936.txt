Abstract    :
              This  project  investigates combined visual  and  haptic  (touch)  interfaces  
              to  display  multi-dimensional  data  generated   by  computer  models  of 
              physical systems.  The  focus  is  on  data  features  that are difficult to
              convey visually, such  as  scalar  data  which  fills  volumes, vector fields, 
              and  tensor  fields.  First, tests are conducted to better understand the
              perception of  haptic  rendering  elements:  virtual surfaces  and 
              constraints,  forces  and  torques,  and  mechanical impedances.   Second,  new
               haptic  rendering  modes are developed which  can  convey  multi-  dimensional
               data via combinations of haptic rendering  elements.  These   modes   are 
              tested  using  representative  visualization  problems   in   fluid  dynamics, 
              electromagnetics,   and   solid  mechanics.   Third,  visualization puzzles 
              are  developed  which  quantify  the  perceptual added value of haptic
              rendering  modes.  Both  cooperative and complementary visual/haptic  rendering
               are  explored.   The  project seeks to discover synergistic  rendering  modes 
               which  produce  understanding  more  easily  than  visual  rendering  alone.  
              An improved visual/haptic  interface  enables  intuitive  debugging of computer
              models, efficient  visualization  of modeling results, and improved physical
              understanding.  Such a  capability  benefits the conduct of scientific research
               in  many  fields,  the design and analysis of engineered systems,  and  the 
              education of future scientists and engineers.
