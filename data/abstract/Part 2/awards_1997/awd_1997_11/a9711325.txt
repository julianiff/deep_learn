              Center    Proposer: Tommie R. Blackwell    Title: "Collaborative Research for
              Spatial Technology Applications and Training"      Amount: $100,000     This is
              an SGER proposal for exploratory research on the educational applications of
              spatial technologies with the specific purpose of creating a model of
              teaching,learning, and outreach.This model is intended to assist the proposer
              in developing a future (not included in this proposal) educational
              demonstration project in spatial technologies. The project will be overseen by
              the proposing institution in conjunction with Auburn University, NASA Marshall,
              NASA Global Hydrology and Climate Center, and the Huntsville Botanical Gardens.
              SRI International has been subcontracted to perform much of the exploratory
              research encompassed in this stage of the project.
