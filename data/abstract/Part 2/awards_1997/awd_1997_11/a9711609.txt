Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    OPP-9711609       RAM, MICHAEL  SUNY at Buffalo    This research
              project will utilize the Greenland Ice Sheet Project Two (GISP2) ice core to
              look for evidence of an eleven-year sunspot cycle.  Preliminary results
              indicate that some of the GISP2 ice core contains dust that has been
              transported by global atmospheric circulation to the summit of Greenland and
              incorporated into the ice sheet. Those results show that a sunspot cycle exists
              in an older section of the core and the investigator will determine if the same
              cycle can be identified in the past few hundred years when there is a
              historical, observational record of fluctuating sunspot activity.  The
              investigator will examine the relationship of increased aridity in China (the
              likely source of the dust) with the sunspot cycle to determine if fluctuations
              in solar activity may be responsible for changes either in desert size or wind
              speed/direction.  Therefore, this project has important implications for the
              impact of solar activity on continental environments.
