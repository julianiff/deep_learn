Abstract    :
                9711481  Allen    Research will be conducted under the auspices of the Coastal
              Ocean   Processes Program (CoOP).  A modeling study will be undertaken of the  
              physical circulation and ecosystem dynamics on the Oregon continental shelf  
              and slope. The objective of this research project is to understand and be  
              able to model physical oceanographic circulation processes and accompanying  
              ecosystem dynamics in the wind-forced continental shelf flow fields off the  
              U.S. northwest Pacific coast. Objectives include the application of high  
              resolution numerical circulation and ecosystem models to both process   studies
              and to direct simulations of continental shelf and slope flow   fields for
              investigation of the physical and biological mechanisms involved   in
              wind-forced across-shelf transport processes. It is intended that this   study
              will prepare for future Coastal Ocean Processes (CoOP) program field  
              experiments with application of a high-resolution, limited-area, regional  
              shelf circulation and ecosystem model. That model would be used to help  
              understand the physical and biological processes in the observed flow   fields
              by providing interpolation or extrapolation of necessarily   incomplete
              measurements and by enabling directly relevant process studies.
