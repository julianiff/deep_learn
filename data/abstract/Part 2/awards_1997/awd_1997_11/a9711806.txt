Abstract    :
                Comparative studies document the diversity of lifestyles observed across
              species.  The usual goal of such studies is to understand the causal basis for
              this diversity.  In the research proposed here, diversity in primate
              behavioral, morphological, and life history characteristics will be examined
              using comparative methods.  This study improves on previous research in three
              ways.  First, it makes use of the largest primate socioecological database to
              better document patterns across species.  This database also retains
              information on intraspecific variation to test patterns below the species
              level.  Second, this study investigates a recently expanded theoretical model
              which includes the role of conflict between males and females in primate social
              evolution.  Finally, this research applies new methods for dealing with the
              statistical problems of non-independence associated with evolutionary descent. 
              Results from these methods have already identified new patterns and invalidated
              some previously proposed associations among traits.  Thus, this research has
              important implications for the empirical basis of our understanding of primate
              social evolution.  Comparative studies have played an important role in
              explaining evolutionary patterns, and the present work is expected to have
              implications for future research and education in primatology.
