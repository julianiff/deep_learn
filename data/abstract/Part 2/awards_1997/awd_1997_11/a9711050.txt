Abstract    :
              van Leer  9711050       The investigator and colleagues organize an
              international  symposium on Godunov-type methods, which are widely used to 
              compute continuum processes dominated by wave propagation.  The  conference
              gives an overview of the current state of development  and use of Godunov-type
              methods in science and engineering, and  it offers a perspective of their
              future development and use.  The  symposium brings together senior researchers
              who are experts in  the development and use of Godunov-type methods, junior 
              researchers who are currently making significant contributions in  this field,
              graduate students just entering the field, and other  interested individuals. 
              It also includes experts from application  areas.       Many important physical
              problems involve flow of a  compressible fluid; they can be described by
              differential  equations whose solutions have jumps in their values.  Computing 
              such a solution is usually difficult.  Godunov-type methods are a  class of
              methods that compute the solution by making particular  local approximations to
              it, moving the local approximations  forward in time, and piecing together
              these advanced values in  certain ways.  Extensions of the original method
              include higher  accuracy in time or in space, higher-dimensional problems, 
              problems with more complicated equations.  This meeting is devoted  to recent
              developments in Godunov methods, including not only  mathematical and numerical
              advances but also advances in  applications areas.  Examples are mesoscale
              meteorology, the  modeling of plasma flows arising in the heliosphere, and a 
              variety of engineering fluid flows.
