Abstract    :
              9711869  Schmitt  This award to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in
              Massachusetts supports the development, jointly with industry partner Falmouth
              Scientific Incorporated, of new, relatively high-precision and inexpensive
              sensors for the long-term, unattended measurement of ocean salinity,
              temperature and pressure.  It is anticipated that this new class of sensor will
              be deployed on multi-year drifting buoys to investigate large-scale ocean
              circulation problems and refine models of ocean circulation and climate.  The
              award includes a substantial cost-share commitment by Woods Hole Oceanographic
              Institution, and is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation Program and
              the Division of Ocean Sciences.  ***
