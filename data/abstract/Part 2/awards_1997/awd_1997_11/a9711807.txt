Abstract    :
              Bearman and Gerteis    This dissertation examines the intersection of class and
              race in the U.S. South by focusing on the Knights and Labor between 1880 and
              1890.  It seeks to answer two questions:  What economic and social conditions
              facilitated the success of the Knights?  How did white and black Southern
              workers understand and construct their own interests?  The study combines
              quantitative analysis of the distributions of Knights' organizations in
              Southern counties, qualitative examination of newspaper records and manuscript
              collections, and case studies of the Knights organizations in Richmond and
              Atlanta.    ***
