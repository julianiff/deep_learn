Abstract    :
              9711267   Carlyle     The PI is organizing a Gordon Research Conference on
              Atmospheric Chemistry in Newport, RI on June 15-19, 1997. This Gordon Research
              Conference is one of the major meetings in this field. This year, the
              conference will cover a broad range of areas in atmospheric chemistry,
              including chemistry and climate, stratospheric chemistry, global tropospheric
              chemistry, biosphere-atmosphere exchange, marine air chemistry, regional air
              quality, and new frontiers in atmospheric measurements. The meeting will be
              attended by both established researchers and young scientists, among them the
              participants of the preceding Atmospheric Chemistry Colloquium for Emerging
              Senior Scientists (ACCESS).
