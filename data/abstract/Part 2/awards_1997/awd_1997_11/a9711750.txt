Abstract    :
              9711750  Houghton      The PIs will conduct focused studies to advance our
              understanding of climate  variability in the extratropics.  The primary
              emphasis will be on the seasonal  variability in the atmospheric annual cycle. 
                The seasonal variability research will focus on large-scale aspects for the
              onset and  ending of the fall and spring transition seasons, length of the
              seasons, and other  relevant variability in the annual cycle.  Description of
              seasonal variability and  understanding of the relevant dynamics that will be
              gained in this research is essential  for advancing knowledge of the
              ocean-atmospheric climate system in aspects such as:  Understanding transitions
              in atmospheric circulation states     Giving a basis for developing seasonal
              forecasting in the extratropics     Understanding the net atmospheric events on
              the ocean over the full annual cycle        (i.e., forcing of interannual and
              decadal variability signals).    This research is important because it has the
              potential to advance the understanding of  seasonal climate variability, its
              causes and physics.
