Abstract    :
              9811891  Sholkovitz    This ocean science technology development project focuses
              on the   design, construction, and testing of sensor systems for the  
              elemental analysis of aerosols on buoys at sea. These systems   involve field
              portable X-Ray fluorescence spectroscopy (FP-XRF)and   an Iron Aerosol Detector
              (FeAD) which uses fiber optic   spectrometry to measure Fe.  The primary
              objectives are sensors   which can measure, in an unattended manner, the
              aerosol   concentrations of dust and reactive iron (Fe) from ocean buoys.  
              Research areas that would benefit from real-time time-series   aerosol data
              from buoys include: measurement of off-shore dust and   contaminants transport,
              effects of mineral dust on the ocean's   biological productivity (the Fe
              Hypothesis), and the role of   anthropogenic mineral aerosols on the Earth's
              radiation balance   and climate.    This is a collaborative project between
              scientists and   engineers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,
              bringing   together expertise in buoy technology and instrumentation,  
              computer software development and marine geochemistry. Given that   aerosol
              sensors have never been deployed from buoys, this project   will involve
              designing, building and testing the individual   instruments and integrating
              these sensors through software into a   single buoy system. Bench and tower
              testing will be followed by   two seasons of field testing on a moored buoy off
              Woods Hole.
