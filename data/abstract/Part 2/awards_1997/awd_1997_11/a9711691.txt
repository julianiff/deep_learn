Abstract    :
              Some studies support the hypothesis that impersonal urban environments cause
              greater stress than do kin-based rural environments.  This project will refine
              this hypothesis by addressing three questions:  (i) how do potentially
              stressful socioecological factors (e.g., wage dependency, community
              cooperation, expectations of affluence) relate to the urban-rural continuum;
              (ii) how do such socioecological factors influence stress; and (iii) how do
              individual differences (e.g., age, personality, life-history) influence stress.
               The study will compare 70 individuals in two Botswana communities:  a remote
              village with under 500 population, and a low-middle income neighborhood of
              Gaborone with 150,000 population.  During nine-months field research,
              participant observation and key informants will provide an ethnographic
              foundation for more focused methods.  Data on independent variables
              (socioecological and individual differences) will be collected from each
              subject during four separate interviews: (1) one-hour structured life-history;
              (2) one-hour structured social networks; (3) two-hours structured personality;
              and (4) one-and-a-half-hours cultural models.  Stress (dependent variable) and
              daily experience will be assessed during three-days using twice-daily visits to
              collect samples of saliva and observations of immediate life-history
              experiences.  Saliva samples will be analyzed using a radioimmunoassay
              procedure to determine content of cortisol on return from Botswana.  Analyses
              will use repeated measures design multivariate linear regression.
