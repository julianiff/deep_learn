Abstract    :
                  9711755  Barthelmie   The project is a study of atmospheric aerosol
              particles that will use a one-dimensional lagrangian air quality model (ACDEP).
               The objective of this work is to produce a meteorology trajectory model that
              incorporates key aerosol formation processes, including secondary formation of
              inorganic and organic aerosols and heterogeneous chemistry.  Once updated, the
              model will be tested and evaluated with measurements from field intensive
              studies.  Data will be utilized from the Fraser Valley study (British Columbia)
              and from an air quality monitoring site in the eastern United States.    
              Results from this study will generate a new modeling platform that can assess
              the relative importance of various aerosol formation processes, interactions of
              suspended particles with ambient gas phase compounds, and the effect of
              atmospheric water vapor on gas-aerosol partitioning for water soluble organics.
               The improved aerosol model will be an important diagnostic tool for air
              quality managers.
