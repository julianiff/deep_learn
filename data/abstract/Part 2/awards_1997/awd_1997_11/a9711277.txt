Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9711277  Peter King and Jan Miller, University of Utah    Travel
              support will be provided to a group of twelve U.S. academic researchers to
              participate at the U.S.-South Africa (S.A.) workshop on particulate and
              multiphase processes on June 30-July 1, 1997, and to visit academic and
              industrial institutions for promoting collaborative activities in the field of
              minerals and chemical engineering.  The main purpose of the workshop to
              establish trends in fundamental research, present new research results obtained
              in both countries, and identify opportunities and topics for future
              collaborations.  The multiphase particulate systems to be considered include
              particle comminution, size separation, flotation, fluidization, three-phase
              flows, pneumatic and slurry transportation of solids.    The S.A. workshop will
              be co-chaired by Dr. Roy Marcus, President of the Engineering Association in
              South Africa.  He will be the link with other S.A. research institutions and
              industry.    The field of particulate and multiphase processes is essential in
              mineral, chemical, and environmental processes.  Research in this field has
              major relevance in both countries, and considerable benefits from research have
              been obtained.  A synergistic effect with benefits to both sides is expected by
              organizing the workshop and short working visits by small groups to S.A.
              universities and industry.    This workshop is being supported by the Division
              of Chemical and Transport Systems and the Division of International Programs.
