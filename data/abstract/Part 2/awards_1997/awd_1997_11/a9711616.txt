              Sources and Sinks of Anthropogenic CO2:  Integrated Assessment Using
              Biogeochemical Modeling and Inversion of Atmospheric Transport    The major
              objective of the proposed work is to provide a quantitative assessment of the
              current CO2 budget and develop new models with more sophisticated integration
              of atmospheric,  terrestrial,  and marine processes with anthropogenic
              emissions.  Integrated multi-tracer inversion calculations will be performed. 
              This should provide a more accurate CO2 budget.  This study is unique in that
              it will develop calculations of sources and sinks of CO2 using CO2 and its
              stable isotopic composition.
