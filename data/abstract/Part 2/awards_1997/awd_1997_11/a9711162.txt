Abstract    :
               This is a program to provide small research grants to sociologists, supporting
              pilot projects, modest research travel needs, and occasional conferences to
              advance a variety of research areas in sociology.  The current grant continues
              the Fund for the Advancement of the Discipline of the American Sociological
              Association. The Fund for the Advancement of the Discipline program aims to
              nurture the development of scientific knowledge by supporting small,
              groundbreaking research initiatives and other important scientific activities.
              Through ASA's coordination and outreach, funds are allocated expeditiously for
              scholars to engage in exploratory research where support from other sources
              would be difficult to acquire. Thus, these small grants constitute an
              invaluable form of venture capital for research that has potential for
              challenging the discipline, for stimulating new lines of scientific research,
              and for facilitating new networks of scientific collaboration.     The Fund for
              the Advancement of the Discipline provides opportunities for substantive and
              methodological breakthroughs, broadens the dissemination of scientific
              knowledge, and provides leverage for acquisition of additional research funds
              from other sources.  These small grants made through the American Sociological
              Association are a highly efficient way to stimulate new research approaches,
              and maintain the intellectual vitality of scientific sociology.
