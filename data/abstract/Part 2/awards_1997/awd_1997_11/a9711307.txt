Abstract    :
              9711307  Devine  The Southfriere Hills Volcano in Montserrat began erupting on
              18 July 1995, creating an urgent need for volcanic hazard assessment.  normal
              components of hazard monitoring (seismicity, ground deformation, etc.) have
              been complemented by near real-time petrologic studies of eruption products in
              order to provide estimates of pressure and temperature conditions, and melt
              volatile content, in the magma storage region beneath the volcano, as well as
              the rate of magma ascent form that reservoir to the surface.  Such information
              is critical because volatile content and magma ascent rate influence the
              eruptive style of a volcano.  Rapid ascent of water-rich magmas leads to
              explosive eruptions, whereas slow ascent leads to passive degassing and
              effusive eruptive behavior.  On 17-18 September 1996, the volcano changed
              briefly from effusive to explosive eruptive style.  The change in eruptive
              behavior resulted from an increase in magma ascent rate.  Funding is requested
              to allow the P.I. to continue petrologic studies that provide estimates of the
              likelihood of a transition from effusive to explosive eruption behavior.
