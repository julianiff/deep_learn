Abstract    :
              This award provides travel for 10 U.S. computer scientists  to attend a workshop
              on the applications of tree automata  held in Dagstuhl, Germany.  The purpose
              of the workshop is  to bring together researchers from three different 
              communities-automated deduction, term-rewriting, computer-  aided verification
              and compiler construction who have been  utilizing tree automata, in an attempt
              at cross  fertilization of ideas among the disciplines and forging new 
              research directions.
