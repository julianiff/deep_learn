Abstract    :
              Reid  9711200  Support is provided to study the full water column  circulation
              of the Indian  Ocean, to examine the exchanges with the Atlantic and  Pacific
              Oceans, and  to compare the circulation and tracer patterns with those of  the
              other  oceans.  An attempt will be made to tie together the entire 
              Atlantic-Indian-  Pacific circulation and the inter-ocean exchanges of waters 
              that maintain the  broad differences in the characteristics between the three 
              oceans.  The  existing network of hydrographic sections, including the  recent
              WOCE  (World Ocean Circulation Experiment) data, will be used.
