Abstract    :
              In this RUI project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry   Program
              of the Chemistry Division, Spiegel will utilize   amplitude-calibrated forced
              Rayleigh scattering (AC-FRS) to investigate   small-molecule diffusion in
              polymer solutions.  This method will be used   to measure photoproduct and
              ground-state probe diffusion in order to   develop in-situ optical control of
              molecular diffusion through polymer   solutions and solids, including
              nonlinear-optical polymer waveguides.    Initial experiments will examine
              photoinduced changes in the diffusion   coefficients of azobenzenes and
              spiropyrans within polar-pendant group   polymers.  The diffusion of uncharged
              molecules across microscopic lengths through   complex solutions such as
              polymers is a commonly occurring process in   chemistry, chemical engineering,
              and biology.  Nonetheless, there are   many fundamental physical issues which
              have not been addressed.  This   project will look at some of the interactions
              which are important in   understanding how to use light to control the rates of
              diffusion of   neutral particles in polymer solids and solutions.  This type of
                phenomenon has implications for high-speed nonlinear fiber optics  
              technology.
