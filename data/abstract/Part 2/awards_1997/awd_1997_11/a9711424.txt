Abstract    :
              9711424  Channell    No geomagnetic paleointensity records are available for the
              high  latitude Southern Hemisphere.  The study is aimed at developing  such a
              record from the upper Quaternary piston cores collected by  R/V Thompson in
              1996 during an ODP site survey cruise. The record  will be useful for
              independent intra-hemispheric correlations to  tie the North Atlantic records
              with Antarctic and Greenland ice  core records. Environmentally biased
              stratigraphies, such as stable  isotopes, can not provide such independent
              correlative tool for  millennial scale climatic interpretations.
