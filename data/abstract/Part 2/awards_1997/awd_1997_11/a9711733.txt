Abstract    :
              EEC-9711733  Jose Roesset    This award provides funding to the Engineering
              Research Center at Texas A&M University/University of Texas at Austin entitled
              "Offshore Technology Research  Center" to develop a multimedia electronic
              textbook on Ocean Wave Theory and Applications.  This courseware can be used as
              a complement to undergraduate, graduate, and continuing education courses in
              ocean, coastal, civil, environmental, and marine engineering or as a stand
              alone book.  This educational material will be developed in both CD-ROM and
              World Wide Web format.   The goal of this textbook is to provide students with
              an understanding of the basics of ocean wave theory and current experimental
              and computational techniques for assessing and predicting the effect of the
              ocean on its surroundings.  This textbook will include topics on wave
              kinematics,  wave dispersion and refraction, linear and nonlinear free surface
              dynamics, wave forces on bodies of arbitrary shape, diffraction and radiation
              by fixed or moving bodies, ocean wave statistics and their simulation as
              stochastic processes, and experimental demonstrations from the Center's wave
              basin research.  Students will be able to solve an unlimited number of ocean
              wave problems with different parameters to observe the relative importance of
              different physical variables, validity of various approximations, and the
              behavior of solutions.
