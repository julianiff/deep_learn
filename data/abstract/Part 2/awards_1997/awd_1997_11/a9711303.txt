Abstract    :
              The research will extend work on information processing in organizations
              including (a) a model of real-time hierarchical resource allocation that
              distinguishes between and exhibits decentralized information processing and
              decentralized  decisionmaking, (b) models of markets as systems for aggregating
              information and calculating allocations, comparing the computational efficiency
              of various market an bureaucratic mechanisms, (c) models of the relationships
              between incentive constraints and information processing constraints, (d)
              models of strategic interactions between autonomous organizations each of which
              is controlled by multiple  boundedly-rational agents, and (e) to provide
              foundations for modeling bounded rationality and learning in dynamic settings.
              The primary approach to be used in this project is modeling the process of
              multi-agent  decisionmaking in organizations as real-time decentralized
              control.
