Abstract    :
              The National Domestic Workers Union of America (NDWUA), founded by Dorothy
              Bolden in 1968, was the most resilient union of domestic workers in U.S. labor
              history.  Given the difficulties and discrimination confronting poor African
              American women in the urban south, sociologists are driven to ask how did such
              a strong union form and endure?   This dissertation will answer the question by
              drawing on literature concerning the Civil Rights and Labor movements, theories
              of social movement organization, and examinations of the internal leadership
              structure of the Civil Rights movement.  The case study of the NDWUA will be
              developed using material from new primary sources, including archival materials
              from the union and related organizations, and interviews with NDWUA leaders,
              members, and knowledgeable others.  The case material will be analyzed by
              applying two interrelated strategies, the extended case method and event
              structure analysis, which in combination allow the organization's life history
              to be analyzed in a logical, rigorous, replicable manner.
