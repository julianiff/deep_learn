Abstract    :
              9711484  Foley    The PI's will develop new methods and models to evaluate the 
              potential for vegetation feedbacks on the climate system.  In  particular, they
              plan to couple IBIS, and integrated dynamical  biosphere model, to the NCAR
              Climate system Model (CSM).  Using the  dynamically coupled CSM/IBIS
              climate-vegetation model, they will  then explore vegetation feedback
              mechanisms and their potential  role in future climate scenarios.      The
              development and evaluation of these new coupled models will  provide a more
              holistic frame work for preforming integrated  analyses of global environmental
              change.  Most importantly this  work will help elucidate the potential role of
              vegetation feedbacks  on the climate system, and the impact of transient
              climate change  on the terrestrial biosphere.  Attempts at an integrated
              assessment  of global change must consider the possibility of substantial 
              biospheric feedbacks on the climate system.    This research is funded under
              the NSF methods and Models for  Integrated Assessment initiatives.
