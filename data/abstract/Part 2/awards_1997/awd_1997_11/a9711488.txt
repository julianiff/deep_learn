              ABSTRACT  ATM- 9711488  Shankar, Uma  Microelectronics Center of North Carolina 
                TITLE: Improved Methods for Modeling the Atmospheric Aerosol Size and
              Composition Distribution for Regional to Global Climate Change Applications.   
              This proposal is for modification of an integrated air pollution assessment EPA
              model widely in use.  These modifications are necessary steps in the right
              direction to apply the models for climate change issues.  The generalization of
              the present modal aerosol dynamics to allow for more than usual two modes,  to
              allow more generality in creation and destruction of modes,  and to allow for
              multi-component systems with size dependent composition,  is attempted in the
              work proposed.  This research enhances in the long run societal abilities at
              estimating regional environmental impacts.
