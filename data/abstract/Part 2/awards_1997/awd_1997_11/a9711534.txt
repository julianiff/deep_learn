Abstract    :
              This project will fund special sessions at the National Educational Computing
              Conference.  The speakers at the sessions will be past and current recipients
              of DUE grants who will share their expertise and experience with the NECC
              audience.  The speakers will be chosen for their work in pre-college education
              and teacher preparation and will interact with other educators involved in
              computer-based education.
