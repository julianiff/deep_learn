Abstract    :
                  9711882  Keeling     The project will continue Professor Keeling's 40-year
              atmospheric carbon dioxide time series and his measurements of dissolved
              inorganic carbon (DIC) and titration alkalinity (TA) of surface sea water at an
              array of stations (a 13-yr record).  The long term goal of this work is to
              document how the carbon cycle is responding to human activities and to
              variability in climate.  As part of this science objective, the project will
              continue to produce time series data on the stable carbon isotopic ratio of
              carbon dioxide and DIC on the same samples of air and water, to identify
              impacts on the oceanic and terrestrial carbon cycles.  The stable isotope
              information will be combined with laboratory studies to predict to high
              accuracy the partial pressure of CO2 in sea water from DIC and TA data. 
              Finally, the patterns in the time series data sets will be compared to patterns
              observed in records of global temperature and of the greenness of vegetation. 
              This additional task is intended to produce knowledge about the fluxes and
              storage of carbon in natural systems and their relation to climate by detecting
              temporal and spatial patterns in atmospheric CO2.             ATM-9711882
