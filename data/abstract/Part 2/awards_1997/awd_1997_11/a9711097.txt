Abstract    :
              9711097  Brenner  This grant, cosponsored by the Office of Multidisciplinary 
              Activities of the Directorate for Mathematical  and Physical  Sciences,
              supports development of a virtual-reality  laboratory for engineering education
              at North Carolina State  University that will be used by both beginning and
              upper-  level undergraduate engineering majors.  This funding will  be used to
              enhance a program currently funded by the NSF  Division of Undergraduate
              Education through the development  of software modules applicable to more
              advanced topics in  materials science and engineering.  The laboratory, which 
              will be associated with the Department of Materials Science  and Engineering,
              will be composed of virtual-reality  stations designed to take advantage of
              recent dramatic  reductions in the cost of force-feedback haptics and 
              breakthroughs in the performance of graphics workstations.  Each station will
              consist of a three-degreeof-freedom haptic  interface and IBM-compatible PCs. 
              %%%  This grant from the Division of Materials Research is one of  the first
              awarded in an attempt to find innovative methods  to integrate research and
              education.  It is to devise  teaching methods for materials concepts based on
              virtual  reality techniques including specifically, a tactile  (haptic)
              interface.  It is also cosponsored by the Office of  Multidisciplinary
              Activities of the Mathematical and  Physical Sciences Directorate.  It supports
              a program  currently funded by the NSF Division of Undergraduate  Education
              through the development of software modules  applicable to more advanced topics
              in materials science and  engineering.  ***
