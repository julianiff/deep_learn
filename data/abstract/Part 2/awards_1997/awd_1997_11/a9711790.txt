Abstract    :
                  This project will develop a new methodology for studies of  deformation at
              mid-ocean ridges using restoration of pre-  faulted seafloor topography from
              digital elevation models.  High-resolution bathymetry data, together with
              side-scan  sonar imagery from the Lucky Strike area of the Mid-Atlantic  Ridge,
              and from the southern East Pacific Rise will be used.
