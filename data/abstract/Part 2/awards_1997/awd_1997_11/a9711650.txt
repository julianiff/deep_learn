Abstract    :
              D Asaro  9711650  Mean and turbulent properties of the upper ocean boundary 
              layer and its  atmospheric and wave forcing will be measured during an  Autumn
              season in the  North Pacific. The resulting data will be used to study the 
              boundary layer  turbulence and its relationship to entrainment and mixing at 
              the mixed layer  base. Neutrally buoyant, high drag floats will be deployed 
              for a 100 days during  they will profile 4 times a day to get estimates of
              vertical  kinetic energy,  dissipation rates of turbulent kinetic energy,
              surface wind  stress, heat flux and  directional wave spectrum.
