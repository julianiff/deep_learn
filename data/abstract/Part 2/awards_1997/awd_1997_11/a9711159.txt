Abstract    :
                      9711159  Andrews      This award supports a international conference
              entitled  Topics in Number Theory , to be held at Pennsylvania State
              University, July 30-August 3, 1997. The object is to bring together many
              researchers whose works represent current trends in number theory. In
              particular, special emphasis will be on those topics involving substantial
              interplay between combinatorics, analytic number theory, and arithmetic
              geometry. This includes works related to the proof of  Fermat's Last Theorem ,
              and conjectures concerning special values of L-functions.      This research
              falls into the general mathematical field of Number Theory. Number Theory has
              its historical roots in the study of whole numbers, addressing such questions
              as those dealing with the divisibility of one whole number by another. It is
              among the oldest branches of mathematics and was pursued for many centuries for
              purely aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half century it has become
              an indispensable tool with diverse applications in areas such as data
              transmissions and processing, and communication systems.
