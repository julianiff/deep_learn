Abstract    :
              Duster and Shiao  9711757    This dissertation examines how philanthropic
              foundations contributed to the development of racial and ethnic projects in the
              nonprofit sector from 1960 through 1990.  The research proposes that the
              development of racial and ethnic concerns should be understood as a political
              process regularly channeled by philanthropic interventions.  The independent
              contribution that foundations make to the nonprofit sector results from their
              relative autonomy from government and thri cohesiveness as a field of
              organizations.  This research will first trace the history of foundation
              involvement in support of work concerned with race and ethnicity, then will
              examine the development of community foundation activities in two cities,
              Cleveland and San Francisco.    ***
