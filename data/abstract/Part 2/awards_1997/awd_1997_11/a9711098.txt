Abstract    :
              DMS9711098 51st Session of ISI, Istanbul  Abstract    The American Statistical
              Association (ASA), an affiliate of the   International Statistical Institute
              (ISI), requests funds for   approximately twenty (20) travel grants for the
              meetings of the 51st   Session of the ISI to be held in Istanbul, Turkey, from
              August 18-27,   1997.  The ISI holds its biennial meetings in capital cities
              around the  world, in odd-numbered years.  Of the approximately 500 United
              States   residents who are members of the ISI, about 60 percent attend the  
              biennial meeting.  The ISI meeting includes meetings of the Bernoulli   Society
              for Mathematical Statistics and Probability; the International   Association
              for Survey Statisticians (IASS); the International   Association for
              Statistical Computing (IASC); the International   Association for Official
              Statistics (IAOS); and the International   Association for Statistical
              Education (IASE) Thus, this will be an   umbrella meeting with sessions of
              interest for thousands of statisticians.  Further, the meetings bring together
              individuals from various areas of   statistical research.  Papers cover
              theoretical statistics and many   areas of application including engineering
              and the behavioral, social,   physical, and health sciences.  Copies of
              individual papers are made   available during the meeting and proceedings of
              the biennial sessions   are published.  Examples of some of the presentations
              by recipients of   past NSF travel grants include "The Role of Electronic
              Communication in  Statistics Education," "Object Oriented Methods in
              Statistics--  Graphical Construction and Editing of Plots," and "Time Series  
              Applications in Astronomy and Meteorology."    The travel grants will provide
              partial support to defray transportation  costs for a limited number of
              individuals, who will be selected by a   committee of ASA members.  Of primary
              importance to the ASA is the   emphasis placed on encouraging younger
              statisticians to participate in   the meeting.  ASA proposes to awa rd
              approximately twenty grants, with   the majority of the funds supporting
              individuals who received their   Ph.D. in 1988 or later.  The ASA encourages
              applications from all   qualified individuals, especially women and minorities.
               ASA affirms   the policies of the NSF in this regard.
