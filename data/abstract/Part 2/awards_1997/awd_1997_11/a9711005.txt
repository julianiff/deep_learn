Abstract    :
                            9711005  Wiles    After completing his work on the
              Taniyama-Shimura conjecture for semistable elliptic curves, the principal
              investigator has turned his attention to the study of reducible
              representations. Here the problem is to show that ordinary 2-dimensional Galois
              representations with reducible residual representation necessarily come from
              modular forms.    This project falls into the general area of arithmetic
              geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number
              theory and geometry.  This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful -
              having recently solved problems that withstood generations.  Among its many
              consequences are new error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both
              modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
