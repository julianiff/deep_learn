Abstract    :
              Webb  OPP 9711557    Abstract    The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research
              (SCAR) Antarctic  Offshore Stratigraphy Program (ANTOSTRAT) committee will
              convene  a workshop at Hobart, Australia, during July, 1997, with the 
              principal objective of writing a document that outlines important  topics that
              the Antarctic geoscience community should address  during the next decade. 
              This document, or strategic plan, will  focus on significant events and
              processes associated with  changing environmental conditions over the last 100
              million  years; and will consider the types of geological sampling,  including
              drilling and coring, required to attain these  geological objectives.  The
              document produced at the Hobart 1997  workshop will be used by SCAR at its 1998
              meeting, to consider  instituting a new Group of Specialists that is tasked
              with  implement the recommendations of the workshop.  This award  provides
              participant support costs so that the US geoscience  community may be
              represented at this workshop.
