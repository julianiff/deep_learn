              Investigator Inititated  Principal Investigator:  Arup K. Chakraborty 
              Affiliation:   University of California Berkeley.      This grant is awarded
              through the Separations and Purification Program sub-element of the
              Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of the Chemical and Transport
              Systems Division.  The principal investigator is Dr. Arup Chakraborty of the
              University of California Berkeley.  The project is directed towards the
              understanding of random heteropolymer adsorption on disordered surfaces and the
              rational design of pattern matching between heterofunctional polymers and
              adsorption sites.  A combination of replica field theory and ensemble groth
              Monte-Carlo simulations will be developed to examine the issues of statistical
              pattern matching.    Elucidating the phenomenon of statitical pattern matching
              is expected to impact technologies relevant to biomedical applications such as
              drug delivery and drug design,   Protein separation processes, and polymer
              adsorptioon and adhesion to surfaces.  A goal of the research is the de novo
              design of random heteropolymer sequence statistics(and hence chemistry) that
              will optimally inhibit the attachment of specific viruses to cells, and to
              guide the design of inexpensive chromatographic materials that can discriminate
              between different types of protein sequences.
