Abstract    :
              This  project has the goal of understanding computational aspects  of  the 
              immune  system.   The project extends  earlier  work  by  emphasizing the
              highly distributed memory and control  structures  of the immune system and
              integrating several earlier models.  The  following  approach  is  taken:  (1) 
              identify  an  immune-system  mechanism  that  appears to be interesting 
              computationally,  (2)  write a computer program that implements or models the
              mechanism,  (3) study its properties through simulation and analysis, and (4) 
              demonstrate its capabilities, either by applying the model  to  a  biological
              question of interest or by showing how it can be  used  profitably  in a
              computer science setting.  Computer security  in  open  environments (e.g., the
              Internet) is used as  a  motivating  application  and as an on-line environment
              in which to  test  the  integrated  adaptive computer immune system.  Other 
              applications  include:   biological  modeling,  vaccine  design  for   mutating
               viruses, and anomaly detection in manufacturing.  Distributed and  secure 
              computing will play a central role in almost  any  future  networked  computer 
              system,  and  this  project  contributes   a  principled  approach to this
              topic, particularly the  problem  of  how  to  deploy  active  truly 
              autonomous  agents  across  large  networks
