Abstract    :
                    Processes  of shallow fractionation of mantle-derived  melts  are central
              to the creation of oceanic crust. In this study,  we   will   undertake   a 
              comprehensive,   systematic   and  quantitative study of the mineralogy and
              petrology of phyric  lavas   from  three  mid-ocean  ridge  segments  with  
              very  different AMC characteristics and progressive shrinking  and 
              disappearance of the melt lens. The three ridge segments are  the  East 
              Pacific  Rise at 9 30'N,  10 30'N  and  the  Mid-  Atlantic  Ridge at 26 S, for
              which we have samples that  are  well  studied  for major elements, trace
              elements,  isotopic  ratios, and baseline petrography and mineralogy. The
              samples  we  propose  to  study  in  detail  contain  phenocryst  and 
              microphenocryst   assemblages,   as   well   as   refractory  megacrysts 
              containing melt inclusions.  Using a variety  of  techniques   (point  
              counting,   Nomarski,   crystal   size  distributions,  and electron
              microprobe) we  will  determine  the  abundances,  compositions and
              compositional  zoning  of  different  crystal  populations and their  melt 
              inclusions.  These  data  will be interpreted using available  petrologic 
              tools  to  constrain  the order and relative  importance  of  identified 
              processes of shallow fractionation relating  the  various  liquids  and solids
              present in each  of  the  three  areas.  The  comparative nature of the study 
              and  the  wide  variety   of   quantitative   mineralogic   and   petrologic 
              constraints  will  allow us to test numerous  current  ideas  about AMC
              processes, including the notion that the melt lens  is the site of extensive
              magma mixing.
