Abstract    :
              9711710  Curry    Funds are provided for the support of core and rock sample 
              repository at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution that is  maintained for the
              benefit of marine geological community at  large.  The prime criteria for
              continued funding of these  facilities remain the extent and quality of service
              provided  by the repository to the community, the extent and types of  studies
              supported by the core and rock samples and steps  taken by the institutions to
              maintain and archive the  materials in pristine condition for future use. 
              Funds will  support the Woods Hole facility for three years and allow it  to
              provide continued service to the marine geoscience  community.
