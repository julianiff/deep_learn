Abstract    :
              This research investigates computer support for learning, working, and  
              collaborating.  It focuses on communities of practice (such as local  area
              network   managers and research teams) as subgroups within and across
              organizations. It involves   work with specific communities to study their
              actual and potential learning processes.   Based on the interpretation and
              assessment of these observations and theories from the   research literature
              and previous work the project will develop and articulate a new   conceptual
              framework for computational support of organizational learning. The research  
              issues to be addressed include (1) how to capture knowledge and integrate the
              contexts of   work; (2)how to sustain timeliness and utility of evolving
              information, and (3) how to   deliver relevant information actively and
              adaptively. To assess and develop this   framework, organizational memories
              will be created in collaboration with these   communities, that include  (1)
              mechanisms to capture and represent task specifications,   work artifacts, and
              group communications;  (2) facilities for practitioners to reorganize   and
              sustain the usefulness of the memory; and  (3)techniques of access and delivery
              for   knowledge relevant to current tasks,. The project will extend emerging
              WWW   technologies with structured web-site interactivity, version control of
              evolving   information, software critiquing agents, and end-user
              programmability.  Finally, the   memory and learning prototypes will be
              assessed in naturalistic settings.
