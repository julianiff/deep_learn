Abstract    :
                Beneath the mountainous ocean ridges lies a ribbon-like  vat  of magma from
              which tectonic plates are made.  The existence  of  this  magma  is  known from
              the lavas erupted  onto  the  seafloor  and  from  seismic studies of  this 
              region.   The  eruptive  behavior  and rate of cooling  of  this  magma  is 
              recorded  in the numbers and sizes of crystals contained  by  the   lavas.   
              This   research   involves   measuring   the  distribution of crystal sizes in
              rocks from the East Pacific  Rise  and  the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to discern the 
              individual  styles of magmatism at these ridges.  Because the separation  rate 
              differs significantly between these ridges,  a  marked  difference  in the
              crystal size distributions  is  expected.  This  work  will contribute to
              understanding the fundamental  process by which Earth evolves as a planet.
