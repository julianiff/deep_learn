Abstract    :
              This award is made under the innovative technology connections portion of 
              NCRI's "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64, which covers 
              K-12 education institutions (including vocational technical schools),  public
              libraries and museums.  It provides partial support for twelve  months to
              investigate the use of FSK modulation (Frequency Shift Keying) on  unused
              Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS) bands.  This is an  application
              of FSK modulation, which traditionally is used in spread  spectrum
              communication systems, to the ITFS microwave bands.  This  engineering study
              has the following objectives:      Develop a test plan that addresses both
              adjacent channel and co-channel  testing and test equipment requirements.   
              Systematically field test the use of FSK modulation techniques on  Multipoint
              Distribution Service (MDS) and ITFS frequencies, providing a  matrix of test
              results.    Determine the interference capabilities of an FSK signal into 
              conventional NTSC analog transmissions.    Prepare a document consistent with
              the format of the Request for  Declaratory Rulemaking on the Use of Digital
              technology in MDS and ITFS  frequencies.    The results of the test will be
              submitted to the FCC, and could assist the  FCC in its decision on allowing
              widespread use of this technology.
