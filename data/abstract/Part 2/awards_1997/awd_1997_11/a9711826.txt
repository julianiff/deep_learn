Abstract    :
              9711826  Grove    This grant provides $150,000 as three years partial salary 
              support for a technician to oversee operation and maintenance,  train new users
              and develop analytical routines using the soon-to-  be upgraded (EAR-9616827)
              electron microprobes at the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  This is a
              Phase I request  for technical support under the IF/EAR program.  A large
              number  of faculty at MIT and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution  (through
              their relationship in the MIT/WHOI joint program in  oceanography) and within
              the region will benefit from the  capabilities of this facility.  Currently
              funded and planned  studies that will take advantage of the newly upgraded 
              microprobes include determination of the influence of water on  partial melting
              in subduction zones, petrologic studies of  volcanics in the southern Cascades,
              and high-resolution textural  and mineralogic classification of samples in
              order to identify  prime locations for subsequent secondary ion microprobe
              analysis  of isotopic composition.  ***
