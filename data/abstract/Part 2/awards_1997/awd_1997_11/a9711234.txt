Abstract    :
              Viruses have shells made of repeated protein subunits surrounding  their genetic
              information. Many viruses, including polio, herpes,  and influenza, have
              icosahedraloshaped shells. It is not  understood how these shells self-assemble
              from hundreds of similar  protein subunits. A resolution to this question is
              important  because it allows us to better understand biological phenomena in 
              general and provides a paradigm for nano- and meso-scale self-  assembling
              systems which will become increasingly important in  materials and
              manufacturing. It might also eventually result in  mechanisms for interrupting
              shell formation and interfering with  the infection process.    Drs. Berger
              (MIT) and Prevelige (Univ. of Alabama at Birmingham)  are using cutting edge
              high performance computing and  biotechnology to design a realistic computer
              "toolkit" that will  allow biologists to study virus shell assembly on a
              computer  screen more easily and less expensively than comparable laboratory 
              work. The synergy of computational and biochemical approaches  promises rapid
              advances in our understanding of virus assembly and  self-assembling systems in
              general. This work is supported by the  Computational Biology Activity (BIO),
              the Computational  Mathematics Program (MPS), and the Office of
              Multidisciplinary  Activities (MPS).
