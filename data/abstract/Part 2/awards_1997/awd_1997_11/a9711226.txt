Abstract    :
              9711226  Yu  The proposed research is directed at the chain dynamics on 
              surfaces of water, polymer covered glasses and silicon  wafers in order to
              investigate the influence of confined  geometries on the chain motions.  In
              addition, interest is  focused on the chain diffusion in highly interacting
              systems  wherein the diffusants are known to impact on rheology of  the entire
              system even when they are present as minor  components.  With the interfacial
              dynamic techniques of  surface fluorescence recovery after photobleaching,
              surface  quasielectric light scattering, in-plane steady shear  viscosity by
              canal flow, in conjunction with the interfacial  static techniques of atomic
              force microscopy, x-ray photon  spectroscopy, neutron reflectivity and
              spectroscopic  elllipsometry, the PI will examine 1) polyelectrolyte  diffusion
              on functionalized glass surfaces, 2) polymer  monolayer shear viscosity and
              dilational viscoelasticity at  the air/water interface, 3) polymer diffusion as
              a function  of film thickness, and 4) polyelectrolyte diffusion on  planar
              surfaces consisting of polar heads of surfactant  molecules.  %%%  The purposes
              of the proposed research are to come up with  better materials design methods
              covering a wide range of  advanced organic materials that are used in many
              different  applications such as in artificial organs and implants, all  spill
              confinement materials, drug delivery devices, and  lubricants.  This study is
              at the molecular level.  ***
