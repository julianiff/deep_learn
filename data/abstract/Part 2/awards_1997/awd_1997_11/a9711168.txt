Abstract    :
              9711168  Sieracki    The Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences will undertake an
              instrument development   project to construct an imaging flow cytometer that
              can enumerate and classify plankton in   the size range of 3 to 1200
              micrometers and provide a new tool for biological   oceanography and coastal
              monitoring. This system will allow researchers to rapidly count,   image and
              size medium and large plankton automatically, instead of with conventional,  
              laboratory intensive methods. Commercial and laboratory flow cytometers
              available for   marine research cover the range of cell sizes from 0.3 to 100
              micrometers. This is not   sufficient since there are many microbial organisms
              in the 100 to 1000 micrometer range   present in marine and inland waters.
              Furthermore, these systems do not take images of the   measured cells, leaving
              the user with limited information.    The instrument proposed is based on a
              working prototype and employs cell   imaging, digital image processing and
              fluorescence and scattered light monitoring to   analyze marine particles in
              the size range mentioned above. The proposed system will   improve the
              sensitivity and fluorescence and scattered light triggering of the prototype  
              which has already proven the usefulness of a portable fluorescence triggered
              imaging   system. The instrument is planned for use in several studies,
              including large phytoplankton   grazing and toxicity, harmful algae monitoring,
              coastal monitoring and the distribution of   marine coccoliths.
