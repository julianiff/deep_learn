Abstract    :
              9711970  Castleman      The project is a study of electrolyte systems that
              contain halogens, nitrogen and sulfur molecules which are important to the
              atmosphere.  The main focus of the work is to study the uptake/dissolution of
              electrolytes in aqueous systems and related gas-to-particle processes via a
              molecular cluster approach.  The thermochemistry and reaction mechanisms of
              electrolyte systems will also be investigated for a smaller set of electrolyte
              systems which have high relevance to atmospheric phenomena.   The main emphasis
              will be on halogens (as the acid forms),  halogen oxyacids and salts, and on
              some related electrolyte species composed of nitrogen and sulfate compounds. 
              Two spectroscopic approaches will be employed to study the processes associated
              with electrolyte dissolution: (1) resonant electronic state energy change upon
              solvation; and (2) photodepletion.  A time-of-flight mass spectrometer system
              configured with appropriate tunable lasers will be used for the research. 
              Results from the project will provide new information on the relative
              importance of competing chemical and physical processes that occur via
              molecular aggregation.  These heterogeneous processes have potential importance
              for understanding the uptake of atmospheric molecules by polar stratospheric
              ice crystals, and for elucidating gas-to-particle conversion mechanisms that
              occur in the lower troposphere.
