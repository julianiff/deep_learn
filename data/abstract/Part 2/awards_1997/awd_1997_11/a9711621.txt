Abstract    :
              Peterson  97-11621    Studies of the Magnitude of climate changes expected
              resulting from buildup of atmospheric CO2 are predicted to affect many facets
              of the Earth's environments, although the magnitude of many of these effects is
              unknown. This study aims to integrate data bases regarding the biodiversity of
              Mexico, thematic geographic data, up-to-date information from satellite
              imagery, and simple models of global climate change into a series of
              predictions of the effects of these changes on species of birds, mammals, and
              butterflies in the region, a first assessment of the biodiversity consequences
              of global climate change. Multi-seasonal analysis of Advanced Very High
              Resolution Radiometer imagery will be used to produce a detailed region wide
              vegetation map, which will be combined with existing environmental maps and
              data bases to characterize habitat types. Simple models of the effects of
              elevated C02 and other agents of climate change will be used to mimic future
              shifts in distribution and extent of vegetation types and habitats. Geographic
              distributions of individual species will be predicted based on characteristics
              of sites of known occurrence; based on the future-shift models developed from
              climate change projections, species' future distributions will be modeled, and
              extinction's and colonization inferred. The overall result will be an
              assessment of the biodiversity consequences of anticipated climate change over
              the next several decades or centuries in Mexico, as well as the development of
              several methods and models that will be useful to other investigators
              interested in similar and related issues.
