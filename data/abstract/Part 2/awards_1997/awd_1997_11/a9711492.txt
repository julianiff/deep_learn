              ABSTRACT  ATM 97-11492  Liu , Zhengyu   U WISC    TITLE: Multi-component
              Response of the Tropical Atmosphere Vegetation System to CO2 Increase    The
              response of the global climate and biosphere to the increase of CO2 is a major
              concern for the future.  The behavior of the tropical
              atmosphere/ocean/vegetation system is of particular importance because a very
              significant fraction of the world's population lives in the tropics,  and
              changes in climate,  and in food and water resources will have important
              societal consequences.  The linkages between the long term atmosphere- ocean-
              vegetation response to CO2 increases,  and the additional impact of massive
              tropical deforestation,  require analysis of complex,  multi-component models. 
              The PIs will conduct these studies using state of the art climate model,  the
              NCAR Community Climate Model,  linked to a terrestrial vegetation model.  They
              will use a relatively new methodology,  equilibrium asynchronous coupling,  to
              help diagnose the effects of  changes in component on the other components. The
              new coupling method if tested successful will result in significant economy of
              computational time needed to run ensembles of model simulations that are
              generally needed in climate research.    This award is funded under the NSF
              Methods and Models for Integrated Assessments initiative.
