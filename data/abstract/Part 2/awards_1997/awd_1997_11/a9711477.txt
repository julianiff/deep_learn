Abstract    :
              This project will study the use of integer programming for  register allocation
              and for important compiler optimizations  that interact with register
              allocation.  The project will  build on the preceding work which shows that
              integer  programming can produce optimal or near-optimal register  allocations
              in reasonable time, providing significant  reductions in register allocation
              overhead.  The project's  first objective is to achieve order of magnitude
              speedup in  integer-programming-based register allocation by discovering  and
              implementing more efficient integer-programming  formulations.  The project's
              second objective is to extend  the scope of the integer programming formulation
              to include  other compiler optimizations that directly interact with  register
              allocation, such as common subexpression  elimination and loop-invariant code
              motion.  The extended  formulation will allow register allocation and these 
              interacting optimizations to be done simultaneously,  eliminating the
              traditional phase ordering problem.  It is  expected that the extended integer
              programming formulation  will provide significant code quality improvements,
              and that  the new optimization can be done in reasonable time.
