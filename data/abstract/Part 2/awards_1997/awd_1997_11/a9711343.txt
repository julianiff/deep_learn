Abstract    :
               This project involves the research of a cultural anthropologist from the
              University of California-San Diego.  The goal of the research is to develop
              methods for the identification and measurement of American, Mexican, and
              Japanese cultural orientations, defined as cultural models which have strong
              psychological significance for individuals.  Three different methods for the
              assessment of cultural orientations will be studied: ratings of statements,
              ratings of single terms or phrases, and intensive interviewing of s small
              sample of respondents.  Native born Americans, Mexicans and Japanese
              respondents living in southern California will be sampled.  If successful, this
              basic, methodological project will provide anthropologists and other social
              scientists with a conceptual framework and set of empirical methods by which
              persons can be assessed to determine which aspects of their cultural have
              become internalized into psychologically significant ways of understanding and
              reacting to the world.    This research is important because it will advance
              our understanding of fundamental issues of how people orient themselves to
              their reality, and how they feel about the information they deal with.
