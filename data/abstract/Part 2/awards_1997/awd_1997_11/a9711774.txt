Abstract    :
              John M Faustini  Oregon State University   The doctoral dissertation research
              will test dominant hypotheses about controls on mountain stream channel
              morphology using unique long term data sets from the H.J. Andrews LTER site. 
              The hierarchical study design involves scaling up from the channel unit scale
              by characterizing channel morphology, relating channel response to fluvial
              processes, and interpreting channel morphology and response to floods at
              cross-section sites in relation to geomorphic context.  The work will also
              evaluate geomorphic thresholds as predictors of the type and magnitude of
              channel response.  Use will be made of an existing data base of over 1400 cross
              section measurements spanning the period from 1978 to 1996.  Additional work
              will supplement this data base.  The relationship between observed
              channel/valley floor responses and indices of landscape structure and condition
              will be explored using a GIS analysis.  The results will provide an improved
              understanding of mountain stream channel dynamics which is critical in a
              theoretical sense but also for siting and design of engineered structures.
