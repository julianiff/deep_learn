              Abstract    P.I.: Humphreys  Proposal  Number:  97-11808     Institution: 
              University  of  Oregon  Title: Finite element modeling of the seismic and 
              permeability properties of partially molten upper mantle      The frequency
              dependent seismic response of partially molten  upper  mantle  rock  is to be
              determined using  viscoelastic  finite element computer simulations.  Analytic
              solutions for  the  mechanical properties of this two-phase  material  have 
              been  elusive  because of the complexity  of  the  inclusion  shapes.   The 
              finite  element meshes are  based  on  images  produced  from  analysis  of
              laboratory  produced  partially  molten  peridotites.  To investigate S-waves, 
              the  mesh  is  strained  with a step function in simple shear as a boundary 
              condition  and  time is stepped forward allowing  stress  to  decay  as  the
              melt flows and relaxes viscously.  From  this  stress   decay  function  the 
              frequency  dependent  complex  elastic   moduli  are  computed,  yielding   the
                frequency  dependent  seismic velocity and attenuation.  The method  is 
              benchmarked   by   comparing  finite  element   results   to  relatively simple
              cases with known analytic solution  (e.g.,  ellipsoids  and  triple junction
              tubule-shaped  inclusions).  Permeability  is modeled by applying a pressure
              differential  across  the  meshed  sample, and calculating  the  hydraulic 
              conductivity of the network from the bulk fluid transport.
