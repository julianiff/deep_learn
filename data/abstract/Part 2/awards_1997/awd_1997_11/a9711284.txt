Abstract    :
              9711284  Hayes    The PI's proposal to develop a high-precision hydrogen
              isotopic  GCMS represents a relatively risky project that is justified by the 
              preliminary efforts by the investigator, who is recognized as one  of the
              leading experts in the development of GCMS instrumentation,  and the potential
              applications of the instrument in biogeochemical  research.  The panel believes
              such an instrument would quickly  become an important tool in numerous studies.
               In summary, the  panel concludes that funding this effort represents a
              moderate  risk/high benefit investment.
