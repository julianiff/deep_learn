Abstract    :
              This project investigates the interaction between text compression and text
              retrieval, and aims to build a parallel text retrieval system called Codir that
              allows compression-domain text indexing and retrieval. Ultimately, Codir is
              expected to be able to efficiently respond to queries consisting of one or
              multiple "keywords" connected via Boolean operators, with documents in the text
              database that either contain those keywords, or whose "theme" matches the
              keywords. The most important feature of Codir is the flexibility it provides to
              allow space/time tradeoff and the use of this flexibility in the Dynamic Index
              Cache. The two target applications areas to which the technologies developed in
              Codir are to be applied to are Web Page Searching and Video Access using
              Captioning. The expected contributions of this project to the text retrieval
              field are: (1) the performance tradeoffs of integrating text compression and
              text retrieval in a unified framework; (2) the detailed characterization of the
              access patterns and query statistics of a production-mode use of Codir; (3) the
              development of new techniques to support approximate keyword search and
              frequent in-place updates to the text database; (4) the incorporation of
              advanced text classification techniques such as term weighting and theme
              indexing into the implementation framework of Codir. The technologies developed
              from this project are expected to be useful to designers of corporate
              information repository, internet search engines, and large-scale text-based Web
              servers.
