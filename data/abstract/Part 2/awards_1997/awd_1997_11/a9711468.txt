Abstract    :
              This Professional Development Fellowship will allow a research who has worked on
              philosophical and theoretical issues in the cognitive and brain sciences to
              visit, study, and participate in the laboratory activities of two major,
              interrelated neuroscience laboratories at the National Institutes of Health. 
              In the course of  the fellowship the PI will pursue two specific philosophical
              studies of neuroscience research.  The first study concerns interlevel
              constraints in interdisciplinary cognitive science, examining how different
              disciplines studying the brain tend to inform, shape, and constrain each other.
               Among the constraints considered will be logical, mathematical and other
              technical constraints on theories and models, as well as informal ways that
              research perspectives, techniques, methods, results and models at one level of
              inquiry tend to suggest limitations or openings at another.  The second study
              examines how multiple, related, ongoing projects of a laboratory tend to
              reinforce each other and their results, both through replication in the
              narrowest sense and through replication and extrapolation more broadly
              understood.  Beyond these specific projects, the fellowship year will allow the
              PI to improve his understanding of the substance and practice of neuroscience,
              thus better informing his philosophical work, and, in exchange, to lend the
              ideas and perspectives of philosophy to the scientific investigations of the
              laboratories.
