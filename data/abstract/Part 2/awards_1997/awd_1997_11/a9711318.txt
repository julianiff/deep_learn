Abstract    :
                                    Scranton  OCE-9711318                                     
                                        ABSTRACT    In  this  continuation  of  her ongoing
              research,  the  principal  investigator will study how organic carbon is
              remineralized under  anaerobic conditions in the water column of the Cariaco
              Basin  of  Venezuela.   Because  the  transition from  fully  oxygenated  to 
              completely  sulfidic  water occurs over considerable  depth,  she  will  be 
              able to study details of anaerobic carbon cycling  that  would  be  difficult 
              in the great majority of  other  accessible  marine  systems.  This project is
              a component of Project CARIACO,  a  larger,  multi-investigator time-series
              study of  the  Cariaco  Basin.
