Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9711282  Arens      This award provides funding to support the
              operation of a new NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for the
              Built Environment (CBE) at the University of California, Berkeley.  The Center
              will dedicated to the industries and professions that design and construct
              buildings, manufacture building components, and operate and maintain buildings.
               Its objective will be to improve the performance of buildings by enhancing
              their indoor environmental quality, and by improving the energy efficiency with
              which that quality is produced.  "Quality is being broadly defined as any
              characteristic of the building affecting the comfort, health, or productivity
              of its occupants.  There are great opportunities to improve the performance of
              US buildings through applied research and development.    Additional funding is
              provided in this award by the General Services Administration (GSA) to augment
              the ongoing research program and to obtain a membership in the Center.
