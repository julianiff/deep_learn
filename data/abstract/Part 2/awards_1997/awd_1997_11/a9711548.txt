Abstract    :
              The media, many businesses, and many academicians are proclaiming  the
              information highway and the web as providing universal access  to  information
              and as providing the infrastructure  in  which  a  Oglobal villageO and
              Ovirtual organizationsO will emerge.  Within  this infrastructure, individuals
              are assumed to be able to freely  interact  and  have their ideas compete in an
              open market.   This  assumption,  however, neglects the fact that  people 
              continually  form  groups  and  that groups develop norms and procedures  that 
              restrict  the  flow of information and prevent non-group  members  from  having
               the  same benefits as group members.   IndividualsO  communication behavior is
              significantly affected by  groups  that  emerge  in  on-line communities.  This
              proposal is to investigate  the  evolution of electronic groups and to
              ascertain the  factors  affecting  group  formation and maintenance on  this 
              information  highway.  One of the outcomes of this work will be an empirically 
              validated   model   of   electronic   group   development.     By 
              investigating  the development of naturally occurring  electronic  groups, this
              work is expected to contribute to the study of group  dynamics  and 
              investigations  of  the  impact  and  use  of  new  telecommunication
              technologies.
