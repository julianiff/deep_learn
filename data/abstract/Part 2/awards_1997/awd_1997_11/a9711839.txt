Abstract    :
              This project will investigate issues associated with performing distributed
              parallel computations on clusters of workstations connected  locally by ATM
              (asynchronous transfer mode) switches, and local super-clusters globally
              connected WAN.  This study will be performed in the context of a critical
              application area of concern and interest to both the United States and Mexico,
              that of subsurface transport of chemical species occurring in the border region
              between Mexico and the United States. This proposal has three goals: (1) the
              proposed will bring together the resources and expertise of SwRI and ITESM to
              investigate critical elements necessary for the creation of a regional
              meta-computer ultimately providing an analysis and diagnostic tool to support a
              regional water which combines the resources of SwRI and ITESM into a useful
              computational facility, (2) investigate the effectiveness of different
              programming models (PVM, MPI, HPF, Fortran M, HPC++) applied over a WAN-based
              meta-computer in the context of a real world application code, and (3)
              demonstrate the utility of the meta-computer through application of the
              enhanced MULTIFLO code to the simulation of the border region, subsurface
              environment.  This research will compliment programs already on-going at both
              SwRI and ITESM in distributed parallel computing, network technology, and
              subsurface transport.  Through this effort, the computational resources of SwRI
              and ITESM will be linked through high-speed WAN technology and methods
              developed for the efficient use of such a meta-computer.
