Abstract    :
                This study proposes to develop a biophysical index of the status of the
              eastern Bering Sea in winter and spring which incorporates characteristics of
              the seasonal ice and migratory bird behavior.  NSCAT (NASA scatterometer from
              satellite) data will be verified with all available satellite, ship, and land
              station data for October 1996 to May 1997.  Digital analysis of same-day NSCAT
              images with AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) images will be
              made in a GIS system.  The NSCAT data will either verifgy the usefulness of the
              AVHRR imagery and add to the detail of ice growth, melt and retreat, or provide
              a different source of research data to evaluate the conditions of sea ice. 
              Detailed maps of the sea ice edge dynamics in spring will assist in studies
              aimed at understanding fisheries recruitment processes on the shelf currently
              being funded by other agencies.  Waterbird distributions evaluated during a
              period encompassing fall and spring migration will be incorporated into the GIS
              models.  Because these opportunities are time sensitive and because the
              approach is innovative and exploratory, the PIs have chosen to submit a
              proposal of limited scope under the guidelines of the Small Grants for
              Exploratory Research (SGER) program.
