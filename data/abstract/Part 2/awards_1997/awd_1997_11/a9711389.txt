              Affiliation:               State University of New York at Buffalo      This
              grant is awarded through the Separations and Purification Program sub-element
              of the Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of the Chemical and
              Transport Systems Division. The principal investigator is Dr. Eli Ruckenstein
              of the State University of New York at Buffalo. The objective of the research
              is to develop affinity membranes of controlled porosity using chitin and
              chitosan, which are biocompatible materials. The approach followed to generate
              porosity takes advantage of the fact that the polymer and a porogen have widely
              different solubility characteristics as a function of solution pH. The
              solubility difference is used to first cast the membrane at acid pH values and
              then remove the porogen at basic pH values.  After forming the membrane, the
              objectives of the research are to characterize the application potential of the
              membranes, particularly to affinity separations.            The research could
              lead to the preparation of inexpensive, biocompatible chitin/chitosan membranes
              have a variety of applications for in vivo therapies, tissue culture, wound
              healing, and affinity separations.
