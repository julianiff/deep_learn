Abstract    :
                9711015  Collins  The seismic Design provisions of most building codes 
              existing account for the uncertainty in the ground motion by  defining a single
              "design" earthquake based on probability  of exceedance or return period.  A
              more rational approach to  structural design would be to establish performance
              criteria  for the structure corresponding to two (or more) levels of 
              earthquake excitation, express these criteria in  probabilistic terms, develop
              deterministic design-checking  equations based on the probabilistic criteria,
              and design  the structure using the deterministic design-checking  equations.  
               The objective of this research project is to further develop  and refine the
              performance-based design procedure so that it  will be applicable to more
              complex building configurations.  To this end, analytical studies will be
              performed to  investigate several issues including (1) investigating  alternate
              choices of the lateral force distribution used in  the static push-over
              analyses, (2) developing simple  techniques to account for torsional effects
              and three-  dimensional effects while preserving the probabilistic bases  of
              the deterministic design equations, (3) accounting for  the effects of
              nonstructural components on overall building  performance, and (4) considering
              alternate measures of  structural response to be used in formulating
              performance  criteria.  Although no experiments are planned, existing 
              experimental data will be used to supplement the analytical  results obtained
              during this investigation whenever  possible.
