Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT  EEC-9711581  Akansu      The analog technology of television is
              in the process of changing to the recently approved FCC High Definition
              Television Standard which is digital.  Although digital video is mature enough
              to generate and deliver digital video,  a lot of research is necessary to
              enhance and broaden the current capability.    This award provides funding for
              a planning meeting at the New Jersey Institute of Technology to determine if
              there is sufficient industrial support to establish an Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Digital Video.  In a recent award to
              Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute it was noted that the envisioned research
              interests of industry would require the involvement of other university
              researchers.    This award provides funding for an additional planning meeting
              to determine if there is sufficient industrial interest to establish a
              multi-university I/UCRC for Digital Video and Media utilizing the resources of
              Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute, New Jersey Institute of Technology, and
              Princeton University.
