Abstract    :
              9711213  Barro    Under their previous NSF grant the investigators assembled and
              placed on the internet an international data set that includes a large number
              of economic, political, and social variables useful for analyzing the
              determination of economic growth.   This project concentrates on improving
              measures of the quality and quality of school attainment for a broad cross
              section of countries.  This information, which includes student performance on
              internationally comparable examinations, will be incorporated into an updated
              version of the data  on the determinants of economic growth.  A long-term panel
              will also be assembled that includes indicators of democracy and other aspects
              of political structure.  This information will be merged with measures of
              economic performance, schooling, and other variables and used to assess the
              determinants of political structure, including the extent of democracy.
