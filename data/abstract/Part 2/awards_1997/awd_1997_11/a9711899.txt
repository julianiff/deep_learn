Abstract    :
               9711899 Papadimitrakopoulos  A symposium, co-supported by the
              Electronic/Photonic Materials and Solid State Chemistry programs, will be held
              April 13-15, 1997 on Organic Materials and Devices for Display Technology
              covering the synthesis, processing, and characterization of organic, polymeric,
              and liquid crystalline materials. The symposium is being held to focus on
              recent progress in a research area rapidly evolving toward achievement of
              better understanding and practical device realization.  Organic photonic
              materials have significant projected advantages in reduced cost and large area
              display capability,  for a variety of communication and display device
              applications.  NSF funds will be used to support participation by graduate
              students and young faculty.  There will be an opportunity to assess the field,
              and to establish ties between universities, research institutions, and
              industry.  It is expected that top scientists in the field will attend, and
              that the symposium will provide an effective forum to discuss and delineate
              critical scientific issues in this rapidly developing research area. %%%  An
              evaluation of the progress and status of Organic Materials and Devices for
              Displays and related materials processing and characterization issues,
              especially critical materials research areas of materials processing, and the
              relationship of materials research to device fabrication along with current
              assessments of the most important developments in this field will be of great
              value to the understanding and enhanced utilization of organic and polymeric
              materials in the field of electronics and photonics.    ***
