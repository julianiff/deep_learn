Abstract    :
              9711969  Tolbert     In this project, laboratory studies of particle formation
              and heterogeneous chemical reactions under conditions relevant for the upper
              troposphere/lower stratosphere will be performed. The composition, formation
              mechanism and abundance of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) remain uncertain,
              and the role of heterogeneous chemistry in the upper troposphere has not been
              established.    To probe particle formation, several types of experiments will
              be performed. First FTIR reflection absorption spectroscopy (RAS) will be used
              to make fundamental measurements of homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation
              parameters for atmospheric materials. Diffusion activation energies and contact
              parameters will be determined to provide the necessary input for nucleation
              theory. Other laboratory experiments will probe the formation mechanisms of
              PSCs, in particular, type Ia PSCs, whose exact composition is still unknown.  
              In addition, laboratory studies of heterogeneous chemical reactions of
              potential importance in the upper troposphere will be performed. The most
              abundant types of particles there are thought to be cirrus, subvisible cirrus,
              and sulfate aerosols. A Knudsen cell flow reactor coupled with FTIR RAS to
              probe the condensed phase will be used. Oxidation/reduction reactions that may
              occur between oxygenated organics and nitric acid condensed on cirrus particles
              will be studied, and experiments on the reactivity of deliquesced and
              crystalline sulfate salts will be performed.
