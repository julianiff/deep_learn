Abstract    :
              In wireless systems, performing IF filtering/demodulation digitally has many 
              advantages.  The software radio environment makes it possible to implement 
              diverse wireless standards on a single hardware platform.  Since non-linear 
              quantization causes interchannel mixing, this application demands a premium ADC
               performance in spurious-free dynamic range of at least 80 to 90dB.  This
              highly-  linear data conversion at IF requires ADC performance typically of 14
              bits at  above 50MSample/s.  Although remarkable progresses have been reported,
              it is  unlikely to achieve this high sampling rate with 14 bits using any known
              CMOS  architectures.    This research challenges the current ADC arts with two
              unique methods.  Multi-  step ADCs are very linear but limited by the speed of
              the interstage residue  amplifier.  On the other hand, folding ADCs are fast
              but limited by folding  amplifier offsets and their complexity to achieve more
              than 10 bits.  This  research presents two unique solutions.  One is to use a
              trans-resistance  amplifier for fast residue amplification, and the other is to
              use a subranging  concept to cascade folding stages.  Linearities in both cases
              are calibrated in  background using an oversampling delta-sigma calibrator. 
              This work is the first  one that ever attempts to calibrate the folding ADC.
