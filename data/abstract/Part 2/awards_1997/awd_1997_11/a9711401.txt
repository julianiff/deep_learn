Abstract    :
              This  project  plans  and executes a  workshop  that  brings  together 
              representatives of the diverse research  community  funded by the Information
              Technology and Organizations (ITO)  Program.  This workshop will be a forum to
              allow researchers  in   this   area   to   meet,  mix,  learn   about   others'
               contributions,   to   potentially   form    more    fruitful 
              interdisciplinary research alliances, and to articulate  the  significant 
              research  and programmatic  issues  facing  ITO  today and in the future. One
              outcome of the workshop will be  collection  of  short  project  descriptions 
              suitable   for  display on the World Wide Web. Another workshop product will 
              be  a  report  that  weaves together  the  diverse  research  threads supported
              by ITO, showing their common concerns  and  their  special distinctions. This
              report will  also  discuss  historical, current, and potential future
              directions of  ITO  research.
