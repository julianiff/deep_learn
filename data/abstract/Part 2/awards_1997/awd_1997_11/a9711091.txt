Abstract    :
                This is a one year project to generate software and a pilot infrastructure for
              measuring Internet performance.  The project could lead to positioning probe
              machines throughout the Internet to collect data to assist in identifying
              current and long-term performance characteristics of portions of the Internet
              and the overall system.  The project is patterned after Network Probe Daemon
              (NPD), a prototype by one of the co-PIs which instrumented 37 Internet sites to
              perform the first large-scale measurements of end-to-end Internet behavior
              regarding routing and connection dynamics.  This project also will establish
              the framework for producing a national Internet profile to record the network's
              performance over time.
