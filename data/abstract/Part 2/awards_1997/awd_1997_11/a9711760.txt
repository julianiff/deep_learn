Abstract    :
              Debra R Ohman  University of Washington   The doctoral dissertation research
              will examine the origins and character of non-metropolitan economic and
              population change in parts of the Pacific Northwest during the 1990s.  The
              project will seek to obtain a deeper understanding of major forces in the
              change process and relies on theory regarding the restructuring process,
              consumption, ideology and identity, and the social construction of nature and
              place.  The methodology consists of three phases: cross-sectional analysis,
              mail surveys and case studies with interviews.  The research will contribute to
              a better understanding of the shape of restructuring and how social and
              economic restructuring are connected to a change from productive to consumptive
              uses of the landscape and different social constructions of nature and rural.
