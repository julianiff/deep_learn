Abstract    :
              ***  Lehmann  9711674  This project will increase understanding of post-Soviet
              Russian society among U.S. social scientists who are not Russian area
              specialists by making available on the World Wide Web several sets of survey
              data.   The recent, powerful transformations in Eastern Europe offer social
              science an unprecedented opportunity for comparative and dynamic studies.  Yet
              such opportunities have been limited to those with the language skills and
              contacts to gather primary data in those societies.  By putting several
              valuable data sets online, the PI will make such specialized data accessible to
              a wider range of social scientists.  Among the data sets to be placed on line
              are election studies in 1993, 1995, and 1996 (2 rounds), plus surveys of the
              values of young adults and of high school students.   ***
