Abstract    :
              9711912  Pirmez    Meandering channels of large submarine fans have a planiform 
              expression that is similar to subaerial meanders but cross-  sectional shape
              differs.  Levees are more prominent and  asymetrical in the submarine channels.
               Pis will delineate  the connection between channelized sediment-driven flows
              on  the submarine fans and the evolution of submarine channel  meandering. 
              They will also develop a numerical model for  the submarine meanders, where
              their vast experience in  subaerial meanders, channels and floodplains will be
              very  useful.  The study will lead to a better understanding of  these little
              known morphological features offshore major  river systems.
