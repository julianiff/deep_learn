Abstract    :
              The  area  of  automatic  indexing is  to  be  explored  via  automatic  content
              abstraction from a semantic  perspective.  Robust  language processing
              techniques are used to  generate  multipurpose  data  structures called lexical
               webs.   These  are, in turn, used in an automated semantic indexing program 
              designed  to parse, index, and hyperlink on-line texts.  The  research 
              involves three major areas: data structure  design  for  implementation of
              lexical webs; design of  lexical  web  acquisition  tools that utilize
              linguistic  and  statistical  heuristics  for developing robust finite-state
              grammars  for  chunking  of  significant phrase-level  and  discourse-level 
              constituents; and design of document annotation  tools  that  annotate  a  text
              with lexical webs by creating  appropriate  hyperlinks. The creation of lexical
              webs can accelerate  the  availability of information in a highly indexed  and 
              cross-  indexed   format,   facilitating   navigation   and    rapid 
              information access.
