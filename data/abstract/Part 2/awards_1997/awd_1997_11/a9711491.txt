              ABSTRACT  ATM -9711491  Aizen, Vladimir B.  University of California, Santa
              Barbara    TITLE: Simulation of  Snow and Glacier Runoff in Central Asia Alpine
              Watersheds.    The objective of this research is to carry out improvements in
              physical regional modeling of snow/glacier melt runoff in the Central Asian
              river basins of Tien Shan and to analyze the long term water balance dynamics
              in this region.  This involves important hydrological data set development over
              the region to calibrate and then to validate the model developed. Based on such
              a model development  long term changes in river runoff over this region will
              also be analyzed.  Successful completion of this project will help analyze
              water balance dynamics over mountainous snow/glacier fed river basins.
