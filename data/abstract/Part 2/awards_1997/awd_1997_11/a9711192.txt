Abstract    :
                    9711192  May  A central component of efforts to address losses posed by 
              earthquakes is the incorporation of mitigation measures into  decisions about
              land use, building practices, and risk bearing.   Considerable research has
              been undertaken about prospective  measures and the factors that shape decision
              making by the  affected groups.  But, despite this growing body of research, 
              there is a rather unsatisfying understanding of the prospects for  mitigation. 
              This is an exploratory, case-study investigation of  exemplars of programs that
              are useful analogs to earthquake  mitigation and have been successful in
              bringing about change in  risk termite inspection, and radon detection. 
              Interviews will be  conducted with representatives of each of these groups
              within  state (or local) programs that are identified as part of the  research
              as being exemplars.  In addition, library research and  document collection
              will be undertaken.  The purpose of the study  of the exemplars is to draw
              insights concerning research about  and the institutional design of federal
              earthquake-hazard  mitigation programs.  ***
