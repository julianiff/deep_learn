Abstract    :
              9711151  Christensen  This is an award to support conduct of a workshop to 
              consider environmental problems that are characteristic of  urban coastal
              waters of the United States.  Co-Chairman of  the workshop will be Dr. Charles
              R. O'Melia, Department of  Geography and Environmental Engineering, The Johns
              Hopkins  University.  A resource document to be used for addressing  this topic
              will be Managing Wastewater in Coastal Urban  Areas, a report of the National
              Research Council's Water  Science and Technology Board.  Topics to be addressed
               include research needs associated with approaches to  determine the nature and
              scope of the environmental problems  resulting from the presence of
              contaminated sediments,  prevention of future accumulations of contaminants and
               appropriate conditions and approaches for their  decontamination.    While
              point-sources of water pollution are generally readily  identifiable, non-point
              sources such as those attributable  to runoff from developed and undeveloped
              land as well as  deposition from the atmosphere are not.  The product of this 
              conference is expected to be a report that can be used in  planning operation
              of the Environmental Systems research  program as it addresses problems of
              special significance to  coastal communities.  Results of this research are
              expected  to lead to improved models that can be utilized in  engineering
              design of systems to prevent pollution,  facilities for pollution control
              facilities and  decontamination of polluted aquatic resources.  ***
