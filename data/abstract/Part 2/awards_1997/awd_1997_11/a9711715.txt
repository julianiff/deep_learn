Abstract    :
                       This is a seismic study of the southern flank of  Kilauea volcano,
              Hawaii, that will constrain the kinematics  and mechanics of landsliding along
              the slopes of young  submarine volcanoes.  Multichannel seismic data will be 
              collected using the R/V Ewing's 20-air gun array and 3-km  streamer. Lines will
              be run along, and across, the south  flank of Kilauea and the southeast edge of
              the Puna rift.  It is expected that the offshore seismic shots will also be 
              recorded by land seismometers maintained by the USGS Hawaii  Volcano
              Observatory.
