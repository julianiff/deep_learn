Abstract    :
              Popp (OCE-9711197)                              ABSTRACT                        
                                                       Popp                            
              OCE-9711197                                              Current research
              activities by the PI and his  colleagues at the University of Hawaii require
              the measurement of  precise isotopic ratios of C and N in marine samples.  The 
              proposed purchase of an automated C-N isotopic analysis system  would greatly
              enhance the throughput and sensitivity for making  these measurements over what
              is currently available.  The PI and  his colleagues are experts in the use of
              such instrumentation and  have a proven track record of research
              accomplishments in this  area.  Thus the proposed l improvements would lead to
              a  strengthening of current research activities and lead to  enhancements in
              current graduate and post-doctoral education  programs and facilitate new
              research projects not possible  without modernization of the current facility
              at the University  of Hawaii.  In addition to the $40K of NSF support, $55K in
              total  funds have been approved by the University using an existing ONR 
              building fund to support this equipment purchase, thus  significantly
              increasing total funds to this project.
