Abstract    :
              9711165  Monismith    This project is for a laboratory study of wave breaking
              and  the turbulence it induces.  A  full-field velocity measuring technique
              (Digital Particle  Tracking Velocimetry) will be used  to obtain
              two-dimensional velocity fields, from which  vorticity, turbulent statistics
              and  dissipation can be calculated as functions of time.  The  study will
              improve our  understanding of the dominant mixing process in the upper  ocean,
              and the data could also  be used to include breaking in Large Eddy Simulations
              of the  upper ocean.
