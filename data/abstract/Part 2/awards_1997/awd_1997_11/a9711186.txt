Abstract    :
              9711186  Ozgokman    This project is to conduct a numerical study of the Gulf 
              Stream separation.  The objective is to explore the joint  dynamics of the
              separation mechanisms and to investigate how  the stability of the Gulf Stream
              separation is achieved.  This will be done by progressively incorporating
              different  mechanisms and analyzing their cumulative impact on the Gulf  Stream
              separation.
