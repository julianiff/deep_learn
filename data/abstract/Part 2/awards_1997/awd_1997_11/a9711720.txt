Abstract    :
                              During the course of the proposed study, analysis of  the
              recorded vent fluid temperature data, and correlation of  these  data  with 
              the  findings and  observations  made  by  biological  and geochemical
              colleagues will allow evaluation  of  the  following questions:  (1) How have
              temperatures  at  high-temperature  and  low-temperature  vents  in  the  Bio- 
              Transect  area of the East Pacific Rise continued to  change  since  the 1991
              eruption; (2) What are the long-term (months  to years) and short-term (hours
              to days to weeks) variations  in  fluid  temperature and how do they  correlate
               spatially  along   the   Bio-Transect.   Is  there   coupling   between 
              temperature  changes in high-temperature or  low-temperature  vent  fluids? 
              Are sections of the Bio-Transect consistently  hotter than others?  What are
              the correlations to variations  in  fissuring  and lava morphology along the
              ASC?  (3)  What  geological  changes  (e.g. collapse of lava  flow  surfaces, 
              microseismicity,  dike  intrusion and  lava  eruption)  have  occurred which
              reflect the thermal state of the axial summit  caldera.    (4)  How  has  the 
              composition  (e.g.   species  diversity)  and  character  (e.g.,  growth, 
              health,   areal  coverage)  of  the biological communities at  the  different 
              instrumented sites changed, and how do they correlate to the  variations in
              vent fluid temperature measured by the probes.  (5) Do tidal cycles provide a
              major influence on the thermal  behavior   of   the  vents,  or  do  they 
              simply   modulate  temperature at the seafloor by moving packets of warm  water
               around in such a way as to influence biological processes at  a local,
              community-scale.
