Abstract    :
              ECS-9711590  Bose    Robustness property is crucial in the performance
              evaluation spatio-temporal systems used to process analog video signals,
              multidimensional transform-based coding and in multidimensional filtering for
              picture quality improvement.  This project will promote collaboration between
              the scientists in Mexico who are developing constructive methods for the robust
              stability analysis of nonaffine families of multivariate polynomials and their
              counterparts in U.S.A. who will be involved in, first, obtaining
              generalizations to the multidimensional case of their deterministic and
              probabilistic approaches to, respectively, the robust wavenumber response and
              worst-case robust stability analysis problems and, second, the application of
              these results in image filtering based on classical as well as neurocomputing.
