Abstract    :
              The  goal  is  to  develop  a  computer  system  to  support  geographically
              separated researchers performing  cooperative  experimental research in
              robotics. This system  uses  vision  techniques under the control of smart
              planners to acquire  a  visual  model (combining 3-D data and texture maps)  of
               the  physical  environment where the experiment takes  place.  It  provides
              real-time graphic renderings of the experiments  on  the  researchers'  graphic
              workstations  along  individually  selected  viewpoints.  Hence, each 
              researcher  is  able  to  OBSERVE  the  experiments  using  his/her  own 
              controllable  virtual camera.  The initial exploration will focus  on  one 
              major  component  of  the envisioned system,  the  automatic  construction of a
              3-D model of an experimental robotic site.  This will be used to analyze basic
              issues that will also  be  encountered  in  the  other  components  of  the 
              envisioned  system,  in  particular  the effect of  uncertainty  on  the 
              interaction  between a user and a remote experimental  site.  This  is  a 
              collaborative effort between R. Bajcsy  of  the  GRASP laboratory at the
              University of Pennsylvania and J. C.  Latombe at Stanford University.
