                                                       Keil                            
              OCE-9711792                                              Geochemists have long
              recognized the potential  importance of mineral surfaces in protecting and
              preserving  marine organic matter (OM) in aquatic sediments.  This proposal 
              seeks to further out understanding of OM preservation by  evaluating in more
              detail the organic mineral to mineral surface  area ratio (OM:SA) which has
              recently been shown by this PI and  others to be useful for evaluating OM
              preservation in marine  sediments.  The proposed measurements are aimed at
              answering  fundamental questions in marine geochemistry about the factors  and
              processes that form and mold the OM:SA relationship.  A wide  range of
              approaches will be used to evaluate marine sediments,  including:  a
              combination of probing techniques (X-ray  photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV
              photooxidation, density  fractionation); adsorbing extracted organic matter to
              know  mineral phases; and, conducting microbial degradation  experiments.  The
              PI will conduct these experiments on samples  collected from contrasting redox
              environments and OM:SA settings.  The proposed studies build on successful
              experiments previously  conducted by the PI and should lead to a significant
              advancement  in our understanding of OM preservation in ocean sediments.
