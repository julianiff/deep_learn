                        A  major  area of interest in marine sciences is the distribution 
              and  preservation of organic matter in marine sediments.  The  PI  has  been  a
               key  contributor to studies in this  area,  and  he  proposes to continue his
              research on the forms, distributions and  preservation of organic matter in
              marine sediments.  A major  aim  of  this  proposal is to identify shifts in
              the major biochemical  compositions of sedimentary organic mixtures subjected
              to varying  extents  of  degradation.   New analytical  techniques  would  be 
              brought  to  bear  on existing sediment samples  which  would  be  selectively 
              extracted for organic carbon.  Thus in  addition  to  bulk  characterizations,
              analyses by 13C NMR would  be  added  to  provide  more detailed organic
              compositional data.  Results  from  this  study  would  be  expected to unravel
              the  two  fundamental  issues in the preservation of organic matter in marine
              sediments,  namely  1) how oxygen-sensitivity relates to protective  sorption 
              of  organic  matter  in sediments and 2) to what  extent  oxygen-  sensitive  
              organic  matter  might  be  directly   derived   from  hydrolysis-resistant
              biomacromolecues.
