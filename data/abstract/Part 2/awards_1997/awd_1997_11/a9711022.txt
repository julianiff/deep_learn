Abstract    :
              Morrison Institute of Technology will use this grant to connect  to the
              Internet.  They have proposed to use CICNet as their  Internet service
              provider.  The students and faculty of Morrison  Institute of Technology need
              the Internet connections to be able  to access information resources throughout
              the state, the nation  and the world.  The connection will benefit the faculty,
              staff  students of this institution as well as the community in general.  The
              award provides partial support of the project for two years.
