              clearly  shows that shear walls offer excellent protection to buildings in 
              seismic regions.  This project is to develop a rational approach  to
              understanding and predicting the behavior of low-rise shear  walls and framed
              shear walls under cyclic loading.    The overall concept behind this approach
              is that the complicated  behavior of shear walls as a whole system, can be
              elucidated by  integrating what can be learned, experimentally, about its parts
               and components, visualized as being an assembly of membrane  elements
              (panels).  The stress-strain behavior of individual  membrane elements will be
              studied to establish physical and  analytical models.  The resulting models
              will then be integrated  into a finite element program to compute and predict
              the load-  deformation behavior of whole shear walls under specified 
              conditions.    A unique universal panel tester was constructed at the
              University  of Houston in 1988 which is especially suited for the intended 
              testing.  A test program of 25 wall panels subjected to cyclic  loading will be
              carried out.    The results from the cyclic tests on membrane elements will be 
              used to establish the cyclic constitutive laws of concrete.   Concrete behavior
              such as stiffness deterioration, strength  deterioration, and "pinching" of
              hysteretic loops will be  determined and then used to calibrate their
              corresponding  parameters in an analytical model established by El-Borgi.  The 
              calibrated hysteretic models will then enable a nonlinear finite  element
              computer program be formulated, which can be used to  predict the behavior of
              whole shear walls.    The University of Houston in the United States and the 
              Polytechnic School of Tunisia in Tunisia will jointly carry out  this research.
