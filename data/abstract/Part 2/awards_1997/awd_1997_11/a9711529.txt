Abstract    :
                This project will long term study that has focused on ecological disturbances,
              causes, and the responses of eastern Pacific reef coral populations and reef
              communities during and following the severe and historically unprecedented 1982
              1983 El Nino / Southrn Oscillation (ENSO) event. This study involves strong
              international collaboration with host country research teams working at several
              field sites in Costa Rica, Panama, and the Galapagos Islands (Ecuador), all
              areas that were severely affected during the 1982 1983 ENSO disturbance. This
              study will continue with (a) monitoring the physical and biological conditions
              of eastern Pacific coral reefs initiated in the early to mid 1970s, (b)
              investigating the responses of different coral species to ENSO stressors
              (chiefly positive sea temperature anomalies) under controlled microcosm
              conditions, (c) studying coral reproductive ecology as it relates to
              recruitment success in field surveys, and (d) documenting coral community
              recovery or changes leading to alternate, non reef building communities. New
              research directions initiated in 1994 will be pursued, namely (e) an attempt to
              link coral bleaching/mortality with local and global scale sea surface
              temperature (SST) anomalies, and (f) modeling the size structure of coral
              populations and coral community dynamics based on mechanistic relationships
              between temperature, predation, coral growth, and survivorship derived from
              field monitoring and experimental results. In addition, (g) analyses of the
              molecular genetic structure of the different zooxanthella taxa found in eastern
              Pacific corals to assess the importance of zooxanthellae diversity in
              explaining the variability in patterns of coral bleaching, and (h) recovering
              coral populations, to assess their genetic structure and diversity in relation
              to population size and distance from source populations, will be investigated.
