Abstract    :
              9711454  Walker  This proposal is to continue characterization of the Os
              isotopic composition of various mantle domains through time, via the analysis
              of ultramafic rocks that are otherwise geochemically and isotopically
              well-characterized, and that have relatively high Os concentrations and low
              Re/Os ratios.  Specific issues that Re-Os isotopes may be particularly useful
              in elucidating are: (1) nature of material added to the Earth via late
              accretion, (2) the rate at which late accreted materials were homogenized
              throughout the mantle, (3) the nature and rate at which oceanic crust has been
              recycled back into certain plum sources, (4) the existence of, and level of
              chemical exchange between the mantle and outer core, )5) the chronology of
              development of subcontinental lithospheric keels, and (6) the distribution of
              highly siderophile elements in various modern and ancient reservoirs.  The PI
              will analyze ultramafic magmatic systems that represent upper oceanic
              lithospheric materials (Archean through recent ophiolites) and materials
              derived from likely mantle plumes (Archean and Proterozoic komatiites and
              ferropicrites). Both whole rock and mineral separates will be analyzed from
              each location.
