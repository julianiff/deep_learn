Abstract    :
              9711722  Grunow    Abstract  This award supports an exploratory program to
              measure the  anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) on existing samples 
              of the Ferrar intrusive rocks to provide preliminary magma flow  directions. 
              The AMS method represents one of the few techniques  available capable of
              determining magma flow directions and hence,  constrain magma emplacement
              models.  The Ferrar province (>4000km  long), along with the Karoo province in
              South Africa, represents  the most significant flood basalt province associated
              with  Gondwana break-up.  Various models have been proposed in which  the
              Ferrar magmas are thought to have emanated from a point  source beneath South
              Africa, beneath the Dufek massif, or from  multiple point sources.  The AMS
              method provides a direct test of  these models.  Very little AMS work has been
              done on the Ferrar  province and so it is uncertain whether the Ferrar rocks
              will  yield any magma dlow information.  Ferrar samples (75 cores) from  a 3000
              km segment of this province are presently available and  more will be collected
              in the upcoming field season and made  available to this project.  These
              samples will be analyzed at the  University of Michigan paleomagnetism
              laboratory.  Results will  demonstrate the viability of the method on Ferrar
              province rocks  and may also provide preliminary constraints on Ferrar plume 
              versus multiple source emplacement models.
