Abstract    :
              Project FOCAL Point is a multi-strand project encompassing  models that have
              been shown to be effective in encouraging  girls and young women in
              non-traditional fields.  Twenty  high school computing teachers from Wisconsin
              and  surrounding areas will gather at the University of Wisconsin  - Stevens
              Point for a two-week summer workshop in which they  will receive training in
              gender issues, electronic  communication, and information systems concepts. 
              They will  develop female-friendly lessons to  be piloted with high  schools
              students in a following two-week summer computer  camp targeted for young
              women.  University women serve as  mentors to the high school students during
              the summer  session, as well as teaching assistants.  Gender related 
              technology projects, funded through sub-contracts to teacher  participants,
              extend the impact of the project beyond the  immediate participants.  All
              project participants are  electronically connected to a "virtual community of 
              learners."
