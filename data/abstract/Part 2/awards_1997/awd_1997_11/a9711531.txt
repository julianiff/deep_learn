Abstract    :
              This project aims to analyze imperative, object-oriented  programs for  type
              signature information, which can help  automate several programming  tasks that
              are currently  performed manually. Type signatures summarize the  behavior of a
              program's methods, functions, or procedures;  while such information has been
              used to advantage in the  functional programming language community, little has
              been  done to investigate how popular, object-oriented languages  could benefit
              from use of type signatures. The research will  improve the quality and
              efficiency of software navigation  and reuse; software testing and
              demonstration;  and  construction of graphical and non-graphical user
              interfaces.  Novel aspects include use of data flow analysis to refine  and
              improve the precision of type signatures extracted from  imperative languages
              and analysis of method call-sequences  that accomplish or approximate a given
              type signature.
