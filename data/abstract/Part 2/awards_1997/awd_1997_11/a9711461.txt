Abstract    :
                  In the fall of 1996 a subglacial  eruption beneath the  Vatnajoekull icecap
              triggered the largest joekulhlaup of  this century of Iceland. The flood
              produced a large-scale  sediment plume in the ocean floor.  A field expedition
              was  mounted with supplemental funds to sample and study the  products of this
              event, including, sediment and water  samples.  New funds will be used to
              continue the analyses of  this unique data set to: 1) characterized the
              sedimentation  of particles from the event as they traveled to the sea and 
              were dispersed, 2) examine the nature of particle laden  plume in the water and
              its dispersal, and 3) investigate the  dynamic nature of the floods as they
              enter the ocean. The  study will shed new light on the behavior of the
              joekulhlaup  flows, their dispersal and the sedimentary processes  associated
              with them in the marine environment.
