Abstract    :
                  Abstract  EEC-9711732  "An Opportunity for Supplemental Education Initiative
              Funds to an Engineering Research Center"  The Ohio State University  Taylan
              Altan, PI; Gary Kinzel and Jerald Brevick,  Co-PI    This award funds the
              Engineering Research Center at Ohio State University entitled Net Shape
              Manufacturing to develop modular educational materials on topics related to net
              shape manufacturing, with emphasis on metal forming (forging and sheet metal
              forming) and die/mold design and manufacturing.  These materials will present
              both theory and practical applications based on the Center's research in net
              shape manufacturing, experimental facilities, and industrial applications. 
              These materials will be produced using modular architecture in an interactive
              CD-ROM multimedia format.  The modules will be appropriate for continuous
              education and training of upper level undergraduate and graduate students and
              practicing engineers of diverse backgrounds and levels of manufacturing
              knowledge.
