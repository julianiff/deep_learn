Abstract    :
               The focus of this research involves the development of second generation  
              fluorophosphonate synthons. To this end, the synthesis of fluorinated  
              gamma-silyl-alpha-fluoroalkyne phosphonates in conjunction with solid   phase
              fluorination studies, the use of phosphonate as a leaving group and   the
              synthesis of cyclic alpha-fluoro- and alpha, alpha-difluoroalkyne  
              phosphonates  will be carried out.  The long-term goals of the research  
              include solid phase fluorine incorporation of a gem-difluoropropargyl   unit,
              synthesis of fluorinated phosphonic analogs of nucleotides,   synthesis of
              heterocyclic alpha-fluoro phosphonates and transmission of   chirality at the
              fluoromethylene carbon in alpha-fluorpropargyl   phosphonates.  With this
              renewal Research in Undergraduate Institutions   (RUI) award, the Synthetic
              Organic Program is supporting the research of   Dr. Gerald B. Hammond of the
              Department of Chemistry at the University of   Massachusetts, Dartmouth. 
              Professor Hammond will focus his work on   developing a group of reagents known
              as fluorophosphonate synthons.    These molecules are versatile synthetic
              intermediates as precursors to   fluorophosphonates , an important group of
              biological phosphate mimics,   and as fluorine containing synthons for the
              preparation of organofluoro   compounds.  The proposed research will be carried
              out, in the main, by   undergraduate students.
