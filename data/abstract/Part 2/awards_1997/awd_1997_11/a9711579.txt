Abstract    :
                                          ABSTRACT    The  importance  of methyl bromide as a
              source for  stratospheric  bromine  has  led  to  its planned phase-out as  an 
              agricultural  fumigant  as  part of the Montreal Protocol and  Clean  Air  Act.
               However,  there is significant uncertainty regarding  the  global  budget  of
              tropospheric methyl bromide and the role of the  ocean  as  a source or sink. 
              The oceanic lifetime of methyl bromide  is  an  important parameter in global
              models seeking to  predict  the  atmospheric response to proposed changes in
              emissions  of  methyl  bromide.    In this project, investigators at the
              University of Miami and the  University of Connecticut will conduct laboratory
              experiments  as  well as studies at sea to determine whether biological removal
              of  methyl bromide from surface seawater proceeds ar rates sufficient  to 
              affect  the oceanic lifetime of this compound.   The  current  state of
              knowledge allows prediction of its turnover rate through  purely  chemical
              (non-biological) pathways; little  is  known  of  microbiological  impacts.  If
              biological removal is  significant,  it  will  alter our current concept and
              quantitative modeling  of  the global cycling of methyl bromide.
