Abstract    :
                      1                9711785  Smalley  The objective of this Selected
              Research Opportunity Grant is  to  interrogate the true tensile strength of  an
               individual  single-wall  carbon nanotube (SWNT).  Achieving  these  very 
              difficult  experiments will require substantial improvements  in techniques for
              isolating, manipulating, and securing SWNT  ropes onto fabricated supports.  A
              single continuous rope of  SWNTs  will  be  draped cross metallic line 
              features  on  a  silicon  wafer  fabricated  at the Stanford  Nanofabrication 
              Facility.  The sample will then be introduced into an atomic  force microscope
              which will be used for three purposes:  (1)  The  entire  sample will be
              scanned periodically,  first  to  find  an attractive span, and subsequently to
              look for signs  of  breakage and slippage;  (2) High-resolution scans of the 
              rope  lying on the support lines on either side of the  span  will  yield the
              geometry of the rope, giving a good estimate  for the number of SWNTs in the
              rope; (3) The AFM tip will be  engaged  at  one point in the middle of the span
              to  deflect  the  rope.   The  known AFM cantilever force constant  along  with
               the  measured deflections will provide the information  required to obtain
              tensile strengths of the rope and of  the  individual tubes.    %%%    New  
              evidence  suggests  that  carbon  nanotubes  are   the  strongest  materials 
              known,  potentially  enabling   unique  applications  in  many areas critical
              to the  U.S.  economy.  This  research  will  involve  direct  measurements  of
               the  strength  of  nanotube  ropes using micromanipulators.   The  results 
              will  provide  the  foundation  for  research   and  development  of  nanotube 
              based superstrong  materials  and  their applications
