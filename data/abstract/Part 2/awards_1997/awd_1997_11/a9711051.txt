Abstract    :
                  ECS-9711051  Shira Broschat    In this research, a computationally efficient
              algorithm for ultrasound imaging of small breast tumors will be developed by
              combining imaging processing techniques with wave theory.  The research also
              includes, through its Materials Classifications step based on statistical
              pattern classification, realistic inclusion both of materials properties of the
              tissues involved and realistic distribution of scattering centers and
              structures.  Preliminary results indicate that this approach provides excellent
              reconstruction and can distinguish  between tumors and cysts.  The ultimate
              goal of the research is the detection of millimeter-sized breast tumors in what
              is experimentally a strong scattering environment.  The algorithm will also
              prove useful for other areas where strong scattering is a problem.
