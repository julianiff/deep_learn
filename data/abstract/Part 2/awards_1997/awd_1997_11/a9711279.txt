Abstract    :
                        INT-9711279  Malin    These three joint workshops in environmental
              chemistry, in which U.S. researchers from the American Chemical Society will
              join with their counterparts in Lithuania, the Newly Independent States  NIS ,
              and the Czech Republic, will take place in Palanga, Lithuania (June 1997), St.
              Petersburg, Russia (May 1998), and Prague, the Czech Republic (Summer 1999). 
              At each workshop a selected group of around ten U.S. environmental chemical
              scientists will confer with fifteen local scientific counterparts to develop
              plans and recommendations for scientific research addressing the unique
              environmental problems of the region.  Also, for each year, the American
              Chemical Society will select three early-career scientists from among nominees
              identified by the counterpart organizations.  Each of the participants will
              make a short-term visit of at least two months' duration to a research
              laboratory in the U.S.  The project will give U.S. chemical scientists an
              opportunity to consider environmental problems in unique regions of the
              Baltics, the NIS, and central Europe.  The participants can be expected to
              develop long-term cooperation and joint research in environmental chemistry
              between U.S. laboratories and some of the "best and brightest" early-career
              chemical societies in the Baltics/NIS/central European region.  In addition,
              the program should strengthen U.S. relationships with the non-governmental
              professional societies of the region.     These workshops should result in many
              new collaborative research efforts in quantum optics between U.S. researchers
              and their Lithuanian, Russian, and Czech counterparts.  They fulfill the
              program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and these
              countries to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong
              mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and
              mutuality of benefit.    ***  ??
