Abstract    :
              McCartney   9711875   As part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE)
              Indian Ocean    Expedition, the PI was lead scientist on the first two
              hydrographic cruises in    the southeastern part of the basin. These
              hydrographic surveys covered two    nearly meridional lines between western
              Australia and Antarctica, crossing    the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. 
              Preliminary analysis has revealed a    number of features not previously
              observed.  Support will be used to carry    out an analysis of these features,
              leading to a complete quantitative    circulation description, including the
              abyssal, mid-depth, and    thermocline/upper water column strata, and including
              comparison of these    1994-5 data to older hydrography to link observed
              subtropical thermocline,    SubAntarctic Mode Water (SAMW) and Antarctic
              Intermediate Water    (AAIW) water mass changes to high latitude source
              changes.
