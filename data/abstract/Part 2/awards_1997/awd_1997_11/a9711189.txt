Abstract    :
              This award supports a two day workshop held April 24-25, 1997 at Northwestern
              University to address the technical issues of the wide area high performance
              networking infrastructure required for the Nation's research community. 
              Participants primarily are representatives of the institutions with NSFNET
              Program high performance connections awards.  The workshop is a follow-on to
              the November 1996 workshop at the University of Colorado which addressed the
              campus infrastructure necessary to interface properly with high performance
              connections.
