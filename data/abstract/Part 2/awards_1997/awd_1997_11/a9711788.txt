              Abstract  ATM-9711788  Moore, Theodore  University of Michigan  Title: Lake
              Nicaragua: A Possible High Resolution Record of  Tropical Climate    This SGER
              award supports a study designed to establish the  paleoclimate potential of
              Lake Nicaragua.  Located at approximately  12oN in the heart of the northeast
              trade wind belt, Lake Nicaragua  appears to offer a very promising target for
              paleoclimate studies.    It is the largest single lake in the Americas between
              Lake  Titicaca at about 16oS and the Great Salt Lake at about 41oN.   Rainfall
              in the area is highly seasonal and the climate of the area  is  strongly
              affected by the ENSO cycle.  The location and size of  the lake is ideal for
              recording regional variations in climate  driven by changes in the ENSO
              tropical cycle in temperature and  rainfall.  Paleoclimate records from this
              lake could form an  important tie point along the PEP I transect (The Americas)
               proposed by PAGES (the international Past Global Changes Program,  a core
              project of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program).   Little work has
              been done on the sediments from Lake Nicaragua and  it is possible that the
              stratigraphic record may be disturbed by  tectonic activity or strongly
              reworked and mixed in the shallower  areas by storms.  However, the high
              organic content of the surface  sediments and the presence of at least some
              deeps reaching 40 m  offer substantial hope that a very useful paleoclimate
              record can  be recovered.
