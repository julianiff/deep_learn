Abstract    :
              A central problem in understanding the brain concerns how knowledge is stored in
              synaptic connections among neurons.  In artificial neural networks this
              phenomenon is modeled by connection weights, which determine how much of the
              activation of one neuron is passed to another neuron.  The goal of this project
              is to understand how knowledge is stored in a set of connection weights, and to
              use this understanding as the foundation for an epistemology that is directly
              grounded in what we know of the brain.  Our understanding of the brain and of
              the neural networks that model it, including those used for artificial
              intelligence purposes, will be limited until we understand how to correlate
              specific changes in connection weights with specific changes in stored
              knowledge.  For similar reasons, psychological explanations of cognitive
              processes and the philosophic theories of epistemology that build on them both
              rely fundamentally on understanding what knowledge is stored, and under what
              conditions, within a neural network.
