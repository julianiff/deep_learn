Abstract    :
                  9711063  Liu  This action is to provide travel funds for six US researchers
              to  attend the Okushiri Tsunami Workshop '98, to be held in Hakodate  and
              Okushiri, Japan, 12-16 July 1998.  The workshop is being  organized by Dr.
              Fumihiko Iamamura of Tohoku University, Japan.    This is the third
              international workshop focusing on the runup of  a tsunami onto a coastline. 
              The first workshop was held at  Catalina Island, CA in 1990, the second at
              Friday Habor, WA in  1995, both being supported entirely the National Science 
              Foundation.    The Okushiri tsunami workshop also marks the fifth anniversary
              of  the 1993 devastating Hokkaido tsunami.  Major topics to be  discussed are:
              (1) Runup of a tsunami around an island, (2)  Tsunami generation by landslides
              and tectonic movements, (3)  Local tsunami runup, and (4) Disaster prevention
              and  reconstruction.    The PI will establish close communication, via Internet
               electronic mail, with US tsunami researchers who are unable to  attend the
              workshop.  ***
