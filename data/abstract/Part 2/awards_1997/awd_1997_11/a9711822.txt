              P.I.: Goni  Proposal  Number:  97-01940     Institution:  University  of  South
              Carolina  Title: CAREER: Non-point sources of dissolved organic matter  to the
              ocean: groundwaters from coastal soils and sediments      It  is  well
              established that rivers are an important source  of  dissolved  organic matter
              (DOM) to  the  coastal  ocean.  However,  recent studies have shown that
              groundwater  inputs  might contribute a significant amount of terrigenous DOM 
              to  the  coastal  ocean  in areas such as the southeastern  U.S.  The  primary 
              research  objective of  this  proposal  is  to  understand how the diffused
              flow of groundwater constituents  affects the dynamics of carbon, nitrogen and
              other nutrients  in  coastal environments.  The research efforts are designed 
              to answer three specific questions:  1) What are the sources  and 
              characteristics of groundwater DOM?; 2)  What  are  the  seasonal   dynamics 
              of  groundwater  DOM   production   and  transport? and 3) What are the impacts
              of groundwater DOM on  the coastal ocean? Another important goal of the
              proposal is  to  link  the  research objectives outlined above  with  the 
              education of students at different stages of their  careers.  This  proposal 
              makes  students  key  participants  of   the  investigations   designed  to  
              understand   the   role   of  groundwater   in  DOM  cycling.   The  vehicles  
              for   such  participation include new field summer courses at the Baruch 
              Laboratories  in  North Inlet (SC) and new  laboratory-based  graduate and
              non-major undergraduate courses.
