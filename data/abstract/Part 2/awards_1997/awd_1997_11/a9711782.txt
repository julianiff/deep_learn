Abstract    :
              One of the mainstream theories on human movement coordination and  learning
              states that complex human movements are organized  as  a  concatenation of
              simpler movement primitives, which are  in  turn  scaled  with respect to space
              and time to generate a more diverse  range  of  movements.   The goal of this
              project  is  to  provide  machines  with  similar  motor  intelligence 
              capabilities:   the  ability to generate complex movements from a vocabulary of
               basic  movement  primitives, to optimize movements for a  given  desired 
              objective,  and  to incorporate feedback mechanisms  that  ensure  proper 
              execution of the movement in the presence of  uncertainty  and disturbances. 
              Based on studies of human and animal movement,  basic  movement  primitives are
              identified for a  wide  range  of  robotic  systems  (e.g., manipulators and
              walking  machines).   A  "motion  compiler" will be developed that, given  a 
              sequence  of  primitives,  appropriately adjusts the sequence,  and  determines
               optimal  time  and  space scalings with  respect  to  a  suitable  performance
               measure.   The physical end-product  is  a  software  system  that  takes as
              input a machine's kinematic structure  and  dynamic  properties, a set of
              movement primitives, and a  desired  goal,  and  produces  an optimal
              coordinated  movement.   Key  to  developing  an  efficient  and  reliable 
              motion  compiler  is  a  powerful  set  of  recently developed multibody 
              system  analysis  tools based on the mathematics of Lie groups and Lie
              algebras.
