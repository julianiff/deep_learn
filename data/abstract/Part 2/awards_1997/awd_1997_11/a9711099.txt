Abstract    :
              This research is on test methods for mixed signal and analog VLSI systems. 
              Aspects being considered are: 1) design of high-speed dynamic current sensors
              for  application in iDD pulse response test method, for mixed-mode, MOS and
              bipolar  circuits; 2) development of high-speed static current sensors for
              utilization  with the IDDQ test method; 3) verification of a dual to the IDDQ
              test scheme for  analog circuits (denoted VDDQ testing). Approaches are: a)
              on-chip generation and  comparison of VDDQ voltage references, and b) external
              measurement of VDDQ  voltages using analog boundary scan test techniques to
              bring them out of chip in  analog form using sample and hold circuits or in
              digital form after performing  on-chip A /D conversion. Research activities
              designing, manufacturing and  evaluating various integrated circuit prototypes
              of built-in dynamic and static  current sensors and of VDDQ test circuitry.
