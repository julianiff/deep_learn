              University of Florida    TITLE: Regional Assessment of the Effects of
              ENSO-Related Climate Variability on the Agricultural Sector of Argentina and
              Uruguay- Implications for Adoption of Climate Forecasts.    This is a
              multidisciplinary proposal to link a system of climate,  crop and decision
              models in order to understand the interactions of interannual climate
              variability,  crop productivity and the value of ENSO-related climate forecasts
              to the agriculture of  Argentina and Uruguay.  Monte Carlo simulation
              techniques will be utilized to create probability distribution of crop response
              to climate variability.  Survey methods will be used to understand the
              perceptions of the decision makers.  This research will try to answer the
              important question of how useful the recent gains in climate prediction skills
              are and can be to the agriculturists.  The results from this grant will be of
              great practical utility in assessing the value of improvements in climate
              prediction.
