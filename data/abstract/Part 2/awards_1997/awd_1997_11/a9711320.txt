Abstract    :
              New US/Russian findings imply catastrophic flooding of the  continental shelf of
              the Black Sea in mid 6000 BC.  A shelly  gravel surface marking an erosional
              event extends across the  entire northern Black Sea continental shelf.  This
              event has  important implications for Holocene climate in the  intercontinental
              setting of Eastern Europe and the exchange  through Bosporus and Dardanelle
              Straits.  The PI will use  the existing sediment core material and conduct a
              new field  program with European scientists.  Sediment, faunal and  isotopic
              analyses will be used together with C-14 dating and  ultra-high resolution
              seismic profiling and wide-aperture  multibeam bathymetry to test these ideas.
