Abstract    :
              9711377  Walker         This grant provides $100,000 as two-years partial salary
               support for a technician to oversee operations and maintenance,  train new
              users and develop new geochemical techniques utilizing  the thermal ionization
              mass spectrometers (TIMS) in the Isotope  Geochemistry Lab (IGL) at the
              University of Maryland.  This is a  Phase II grant for technical support under
              the IF/EAR program  Continued support of a highly qualified scientist, Dr.
              Sonia  Esperanca, in this technical position is fully warranted and her  added
              expertise provides this group with a great deal of added  scientific motivation
              for further development of difficult  chemical separation and mass
              spectrometric techniques for the  analysis of lithium isotopes and osmium
              isotopes in the Re/Os  system.  The development of techniques in the Re/Os
              system has  already brought significant contributions to our understanding of 
              the early geochemical differentiation of the Earth and new  developments in the
              use of lithium isotopes as tracers of fluid  flow in magmatic, hydrothermal and
              groundwater systems holds  future promise.  Lastly, the addition of a new
              faculty member  this summer, Dr Christina Gallup, brings new expertise in
              uranium  series dating and trace element analyses in coral skeletons as 
              paleoclimatic indicators.  ***
