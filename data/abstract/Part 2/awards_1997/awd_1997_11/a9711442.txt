Abstract    :
              Theoretical and numerical investigation of momentum, heat and mass transport
              processes in low Reynolds number two-phase flow with particles in the Stokes
              range will be undertaken.  The shear-induced particle and fluid diffusivities
              in a non-uniform shear flow will be modeled and numerically simulated.  The
              method to determine the volumetric particle flux due to a gradient of shear
              rate will be established.  Kinetic theory of suspension mechanics will be
              applied in conjunction with numerical methods to calculate drift velocity of
              particles due to concentration and shear rate gradients.  A statistical theory
              of macroscopic phenomena in low-conducting suspensions subject to strong
              electric fields will be further developed.  The effects of conductivity and
              interparticle interactions in electrorheological fluids and in
              dielectrophoresis will be modeled and introduced in the simulations.    This
              project is relevant to the suspension rheology and flow properties of
              electrorheological fluids.
