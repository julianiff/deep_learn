Abstract    :
              Developing numerical integrated-assessment models to understand and develop
              policies to reduce the impacts of global climate change is a major research
              priority for the social and natural sciences.  This research will continue work
              by the principal investigator to improve integrated assessment models by
              developing a new version of the Dynamic Integrated Model of Climate and the
              Economy (the DICE model).  The DICE model is a globally aggregated model
              integrating a general-equilibrium model of the global economy with a climate
              system including emissions, concentrations, climate change, impacts, and
              efficient policy.  This research will focus on two specific areas.  First, the
              research will update the underlying data and components to reflect developments
              in the natural and social sciences since the model was developed.  Second, the
              new version of the DICE model (tentatively called the `NEWDICE` model) will
              incorporate three new methodological approaches:  using a production function
              to represent the emissions-output tradeoff, incorporation of fossil fuel
              supplies to reflect the finite nature of the carbon base, and an attempt to
              incorporate an innovation possibility function to reflect the induced character
              of technological change.
