              Abstract  ATM-9711459  Swart, Peter  University of Miami  Title: Workshop on the
              Application of Sclerosponges as  Paleoclimatic Indicators    This award
              supports a workshop at the University of Miami (10 -13  May 1997) to discuss
              the implications of the use of sclerosponges  as paleoclimatic indicators. 
              This interdisciplinary workshop will  focus in the potential of the
              sclerosponges (calcified demosponges)  as proxy indicators of climate.  These
              sponges secrete aragonite  skeletons and colonies can span 400 years.  The
              workshop is  designed to examine the uncertainties regarding the mechanism of 
              incorporation of stable isotopes into sclerosponge and coral  skeletons; and on
              the degree of correlation between the ambient  environment and the sponges. 
              This workshop on the development of  a new proxy indicator of paleoclimate will
              be an important step in  widening our information base in tropical waters.  It
              is possible  that the sclerosponges will allow reconstruction of thermocline 
              history and increase our understanding of the penetration history  of
              anthropogenic CO2 into the upper ocean.
