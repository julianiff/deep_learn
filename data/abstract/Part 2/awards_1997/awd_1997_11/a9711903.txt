Abstract    :
              9711903  Kalia and Vashishta  These senior PI's are well known as leaders in
              multi-  particle (involving more than million particles) simulations  of
              critical material properties.  They are also pioneers in  educational
              innovation by introducing and successfully  managing a dual degree program with
              a Ph.D. in Physics and  an MS in Computer Science.  This grant, to a university
              in  an EPSCOR state, is a renewal of their research program.  Specifically, it
              contains three foci: (1) Residual stresses,  nucleation and growth of cracks
              and delamination at Al/AlO3  and Al/SiC interfaces; (2) The
              structure-mechanical  properties relationship and dynamics of consolidation and
               fracture in nanophase ceramic composites and (3) Stresses  and strains a as
              function of density, stoichiometry and  thickness of ceramic coatings on metals
              and semiconductors.  %%%  The two senior collaborators form an EPSCOR state
              have  clearly emerged as leaders in the new field of massively  parallel,
              multi-particle atomistic simulation of critical  material properties.  
              Supported by state of the art  computing resources,  they are studying the
              details of  growth and mechanical properties of ceramics and ceramic  coatings
              on metals and semiconductors.  They are also  studying the characteristic
              growth of a crack-tip front in  fracture of materials.  ***
