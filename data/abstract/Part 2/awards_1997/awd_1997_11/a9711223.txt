Abstract    :
              9711223  Bloxham           This award provides one-half of the funding for the
              upgrading  of the computer network system used for geophysical research in the 
              Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Harvard University.  Harvard
              University is committed to providing the remaining half of  the cost of
              acquisition. The network is used to support research  across a range of
              fundamental earth science problems including the  generation of the Earth's
              magnetic field in the core, the fine  structure of the Earth's rotation, and
              the dynamics of the Earth's  mantle.  ***
