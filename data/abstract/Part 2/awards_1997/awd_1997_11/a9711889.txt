Abstract    :
              Abstract- Linne  CTS- 9711889    This is an instrumentation development project
              on a picosecond pump/probe instrument based on mode-locked Ti: sapphire lasers.
               Addition of a regenerative amplifier makes it possible to observe absolute
              concentrations of key species in reacting flow-fields at high speeds and
              perhaps independent of pressure.  The effort also includes design of novel
              demodulation sensors that could have broad applicability in such diverse
              applications as ballistic imaging in tissue, imaging spectrographs, and
              night-vision devices.
