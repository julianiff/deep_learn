Abstract    :
              Joseph Dalton Hooker became one of the most influential British naturalists of
              the nineteenth century: he produced impressive taxonomic and phytogeographical
              research, served as director of Kew Gardens and president of both the Royal
              Society and the BAAS, provided seminal botanical advice for Charles Darwin's
              theory of evolution, enjoyed close personal relationships with numerous
              preeminent scientific authorities throughout Europe, and played a central role
              in the transformation of the amateur natural scientist into the professional
              civil servant.  Yet despite his distinguished career, he did not hold his first
              permanent professional scientific position until three weeks before his
              thirty-eighth birthday.  This study will examine his life during the formative,
              unsettled years of 1845 (when local; politics cost him his bid to become
              professor of botany at Edinburgh) and 1855 (when   he finally achieved
              assistant directorship at Kew), a period anchored by three-and-a-half years of
              scientific exploration in India.  It will trace his experience as he navigates
              diverse, social, cultural, and physical terrain in the quotidian practice of
              his daily life, to uncover his methods for acquiring natural knowledge, how he
              communicated this knowledge to colleagues and the public, what won his
              reputation, what he had to do to provide a living income, and the ways he
              harmonized science and family life.  Among the historiographic issues addressed
              will be the importance of `traditions` within natural history, the apportioning
              of scientific authority among field and museum work, the role of
              professionalization and institution-building, the methods and purposes of
              scientific representation, the relationship between science and imperialism and
              between metropole and periphery, and the position of women, and more strictly
              wives, within `manly`  Victorian science.  The decade surrounding Hooker's time
              in India provides an excellent opportunity to chart the ways an ambitious,
              talented and accomplished but professionally insecure young naturalist
              negotiated his identity in high Victorian Britain, and in turn reveals much
              about the character of science during a period  of distinct social and cultural
              change.
