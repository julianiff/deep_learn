Abstract    :
                PROJECT SUMMARY  The main goals of this project are to reconstruct trends in
              salmon abundance in the California Current and Northern Gulf of Alaska systems
              over the past 500 to 2000 years, to compare trends in abundance between the
              systems, and to determine relationships between climate change and salmon
              abundance.  This project will use newly developed techniques to reconstruct
              salmon abundance trends from stable isotopic analysis of lake sediment cores. 
              Several sites will be studied in each of the California Current and Northern
              Gulf of Alaska systems to compare trends within and between regions.  The
              records of salmon abundance will be compared with paleoclimatic data determined
              from studies of tree rings, glacial advances and other sources.  Long-term
              records of salmon abundance will be reconstructed by analyses of stable
              nitrogen isotopes in sediment cores.  This new application of N stable isotopes
              is based on the observation that Pacific salmon supply measurable quantities of
              elements into freshwater systems when they return to spawn.  Nitrogen derived
              from adult salmon is enriched in 15N relative to terrestrially-derived N. and
              thus past changes in the number of returning adult salmon are reflected by
              downcore changes in sedimentary delta15N.  The stable isotopes of sulfur also
              have potential to trace salmon-derived elements into freshwater ecosystems,
              because there is a large difference between marine and terrestrial signatures
              of delta34S. Because N and S have different geochemical controls and different
              geochemical cycling processes, the use of both tracers should lead to a robust
              reconstruction of salmon abundance.
