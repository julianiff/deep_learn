Abstract    :
              This project will establish the timing (phase) of global  climate change
              relative to changes in the Earth's orbit  about the Sun for the period between
              1 and 5 million  years  ago.  Emphasis will be upon using an assumption of
              constant  phase relative to tilt of the Earth's axis, rather than the 
              more-common approach of constant phase relative to orbital  precession. 
              Iterative experiments will be done using  different age models and filters on
              four independent data  sets.  In addition to producing a master age model which
              can  be used by others for detailed comparisons of globally  distributed
              climate records, the project will assess the  sensitivity of these techniques
              to various assumptions, and  provide insight into mechanisms of past climate
              change.
