Abstract    :
              9711932   Swift      This project is to investigate passive polarimetric remote
              sensing of the ocean surface    wind direction and speed, and to compare this
              technique to scatterometry.  A rich data set    will be analyzed to 1) develop
              an empirical model describing the radiative Stokes    parameters dependence on
              wind, 2) perform a Fourier analysis to characterize the Stokes    parameters;
              3) compare the results with backscatter signatures, 4) model the physical   
              processes contributing to the response, and 5) evaluate the potential of
              passive polarimetry    for satellite-based sensing of the ocean surface wind
              vector.
