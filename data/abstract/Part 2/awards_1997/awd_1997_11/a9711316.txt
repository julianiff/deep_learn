Abstract    :
              This project will analyze the petrology of ice-rafted  detritus in
              high-sedimentation-rate cores from the North  Atlantic, concentrating on the
              last glacial interval.  Previous work has identified a persistent cycle of 1500
               years at one site during both glacial and interglacial  intervals, implying an
              inherent instability in the Earth's  climate system resulting in varying
              production of icebergs.  The project will expand the study to other sites, in
              order  to determine the reliability of this finding.
