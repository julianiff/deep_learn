Abstract    :
              9711130  Harcum  This Research Planning Grant proposal addresses what appears 
              to be a commercially significant and scientifically under-  investigated area,
              the effect of  bioreactor conditions on  the glycosylation patterns of protein.
               The research program  would study mammalian cells grown in continuous culture 
              (chemosts) and determine the effect of variables such as  agitation, pH,
              temperature, growth rates, etc.  Electrophoretic and chromatographic
              separations coupled with  mass spec and NMR analyses will be used in structural
               determinations.  ***
