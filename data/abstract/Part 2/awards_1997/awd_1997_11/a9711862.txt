Abstract    :
                9711862   Skyllingstad    This project is for a modeling study of turbulence
              generation by storm-driven inertial currents.  A series of experiments using
              LES model will be carried out with the objectives to: 1) develop a physical
              description of turbulent processes that are forced by inertial currents; 2)
              quantify the energy budgets during wind events and how they relate to changes
              in density structure; 3) determine the importance of mean flow properties in
              controlling instability processes at the base of the mixed layer.
