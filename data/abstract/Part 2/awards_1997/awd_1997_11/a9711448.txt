Abstract    :
                The goal of the GLOBEC Northeast Pacific program is to gain an understanding
              of how variability in the physical environment, specifically changes that might
              result from climate change, affects populations of marine animals on the west
              coast of North America, specifically salmon and associated species.  The PIs
              will formulate models spanning the individual level to the metapopulation level
              for two genera of interest to GLOBEC in the California Current System (CCS):
              (1) the two CCS salmon species identified by GLOBEC, coho salmon (Oncorhynchus
              kisutch) and chinook  salmon (O. tshawytscha) and (2) Dungeness crab (Cancer
              magister), a species which covaries with salmon, is a significant prey of both
              species, and is subject to similar mesoscale circulation patterns.  These
              models will link the different scales of variability and levels of ecological
              organization in the various retrospective, monitoring and process studies so
              that the effects of changes in the physical environment on populations can be
              projected.
