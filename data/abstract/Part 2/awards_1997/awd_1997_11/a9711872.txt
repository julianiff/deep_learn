Abstract    :
                9711872  Smyth    This project will study the effects of wave saturation in 
              governing the form and evolution of the Equatorial  Undercurrent. 
              Specifically, it will 1) apply linear  stability analyses to identify the
              factors that govern the  wave radiation; 2) use the linear results to define
              length  scales for use in the LES; 3) improve the resolution and  test of LES;
              and 4) use the LES model to evaluate the wave-  mean flow interactions in
              maintaining the EUC.
