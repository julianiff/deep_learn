Abstract    :
              9711914  Alfano  A two day workshop entitled Advanced in Optical Biopsy and 
              Optical Mammography occurred April 24-25, 1997 at the City  University of New
              York Graduate Center.  The meeting was  jointly organized by the New York
              Academy of Science and the  New York State Center for Advanced Technology in
              Ultrafast  Photonic Materials and Applications at the City University  of New
              York.    The goal of the symposium is to advance the understanding  and
              development of biomedical instrumentation for optical  methods of cancer
              detection.  Optical biopsy and mammography  are promising new techniques for
              determining whether or not  a tissue is cancerous without using invasive
              techniques.  An  analysis of the spectrum of light emitted from optically 
              excited tissue allows investigators to detect physical and  chemical changes in
              tissue and determine if the tissue is  normal, benign, or cancerous.  Because
              they are minimally  invasive, and use non-ionizing radiation to detect diseases
               with high sensitivity and accuracy, these new techniques may  lead to novel
              diagnostic and therapeutic techniques.    Funding from the Foundation defrayed
              partial travel expenses  for the U.S. participants who prepared and delivered 
              scientific presentations at the meeting where approximately  80 persons
              attended.  Information presented at the  conference is to be disseminated in
              the Annals of the New  York Academy of Sciences, thereby making the results of
              the  meeting available to a wide audience.  ***
