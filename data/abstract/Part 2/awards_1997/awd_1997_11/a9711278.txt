Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT  CTS-9711278  T.G. Theofanous, UCSB    Partial support for travel
              expenses will be provided to selected participants to an university-industry
              Workshop on Multifluid Science and Technology, to be held in Santa Barbara on
              February 28 to March 1, 1997.   The main objective is to evaluate the research,
              education and organizational needs, and on this basis to initiate an
              organization for fostering synergism between fundamental research and
              industrial needs and supporting the multidisciplinary multifluid community. 
              The multifluid/multiphase community has been fragmented among various
              disciplines and areas of relevance, without sufficient benefit of
              cross-fertilization of the methods of investigation and research results.  The
              proposed meeting will explore ways to promote interdisciplinary and
              industry-university synergism, group activities and representation with other
              organizations.  The second part of the meeting will be dedicated to technical
              presentations and scientific exchanges.  This workshop aims to generate an
              organizational framework in order to better advance multifluid sciences and
              technological developments in the U.S. by promoting on a continuous basis
              better communication, synergism, high quality research and education in the
              field.
