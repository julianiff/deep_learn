Abstract    :
              McGillis  9711218    Support is provided to measure air-sea gas fluxes directly
              in the air  boundary layer by the eddy correlation (direct covariance) method;
              to  compare the results with the well-established method of estimating gas 
              transfer velocities from tracer mass balances in the ocean; and to develop  a 
              parameterization of this flux (and its gas transfer coefficient) as a  function
              of environmental forcing on shorter time scales than is possible  with the mass
              balance technique.  The techniques developed in the lab will be  tested in
              coastal waters in 1997, and as part of carbon dioxide exchange  program  in the
              open ocean in 1998.
