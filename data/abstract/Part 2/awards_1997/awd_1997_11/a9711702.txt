Abstract    :
              Repet702                              ABSTRACT    Recent reports of nitrogen
              distribution in marine sediments offer  the  exciting prospect of tracking
              changes in the marine nitrogen  cycle  through  time, including changes in
              paleoproductivity  and  paleonitrification.   These developments show  great 
              promise  in  adding  to  our understanding of large-scale controls  on  marine 
              production,  carbon preservation in sediments, and the  interplay  between 
              climate and geochemical cycling.  In this  project,  the  principal  
              investigator  will  focus  attention  on   the   main  impediment  to  using 
              sedimentary nitrogen  isotopes  in  paleo-  oceanographic  studies:  namely,
              the large  and  non-quantifiable  imprint  of  early  diagenesis  on the 
              sedimentary  N15  record.  Specifically he will continue his studies of the N15
               composition  of  sedimentary chlorophyll-a as a tracer for processes affecting
               surface  water nutrient dynamics.  This approach should  be  more  reliable 
              that using N15 for bulk sedimentary organic  matter  in  which the N15
              signature of surface conditions is convoluted  with  post-depositional changes
              in nitrogen chemistry since  deposition  at the sediment surface.
