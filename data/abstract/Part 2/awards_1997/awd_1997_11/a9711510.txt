Abstract    :
              ***  Grusky and Weeden  9711510  Social inequality in industrial society is
              generated by three processes:  the differentiation of positions in the division
              of labor, the matching of positions to rewards, and the allocation of
              individuals to positions.  Scholars of occupations explore the first component,
              stratification research examines the third, but the second has received little
              recent sociological attention.  To address this gap in our knowledge, this
              dissertation project will analyze cross-sectional data at three points in time
              to separate the effects of occupational closure (or the ability of an
              occupation to limit membership, through professional associations, licensing,
              unionization or credential requirements) from the effects of human capital
              characteristics of occupation members (including education, experience, gender,
              and race).  ***
