Abstract    :
              Caroline R Nagel  University of Colorado, Boulder   The doctoral dissertation
              research will examine a series of questions which relate to identity, politics
              and place in an immigrant receiving society using the example of Arab
              immigrants in London.  The project will seek to learn the relationship between
              group identity and political action, and the ways group identities shape the
              adaptation process in a host society.  In addition the research attempts to
              depict new geographies which are created from group identity patterns and
              political struggles.  An initial premise is that immigrant identity reflects
              social relations which are rooted in constructions of gender, race and nation. 
              Space is seen as critical in the analysis and is an integral component of
              identity, political struggle, and immigrant integration.  Secondary data on the
              immigrant community in London will be gathered and organized temporally and
              structurally.  In addition primary data will be gathered through
              semi-structured interviews which will explore linkages between context,
              identity and political actions in order to reveal the spatial components of
              identity politics.  The result will be a deeper understanding of the ways in
              which space, identity and politics are woven together in the adaptation process
              of an immigrant community.
