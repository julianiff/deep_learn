Abstract    :
              Brustein and Berntson    Women's participation in France's
              electorally-successful Front National is growing and will likely prove integral
              to the future electoral success of that anti-immigrant, anti-Semitic political
              party.  Women's participation in the Front National's traditional and "family"
              values platform is also required to ensure the success of its social and
              political goals.  The proposed research is a case study of women's
              participation in the Front National.  Until recently women's participation in
              far-right political parties has been neglected by scholars, who perhaps assumed
              for various reasons that women would not join such parties.  Informed by an
              interest-based model of political participation and by work on the narrative
              construction of identity, this dissertation project will enhance our
              understanding of women's reasons for joining such parties and will explore the
              dimensions of their participation.  The study will do so through
              semi-structured interviews with women who belong to the Front National in
              Montepellier and Toulon, France.    ***
