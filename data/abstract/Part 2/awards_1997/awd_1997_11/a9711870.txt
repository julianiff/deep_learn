Abstract    :
                                          ABSTRACT    More  than 40,000 tons of interplanetary
              dust particles  fall  to  the  Earth's  surface each year.  Those particles 
              less  than  30  micrometers   in   size   retain  to   a   large   extent  
              their  extraterrestrial  isotopic signature.  In the central  equatorial 
              Pacific  Ocean,  a  limited  geographic  region  of  the  earth's  surface, 
              the  flux  of  extraterrestrial helium,  determined  by  normalization  to 
              thorium-230,  has  been  relatively   constant  through   the  past  200 
              thousand  years.   In  this   research,  investigators from the Lamont-Doherty
              Geological Observatory  and  Tulane University will carry out a thorough
              investigation of  the  apatial  and  temporal  variability of the  He-3  supply
               to  the  sediments  throughout  the world ocean.  Other  applications  and 
              limitations  of  extraterrestrial He-3 as a  constant-flux  proxy  will also be
              explored.
