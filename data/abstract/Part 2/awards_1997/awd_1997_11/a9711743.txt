Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9711743  University of Minnesota  "Connecting Laboratory and
              Conceptual/Theoretical Components of Undergraduate Core Engineering Courses" 
              D. Fennel Evans, PI and Karl Smith and Vaughan Voller, Co-PI    This award
              funds the Engineering Research Center at the University of Minnesota entitled
              the Center for Interfacial Engineering to develop computer based instructional
              materials for use in core undergraduate courses in transport phenomena.  These
              materials will include basic content modules in fluid flow and heat transfer
              and interactive fluid flow and heat transfer laboratory simulations.  These
              simulations will allow students to assemble and conduct their own experiments. 
                Examples will be drawn from the Center's systems level research and
              industrial applications, e.g., a coating flow machine, polymer impregnation,
              atomization processes, industrial water purification and waste treatment
              system, reactive blending of immisible polymer systems, and production of
              polyurethane foams.  Materials will be produced on CD-ROM and the World Wide
              Web.  Distribution will be enhanced by accompanying teaching guides and
              supporting workshops for engineering faculty.
