Abstract    :
              A  critical  issue in recognizing 3D objects and  in  registering  surfaces  is 
              the  definition  of a ound  measure  of  similarity  between  3D shapes.
              Although shape similarity metrics  have  been  proposed in the case of 2D
              shapes, only partial results have been  obtained  for  3D  shapes. Part of the 
              problem  is  that  it  is  difficult  to  define  the  necessary
              pose-independent  reference  frame    on   a   3D   surface.    This   research
                investigates  representations of 3D shapes that lead to a natural definition
              of  shape  similarity  that  can be built directly  from  point  sets  without 
              requiring feature extraction, segmentation,  or  surface  fitting.  These
              representations may be adjusted to  be  either  a  global representation of a
              surface (e.g., for object recognition)  or  a  more  local  representation
              (e.g., for tracking  of  local  surface  patches.)  They  lead naturally  to 
              3D  shape  matching  algorithms  directly  applicable to object recognition 
              problems.  Beyond   their  application  to  3D  object  recognition,   these 
              representations will provide a framework for the analysis  of  3D  shapes. Of
              particular interest is the study of shape classes  and  generic  object
              recognition.  The shape representations  and  the  associated  matching
              algorithms are validated  through  scenarios  motivated  by  real 
              applications.  In  one  application,  object  recognition is used for building
              and identifying geometric models  of   industrial  parts.  In  a  second 
              application,  the   shape  similarity technique is used for registering views
              of terrain and  landmark  surfaces  in  a natural environment  for  mobile 
              robot  navigation and mapping.
