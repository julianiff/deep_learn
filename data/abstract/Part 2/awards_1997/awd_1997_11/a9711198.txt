                                      ABSTRACT    From  tidal  flats  to  the deepest ocean
              trenches,  the  surface  sediments  of  the  sea  floor  are zones  of  intense
               chemical,  biological, and physical activity.  This intensity is due largely 
              by  macroscopic animals that physically mix particles  and  cause  interstitial
               water  exchange during their feeding,  moving,  and  burrow   irrigation  
              activities.   Such   activity   effectively  increases  the  effective surface
              of the seafloor  several  times  more that it would be if such animals were not
              present.    The  investigator in this project will be organizing a scientific 
              workshop  to  review the state of scientific development  of  the  field  of  
              "organism-sediment" relations and  to  assess  future  research directions and
              technological developments.  Participants  will   include  sediment 
              geochemists,  physical  oceanographers,  benthic  biologists, ocean engineers,
              sedimentary geologists  and  others  who  share a common interest in
              understanding  this  most  scientifically elusive boundary of the world ocean.
