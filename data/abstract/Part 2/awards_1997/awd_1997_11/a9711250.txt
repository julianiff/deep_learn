Abstract    :
              This is a Minority Career Advancement Award.  The research is directed  toward
              the problem of  manufacturing techniques used to miniaturize electronic
              components.  These techniques  have recently been applied to the construction
              of microscopic mechanical components.  Devices using such components often
              include a gas flow as part of their design.  However, the conventional methods
              for simulating gas flows are not accurate when applied to miniaturized systems.
               Instead one must perform calculations that track the motion of individual gas
              molecules.    A major difficulty with performing numerical calculations that
              track individual particles is that they are extremely time-consuming, even on a
              modern supercomputer.  This is especially true if the entire device is large
              but contains a crucial component that is small.  For example, in a computer
              disk drive is relatively large (about the size of an ant) but the air flow that
              supports the read/write head above the spinning platter passes through a gap
              that is roughly one millionth of an inch wide (about the wavelength of visible
              light).    The goal is to efficiently simulate microscopic flows that exist as
              part of a macroscopic device by combining particle calculations and traditional
              hydrodynamic computations  into  a hybrid computer program.  Only the regions
              that require a particle description are calculated using particles while in the
              larger volume the equations for pressure, temperature, etc. are solved.  The
              end result of this program will be a composite scheme that will permit  the
              solution to flow problems that cannot be effectively computed by any single
              technique.
