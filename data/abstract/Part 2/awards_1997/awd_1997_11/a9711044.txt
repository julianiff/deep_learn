Abstract    :
              9711044  McKittrick  The development of high quality ferroelectric thin films is
              one of the main challenges to achieving giga-bit storage capacity on dynamic
              random access memory (DRAM) devices.  Bulk ferroelectrics such as BaTiO3 are
              well characterized; however, the ferroelectric properties of thin films are not
              understood at a fundamental or even technical level.  The microstructural
              features such as grain size, grain orientation (polycrystalline vs. epitaxial),
              stoichiometry, thickness of the film, residual stress, dopant concentrations
              and surface roughness have not been systematically studied or characterized. 
              In order to use ferroelectric thin films, they must be sandwiched between
              conductive electrodes.  These electrodes have been found to be the source of
              current leakage, increasing fatigue and aging damage.  To fully exploit the
              optimized thin film structures, a basic understanding of the electrode is also
              necessary.    This two year proposal seeks to systematically investigate the
              microstructure-electrical property dependence of paraelectric BaxS l-xTiO3, for
              megabyte DRAM applications.  The objectives of this work are fourfold: (A) to
              optimize a conductive oxide electrode for the deposition of the ferroelectfic
              films, (B) to quantify the role of stoichiometry, grain size, thickness, and
              residual stress in thin film ferroelectrics and optimize the electrical
              properties, (C) investigate the effect of adding donor dopants to BaxSrl-xTiO3
              with the goal of improving the electrical properties and (D) to fabricate
              superlattice structures of BaTiO3 and SrTiO3 and correlate the microstructural
              features with the electrical properties.  This work will be performed at UC-San
              Diego and the Institute of Physics in Ensenada, Mexico which have different but
              complementary facilities.  ***
