Abstract    :
              This project continues research in discrete and computational  geometry,
              developing new combinatorial ideas for the study of  algorithms in real
              algebraic geometry. The algorithm studied  include the existential theory of
              the reals, quantifier  elimination over real closed fields and constructing
              roadmaps of  arbitrary semi-algebraic sets.  An important development comes 
              from considering the situation in which these problems live on an  algebraic
              variety of dimension lower than the dimension of the  ambient space.  In this
              situation it has been possible to find  algorithms and structural bounds for
              which the combinatorial  complexity depends on the dimension of the variety
              rather than on  the dimension of the ambient space.    These ideas will be used
              to:    (1) Develop more efficient algorithms to compute a semi-       
              algebraic description of the connected components of a semi-        algebraic
              set.      (2) Investigate the complexity of a Whitney stratification of a      
               semi-algebraic set.      (3) Develop more efficient algorithms to compute the
              real        dimension of a semi-algebraic set.      (4) Investigate other
              parameters of complexity such as the        input fewnomial bound (the number
              of input monomials) and        explore broadening the class of input functions
              to Pfaffian        functions.      (5) Remove the genericity hypotheses in the
              recent breakthrough        result of Sharir, which gives nearly sharp bounds on
              the        complexity of the lower envelope of a family of        hypersurfaces
              (or patches of such surfaces) in general        position.      (6) Investigate
              whether the classical zone theorem can be        further extended to bound the
              complexity of an algebraic        variety in the midst of a family of algebraic
              sets.    The solution of these problems would have significant impact on 
              problems in motion planning and computer algebra.
