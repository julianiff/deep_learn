Abstract    :
              9711266  Davidovits     The Atmospheric Chemistry Colloquium for Emerging Senior
              Scientists (ACCESS) was established as an institution aimed at recent or
              expectant Ph.D. recipients on the threshold of independent research careers in
              atmospheric chemistry. This will be the fourth in a series of Colloquia
              designed to introduce these young scientists and their thesis and/or post
              doctoral research to one another and to representatives of the major funding
              agencies involved in atmospheric chemistry and closely related topics. ACCESS
              IV will be held at Boston College June 12-14, 1997, immediately prior to the
              1997 Gordon Research Conference on Atmospheric Chemistry in Newport, RI. The
              colloquium attendants will participate in the Gordon conference.
