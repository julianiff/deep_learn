              Request for Conference Support  Principal investigator  Georges Belfort 
              Affiliation:                              Gordon Research Center      This
              grant is awarded through Separations and Purification Program sub-element of
              the International, Transport and Separations Program of the Chemical and
              Transport Systems Division.  The principal investigator is Georges Belfort. 
              The grant is to be used for travel  Support to the 1997 Gordon Conference on
              Membranes:    Materials and Processes.  This Gordon Conference will address the
              theme of membrane science and technology.    The conference is very pertinent
              to emerging areas of separations technology.  Membranes are very  important in
              chemical and biochemical separations and advances in membrane technology are
              expected  to lead to processes that will replace conventional chemical
              separation processes, e.g. distillation.  The interdisciplinary nature of the
              conference will allow cross-fertilization of ideas.  For example, the notion of
              using biomimetic principles for membrane design is an area that biochemists and
              chemical engineers can fruitfully collaborate in.  The conference will bring
              together academic and industrial participants, engineers and physical
              scientists, and a mix of mature researchers and new researchers including
              students.  The focus on discussions, an integral part of the Gordon Conference
              format will aid information dissemination and enhance the educational component
              of the conference.
