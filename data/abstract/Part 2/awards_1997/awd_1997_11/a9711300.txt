Abstract    :
              9711300  Bingham    This project is to investigate how ocean water 
              characteristics varied from year to year  during the WOCE Pacific field
              program.  This will be done  using a variety of existing  datasets, including
              repeat hydrography and other regional  hydrographic surveys.  The data  will be
              analyzed for spatial and temporal scales of water-  mass variability in the
              region.  The ultimate goal of the project is to help place the WOCE 
              observations into the context  of a highly variable region of the ocean.
