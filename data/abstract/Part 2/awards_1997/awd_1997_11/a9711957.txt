Abstract    :
              9711957  Filippelli      This project will determine the accumulation rate of P
              in  sediments from a variety of continental margins over  glacial/interglacial
              time scales.   Sites will include those  dominated by terrigenous versus marine
              accumulation, and  both open and restricted marine settings.  The goal is to 
              determine whether there are consistent patterns in P  accumulation, and assess
              the role of continental margins in  the global oceanic P budget.  ***
