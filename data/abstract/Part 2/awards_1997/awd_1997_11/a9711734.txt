              Jones and Rodger B. Dannenberg, Co-PI    This award provides funding to the
              Engineering Research Center at Carnegie Mellon University entitled "Data
              Storage Systems Center" to develop a CD-ROM tutorial on the design of data
              storage systems.  This tutorial will be an interactive, multimedia course on
              the fundamentals of magnetic and optical recording system design.  The tutorial
              will present an interdisciplinary, broad-based approach to data storage
              technology.  Material will be integrated in the tutorial from the chemical
              engineering, computer science, electrical and computer engineering, materials
              science, mechanical engineering, and physics disciplines.  The course will be
              designed in modules that will cover magnetic recording background, magnetic
              recording process, magnetic recording media, magnetic recording heads,
              head-media interface, magnetic recording electronic subsystems, optical
              recording background, optical recording systems, optical recording media,
              optical recording heads, optical recording electronic subsystems, and computer
              systems.  This material will be appropriate for senior level undergraduate or
              early-year graduate students.
