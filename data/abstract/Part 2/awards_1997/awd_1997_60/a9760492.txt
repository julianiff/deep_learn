Abstract    :
              ***   9760492  Wickman    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will develop a high-throughput automated system for catalyst testing. 
              Catalyst development is currently limited by the high labor costs in evaluating
              new catalysts.  With older, manual equipment, testing one catalyst could easily
              cost several thousand dollars.  Using microcomputer-controlled catalyst testing
              apparatus capable of continuous, unattended operation, cost can be reduced to
              several hundred dollars per catalyst.  The new concept of high-throughput
              catalyst testing may lower the unit cost of testing to less than ten dollars. 
              Phase I will develop a system for the simultaneous testing of an array of
              catalysts.  In Phase II will prepare and test a 10 by 10 array system of
              larger.    A high-throughput catalyst testing system is expected to find
              immediate application by catalyst manufacturers, major refineries, and other
              industries that use catalysts in manufacturing or processing.  ***
