Abstract    :
              ***  9760642  Reynolds            This Phase I Small Business Innovation
              Research project aims to develop a novel and highly versatile family of laser
              and NLO crystals that may overcome the limitations of conventional technology. 
              These materials are multifunctional and exhibit a number of unique properties
              that include, isolated sites for doping with rare-earth laser ions and
              transition metal laser ions, efficient nonlinear optical materials, high damage
              thresholds, wide transparency range, and function as a self-frequency doubling
              laser. In Phase I, the proposer will demonstrate feasibility by preparing small
              optical quality crystals and evaluate their optical properties.  The most
              promising of these materials will be optimized in Phase II, in preparation for
              Phase III commercialization. The need for new optical materials is clearly
              evident from the substantial amount of time and money being devoted to this
              research by industry and government agencies.  Although many materials have
              been developed for specific applications, emerging technologies require new
              optical materials with specific properties.  Essential to the growth of the
              photonics industry is the development of new laser materials and nonlinear
              optical (NLO) materials.  Specifically there is a need for laser systems that
              operate at blue and UV wavelengths, are wavelength tunable, more compact,
              rugged, with improved efficiencies over conventional technology.          The
              materials developed will be used in materials processing, optical memory
              storage, flat panel display technology, and medical applications such as eye
              surgery.  ***
