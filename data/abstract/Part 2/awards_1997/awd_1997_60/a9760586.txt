Abstract    :
              ***  9760586  Perlov          This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research
              project aims to develop a new approach to the growth process of and
              characterize as-grown single crystals of Pb(Znl/3Nb2/3)03-PbTiO3 (PZN-PT) and
              Po (Mg,/3Nb2/3) 03 -PbTiO3 (PMN-PT). These materials have unique properties
              that include very high longitudinal coupling coefficient (>90%), large
              dielectric constants (1000-5000), low dielectric loss (<0.01), and
              exceptionally high piezoelectric coefficients (d33 > 2000 pC/N). and (d33 >
              These exceptional properties have established PZN-as very attractive materials
              for low frequency acoustic transduction, ultrasonic biomedical imaging and
              actuation.  However, large single crystals of good quality are not available.  
                   Applications of PZN-PT and PMN-PT single crystals will include low
              frequency acoustic transduction (hydrophones, passive listening devises), ultra
              sound sensors for biomedical imaging and electromechanical actuators (laser
              optics, precision machinery and small motors).  ***
