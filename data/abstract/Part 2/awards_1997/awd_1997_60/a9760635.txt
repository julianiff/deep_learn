Abstract    :
              ***  970635  Donahue    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              will be directed toward the fabrication and performance evaluation of a new
              generation of oxygen anion conducting solid electrolytes.  The new materials
              based on oxygen deficient brownmillerite lattices are expected to have a near
              term potential for achieving high ionic conductivities at relatively lower
              temperatures. There are strong incentives to develop solid electrolytes for
              application in electrochemical cells and sensors.  The performance of these
              devices would be significantly enhanced by realizing higher ionic conductivity
              at lower temperatures than is currently realized in the yttria stabilized
              zirconia. It would, for example, enable fuel cell technology to be economically
              competitive by reducing the severe materials constraints on hardware due to the
              high operating temperatures of the current system.  Moderate temperature
              electrochemical devices based on such advanced solid electrolytes will only
              require relatively inexpensive stainless steel hardware components for their
              implementation.    Successful completion of this program will result in
              identifying a new generation of oxygen anion conducting solid electrolytes for
              application in intermediate temperature electrochemical devices.  ***
