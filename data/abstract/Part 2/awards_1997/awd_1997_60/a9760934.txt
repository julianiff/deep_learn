Abstract    :
                ***  9760934  Harvey    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project proposes a novel radiochemical sensor that combines extraction
              chromatography with an aqueous flow-cell radiation sensor. The sensor will
              allow for quantification of a radioactive isotope or group of radioactive
              isotopes in surface water, groundwater and drinking water at much lower levels
              for alpha- and/or beta-emitting radionuclides.  This increased sensitivity over
              conventional on-line sensors will greatly enhance the tools used by scientists
              and engineers for environmental monitoring    Monitoring of radioactivity is
              important in environmental science applications.  Traditional radiochemical
              techniques are time consuming and expensive. The sensor offers the possibility
              of near real-time quantification of radioactive contamination at a lower cost
              and higher sensitivity than currently available techniques. Monitoring of
              radioactive effluent from hospitals, research institutes and/or production
              facilities is just one potential application.  ***
