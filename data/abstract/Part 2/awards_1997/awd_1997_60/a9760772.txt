Abstract    :
              ***  9760772  Kittrell    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project is to establish the technical and economic feasibility of an
              Adsorption-Integrated-Reaction (AIR) technology, and provide a system to
              destroy volatile organic compounds (VOCS) in applications with high flow rates
              of air and dilute contaminant concentrations.  The research program will
              provide a new, multicomponent, zeolite-based photocatalytic adsorbent, shown to
              be much more active than traditional titania photocatalysts. It will consist of
              synthesis and evaluation of catalyst compositions, kinetic studies of
              destruction efficiency on representative classes of VOCS, and a comparative
              cost analysis of the resulting photocatalytic technology relative to other
              emissions control alternatives.  It is anticipated than an effective dilute
              phase pollution control concept will be developed, which will provide a
              cost-effective technology for destroying VOCs in high flow rate air with dilute
              VOC concentrations.    The commercial applications for the concept will be for
              control of air pollution (a) by destruction of air emissions of VOCs from soil
              and groundwater remediation, (b) from industrial emissions, and (c) for
              enhanced indoor air quality. The technology will reduce the costs of air
              pollution control, enhance environmental quality, and improve economic
              competitiveness.  ***
