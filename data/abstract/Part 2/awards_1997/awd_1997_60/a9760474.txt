Abstract    :
              9760474  Carlberg  This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will develop and utilize advanced transgenic genetic engineering
              methods to produce striped bass fingerlings with traits favorable production in
              culture systems common in the U.S.  Desired traits include accelerated growth
              and increased resistance to bacterial disease. Phase I will first introduce a
              marker gene (foreign genetic information that can be readily identified) and
              then introduce foreign genetic material that will confer upon fish the desired
              traits.  If this succeeds, Phase I will develop the required supporting culture
              and fish breeding technology to take advantage of fingerlings possessing the
              new traits.  Every major review of U.S. aquaculture describes the critical need
              for improved seed stock methodologies if this new industry is to expand.  The
              introduction of genes for expressing growth hormones and antimicrobial
              molecules in striped bass is a complex task, but the rewards could be
              significant.  Striped bass farming has exploded around the world, and although
              the primary markets are in the U.S., foreign products are easily delivered
              fresh anywhere in the country overnight.  Research on these methods is expected
              to buttress the industry against the rising global competition.
