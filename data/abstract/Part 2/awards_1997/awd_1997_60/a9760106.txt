Abstract    :
              ***  9760106  Bates    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will develop a new binder that will allow powder metal injection
              molding (MIM) of reactive metal parts.  Parts made of reactive metals such as
              titanium are already made extensively using powder metallurgy, but many
              valuable metals are so reactive at high temperature that currently available
              binders will react with and contaminate the part during MIM processing.  The
              new binder will be explored for the conditions of its formation as well as for
              its physical and debinding characteristics.  Binder properties, the
              binder/powder ratio, the mixing procedure, the injection molding process, and
              the debinding process will be explored experimentally to optimize the process
              using titanium as the reactive metal powder.  Molding and debinding will be
              demonstrated and the green strength of the parts measured.  Some sintering will
              be attempted to show the effectiveness of the process.    Potential commercial
              applications of reactive metal injection molding are expected in the powder
              metallurgy industry, leading to the availability of more complex reactive metal
              parts in the many applications where they have major advantages.  ***
