Abstract    :
              ***  9760568  Sherman         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              program will demonstrate the ability to fabricate a low cost titanium foam
              structural material.  The resulting syntactic foam will offer improved
              structural efficiency without the limitations of currently available honeycomb
              core sandwich structures by improving the properties (primarily shear) of the
              core material and the care/facesheet bond.  The primary objectives of the
              proposed program will be demonstrating improvements in structural efficiency
              and design flexibility that can be achieved using a titanium foam core sandwich
              panel, while, eliminating current sandwich panel design limitations.  Powdermet
              will demonstrate the fabrication of syntactic titanium foam with 50-80%
              microsphere loadings using metal encapsulated ceramic microspheres prepared
              using chemical vapor deposition and consolidated through either sintering or a
              modified OSPREY process.  The end result will be a low cost, high strength and
              structurally efficient syntactic titanium foam composite material.       Aside
              from the obvious airframe applications of sandwich panels (a
              multibillion-dollar market), commercial spinoffs in spacecraft, sporting
              equipment, robotics, medical implants, automobiles, and other critical
              stiffness-driven material applications, as well as other specialized markets
              including filters and noise suppression structures, represent tremendous
              commercial potential for a reliable foam core sandwich structure.  ***
