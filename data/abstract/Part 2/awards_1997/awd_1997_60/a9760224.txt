Abstract    :
                  ***  9760224  Dwyer    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project proposes to develop improved methods for the measurement of the
              molecular weight of synthetic polymers.   Size Exclusion Chromatography and
              Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry(MALDI-MS) will be
              combined in an automated sample preparation and data analysis system.    While
              MALDI-MS provides a direct measurement of molecular weight,  accurate
              determinations are obtained only with narrow dispersity polymers. 
              Chromatographic separation combined with MALDI-MS is effective for polydisperse
              samples.The proposed instrument utilizes established technology to
              concentrate/deposit chromatographically separated components onto a metal foil
              pre-coated with matrix. The deposit is probed by the MALDI-MS excitation laser,
              and spectra are collected, and processed to provide molecular weight
              distribution of the sample.  The resolving power of MS also enables structural
              and comonomer composition analysis.    Molecular weight measurements are
              predictors of polymer performance and are routinely carried out in 8,000
              laboratories worldwide. Interest in determining the molecular weight
              distribution of commercial polymers using the MALDI-MS technique is very high.
