Abstract    :
               Building on its innovation, ALOHA, a connection-free wireless communications
              technology, this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from ALOHA
              Networks, Inc. will investigate the technical feasibility of chip slotting in a
              general Spread ALOHA Multiple Access (SAMA) data network.  ALOHA Networks plans
              to (a) determine the practicality of transmitting chip clock phase information
              for the hub receiver in broadcast mode; (b) formulate algorithms for the use of
              this information by the remote terminal transmitters; and (c) provide a
              preliminary design of a SAMA hub receiver which can resolve overlapping chip
              slotted SAMA packets from multiple transmitters.  The benefits of a chip
              slotted SAMA network will be simplifying in a major way  the implementation of
              wideband connection-free multiple access channels while at the same time
              increasing the multiple access throughput of these channels.   The potential
              commercial applications of the improved performance characteristics of the
              ALOHA connection-free wireless data network which the project has as its
              objective will include wireless Internet access, wireless local loops, video
              answerback, and large scale wideband Very Small Aperture Terminals (VSAT)
              networks.
