Abstract    :
              ***   9760645  Chow    This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project utilizes bandgap-engineered photon detection for high performance
              ambient temperature thermal imaging for a variety of industrial applications
              such as nondestructive testing, quality control, and process optimization. 
              Although thermal detectors such as micro-bolometers have seen rapid progress in
              performance and cost reduction, they are limited by low detectivity, sluggish
              response time, and spectral non-specifivity.  Fast IR imaging is difficult to
              achieve.  Indium arsenic antimonide (InAs1-xSbx), grown by molecular beam
              epitaxy, , will be used as the basic photodiode material.  The design
              suppresses Auger noise to achieve much higher detectivity.  In similar material
              systems high detectivity has been found that is greater than commercial thermal
              detectors by an order of magnitude.  Phase I will emphasize material
              fabrication and feasibility demonstration of uncooled operation.  Phase II
              would optimize the device structure and fabricate two-dimensional imaging
              arrays.    Uncooled IR imaging arrays are expected to have commercial
              applications in nondestructive testing, medical diagnostics, industrial process
              control, navigation, and pollution monitoring. Reduced fabrication and
              operating costs may expand commercial markets significantly.  ***
