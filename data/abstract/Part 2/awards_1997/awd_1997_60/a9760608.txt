Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will exploit recent
              advancements in optimal algorithms for solving the Hamilton-Jacobi equations
              which arise imaging seismic data volumes used in oil and gas exploration and
              reservoir characterization.  Fast Marching Methods are recently developed
              numerical techniques for solving the Eikonal equation.  They compute the
              correct viscosity solution in O(N log N) time, where N is the total number of
              points in the computational domain.  As such, they are the fastest schemes
              available, and rely on a marriage of upwind finite difference operators for
              entropy-satisfying gradients, the theory of viscosity solutions to
              Hamilton-Jacobi equations, and fast sort algorithms.  The techniques are
              unconditionally stable and designed for large variations in velocity.  The goal
              of this Phase I project is to use Fast Marching Methods for computing first
              arrivals in analysis, as a key part of the migration and imaging algorithms,
              providing significant computational advancement over existing techniques.  The
              Phase II effort will involve the demonstration of the method on a full 3-D data
              volume, and the extension of the method to calculate multivalued travel times,
              most-energetic traveltimes, and traveltimes in anisotropic media.  Oil and gas
              reserves in areas of complex geological structure are costly to produce and
              therefore require sophisticated and detailed 3-D seismic imaging.  This project
              will have a direct and significant impact on the oil and gas industry by laying
              the groundwork for the development of a fast, accurate and easy to use imaging
              method that will meet the increasingly stringent demands at today's competitive
              exploration and production environment.
