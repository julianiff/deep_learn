Abstract    :
              ***   9760212  Somes    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will investigate a new robot architecture for high-performance force
              responsiveness.  Current robot utility is hampered by low ability to control
              environmental interaction forces.  Operations trivial for humans (turning a
              crank, snap assembly of components, polishing a surface) are beyond current
              robot capabilities.  The fault lies not in poor control of mechanisms, but in
              fundamental performance limitations imposed by the dynamics of mechanisms
              themselves.  A new cable drive transmission has demonstrated outstanding
              dynamic properties in a few select positioning applications, but it is unproved
              in force control tasks.  Its large envelope inhibits integration with many
              mechanical systems.  Phase I will evaluate the cable drive transmission for its
              capacity to produce high-performance, guaranteed stable force control.  Novel
              configurations will be studied employing the drive for their practical
              implementations in robotic manipulators.  The expected performance of the
              conceptual manipulators will be calculated and compared with existing robots. 
              Success in this research will apply towards single axis, torque-control
              mechanisms, with implications for multiple degree-of-freedom robots approaching
              human-level force control capability.    Commercial applications are expected
              in:  superior tensioning mechanisms in web processing applications;  automated
              finishing of fabricated parts, including grinding, deburring, polishing, and
              blending;  and automated assembly of closely fitting components.  Benefits are
              also expected in robots that can work in close proximity and provide assistance
              to human laborers, including the physically impaired.
