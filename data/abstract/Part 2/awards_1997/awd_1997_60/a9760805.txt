Abstract    :
              ***  9760805  Jones     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              will test the feasibility of using a novel Microwave/Electron Beam (EM) Gas Jet
              technique to prepare high stable efficiency microcrystalline silicon cells at
              high deposition rates.  These cells, with light absorbing microcrystalline
              layers, have been proposed as an alternative to amorphous silicon based cells
              because, in contrast to the amorphous cells, the efficiencies do not degrade
              with long term light exposure.  While microcrystalline cells with 11% stable
              efficiencies have been obtained, the technique used to prepare these cells
              requires unacceptably low deposition rates of 1-3 A/s for microcrystalline
              formation.  The proposed technique is unique in that it utilizes a microwave
              source, an electron beam and a Gas Jet that produces near supersonic gas
              speeds.  The microwaves efficiently decompose the silane gas to create high
              deposition rates and with large amounts of hydrogen dilution generate large
              atomic hydrogen fluxes that are important for microcrystalline formation.  The
              electron beam is required to stabilize the plasma while high gas speeds created
              by the Gas Jet minimize any detrimental gas phase interactions.  The proposer
              will demonstrate in this program that high quality microcrystalline silicon
              materials and solar cells can be prepared at high rates with this novel
              deposition technique.   The success of this program will ultimately lead to a
              wider use of Photovoltaic (PV) products thereby reducing the dependency on
              fossil fuel energy sources.  Development of a high deposition rate technique to
              prepare high quality microcrystalline silicon could also be applied in other
              industries such as thin film transistors, photodetectors, and photosensors.
