Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the control
              of S02 emissions to the from coal-fired power plants.  Since any economical
              reductions of the sulfur content of coal used by utilities is through blending
              of various coals, it proposes the development of a neutron-based on-line coal
              analyzer.  This analyzer will measure in real time the sulfur content of coal
              along with other important coal bulk parameters such as caloric value,
              moisture, density, volatile matter etc., that affect the efficiency of the
              power plant  The main features of the proposed analyzer which is based on
              pulsed fast/thermal neutrons are self-calibration independent of the coal seam,
              diminished radiation risk, and better accuracy in the determination of elements
              such as carbon, oxygen and sodium.  The proposed on-line coal analyzer is to be
              used by coal mines, coal preparation plants and coal-fired power plants
              worldwide  In the U.S., there exist nearly 900 of the above coal related
              facilities, and over 100 on-line analyzers have already been installed.  This
              research addresses the issues that the existing analyzers have problems with,
              and, in the beginning, it targets approximately 100 coal mines that have been
              identified as potential users of the pulsed neutron technology.  This award is
              supported by the Small Business Innovation Research Program and the
              Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).
