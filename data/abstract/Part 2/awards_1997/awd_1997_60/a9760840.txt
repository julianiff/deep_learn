Abstract    :
              ***  9760840  Leaskey    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will explore self-lubricating ceramics.  Silicon carbide (SiC) ceramic
              composites, containing two different lubricating phases, will be evaluated for
              current as well as potential new applications.  An innovative processing
              technique will be examined for:  (1) low cost processing; (2) attaining high
              densities without pressure-assisted sintering; (3) near-net-shape fabrication
              of parts to accurate dimensions; and (4) flexibility to tailor composition to
              specific applications.  Two different SiC-based systems with potentially
              self-lubricating properties will be investigated.  Characterization of
              composites will include evaluation of microstructure and measurement of
              strength and tribological properties.  Friction and wear screening will be
              performed by a major equipment manufacturer.  Phase II would pursue
              comprehensive testing of prototype diesel engine components in a single
              cylinder research engine.    Potential applications include high-temperature
              wear parts, such as machine tool components, bearings, chemical processing
              equipment including mechanical seals, and valve guides and seats.  ***
