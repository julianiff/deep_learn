Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Efficient Channel
              Coding, Inc. will evaluate the performance and feasibility of implementing a
              class of combined modulation and coding techniques called Turbo Product Codes
              Modulation (TPCM).  TPCM uses Turbo Product Codes (TPCs) and other
              soft-decision block codes as constituent codes applied to multiple levels in
              Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) formats.  For example, a TPCM system
              applied to 16-QAM offers 3.57 bits per symbol and requires an estimated 8.9 dB
              Eb/No to obtain a BER of 10E-10.  There are a wide variety of other TPCM
              formats that provide high rate and coding gain while emphasizing low
              complexity, enabling low-cost and high-speed implementations.  Constituent TPC
              devices are currently under development by Efficient Channel Coding. and will
              greatly accelerate the implementation of TPCM systems.  A flexible TPCM system
              is applicable to a large number of commercial and government digital
              communications systems that use bandwidth efficient QAM techniques.  Efficient
              Channel Coding is targeting TPCM insertion into the next generation Direct
              Broadcast Satellite and other future satellite communications systems as well
              as emerging terrestrial systems.  These terrestrial systems include Wireless
              Local Area Networks, Digital Radio, Digital Television, Local Multipoint
              Distribution Systems, cable modems, Digital Subscriber Links, and Video
              Blanking Interval data broadcasting.
