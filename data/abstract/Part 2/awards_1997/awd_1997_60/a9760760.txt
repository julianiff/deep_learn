Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project relates to the
              research of proton exchange membranes (PEM's).  The project proposes to develop
              a new class of PEM's based on polyphenylene polymers by exploring the
              structure/proton-conductivity relationship.  These new PEM's are designed to
              overcome problems encountered with conventional PEM's at temperatures
              above100(C, and are expected to have better performance at ambient temperatures
              at much lower cost.  Current PEM's require condensed water to attain useful
              conductivity at temperatures above the boiling point at which time the PEM
              dries out and conductivity drops drastically.  High temperature is preferred
              for optimal performance of state-of-the-art oxidation catalyst systems. 
              Recently, Maxdem has conducted some preliminary studies of polyphenylene PEM's
              and demonstrated the outstanding properties of these materials for proton
              conductivity.  The conductivity of some of these materials is much higher than
              Naflon membranes, even at high temperature.  Further investigation in
              structure/proton conductivity relationship is expected to provide PEM's for
              practical fuel cell applications with unmatched performance at lower costs. 
              The novel proposed electrolytes would allow major advances in fuel cells. 
              Lightweight, high energy density fuel cells are needed for powering electric
              vehicles and for man-portable applications.  Both defense and civilian
              applications present lager potential markets.
