Abstract    :
              ***  9760459  Geng    This Small Business Innovation Research (Sbir) Phase I
              project will explore a new means for rapid generation of three dimensional (3D)
              data for parts to be prototyped.  Although many rapid prototyped (RP) parts can
              be produced from CAD drawings, the capability of directly digitizing 3D
              physical objects is needed in certain RP applications, in which parts must be
              fabricated to fit irregular shapes of 3D objects, e.g., certain parts of human
              body or teeth.  Conventional methods of measuring complex 3D shapes are usually
              time-consuming, complicated, highly interactive, and require expert knowledge. 
              Thus, the time of a RP iteration cycle is driven by the digitizing of a 3D
              model and generating an adequate 3D data file.  Phase 1 SBIR will study a high
              speed 3D camera (that can acquire a full frame 3D image of an object at a rate
              of 30 frames per second) and an ultra-precision RP machine.  The high-speed 3D
              imaging technique will be combined with an ultra-precision droplet deposition
              ink jet RP technique for realistic dental office environments.  3D dental
              images will be acquired, and dental parts will be produced in real-time with
              sub-millimeter to micro-sized features.    Applications of this integrated RP
              concept include rapid dental treatment in the digital dental office.  By this
              technology a new generation of RP dental instruments is expected that can
              rapidly fabricate dental implants, caps, crowns,and bridges in a dentist's
              office.    ***
