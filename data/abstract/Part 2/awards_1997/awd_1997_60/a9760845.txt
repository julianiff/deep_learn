Abstract    :
              ***   9760845  Aye    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will develop a Micro-Optic Spectroscopic Imaging Sensor (MOSIS), based
              on a polarization sensitive diffractive micro-optic array.  MOSIS will be a
              miniature, compact, lightweight monolithic device capable of multi-spectral,
              polarimetric imaging in real time.  Phase I will microminiaturize a
              conventional spectrographic system using a refractive-diffractive micro-optic
              array, integrated with a high resolution charge-coupled-device (CCD) array to
              form a two-dimensional (2-D) imaging sensor.  Because of the focusing property
              of the refractive element and the high spectral dispersion of the diffractive
              elements, the device will perform high resolution (1-10 nanommeters)
              spectroscopic image detection in a broad visible-to-mid IR spectral range. 
              This MOSIS is a simple monolithic focal-plane array consisting of a stack of
              three basic elements: (1) a refractive microlens array; (2) a pair of conjugate
              birefringent diffractive optics arrays; and (3) a 2-D detector array, which can
              be a commercial CCD chip.  This approach can be applied to any desired bands of
              the optical spectrum without any limitations imposed by materials or
              fabrication processes as in the passive (holographic or multilayer) and active
              (acousto-optic or liquid crystal) filter-based devices.    Applications are
              expected in compact, low-cost, reliable, polarimetric imaging, multispectral
              sensor systems for remote sensing in ocean monitoring, environmental sensing,
              mineral identification, agricultural surveillance, biomedical and chemical
              spectroscopic imaging, and industrial inspection.  ***
