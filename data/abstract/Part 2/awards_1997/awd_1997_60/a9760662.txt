Abstract    :
              ***  9760662  Feldman    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project
              will develop a new liquid absorbent for a new absorption heat pump that is
              compact, environmentally clean and has the potential to be twice as efficient
              as current systems. The new absorbent is an organometallic "HySorb liquid" with
              a large heat of desorption and cooling produced when gas is desorbed from the
              liquid.  A small quantity of HySorb liquid has been synthesized, demonstrating
              the feasibility of reversible absorption/desorption of hydrogen gas
              refrigerant.  The proposed Phase I research would investigate the feasibility
              of a nonflammable nitrogen gas refrigerant by making a sample of the liquid and
              measuring its absorption capability and thermophysical properties. Methods for
              large scale manufacturing of the HySorb liquids will be initiated during Phase
              I and developed during Phase II.  It is anticipated that a family of HySorb
              liquids can be formulated to operate with nitrogen refrigerant for both
              compressor driven and heat driven heat pumps.    The environmentally clean
              HySorb technology will allow air conditioners, refrigerators, ice makers and
              heat pumps to be twice as efficient as current systems.  If this more efficient
              technology were fully implemented the energy saving would be approximately 11
              Quads or 14% of US energy consumption.   ***
