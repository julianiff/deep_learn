Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will assess the
              feasibility of long-term leak monitoring of water, gas, and petroleum
              pipelines.  The firm has designed and validated a portable acoustic leak
              detector which exceeds the performance of other devices which are limited to
              detection of acoustic leak signatures of 60 dB below the pipe noise level. 
              Alternative technology consists of vehicle-based surveying methods, registering
              emissions.  The new system is aimed at the challenging, unsolved problem of
              detecting leaks whose acoustic signatures are 90 dB below the noise level. 
              Pipeline sensors are placed up to 20 miles apart and data is analyzed remotely.
               The present proposal will develop sophisticated signal processing methods
              needed to detect small, emerging leaks automatically.  The firm is partnering
              with a well-established gas pipeline supplier.  A series of experiments
              performed on a 10-mile gas pipeline will establish the sensitivity of the
              technology and the parameters of monitoring.  Results will determine whether
              long-term, computerized small-leak monitoring of pipelines (gas, water, and
              petroleum alike) is feasible.    The concept has generated enthusiasm from the
              gas industry.  The Company projects a potential market of over $400 million,
              building on a portable-device water market of $100 million in which the firm is
              active.  This award is supported by the Small Business Innovation Research
              Program and the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research
              (EPSCoR).
