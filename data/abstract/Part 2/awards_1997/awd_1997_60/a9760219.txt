Abstract    :
              ***  9760219  Jue    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project addresses novel pressure sensors for deep sea applications. 
              State-of-the-art pressure sensors are either (1) piezoresistive, (2)
              capacitive, or (3) piezoelectric.  The first two classes require an energy
              source for signal generation, and piezo-type sensors require temperature
              compensation.  Further, the signal usually is linear over only a narrow range. 
              The new pressure sensor does not require an energy source, the signal is linear
              over a large pressure range, and it is temperature independent.  Although deep
              sea application is targeted here, a slight modification of the sensor can
              extend the operating temperature range up to 700(C.  These pressure sensors
              will be fabricated with and without an amplifier.  The sensor response will be
              characterized over a wide pressure and temperature range.  Feasibility of
              microfabrication and integration using photomicrolithography will be explored. 
              Direct mount pressure sensors for monitoring marine life is an objective of
              this research.    Potential commercial applications of the novel pressure
              sensors include pressure sensors for : (1) monitoring life in deep sea, (2) oil
              well logging, (3) aerospace industry, (4) automotive manufacture, (5) pressure
              vessels, (6) chemical industry, and (7) general industrial use.  ***
