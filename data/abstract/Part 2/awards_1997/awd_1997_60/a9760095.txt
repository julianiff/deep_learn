Abstract    :
              ***  9760095  Baker    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              proposes to develop an integrated software-hardware system, based on high end
              microprocessors working in parallel, and running a state-of-the-art, fully
              parallel quantum chemistry program.  It will offer supercomputer performance at
              a fraction of the cost. There is demand for a system, which would allow the
              accurate modeling of complex materials and chemical reactions, and would be
              affordable by a workgroup or a small department.  None of the currently
              available hardware-software combinations satisfy this requirement.  The system
              will run parallel implementations of the most important methods of ab initio
              quantum chemistry (including density functional methods), in particular
              geometry optimization.  It will be coupled to a commercial
              modeling/visualization program running on the same machine.    The proposed
              personal computer based software-hardware system should be of interest to
              chemical and pharmaceutical companies involved in drug and material design,
              university research departments and modeling groups, and will be affordable
              even by individual researchers and bench chemists.  ***
