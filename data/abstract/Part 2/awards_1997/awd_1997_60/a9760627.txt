Abstract    :
              ***  9760627  Samman    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              will conduct research on a novel laser-based device that will accurately
              measure surface roughness of drilled shaft boreholes.  Drilled shafts are
              foundation elements whose capacity is derived predominantly from the shear
              resistance developed at the rough interface between the shaft and the
              surrounding geomaterial.  Current design methods ignore roughness and instead
              are generally based on past experience and rules of thumb.  This ultimately
              leads to shaft designs that are perhaps overly conservative and expensive. 
              Over the last ten years, theoretical models have been developed to include
              roughness in all stages of the design process.  However, until shaft roughness
              can be measured accurately in situ, it is unlikely that these models will reach
              their potential, nor will the potential cost savings to society be realized. 
              In Phase I, the feasibility of the proposed device will be established by: (1)
              measuring the accuracy and establishing the limitations of laser range sensors,
              and (2) assessing the cost and challenges associated with developing a
              prototype device that ensures satisfactory field performance.    The annual US
              market for drilled shafts is estimated at $1 billion per year.  This research
              will ultimately lead to shaft designs that are conservative yet economical.  A
              moderate 20% reduction in shaft lengths would translate to a saving of some
              $150 million annually in the US alone.  Because of its strong potential, the
              Federal Highway Administration has expressed interest in providing
              supplementary funding and the International Association of Foundation Drilling
              has also indicated a willingness to support the research project.  ***
