Abstract    :
              ***   9760946  Roychoudhry    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              Project is aimed at developing a low temperature methane catalytic combustor
              for applications in power generation, air purification and emissions control. 
              In Phase I of this Project, PCI will develop an adherent high specific surface
              area coating for the, short channel length, high cell density (SCL-HCD) metal
              monolith elements, incorporate the catalytically active phase (of palladium) on
              the resulting high specific area substrate, and test the viability and
              efficiency of these catalyst systems for low temperature catalytic oxidation of
              methane.    This technology has potentially important applications for
              ultra-low NOx power generation.  Because of the economic penalties associated
              with NOx production, catalytic combustion is being increasingly recognized as a
              clean and efficient alternative to exhaust after treatment.  Based on previous
              PCI work in catalytic combustion applications, an SCL-HCD metal monolith based
              catalytic combustor could be appropriate for power generation across the full
              size, range, from very small mobile source applications (30 kW range) up
              through machines generating two hundred MW of power.  ***
