Abstract    :
              This is a Small Business Innovation Research Phase I proposal   We propose to
              develop instrumentation and techniques for the rapid and accurate
              quantification of nucleic acid concentrations.  We believe that our method
              could be used by many molecular biology labs for routine measurements of
              oligonucleotides, plasmids, total RNA, MRNA or genomic DNA.  The major
              component of this instrument is a detection module based on a very sensitive
              magnetic field sensor on a solid-state chip.  The amount of nucleic acid is
              determined by measuring the magnetic field generated by probes bound to the
              nucleic acid.  In Phase I studies we will improve our prototype and test the
              system with oligonucleotides, plasmids, total RNA, MRNA and/or genomic DNA. 
              Our goal will be to produce an instrument which can reliably detect one
              nanogram of nucleic acid in a one microliter volume.  We anticipate this
              instrument will be used in basic research to detect small amounts of nucleic
              acids.  We also hope to produce a portable device for the detection of
              biological agents in water supplies and food processing materials.
