Abstract    :
              ***   9760865  Jones    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will address contamination in environments surrounding sites of
              petroleum exploration, production, refinement, and storage.    Bioremediation
              techniques have been used to remove hazardous chemicals from the environment;
              however, monitoring these sites is hindered by expensive and time consuming
              techniques required to obtain necessary sensitivity and specificity.  For
              example, gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GCMS), capillary
              zone electrophoresis (CZE), or high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
              have been used to monitor environmental exposure, and various methods of
              microbial activity and biomass assays have been used to monitor remediation
              processes.  GCIMS, CZE, and HPLC require expensive instrumentation, extensive
              operator expertise, and laboratory analysis removed from the site of
              contamination.  Microbial activity or biomass assays are time consuming, and
              specificity for the microbe of interest is not reliable.  Phase I will explore
              a novel optical fiber sensor that has the potential for environmental
              monitoring in areas of petroleum activity and its in a chemical and biological
              sensing platform.    Biological and chemical sensors are expected to yield
              high-resolution, low-cost, multi-target systems for applications in 1)
              environmental monitoring, 2) drinking and wastewater monitoring, 3) large
              scale, high-speed testing in the medical field, 4) chemical analysis, and 5)
              intelligent monitoring of advanced materials processing.  ***
