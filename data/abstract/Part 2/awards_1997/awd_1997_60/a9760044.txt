Abstract    :
              ***  9760044  Steffan    This 6 month Phase I SBIR project involves the
              development of improved biocatalysts for destroying gasoline oxygenates such as
              methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl tert butyl ether (ETBE), and tert-amyl
              methyl ether (TAME).  Oxygenates such as MTBE have been added to gasoline in
              the United States since the late 1970@, to replace lead and other toxic
              components.  Currently, MTBE is second on the list of organic chemicals
              produced in the United States with greater than 24 billion pounds produced
              annually, and it has become one of the most common contaminants of urban
              groundwaters.  Recent concern over groundwater contamination has led some
              states to reduce their allowable maximum levels of MTBE in groundwater to <100
              ppb.    The few studies that have addressed MTBE biodegradation have met with
              very limited success, thereby leading to the conclusion that MTBE is
              recalcitrant to biodegradation.  Recent studies by Envirogen, however, have
              identified a class of microorganisms that can biodegrade MTBE, but can not use
              it as a growth substrate.  The goal of the proposed work is to use modern
              molecular biological techniques to exploit knowledge gathered to date to
              develop an organisms that can grow on MTBE as a sole source of carbon and
              energy.    The technology developed during this project will be applicable for
              destroying gasoline oxygenates in a variety of wastewaters including
              groundwater remediation and end-of-pipe treatment.  Initially, the technology
              will be deployed in contained bioreactors, and eventually, upon deomonstrating
              the safety of the biocatalysts, in situ.  More than 300,000 leaking gasoline
              storage tanks have been reported to regulatory agencies, and many of these
              sites contain MTBE-contaminated groundwater.  The lack of alternative
              remediation alternatives for MTBE makes the proposed work commercially
              significant.  ***
