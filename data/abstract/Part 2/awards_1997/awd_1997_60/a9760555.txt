Abstract    :
              ***  9760555  Zhou    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              proposes to develop a direct synthesis process for hydrogen peroxide from
              hydrogen and oxygen using a highly selective catalyst.   The current commercial
              process is complex and based on autoxidation of anthraquinone.  Many attempts
              have been made to replace  this process with a simple, direct synthesis. 
              However, none of the attempts have  been commercially feasible due to the low
              activity and selectivity or the operating limitations set forth by explosion
              limits.  The main objective in this Phase I is to develop a new generation
              phase-controlled Pd catalyst that will function below the lower explosion limit
              and will remain highly active and selective. A  capping polymer will be used to
              control the morphology of Pd on the catalyst, in order to expose the desired
              crystal phase.      The research will lead to a cost efficient process due to
              its simplicity:  no organic solvent, reduced purification cost,  and fewer
              processing steps.  A potential saving of 20 - 30 % over the current commercial
              process is anticipated.  The direct synthesis process has two potential niches:
              clinical applications due to its ultra-pure and organic-free product, and as 
              bleach in the pulp and paper industry due to its simplicity which makes on-site
              production viable.  ***
