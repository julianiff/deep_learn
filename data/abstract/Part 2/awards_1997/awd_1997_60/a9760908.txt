Abstract    :
              ***  9760908  Mikhael    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase
              Iwill explore a solvent-free, industrial scale manufacturing technique for
              photoconducting polymer composite films.  These polymer composites have
              potential for excellent thermal and chemical stability.  The proposed technique
              brings both the electron acceptor component and the electron donor component of
              the composite together in a solvent-free, homogeneous, fully cured polymeric
              structure.  The new technology allows molecular-level dispersion of the dopant
              molecules in a radiation cured polymeric structure.  The resulting ultra-thin,
              polymeric films are entirely solid and are expected to have superior
              photoconductive properties.  These environmentally safe materials are expected
              to perform better and serve longer than products prepared by spin-coating from
              organic solvents.    Photoconducting materials are employed in many
              technological applications, such as photodetection and electrostatic imaging. 
              Market opportunities of this technology include xerographic applications.
