Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the need for
              CO-tolerant anode electrocatalysts for proton exchange membrane fuel cells
              operating with reformate hydrogen.  Improving the tolerance to carbon monoxide
              will reduce the required loadings of noble metal catalyst and permit operation
              on reformed hydrocarbon fuels without requiring separation and purification of
              the hydrogen.  The proposed approach is a synergistic combination of two
              previous strategies that have proven successful in improving the efficiency and
              CO tolerance of anodic electrocatalysts.  Inherently active and poison-tolerant
              high surface area support materials will be used.  In addition, the supports
              will be modified to create highly disperse bifunctional sites.  Phase I
              involved a systematic study of three process variables used in preparing the
              supported catalyst materials.  The composition and microstructure of the
              materials will be analyzed.  Electrodes will be prepared for standard
              electrochemical measurements of activity.  In Phase II, electrode designs will
              be optimized and electrochemical measurements extended to evaluate full cell
              and stacked cell performance as a function of catalyst loading, temperature
              range and fuel composition.  Reducing catalyst costs will address a key
              obstacle hindering the commercialization of PEM fuel cells for vehicle
              propulsion and off-grid electric power generation.
