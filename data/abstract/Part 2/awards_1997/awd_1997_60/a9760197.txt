Abstract    :
              ***  9760197  Tomsic         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project will investigate a non-vapor deposition method to deposit YBCO that
              will provide c-axis texture on textured buffered metal substrates, similar to
              vapor deposition Processes.  This approach will provide an economical and
              practical way to develop 5-25 micron textured YBCO deposits with high
              superconductor to sheath ratios compared to vapor deposition processes.  This
              will enable higher engineering current densities for these high temperature
              superconductors.  The proposer will investigate various textured substrates,
              processing parameters for developing YBCO on long length conductors.  YBCO high
              temperature superconductors on textured metal samples has been demonstrated
              with current densities of 700,000 to 1,000,000 amps/cm2 at 77 K by various
              research organizations on short samples using static vapor deposition equipment
              on textured substrates.        The development of high temperature
              superconductors at 4-77 K, will enable the commercialization of HTSC motors,
              generators, fault current limiters, transformers, and  transmission cables.
