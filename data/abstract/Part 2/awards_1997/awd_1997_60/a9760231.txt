Abstract    :
              ***  9760231  Krishnan    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project will explore how the change in polarization state for light reflected
              by a surface might be employed as a tool for quantitative surface roughness,
              crack, and defect detection.  The approach is enabled by recent advances in
              four-detector polarimetry that provide high measurement rates, non-invasive
              measurement, and sensitivity to roughness, crack, and defect dimensions of
              0.1(m or less.  The use of physical optics effects facilitates operation in
              production facilities with minimal mechanical and thermal control requirements.
               The approach offers (i) simultaneous measurement of intrinsic (e.g., chemical
              composition) and extrinsic properties (roughness, crack and defect
              concentrations, presence of overlayers), via Mueller matrix ellipsometry (MME),
              and (ii) fast single point scanning of surfaces to map defects.  The Phase I
              effort will (i) expand the scientific database for MME on rough surfaces and
              correlation of measurements with surface properties, (ii) evaluate detection of
              defects less than 0.1 (m to several microns, (iii) determine viability of
              polarization measurements for surface inspection of jet engine turbine blades,
              and (iv) develop design and software/modeling approaches for automated on-line
              process monitoring and NDE.    Successful completion of the Phase I research
              would lead, in Phase II, to the demonstration of a prototype instrument for
              advanced non-invasive measurements in surface science, tribology, for quality
              control in manufacturing operations, and in the NDE of materials and
              structures.  ***
