Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore a
              sol-gel based process for fabrication of large homogeneous patterned
              transparent conductive coatings.  These coatings exhibit high transmittance in
              the visible spectrum, high reflectance in the IR region, and nearly metallic
              conductivity.  These coatings include non-stoichiometric and doped oxide films
              of tin, indium, cadmium, zinc, and their various alloys.  Uses of transparent
              conductors span electronic, electro-optical, and mechanical applications. 
              Phase I will integrate research in chemical synthesis, materials processing,
              and materials engineering to fabricate high quality, patterned transparent
              conductive coatings.  Further research will develop a proper deposition
              technique with chemicals and materials processing.  Potential commercial
              applications of transparent conductors are expected in electronic,
              electro-optical, and mechanical components, including transparent heating
              elements for electrodes for flat panel displays, windows, antistatic coatings,
              heat-reflecting mirrors, antireflection coatings, electrochromic display
              devices and solar cells, and touch screen sensors.
