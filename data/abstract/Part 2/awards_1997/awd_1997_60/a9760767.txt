Abstract    :
              ***  9760767  Pinnau    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              focuses on determining the feasibility of developing polyacetylene-based
              polymers with the selectivity and permeability of poly(l-trimethylsilyl- 1
              -propyne (PTMSP)  but with much improved solvent resistance.   Several
              substituted polyacetylene polymers have extraordinarily high fractional free
              volumes (25% or more), and cast films of these polymers contain a connected
              nanoporous network which leads to remarkable gas permeation properties. 
              Membranes made from these polymers have shown high permeabilities and very high
              selectivity in separating condensable-noncondensable gas mixtures.
              Unfortunately, the most selective and permeable of the polyacetylenes, PTMSP,
              is soluble in most hydrocarbon liquids. Consequently, the membrane must never
              contact any condensed vapor or entrained liquid droplets, a likely occurrence
              in industrial membrane systems. If stable membranes can be formed, a
              breakthrough in the separation of condensable C3-C5 hydrocarbons from nitrogen,
              hydrogen and methane would result.  This represents a large, economically
              important group of separations in the petrochemical, refinery, and natural gas
              processing industries.    The novel nanostructured polymer materials to be
              developed in this project can be used to form membranes for a wide range of
              separations such as natural gas treatment, hydrogen recovery in refineries,
              recovery of propylene and ethylene in polyolefin plants, and separation of 
              Volatile Organic Compounds from air and nitrogen in petrochemical plant vent
              gases.    ***
