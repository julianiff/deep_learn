Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a low
              cost Methanol Crossover Resistant - Membrane Electrode Assembly (MCR-MEA) for
              use in liquid feed Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFC). A chemically resistant,
              dimensionally stable, high temperature MEA will be produced.  This MEA will
              address serious problems preventing Next Generation Vehicle (NGV)
              commercialization, including: methanol crossover, excessive cost and ease of
              manufacture.  These new MCR-MEA based fuel cells will achieve a increase in
              power density. The development team includes experts in polymeric membranes,
              catalysis, MEAS, and fuel cell commercialization (LANL, IFC, GM and Ballard). 
              DMFC are attractive for defense and transportation (NGV) applications due to
              their lower weight and volume since they do not require any bulky fuel
              processing equipment.  DMFC have rapid start-up and load following capabilities
              and also avoid the hazards associated with handling gaseous hydrogen. 
              Commercial applications for DMFC fall into three broad categories: space and
              military, utilities and automotive.  Space and military applications include
              space based (e.g. Space Shuttle), surface ships, low power units (battery
              replacements) and portable/mobile field generating units.  Utility applications
              include communications, computers (laptop) and stationary power generation. 
              Automotive applications include automotive (NGV), bus, truck and railway power.
               The automotive (NGV) application itself represents an incredible market
              potential.
