Abstract    :
                ***  9760571  Nuzzio    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will develop a Deployable Voltammetric Analyzer (DVA), which would
              allow real time, profiling measurements of electroactive species in the water
              column.  The DVA can be moored in position to take timed data, or used in the
              analysis of sediments in oceans, bays, or harbors.  This instrument could be
              used to locate contaminated sediments in bays and harbors, including "hot
              spots" of copper, tin, lead paint from ships, and lead from discarded batteries
              off lighted buoys.  A moored DVA instrument can be used to monitor discharge
              compliance from manufacturing and electrical power plants (for copper or other
              metal contamination) or in monitoring the natural effluent from hydrothermal
              vents.  Commercial applications are expected in both oceanographic research and
              environmental monitoring.    ***
