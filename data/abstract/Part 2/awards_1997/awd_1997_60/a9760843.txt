Abstract    :
              ***  9760843  Jamison    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              is to develop a robust field emission electron source using diamond microtips
              as a replacement for standard hot filament cathodes.  The project will use
              nanocrystaline diamond microtips grown in a silicon mold to produce diamond
              field emission sources that are direct replacements for hot filament cathodes
              used in many scientific instruments.  Phase I of this project will test the
              applicability of diamond microtips for use as a cold field emission source of
              electrons to replace hot filaments in electron guns.  The concept will first be
              tested by replacing the hot filament cathode in an electron gun by the diamond
              microtip and obtaining preliminary operating parameters (e.g. maximum emission
              current, emission voltage, etc.) for the gun.  This information will then be
              used to design a direct replacement tip for hot filament electron guns. 
              Because diamond microtips have a very low effective work function, the Wehnelt
              power supply in most electron guns should serve as the extractor supply.    The
              anticipated benefits of simple field emission replacement for a hot filament
              electron gun are many, They range a high brightness "burn-out-proof", low
              energy spread electron gun for scientific applications, to robust, smaller spot
              size electron guns for high resolution TV tubes.  ***
