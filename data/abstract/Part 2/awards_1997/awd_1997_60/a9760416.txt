Abstract    :
              ***  9760416  Yang    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              focuses on developing self-lubricating materials.  In certain applications
              involving high temperatures and vacuum environments, liquid lubricants cannot
              be used effectively and reliably.  Self-lubricating materials can provide an
              alternative lubrication method for these applications.  This program seeks to
              develop composites with microstructure in nanometer scale.  It is expected that
              nano-composites will feature friction coefficients low enough to be
              commercially significant.  Other anticipated benefits of the proposed material
              include superior wear resistance, hardness, corrosion resistance, and low
              density. During Phase 1, research will be conducted to demonstrate the
              proof-of-concept that nano-composites with significantly lower friction
              coefficient can be synthesized.  Phase II will develop, optimize and field test
              nano-composites.  Phase III will commercialize the technology.   
              Self-lubricating materials are very attractive for applications that require
              high temperatures and low pressure environments.  Potential applications
              include advanced gas turbines, space vehicles, satellite launch seals, high
              performance aircraft, and uncooled engines for automobiles.  Self-lubricating
              nano-composites would enhance energy efficiencies, extend life, improve system
              reliability and reduce environmental impact.  ***
