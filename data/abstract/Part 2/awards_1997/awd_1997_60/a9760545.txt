Abstract    :
                        ***            9760545            Smith    This Small Business
              Innovation Research Phase I Project will demonstrate feasibility of a new high
              energy x-ray target technology allowing linear accelerator sources to operate
              at twice the brightness of current sources.  By incorporating an innovative
              approach to removing heat, the target can handle the increased power load with
              no increase in the peak temperatures which limit the target performance.  The
              increase in brightness will increase throughput and/or improve image resolution
              for computed tomography (CT) systems.  The objective for Phase I is to
              demonstrate, on thin targets, that the bond between the target and the cooling
              substrate can withstand the repeated thermal transients generated when the
              target absorbs energy from intense electron pulses.  Successful demonstration
              of the bond strength will lead to a Phase II extension of this technique to the
              thick targets required for commercial high energies.  The enhanced performance
              of CT systems will accelerate the acceptance of CT as an important component of
              the rapidly growing agile-manufacturing and rapid-prototyping industries. 
              Additional applications are anticipated in the medical and industrial imaging
              industries.            ***
