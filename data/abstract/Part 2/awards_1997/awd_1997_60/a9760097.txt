Abstract    :
              ***  9760097  Biter    This small Business Innovation Research Phase I will
              fabricate a new sensor consisting of a composite magnetoelectric material
              fabricated as a wire.  This research builds on previous work on a composite
              laminar magnetoelectric material that uses a novel method of measuring applied
              stress.      Existing sensors all have limitations for measuring applied forces
              over an extended area.  Most only respond to pressure and are not sensitive to
              side forces (slip, friction).  Others am expensive or incompatible with matrix
              addressing, making a large array of sensors difficult and expensive.    The
              objectives of this Phase I research project are to design and fabricate an
              advanced composite material in the form of a small diameter (.020") wire coated
              with a magnetoclectric layer.  A sensor element is defined by the intersection
              with a second wire.  The low cost and small size will allow fabrication of a
              large dense array of sensing elements.

              measure shear or slip forces and can be configured to closely match the
              response of the human hand.    There is a significant commercial application
              for the composite wire as a sensor but the magnetoelectric element itself
              appears to have a much larger potential market.  It can be adapted to any
              pressure sensing application that benefits by arrays.  This includes 2-D sonar
              imaging, ultrasonic imagers for medical and non-destructive testing and even a
              flat panel display.  ***
