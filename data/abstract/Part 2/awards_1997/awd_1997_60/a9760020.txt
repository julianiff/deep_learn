Abstract    :
              ***  9760020  Weber         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project will determine the feasibility of an inexpensive process to manufacture
              new materials in the form of continuous glass fibers with well controlled
              chemical composition and dimensions.  The process is based on the ability to
              create and maintain liquids in an undercooled, non-equilibrium state at
              temperatures below the normal melting point.  The viscosity of the liquid
              increases in the undercooled state, allowing new glass fibers to be formed from
              materials that normally do not support fiber pulling operations.  Extremely
              large cooling rates occur in the fiber-drawing process, allowing glass
              formation from melts that would crystallize at slower cooling rates.  The
              proposer has performed research that employed containerless processing to
              synthesize short fibers from undercooled melts, determine the temperature and
              process conditions for several materials, and show theoretical feasibility of
              the proposed method of fiber synthesis, which is amenable to fiber manufacture.
                    The proposed Phase I research is to experimentally demonstrate this
              process and its applicability to manufacture new glass fibers with optical,
              fiber-laser, structural and other applications.  Successful completion of the
              proposed work will enable the synthesis of prototype quantities of fibers
              needed for commercial applications R&D in Phases II and III.  ***
