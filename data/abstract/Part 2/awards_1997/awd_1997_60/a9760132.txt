Abstract    :
                ***  9760132  Owens    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will test a system for simultaneous application of pressure and
              microwave heating to curable wood assemblies.  Conventional curing processes
              apply heat by means of heated platens, which are in contact with the surface of
              the product.  Curing of the interior regions is slow since wood is a poor
              thermal conductor.  If platen temperatures are increased beyond a certain
              amount to increase heating of interior regions, scorching and over-curing of
              the product surface can occur.  Microwave energy affords much more uniform
              volumetric heating and curing, since it is directly and instantly converted to
              heat throughout a volume, even in the otherwise hard-to-heat interior regions
              of a product.  The additional uniform heating power afforded by microwaves will
              likely increase production rates substantially and produce more even cures for
              greater product strength and improved quality.    Potential commercial
              application are expected in the engineered wood industry, where numerous
              composite products are manufactured with heat-accelerated adhesives.  These
              products include particle board, fiberboard, waferboard, plywood, laminated
              veneer lumber, oriented strand lumber, and laminated beams  ***
