Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Seamless Solutions,
              Inc. uses virtual reality representations of a signer's head, facial
              expressions, and mouth to augment verbal and/or American Sign Language (ASL)
              communication, and it provides a means to animate these models using commands
              which can be transmitted over inexpensive, low bandwidth channels.  The
              objective of this project is to build on Seamless Solutions' current research
              and development in the long distance communication of sign language by virtual
              human representations or avatars.  Specifically, the project will explore the
              feasibility of using low-cost computer generated facial animations 1) to
              express emotion, 2) to enable lip reading, and 3) to augment signing with head
              movements that add emphasis to communication.  This technology will not only
              provide low cost, long-distance sign language communication, but will also
              supply more natural and rapid interaction between humans and computer
              applications.  Among those who will benefit form this research are the more
              than 500,000 hearing disabled Americans who are currently excluded from
              communicating in their most expressive idiom over long distance communications
              systems.  Moreover, the same technologies that will enhance visual
              communication for the deaf can also add expression to communications for
              persons with unimpaired hearing.  Facial animations can be licensed to
              education, communications, and entertainment software developers (including
              developers of games, PC-based software, digital TV, and videophones).  Such
              licensing would result in avatar use in 1) educational multimedia software; 2)
              computer games; 3) television programs; and 4) interact communications, where
              sound is utilized today.  When coupled with emerging technologies in voice
              recognition, natural language processing, and facial expression recognition,
              the avatars can be added to existing media without the cost of independently
              authoring their behavior.
