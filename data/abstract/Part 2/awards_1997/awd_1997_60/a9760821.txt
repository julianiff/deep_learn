Abstract    :
                ***  9760821  Vujkovic-Cvijin    This Small Business Innovation Research
              (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a mid-infrared (2-5.5 micron) diode-based
              laser source for atmospheric spectroscopy and remote sensing, which operates
              without cryogenic cooling.  The instrument is based on the frequency conversion
              of near infrared radiation of III-V diode lasers further in the infrared.  A
              novel approach to increase the output power is described.  In Phase I the
              instrument will be tested with increased frequency conversion.  During Phase II
              an optimized source would be built, and a working prototype prepared for
              production.  The miniature, narrowband laser source operating at room
              temperature in the mid-infrared region will be used a primarily as the
              radiation source for optical trace gas sensors.  Sensors based on this source
              will be commercially applicable in medical diagnostics, industrial process
              control, and environmental monitoring.  ***
