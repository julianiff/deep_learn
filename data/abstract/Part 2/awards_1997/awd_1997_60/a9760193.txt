Abstract    :
              9760193   Lin    Applied Optoelectronics will develop mid infra-red (3-5
              microns)  semiconductor lasers, capable of operating at temperatures greater
              than 220K, with pulse lengths greater than 10  microseconds, and at average
              output powers exceeding 10 mW.  Type II quantum well lasers will be grown on
              GaAs universal substrates, allowing epitaxial side-down mounting, and using 980
              nm InGaAs diode laser arrays as a pump source.  Commercial applications for
              this technology include in-situ process control, remote chemical sensing, IR
              spectroscopy and glucose analysis.
