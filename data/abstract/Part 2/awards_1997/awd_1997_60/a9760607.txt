Abstract    :
              ***   9760607  Smith    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will explore linear arrays of amorphous silicon (a-Si) thin-film
              transistor (TFT)-photodiodes to achieve a large cost reduction and an increase
              in throughput and spatial resolution for computed tomographic (CT) systems. 
              These systems are targeted to the agile manufacturing and rapid prototyping
              markets.  A technique for compensation of the photocurrent persistence
              characteristic of a-Si will be examined, and a detector and data-acquisition
              system based will be developed for this technology.    Successfully
              implemented, a-Si detectors will improve both the price and performance of CT
              systems used for dimensioning of production parts and for reverse engineering
              of parts lacking digital descriptions.  These improvements in price and
              performance will accelerate the introduction of CT as an important tool for
              these rapidly evolving technologies.  ***
