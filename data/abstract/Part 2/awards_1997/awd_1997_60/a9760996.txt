Abstract    :
              ***9760996  Trantolo          This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research
              project aims to develop, fabricate, and test a holographic memory for mass
              information storage using the photodynamic protein, bacteriorhodopsin (bR) as
              the recording medium.  The ultimate configuration is a page-oriented system
              with reasonable access times technology and long holographic lifetimes. 
              Although bR has shown potential as a holographic material, its use has been
              limited by the short lifetime of the hologram.  If the advantages of a bR
              system could be coupled to longer holographic lifetimes and capacities, then
              technology for large data storage and rapid information retrieval could be
              realized in a system more compact than current CD-ROM technology.  In this
              Phase I project, the proposer will investigate the feasibility of increasing bR
              holographic capability by coupling bR to a liquid crystal (LC) system which
              offers increased birefringence in the writing of the hologram.  Given that a
              key issue is the magnitude of the real component of the refractive index,
              increasing the birefringence may be a useful approach.  In writing the
              hologram, the LC's go from isotropic to an ordered dispersion, a property which
              can be linked to those of bR to improve holographic lifetime.  Thus, if Phase I
              can demonstrate an improved bR holographic, the Phase II development workscope
              will address dense memory storage via a compact, yet thick, material.      
              This research addresses the development of new and innovative techniques for
              large data storage media with rapid retrieval capability.  As such there are
              many applications in the commercial world.  It could conceivably replace the
              CD-ROM currently in use with smaller size, large capacity, more rapidly
              accessible, bulk storage devices.  The use of such devices throughout the
              computer environment is widespread.  ***
