Abstract    :
              ***  9760425  Hood  Cornerstone Research Inc. will develop a dynamic latching
              add-drop multiplexer for use in reconfigurable dense wavelength division
              multiplexing optical communications networks.  The device is designed to tap an
              optical fiber carrying several communication channels, and is dynamic because
              any channel can be electronically selected.  Furthermore, the device has a
              latching capability because no electric field is required to maintain the
              optical configuration of the device once it is set.  These performance
              capabilities are made possible by a newly developed class of electrooptic
              material.  ***
