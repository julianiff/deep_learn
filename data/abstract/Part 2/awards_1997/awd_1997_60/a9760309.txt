Abstract    :
              ***  9760309  Scaringe    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project will evaluate the effectiveness of non-porous polystyrene beads
              derivatized with branched linkers to yield a high loaded support to be used in
              conjunction with an efficient RNA synthesis chemistry.  This support will
              enable (1) large scale RNA syntheses and (2) syntheses of RNA up to 120
              bases.The company is successfully developing an RNA chemistry in which each
              nucleotide couples in less than 90 seconds with yields in excess of 99%.
              36-Nucleotide RNA oligonucleotides are functional sites on the external and
              internal surfaces of porous polystyrene beads.  Unfortunately, the pores
              constrain the amount and length of RNA that can be synthesized.  Large
              syntheses and long sequences are unfeasible with this chemistry on porous
              support. Development of  a suitable non-porous bead is proposed.. 
              Oligonucleotides would grow out into solution without limitations of length. 
              Branched linkers would multiply functional surface sites for large syntheses. 
              These supports will be evaluated with  the existing  RNA chemistry to
              synthesize larger scales and longer sequences.    Project success will satisfy
              research and pharmaceutical market needs for large scale RNA syntheses and
              routine synthesis of RNA less than or equivalent to 120 bases long. These more
              powerful RNA synthesis capabilities will help the biotechnology and health care
              industries in investigating RNA-based therapeutics.  ***
