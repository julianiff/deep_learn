Abstract    :
              ***  9760229  Facello    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              will explore a novel approach to automatic quality surface and volume mesh
              generation for 3D models.  The software to be developed will be a critical
              extension to the firm's Wrap that reconstructs surfaces and solids from
              arbitrary 3D point data, providing the ability to automatically produce quality
              surface and volume meshes directly from the output of 3D scanners.  Currently,
              mesh generation is often a separate package apart from the modeling software,
              and the creation of a finite element analysis (FEA) model is a time consuming
              process requiring a tedious translation of the computer assisted design (CAD)
              model into an FEA model or the construction of a new, duplicate model in the
              FEA environment.  The inability to automatically generate meshes with
              guaranteed local quality has hampered the numerical methods used to analyze
              complicated geometric shapes.    The software module, if successfully
              implemented and combined with Wrap, will solve one of the most difficult
              problems in mesh generation.  The integration of surface reconstruction and
              mesh improvement provides a compact solution that will enable both important
              time savings and ease of use from the total integration and automation of
              modeling and mesh generation for reverse engineering problems.  ***
