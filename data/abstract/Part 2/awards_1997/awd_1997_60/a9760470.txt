Abstract    :
              ***  9760470  Dean    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will explore spraying metal and composite particles at room temperature
              and at velocities of 200-300 meters per second to coat substrates.  Current
              thermal-spray coatings exhibit important limitations; especially, porosity,
              inadequate adhesion, non-uniform properties, and low deposition efficiency. 
              The high temperature of thermal spray precludes the inclusion of desirable
              fibers, e.g., graphite.  The current innovation (Cold-Spray) will utilize
              proprietary activation solutions to enable metallurgical bonding of particles
              to occur on impact.  Because of its low operating temperature, Cold-Spray will
              allow metal matrices to be strengthened with thermally sensitive
              reinforcements, e.g., graphite fibers in titanium.  No thermal damage to the
              deposit or substrate results.  Phase I will focus on the feasibility of cold
              bonding metal and composite powders by spray impact into high-density,
              high-strength, and strongly adhering coatings on metal substrates.  A prototype
              Cold-Spray system will be built and tested.  Phase II will demonstrate forming
              free-standing, function-gradient composite components using Cold-Spray.   
              Potential commercial applications are expected in the fabrication of composite
              structures and components for aerospace, defense, and industry.  Cold-Spray
              forming of parts from CAD files will be a flexible and lower cost process than
              current methods for their production.  ***
