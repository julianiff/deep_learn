Abstract    :
              ***  9760684  Vickery    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              will use a large scale, validated hurricane simulation technique, coupled with
              existing storm surge models to develop the first risk consistent modeling of
              the combined action of direct wind and storm surge produced by hurricanes.  The
              storm surge analysis and resulting flood maps produced by the Federal Emergency
              Management Agency (FEMA) were not developed in a statistically rigorous manner,
              and thus the true return periods associated with the 100 year storm surge is,
              in fact, not known.  To assess the risk of storm damage to structures, the
              combined action of wind and storm surge must be treated as they are inherently
              coupled, and damage in many cases is produced by a combination of the two storm
              perils.  The simulation approach simultaneously determines wind speeds and
              storm surge levels, using an extensively validated hurricane wind field
              yielding the first consistent wind/surge design criteria thus allowing the
              annual joint probability distribution of wind speed and storm surge to be
              determined.    A primary commercial application for this research includes a
              new risk consistent approach for insurance companies to assess their true total
              risk.  The new approach may yield further business opportunities for insurance
              companies in many cases, relieving the Federal Government of some of its risk. 
              Other potential applications include the utility industry, which with this
              research will be able to produce more cost effective transmission and
              distribution system designs in coastal areas.  ***
