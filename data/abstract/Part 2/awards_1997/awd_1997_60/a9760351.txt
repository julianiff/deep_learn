Abstract    :
              ***  9760351  Dean    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              will prove the feasibility of smart, responsive-gel actuators for
              variable-volume sockets.  The comfort, walking efficiency and security of
              lower-limb prostheses are related directly to the fit of the socket.  Yet, a
              consistent, precision socket fit is often not achieved because of natural
              fluctuations in the volume of an amputee's residual limb.  Chronic discomfort
              and an expensive, often endless search for a comfortable prosthesis result.   
              To correct this basic defect, we will innovate a Smart Variable-Volume Socket
              (SVVS) whose main feature will be intrasocket, responsive-gel-filled actuators
              whose volume can be varied electrically.  Associated pressure sensors will
              provide feedback to an on-board controller.  The socket will sense and
              automatically compensate for volume variations of the residual limb.  It  will
              create a consistently precise fit which should lower the need for and cost of
              rehabilitation and improve greatly the quality of life of amputees.  The smart
              gel actuator also has important applications for orthoses and splints.   
              Widespread utilization of the SVVS concept is expected among the 220,000 U.S.
              lower-limb amputees.  A worldwide business of tens of millions of dollars
              should develop.  Savings of over $100 million/year in U.S. rehabilitation cost
              are projected.  ***
