Abstract    :
              ***   9760296  Taylor    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will explore a novel electrochemical process for final surface
              finishing of superalloys.  Non-traditional machining technologies, such as
              electrochemical machining (ECM) and electric discharge machining (EDM) ,
              provide near net shape machining of these and other difficult to machine
              materials or for applications with complex shapes, such as dies, molds, and
              aircraft parts.  However, after ECM or EDM processes, time-consuming
              robotically controlled precision or manual polishing is required to do the
              final surface finish.  Phase I will demonstrate a modulated reverse electric
              field process for final surface finishing.  A model tool and die geometry, made
              from a commercially important superalloy, will be utilized to study
              electrochemical parameters critical to the quality of a finished surface.  The
              electrochemical process is expected to achieve a surface finish less than 20
              microns.    Final finishing processes account for at least 25% of total
              processing time and in the case of manual finishing are operator specific. 
              This novel process will find applications aerospace, automotive, die casting,
              and hot forging industries.  ***
