Abstract    :
                         ***              9760706              Oder    This Small Business
              Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the dry magnetic separation of
              magnetically similar particles with otherwise dissimilar surface
              characteristics. Separation of unburned carbon from pulverized-coal combustion
              fly ash will be used as an example.  A novel laboratory scale continuous
              separator will be built to establish the proof-of-concept of using surface
              properties to enhance selectivity in the dry magnetic separation of micron
              sized particles. Separation and concentration of carbonaceous particles found
              in micron-sized pulverized-coal combustion fly ash  will be evaluated. The
              quantity and quality of low carbon fly ash which can be prepared by the method
              will be determined.  Phase I will include testing of fly ash from power plants
              with and without low NO burners, and a conceptual evaluation to assess the
              feasibility, costs and benefits for the novel method.  A nominal 200 to 1000
              pounds per hour pilot unit is planned for Phase II.    The market for carbon
              removal is being driven by low NO burners which result in high carbon levels in
              the fly ash.  Use of the magnetic-based technology will minimize fly ash
              disposal costs and maximize returns for sales of the by-product..  The
              estimated total market for fly ash equipment sales is $155,000,000.
