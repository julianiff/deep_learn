Abstract    :
              ***  9760588  Suen    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is
              for the advanced development of an automated nondestructive evaluation (NDE)
              system for pavement (i.e. roads, highways and airfields) surface condition
              assessment.  An early version of this system has been developed at Illinois
              Institute of Technology which is based on the Shadow Moire technique and
              utilizes advanced video image processing equipment and related technologies to
              produce objective, machine-readable information concerning out-of-plane
              pavement surface distress.  The primary data is acquired by means of optical
              and video equipment mounted in a special vehicle which travels at normal
              highway speeds.  The cost of the entire system, exclusive of the vehicle, is
              expected to be $60,000 or less when the system has been completely developed
              and engineered.    If successful, the project will provide an affordable,
              automated NDE system for infrastructure (pavement) condition assessment for use
              by the Federal, state, local and private pavement agencies.  Sensing will be
              done automatically at highway speeds (55 mph).  ***
