Abstract    :
              ***  9760945  Meehan          This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project will use NSF-sponsored research on SnGe films to develop of an infrared
              two-dimensional SnxGel-x photoconductive array on Si substrates.  The direct
              bandgap of the SnxGel-x (O<x<0.15) varies from 0.8eV to 0.25eV. There is a
              potential of covering a wavelength range extending beyond 4@m into the
              far-infrared region with increasing Sn concentrations.  The goal of the
              proposed Phase I project will be to demonstrate that high quality, 4x4
              photoconductive arrays can be fabricated using p-type SnxGel-x films
              (x=0.15)grown on Si substrates. Material issues will be addressed including
              characterization of defects, exploration of the bandgap versus composition, and
              the development of n-type material.  Ohmic and Schoftky contacts the SnGe films
              will be developed as well as electrical and optical isolation techniques. 
              Characterization of the devices will include responsivity as a function of
              wavelength and temperature, S/N ratio, and the high speed response time. 
              Processes will be developed that will enable the development of larger arrays
              integrated with Si circuitry" in Phase II.       Applications requiring a
              stable, low cost, mid-IR detector include threshold sensing and quantitative
              measurements such as fire detection, night vision, thermal imaging and optical
              chemical spectroscopy.  ***
