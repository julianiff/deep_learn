Abstract    :
              ***  9760501  Deliwala    There is a growing appreciation among biologists for
              high-resolution microscopy that can rapidly image three-dimensional biological
              samples of living tissue in real time without the need to slice the sample into
              thin cross-sectional sections.  Science Research Laboratory proposes to develop
              a new method of optical microscopy, coherent nonlinear microscopy (CONM), that
              is based on sample illumination by a series of femtosecond laser pulses.  CONM
              combines high resolution (better than 80 nm) with rapid three-dimensional
              imaging and no requirement for oil or water immersion.  The capability to
              rapidly produce a high-resolution nonlinear image represents a major
              improvement over both scanning confocal microscopy and the scanning
              interference microscope.  Phase I will demonstrate the soundness of the new
              microscopy concept, while Phase 11 will be a proof of principle that will be
              based on a working laboratory prototype.    With its capability to perform
              real-time, high-resolution imaging, an instrument based on coherent nonlinear
              microscopy will find numerous applications in the three-dimensional biological
              imaging of living tissue, such as genes and neurons, thereby providing a new
              technique that will enhance genetic mapping and allow cell structure to be
              monitored in real time.  Additional commercial applications include the rapid
              measurement of critical dimensions of microlithographic wafers and mask
              inspection for lithography.  ***
