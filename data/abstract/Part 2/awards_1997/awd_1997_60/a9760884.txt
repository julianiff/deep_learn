Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Knowledge
              Revolution proposes to build on the successful, award winning, modeling and
              simulation products, Interactive Physics and Working Model 3D, products that
              enable students to participate in scientific inquiries and practice.  Knowledge
              Revolution proposes to develop The Physics Collaboratory, an unprecedented
              Web-based product that will transform distributed, 3D environments from simple
              `walkthrough` spaces to worlds constrained by the principles of kinematics and
              dynamics.  Guided by research findings from two nationally prominent research
              studies, the firm will fuse Knowledge Revolution's advanced 3D motion
              simulation engine with the Web and surround this prototype environment with a
              set of Web-based, collaboration tools.  The firm will develop a set of sample
              activities for the prototype that foster active learning through social
              interaction.  When made available commercially, such an environment could bring
              authentic forms of science practice to schools on a sufficiently large scale to
              significantly influence the ways in which teachers and students learn and do
              physics.   Knowledge Revolution estimates 60 to 70 percent penetration of the
              K-12 physics market with Interactive Physics and 40 percent of Mechanical
              Engineering departments in four-year colleges with Working Model 3D products. 
              Knowledge Revolution is experiencing continuing success and presence in the
              physics and engineering education markets:  the firm is well-positioned to
              bring The Physics Collaboratory to market.
