Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Software
              Engineering, Inc. will investigate applicability and refinement of program
              analysis tools to domain-specific business rule extraction.  A business rule is
              a declarative description of how an entity of a company's business process is
              defined.  A program slice with respect to a variable reference consists of all
              program statements that potentially affect the value of the variable at that
              reference.  Slicing has obvious relevance to business rule extraction, but
              requires refinement and elaboration if it is to be incorporated into a
              reengineering environment that interactively assists an analyst identifying
              business rules.  Slices are often too large and too inaccurate.  This project
              will explore methods to restrict slices based on domain knowledge expressed as
              domain-specific typing rules and will filter slices based on syntactic and
              semantic constraints specified by the analyst.  The modern computer environment
              of client-server architectures, internet and intranet capabilities, component
              support for enterprise-wide computing, and platform-independent systems afford
              a significant competitive advantage to the companies that exploit these
              capabilities.  Technology derived from this investigation can assist in this
              reengineering task.
