Abstract    :
                ***   9760791  Certain    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase
              I project will investigate methods for human body modeling and automatic
              extraction of body measurements from body scans.  The goal of the research is
              to devise algorithms that are capable of merging and interpreting multiple
              range images capturing the body in slightly different postures.    Mass
              customization is expected to play a significant role in the future of the
              garment industry.  Body scanning and automatic body measurement extraction will
              be important components of mass customization systems.  The proposed algorithms
              will allow construction of small and inexpensive body scanners.  ***
