Abstract    :
              ***  9760581  Hood    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              addresses research toward a novel detector design which can offer the potential
              for high-sensitivity, low-noise, and large formats.  It has the added feature
              of being highly flexible in the design of pixel-to-pixel spectral sensitivity
              from 2 to over 25 microns.  Large-format, low-noise, highly-sensitive infrared
              detector arrays play an important role in modern astronomy.   If this research
              is succcessful, it can provide improvements in infrared detector technology
              which can enable a continuation of the rapid advances being made in infrared
              astronomy.   This project will utilize specialized design software developed at
              the Ohio State University, ElectroScience Laboratory to optimize the absorbing
              structures; draw upon the NSF supported Cornell Nanofabrication Facility to
              fabricate a series of test structures; and test the proof-of-principle
              detectors.    The commercial potential for this technology is low-cost
              large-format room temperature and cryogenic infrared sensor arrays.  These
              arrays can be used in military, industrial monitoring and control, and
              surveillance applications.  ***
