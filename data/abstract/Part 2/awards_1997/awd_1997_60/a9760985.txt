Abstract    :
               This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Raindrop Geomagic,
              Inc. will explore the automatic creation of non-uniform rational B-spline
              (NURBS)  surfaces from both 3D point sets and polygonal surfaces representing
              3D models.  NURBS surfaces are the preferred representation in the design phase
              because they allow easy and intuitive manual manipulation through control
              points; yet using current methods, the task of constructing NURBS surfaces has
              been both laborious and time-consuming for designers.  Raindrop Geomagic seeks
              to investigate and prototype several methods from the theoretical community and
              compare their performance and feasibility.  Automatically creating NURBS
              surfaces is one of the hardest unsolved problems in the computer-aided design
              industry, and a general solution may not be found in the short term.  In Phase
              I, Raindrop Geomagic will prototype different geometric methods for this
              problem in the context of selected markets where data classification is not
              completely general.  This work will provide the project team with a gain
              insight necessary to the achievement of defining an implementation path for a
              product for automated conversion in the next phase of the research.   The
              resulting software, when fully developed, will fill an urgent need in the
              computer-aided design industry: to freely convert from polygonal surfaces (used
              for analysis and rendering) to NURBS-based surfaces (used for conceptual design
              and styling).  Both computer-aided design/computer aided manufacturing
              (CAD/CAM) users and animators have a strong need for software tools that can
              help speed up their production schedules and reduce their costs.
