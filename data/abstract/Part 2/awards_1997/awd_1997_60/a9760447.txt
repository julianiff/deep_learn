Abstract    :
              ***  9760447  Colvin    This  Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              program will investigate the use of microencapsulated phase change materials
              (microPCMs) to control and stabilize plant surface temperatures within a range
              that protects the plant tissue against low temperature damage.  The project
              will study ways to stabilize the microenviromnent temperature on the plant
              surface with microPCMs as an impetus to develop a safe, economical, and
              effective method for controlling frost damage in the agricultural and
              horticultural industries.  Microencapsulated phase change materials (microPCMs)
              - developed by Triangle Research and Development Corporation (TRDC) on multiple
              SBIR programs from 1984 to 1996 - will be selected and used in this program. 
              TRDC has already developed coatings for textiles and aircraft that can control
              temperature at temperatures from ambient to 1,000 degrees F.  A wide array of
              potential temperature stabilizing microPCMs are available for testing and based
              on ongoing research, we know that microPCMs go into suspension well, can be
              easily applied to plant surfaces, and have demonstrated a compatibility on
              plants tested thus far in other unrelated work.  The proposed research would
              demonstrate the effectiveness of microPCMs to slow or prevent cooling of the
              leaf or flower surfaces to a level where protection of the tissue is achieved. 
                Annually, significant portions of citrus fruits, deciduous tree fruits, small
              fruits, winter vegetables, ornamentals, and cereal crops are lost to
              frost/freeze damage.  For the fruit industry alone, which is worth eight to ten
              billion dollars in the United States, losses are consistently high.  The market
              potential for a successful product for frost/freeze protection of this nature
              would be enormous.  For the horticultural industry, conservative estimates for
              frost damage in the U.S. is near the billion dollar figure.  This research may
              provide a solution to these problems and markets.  ***
