Abstract    :
              9760429   Bozkurt   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will develop zirconium di-bromide (ZrB2)/copper (Cu) electrodes for
              applications in (1) plasma spray coaters, (2) arc-jet plasma reactors, and (3)
              electrical discharge machining (EDM) electrodes.  This material suffers little
              or no erosion from plasma arcs and sparks, which is a major problem in
              continuous operation of these commercial machines.  These electrodes wear about
              10-20 times less than traditional copper or graphite electrodes.  Phase I will
              study the process variables of ZrB2 particle size, fraction of copper, and
              molten copper impregnation temperature in order to maximize useable electrode
              lifetime for each application.  Electrodes will be prepared using selective
              layer sintering (SLS), a rapid prototyping technique.   The technology is
              environmentally important in that arc-jet reactors are leading contenders for
              remediation processes for municipal waste, hospital waste, nuclear waste, waste
              lube oil recycling, aluminum recycling, and tire recycling.  Further, ZrB2/Cu
              electrodes are less toxic than copper or graphite electrodes and also
              contaminate less due to a low erosion rate.  These electrodes are expected to
              find extensive commercial applications.
