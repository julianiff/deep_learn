Abstract    :
              ***  9760399  Simpson    This is a Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              proposal.  With the world's fishing capacity at twice the estimated sustainable
              harvest, accurately assessing fish stocks is an international priority.  The
              federal government requires that North Pacific fishing vessels over 60 feet
              long have an observer onboard at least part-time and large vessels require a
              full-time observer.  Observers collect a wide range of data on both target
              catch and bycatch.  Scientists and fish managers use this information to set
              catch limits, close fisheries, revise population estimates, and determine
              fishing areas.    Recently, the observer program has become stressed.  Poor
              conditions, low pay, and the inherent stress of being a fisheries "watch dog"
              have resulted in high turn-over rates.  Furthermore, observers are required to
              sample from as much as 250 metric ton in 2 hours.  Under these conditions, the
              sample size is as little as 0.08%. Observers, and the fisheries, need help.   
              Scientific Fishery Systems, Inc. (SciFish) proposes to design, build, and test
              an automated fish stock measurement and identification system entitled
              Observer's  Associate.  Observer's  Associate will automatically provide whole
              catch weight and individual fish statistics.  At least a 5% sample size under
              peak conditions is the design goal, resulting in as much as 60 times greater
              coverage than the current approach.    It is conservatively estimated that
              there are 15,000 commercial fishing vessels over 100 ton (the size of vessel
              that would use Observer's  Associate.  World-wide this number increases to
              100,000.  The target price for the trawler-based Observer's Associate is
              $50,000 and the smaller unit price target is $5,000.  Based upon preliminary
              projections, 5% of the available world-wide market would result in a $10M
              product line.  ***
