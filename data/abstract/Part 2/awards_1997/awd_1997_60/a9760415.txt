Abstract    :
              ***       Pirzada  9760415        This Small Business Innovation Research Phase
              I project will develop a cost-effective process to produce ultrafine powders of
              rare earth magnetic materials. Rare earth materials have rapidly become the
              basis of essential components for billion dollar industries and this market is
              predicted to continue to grow rapidly. Existing processes for producing rare
              earth magnet powders have inherent limitations that limit the powder size
              reduction beyond a few microns while maintaining compositional purity,
              spherical shape, and monodispersity. This in turn limits the maximum MGOe
              (million gauss oesteds) and miniaturization currently achievable. During the
              Phase I project, the proposer will establish the proof-of-concept of a process
              that may help launch powders that are an order of magnitude finer than
              presently available. Future efforts will seek to optimize the technology and
              produce prototypes from nanoscale materials for customer qualification and
              commercialize the technology.       Potential commercial applications include
              miniaturized and higher energy product magnets for the electronics,
              information, and telecommunications industries. Spin-off applications will
              serve a wide   range of industries using rare earth alloys.  ***
