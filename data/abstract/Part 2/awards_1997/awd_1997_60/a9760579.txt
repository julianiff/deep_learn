Abstract    :
              ***  9760579  Norris          This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project aims to solve the p-type doping problem in III-V nitrides by means of a
              novel variant on the concept of 'bandgap engineered' doping.  It is shown that
              this approach can enhance the electrical activation of impurities and thus
              strongly increase the free carrier concentration.'Initial calculations predict
              p+ material is possible which is of great importance to III-N laser technology.
              Research in III-V nitride materials has resulted in substantial progress over
              the last few years including the demonstration of efficient green/blue
              light-emitting diodes, and lasers emitting in the ultraviolet and the blue part
              of the optical spectrum.  The thermal stability of III-V nitrides and the high
              radiative efficiency of highly dislocated materials grown on sapphire has led
              to much interest in the field.  However, several significant problems remain to
              be solved in this new class of materials, One of these issues, the "p-type
              doping problem' is due to the large thermal activation energy of acceptors in
              GaN and other III-V nitrides.        The commercial applications of p+ doping
              for low resistance p-contacts are manifold.  These include all 111-N LEDs  that
              is: blue, green and yellow , III-N lasers as well as high frequency, high power
              vertical JFETs for microwave applications.
