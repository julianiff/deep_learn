Abstract    :
              ***  9760236  Pykett    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              will examine the ability of a novel three-dimensional biomaterial, Cellfoam, to
              pre-select, expand, cyopreserve and transduce hematopoietic progenitor cells
              (HPCS) present in cord blood (CB).  Preliminary data from NSF Phase I award
              DMI-9661006 show that CD34' HPCs cultured in Cellfoam without exogenous
              cytokines are expanded 8-10 fold while maintaining their viability and
              multipotency.  IIPCs can be cryopreserved in Celifoam, thawed, re-cultured, and
              transduced efficiently with a retroviral vector.  We propose to examine a novel
              application of Cellfoam: the integrated pre-selection, expansion,
              cryopreservation and transduction CB HPCS.  We will utilize cells from either
              unfractionated, Ficoll purified or CD34' selected preparations of pooled CB
              samples to evaluate the survival, phenotype and multipotency of cells
              pre-cultured in Cellfoam without cytokines for up to four weeks and
              cryopreserved in the same units for one month.  We will also examine the
              retroviral transduction of thawed HPCs over three weeks.  By using different CB
              fractions we may isolate novel, critical subsets of HPCS.    This work will
              facilitate commercialization of Cellfoam systems for the first-ever integrated
              selection, storage and modification system for CB HPCs in an HPC banking market
              anticipated to exceed US $600 million annually in the next decade.  ***
