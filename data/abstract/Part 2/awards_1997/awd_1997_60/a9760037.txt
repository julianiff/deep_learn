Abstract    :
              ***  970037  Berman    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              will evaluate the possibility of extending the Photocatalytic Removal (PCR)
              process for the removal of gaseous pollutants to higher concentration and
              higher flow rate air streams and air streams containing difficult to remove
              pollutants. PCR will be coupled as a polishing process to the Low Temperature
              Plasma Removal (LTPR) process which is known to remove pollutants at good
              energy efficiencies but not sufficiently high removal percentages.  The primary
              goal is to demonstrate that the PCR/LTPR combination destroys pollutants with a
              better efficiency/high percentage removal figure of merit than either process
              alone.     Successful proof and development of the combined process is
              estimated to be applicable to a commercial market of about one billion dollars.
