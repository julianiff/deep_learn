Abstract    :
                The plant pathogens, Fusarium and Pythium, can cause significant losses to
              corn producers when the weather conditions are conducive to the plant pathogens
              and the seed is not treated with a protective fungicide seed treatment. 
              Chemical seed treatments are commercially available to control the effects of
              these pathogens on the seedlings, however, no viable control is commercially
              available to control the root rots and stalk rots that these pathogens cause in
              later growth stages of the plant.  A combination fungal/bacterial antagonist
              has been identified that may be effective to control these pathogens in the
              early plant growth stages with continued protection throughout the growing
              season.  Presently, this combination has a relatively short shelf life.  This
              proposal is directed towards the development of methods to increase the shelf
              life of the fungal/bacterial antagonist and test the fungal/bacterial
              antagonist for efficacy under greenhouse conditions.  Phase II will continue
              the efficacy testing of the successful methods under various field conditions
              and with several corn hybrids.  This proposal is designed to commercialize a
              biological corn seed fungicide that is more effective and more environmentally
              friendly that the presently used chemical corn seed fungicides.  Because the
              proposed product would provide a season long control that the chemical
              fungicides do not, it is anticipated that hybrid corn seed companies would
              readily accept the product as a preferable alternative as long as the questions
              of shelf life and efficacy can be answered.  This award is supported by the
