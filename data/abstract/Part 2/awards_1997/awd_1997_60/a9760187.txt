Abstract    :
               This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Sociometric
              Corporation will establish the Archive of Exemplary Behavioral Science Research
              Instruments (BSRI).  The BSRI Archive will contain searchable, edit-ready, and
              print-ready machine-readable versions of approximately 200 demographic,
              behavioral, and health science instruments used to collect the exemplary
              quantitative research data in the Sociometrics Data Archives and to document
              the effectiveness of the exemplary social intervention programs in the
              Sociometrics Program Archives.  Norms for the scales and items comprising the
              BSRI instruments will be included in BSRI in the form of scale means and
              standard deviations and item frequencies or response distributions calculated
              from the linked data archives at Sociometrics.  The approximately 200
              instruments and 165,000 constituent items and scales that will comprise BSRI
              have been selected and acquired by Sociometrics for public use over a period of
              14 years under the guidance of eight National Advisory Panels of
              scientist-experts.  There will be three commercial product sets comprising
              BSRI: a book series, a CD-ROM series, and an Internet suite accessible on
              Socionet, Sociometrics World Wide Web server.  Phase I will create prototypes
              for these three product sets.   That Behavioral Science Research Instrument
              (BSRI) is characterized by comprehensive substantive scope, availability in
              multiple formats, and easy-to-use interface make it a natural product for
              several thousand institutional target markets serving several hundred thousand
              individual users.  Examples are: (1) academic markets, including social science
              departments, social and health science professors and researchers working in
              the topical areas covered by BSRI, main libraries at colleges and universities,
              and medical libraries in universities; (2) policymaking and business markets,
              such as members of the Association of Public Data Users and employees of the
              federal and state Depts. of Health and Human Services; and (3) general
              information resource markets, such as libraries serving the general public.
