Abstract    :
                 A shortage of well-trained Braille teachers increases while case loads that
              may span hundreds of miles soar.  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase
              I project from Exceptional Teaching Aids will create unique speech-assisted
              Braille mathematics in the form of a stand-alone self-study system.  Speech
              Assisted Learning (SAL) system utilizes synthesized speech for tutorials,
              verification of Braille symbols, and feedback.  No keyboarding skills are
              required.  The overall objective of Phase I is to determine whether visually
              impaired individuals can augment Braille math instruction via the SAL.  The
              research design includes developing a prototype, developing curriculum, and
              evaluating human performance.  Successful  research and development of such a
              system will benefit visually impaired persons of all ages having a variety of
              abilities and needs.   The versatility and user friendliness of the proposed
              SAL system makes it broadly appealing and would greatly increase Braille math
              literacy.  For the first time, Braille math instruction will be available in
              schools, offices, libraries, government agencies, or community centers. 
              Moreover, instruction in all academic areas could be offered.
