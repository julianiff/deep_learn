Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project submitted by
              Teragram Corporation will design and prototype critical theoretical and
              algorithmic elements of a linguistic indexing and search software using
              finite-state technology.    Prototyping the architecture of a search engine 
              will enable searching and indexing syntactically and semantically related
              concepts. This research project embodies linguistic and finite-state techniques
              for the purpose of search and indexing of textual data.  This prototype could
              lead to a new generation of search and indexing technologies, which will enable
              better search by accessing linguistically related concepts, while being
              flexible, fast and scalable to huge amounts of textual information.    The
              company's linguistic technology is based on formal and algorithmic properties
              of finite-state automata and finite-state transducers and enables linguistic
              processing at very high speeds while achieving very high data compression
              rates.  Finite-state technologies have tremendous potentials in linguistic
              processing for indexing purposes.  If the proposed research meets its goals,
              the resulting software will have numerous commercial applications such as file
              system indexing, document indexing, and document retrieval and Internet search
              engines.
