Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is for research to
              design large, high precision, high field ( 1.8 T) iron-yoke/rare-earth (Charge
              Sheet Equivalent Material) dipole magnets.  The few large permanent dipole
              magnets that have been designed have used traditional electromagnet techniques
              and so have unsatisfactorily large parasitic flux and low gap fields of  0.3 T.
               General design and construction methodology will be developed for the magnets
              during Phase I. As proof of principle, these techniques will be applied a  1 T
              tunable gap field 'box' dipole with reversed fringe field for a mobile 70 MeV
              RaceTrack Microtron using the smallest magnets possible.  Four tasks are
              proposed: (1) Perfect the large CSEM dipole design; (2) Develop field error
              measurements and correction methods; (3) Develop fringe field shaping methods;
              and (4) Find a method to thermally stabilize the CSEM.  TOSCA and MAFIA
              computer simulations will be used to verify the design.  Large high-field CSEM
              dipoles can be used in industrial and research accelerators, beam transport
              lines, and spectrometers, as they have simpler construction and superior
              performance than similar electromagnetic dipoles.  Eliminating the magnet
              coils, as well as their power supplies and cooling systems, reduces the
              electrical power consumption, construction costs, servicing expense, control
              system complexity, and space requirements, while increasing the reliability.
