Abstract    :
              ***  9760456  Wixom    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              will develop advanced materials for lithium ion battery electrodes.  These
              materials will be processed to increase the reversible lithium storage capacity
              and decrease the irreversible capacity through control of their microstructure.
               The first task will be to systematically vary the process conditions applied
              to at least two materials typically used in commercial batteries.  The
              electrode microstructures will be evaluated by diffraction and porosimetry, and
              changes in the microstructure will be related to process conditions. 
              Electrodes will be fabricated and assembled into test cells using metallic
              lithium as the reference and counter electrode.  The cells will be cycled to
              measure capacity and polarization.  A process design will be developed to
              demonstrate economic as well as technical feasibility. Phase II will transition
              from highly controlled laboratory-scale processes to larger industrial
              processes presently used in ceramic powder processing    This project will
              improve the volumetric capacity and operating times of rechargeable lithium ion
              batteries.  The market for these batteries is expected to grow to over $250
              million by 2000.  Operating time is perhaps the single most important selection
              criterion for applications such as camcorders, laptop computers, and cellular
              communication.  ***
