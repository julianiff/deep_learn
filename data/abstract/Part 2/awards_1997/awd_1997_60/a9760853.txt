Abstract    :
              ***  9760853  Fleming    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              proposes to apply the infinite velocity method for quantification of elements
              to time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) and to evaluate
              the concept for semiconductor testing. A key requirement to improve
              semiconductor performance and efficiency will be better analysis procedures for
              quantification of elements in smaller features and thinner layers. The infinite
              velocity method stems from the observation that secondary ion yields per unit
              of sample concentration tend to a single value for all elements at infinite
              velocity (high ion energy) if the ion yields are first corrected for sputter
              yield and instrument transmission.  In Phase 1, the efficacy of this concept
              will be demonstrated.    Quantitative elemental analysis of thin films and
              small features in semiconductors are marketed as commercial analytical services
              and instrument upgrades.  Estimated revenues for this small firm are $2,000,000
              per year, or larger if quantification can be performed at the expected
              detection limits.  ***
