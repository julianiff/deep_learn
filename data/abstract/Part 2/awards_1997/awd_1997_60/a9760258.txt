Abstract    :
              ***  9760258  Spitzer         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project will investigate properties of giant magnetoresistance,(GMR) at
              nanoscale feature sizes.  Miniaturization of GMR films is expected to lead to
              improved characteristics, such as faster switching times.  A number of
              investigators have found GMR values to increase with miniaturiztion, but with
              an attendant increase in their coercivity, i.e., the required switching field. 
              The proposer has developed GMR films with ultralow coercivities, an order of
              magnitude lower than previously attained.  Because of their structure, these
              films are expected to exhibit the increase in GMR values reported by others
              upon miniaturization, while maintaining low coercivity.  A variety of GMR films
              with different design parameters will be fabricated and tested at 100 nm
              feature size.  These films wil be used to design integrated solid -state
              devices that use no semiconductors, such as e GMR-based electronic components. 
              The characteristics of these devices will be stimulated.  Their performance-is
              expected to show improvement with miniaturization.       OMR films form the
              foundation for various integrated devices without semiconductors.  The
              potential applications of such devices include nonvolatile memory and storage,
              as well as general-purpose all-metal electronics, with billion-dollar markets.
