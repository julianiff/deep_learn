Abstract    :
              ***  9760522  Smart  Kumetrix Inc. will investigate methods of fabricating very
              fine silicon needles, and other cantilever structures, which have sufficient
              strength to penetrate skin and similar tough biological tissue.  Such
              microstructures can be used for painless blood sampling if they can be made
              more robust.  They will find many applications in clinical medicine, home
              health testing and biological research, with major markets including glucose
              self-testing by diabetics, neonatal blood testing, and screening of large
              populations for specific blood constituents, such as infectious or toxic
              agents.  ***
