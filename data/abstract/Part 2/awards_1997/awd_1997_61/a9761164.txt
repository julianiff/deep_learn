Abstract    :
              ***  9761164  West    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is
              directed at developing a new technology for generating bio-active libraries of
              compounds for high-throughput screening in drug discovery.  This new synthesis
              method is expected to create a diverse spectrum of large numbers of drug
              candidate compounds - many with structures that are difficult or impossible to
              obtain with other methods.  The Phase I program will produce eight libraries of
              compounds, where each library is created from reactants with structural
              similarities to ligands for targeted receptors.  The libraries generated will
              be screened for binding to cannabinoid and x-opioid receptors.  Phase I success
              will be established if binding is demonstrated at a rate of at least one in
              1000 screened compounds - an order of magnitude improvement over current 'hit
              rates"  achieved by combinatorial chemistry techniques.    The proposed process
              has great commercial potential as a tool for the discovery of new drugs.  With
              the advent of high-throughput screening techniques, there is a great demand in
              the pharmaceutical industry for new compounds.  If successful, this new process
              will produce large numbers of an extremely diverse range of compounds.  ***
