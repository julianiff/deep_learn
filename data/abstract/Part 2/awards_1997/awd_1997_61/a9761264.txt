Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project focuses oil x-ray and
              particle imaging of biological specimens using radionuclides, radiotracers or
              x-ray beams.  An imaging detector requires: detection efficiency close to
              unity; photon counting; high spatial resolution, comparable to film;  improved
              contrast due to insensitivity to scattered x-rays or particles; liticar
              intensity response; large dynamic range; low noise;  and differential
              attenuation imaging using x-ray energies.  We propose to address these issues
              with a novel form of' high spatial precision imaging scintillator pixel plate,
              fabricated by micromachining of very high aspect ratio holes (length/diameter)
              in silicon.  The Si holes will be formed into dielectric waveguides (optical
              fibers) by forming a cladding film, for example by oxidizing the walls to form
              SiO2.  The holes will be filled with standard and novel scintillation
              materials, including index-matched collodal  dispersions of nanocrystalline
              photolithographic techniques, with holes from 1 um-1 mm in diamiter, and plate
              thickness up to about 1 mm.  The scintillator array is well-matched to the
              precision and spatial resolution of optical pixel detectors including CCD image
              intensifiers and film.  This program may led to novel large area, high
              precision x-ray imagers, enabling replacement of film or enhancing film in
              medical and dental x-rays.  It may also lead to ultra-high precision
              fiber-optic plates at low cost, and compact full aperture optical and x-ray
              collimators.
