Abstract    :
              ***  9761626  Welker    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              proposes a novel solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) that will more than quadruple
              the practical power, peak power, and energy density of state-of-the-art
              secondary lithium batteries.  The innovation involves the controlled
              incorporation of substituted sidechains onto dendritic carbosilane polymers. 
              Covalently attaching these high performance SPEs to high energy density fibrous
              electrodes will produce secondary lithium batteries with substantially 
              increased energy densities and power densities. These novel electrolytes
              combine the beneficial aspects of SPEs and liquid electrolytes with other
              desirable features not found in either system.    The innovations will enable
              higher power capabilities that arise from higher cell voltages, higher
              conductivities, higher transference numbers, lower interfacial impedance, and
              more complete utilization of the electrode capacity - all at a reasonable cost.
               This program will result in significant improvements in power density, energy
              density, cycle life, safety, disposal, and cost.    Improved lithium polymer
              batteries would find a large market in electric vehicles, and consumer
              products, as well as in military applications.  ***
