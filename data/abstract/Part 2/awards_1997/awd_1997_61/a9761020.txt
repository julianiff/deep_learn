Abstract    :
              ***  9761020  Allaei    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              will attempt to demonstrate the feasibility of developing computer software
              that can be used by design engineers and vibration analysts to incorporate the
              occurrence and effects of the phenomenon of vibration confinement in their
              design and product development processes.  Analytical tools are needed to
              model, study, and incorporate the potential impacts of vibration confinement in
              the design stage of systems, structures, and products.  The engineering tools
              must be user friendly, provide rapid response and analysis, and be compatible
              with other commonly used modeling software/hardware. A user-friendly Vibration
              Energy Confinement Analysis Software (VECAS) will be developed as a stand-alone
              program or as part of a post processing toolbox when used with large commercial
              modeling programs (i.e., finite element programs such as ANSYS, NASTRAN,
              ABACUS, etc.). The software will also be available in two different compilation
              platforms, such as C++ and FORTRAN.  The VECAS program will provide rapid
              awareness of the occurrence of the energy confinement and its significance in
              structures under development, and therefore, reduce the potential for
              catastrophic failures due to confinement of energy.  VECAS can also be used to
              optimize the performance of the structure based on beneficial effects (i.e.,
              improved buckling capacity, vibration isolation, reduction, and sensor/actuator
              optimization) of the phenomenon.  Finally, VECAS can be used to construct more
              effective passive or active vibration/noise control systems.    The VECAS
              program to be developed will provide the tools to incorporate the mode
              localization phenomenon in the design stage of new developments.  Due to the
              broad applications, such as buckling and vibration analysis, and passive active
              vibration control, of the such software, the commercial market is diverse and
              huge.  It is anticipated that researchers, engineers, and educators in
              government laboratories, indus try, and academic institutions, respectively,
              will be interested in using VECAS.  ***
