Abstract    :
              ***  9761618  Law         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project aims to synthesize a new, high capacitance polyimide-barium titanate
              polyamic acid which will be patterned by contact photolithography to produce a
              polyimide composite network having an order of magnitude higher capacitance
              than current polyimide composite materials. The next generation of electronic
              packaging requires the replacement of discrete passive devices with embedded
              material to achieve the necessary gains in component density, performance, and
              cost reductions.  Of the three passive components, resistors, inductors, and
              capacitors, it is capacitors that are used in the highest quantities, and have
              received the smallest amount of integration research.  Current capacitive
              materials for MCM-L substrates lack the dielectric properties which will be
              required for future performance improvements.  A composite dielectric material
              composed of a newly synthesized photo-active and high polarity polyimide with
              nanometer scale ceramic powder will be able to meet the performance, thermal,
              and processing requirements required for developing embedded capacitance
              devices.        The total North American printed circuit board market is
              currently at $6 billion, with no integrated passive components.  By the year
              2007, total PC board estimates are at $13 billion, with approximately one
              quarter of that expected to be generated by boards employing integrated passive
              devices.  Current discrete passive component costs are $0.10 per component,
              plus an additional $0.03 for insertion.  Even with a slight premium for
              developing new embedded materials, the savings involved in eliminating
              insertion costs are substantial.  ***
