Abstract    :
              ***  Chandra  9761291    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will explore a novel technique of using silicon (Si) tubes for the
              production of polycrystalline silicon, a material critical for electronics,
              photovoltaics, micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), and many other devices. 
              A current worldwide shortage of polysilicon material may become acute in the
              future.  Bulk polysilicon is currently produced by chemical vapor deposition of
              Si on a hot thin crystalline silicon rod.  The diameter of the rod increases
              with the deposition, but the process is very slow in the beginning because of
              small surface area.  Two different Si tube-based deposition techniques will be
              examined.  The first will increase yield by 15-20% by allowing deposition on
              both inner and outer surfaces of the tube (with simple retrofitting), whereas
              the second scheme will lead to a much simpler reactor design with a much
              reduced energy requirement, better control, and higher yield.  Phase I will
              establish the relative feasibility of the two concepts through theoretical
              research, design studies, and industrial testing.    Potential commercial
              applications are expected production of polysilicon in the semiconductor and
              solar industries  ***
