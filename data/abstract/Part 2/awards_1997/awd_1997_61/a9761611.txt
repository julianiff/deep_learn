Abstract    :
              ***  9761611  Smithey    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              is directed toward development of new optical materials that are robust,
              reusable, and inexpensive and have optical properties superior to those of
              current materials.  The required properties for a competitive, economically
              viable material are good light Sensitivity, large change in a material property
              (e.g., absorbance or refractive index) upon exposure to light,
              read-without-erase capability, long recording lifetime, fatigue resistance, and
              erasability.  Current materials - e.g.,  photopolymers and phase-change
              materials not satisfy all of these requirements.    The approach will be to
              alter a novel biological material, bacteriorhodopsin (BR), to meet the
              sensitivity requirements for optical-recording materials.  In previous work,
              Bend Research and others have demonstrated the potential of BR for optical
              recording and have shown it meets all of the other necessary material
              requirements.  Improvements in the sensitivity of BR materials is the key
              advance remaining to be achieved in the development of a practical BR-based
              optical-recording material for a wide range of applications.    Development of
              a BR material with improved sensitivity would enable product development for
              many large markets, including optical correlation, pattern recognition,
              optical-data storage, fingerprint identification, neural networks, and
              multimedia storage.  ***
