Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will test the technical,
              scientific and commercial feasibility of the next generation of
              scale-sensitive, fractal-based tiling and packing algorithms.  These algorithms
              will be used to develop software that can be used to improve the
              characterization of topographic data acquired from engineering surfaces.  It is
              well known that the topography or roughness of a surface influences its
              performance or behavior, and is influenced by the manufacturing or creation
              processes, although quantification of these relationships depends on advancing
              surface metrology.  The improved characterization will promote better
              functional correlations between the topography of a surface, its performance
              and its manufacture, which will support concurrent engineering design of
              surfaces topography.  These algorithms will be applied to topographic data
              acquired by several kinds of instruments which have been recently developed:
              atomic probe microscopes, interferometric microscopes, confocal microscopes,
              scanning laser microscopes and stereo reconstruction of digital images, as well
              as conventional profiling devices.    The market for these kinds of devices is
              several hundred per year and growing at 10-20%  per year.  Currently several
              software packages are in use for less sophisticated scale-sensitive fractal
              analyses which have sold to industry for about $ 10,000 apiece.  This award is
              supported by the Small Business Innovation Research Program and the
              Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).
