Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Gensym
              Corporation will investigate the feasibility of developing online, real time
              reliability and risk analysis software that will analyze process data to
              ascertain the reliability of equipment and system functions, assess the current
              risk in the facility, report and possibly alarm operators and managers of the
              risk to system functions and equipment, and recommend corrective actions to
              maintain control over risk.  For many organization, expenditure on risk
              mitigation and safety is significant.  Risk mitigation costs can be reduced by
              more carefully monitoring risk and taking corrective action before worst case
              scenarios develop.  The greater the ability to monitor and the tighter the
              feedback loop between risk discovery and evasive action, the more significant
              the savings.  This research will demonstrate that Bayesian networks provide a
              core representation for most reliability and risk analysis models, that system
              decomposability can be exploited to provide real time assessment, and that
              learning methods can be utilized to estimate and recalibrate the analysis.  The
              value for an online risk management capability is high in many industries: 
              Environmental monitoring, toxic waste processing, cleanup and shipment, nuclear
              power generation, offshore oil production and shipment, emergency response and
              emergency evacuation, critical telecommunications, transportation, flexible
              manufacturing, securities trading, credit fraud prevention, and many others.
