Abstract    :
               Microbial processes are very prominent in research and industry, but few
              college laboratories, and fewer high school courses are able to present this
              technology to their students.  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project from EDVOTEK, Inc. will conduct research focusing on the feasibility of
              developing biotechnology teaching and learning resources, which include
              cost-effective fermentation equipment.  This equipment will be utilized with
              investigative problem-based experiments.  Along with the advantages in cost and
              simplicity of fermenters, EDVOTEK proposes to craft laboratory experiments
              illustrating a variety of processes.  Kits of culture media, live inocula, and
              all the accessories needed for each experiment will be researched.   At this
              time there is no fermentation equipment at reasonable cost ($500 to $1000) that
              can simulate that used in the biotechnology industry.  Likewise, there are no
              readily available commercial experiments that can provide new approaches to
              teaching and learning fermentation biotechnology.  The project will contribute
              what is currently unavailable:  cost-effective fermentation equipment and
              accompanying experiments and thereby enhance student understanding of
              biological concepts in such a way as to illuminate student cognizance of the
              relationship between laboratory activities and the solution of real-life
              biotechnology problems.
