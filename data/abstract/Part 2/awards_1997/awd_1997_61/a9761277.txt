Abstract    :
              9761277  Rao    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to
              develop microwave resonators based on HTS multilayer technology, which will
              form the basic building blocks for a new generation of advanced communications
              filters.  Improved trilayers will lead to HTS trilayer resonators with
              extremely small size and high Q.  These structures will enable the production
              of filters with orders of magnitude improvement in selectivity over
              state-of-the-art technology.   The customers for this next generation of
              communications filters are providers of cellular and personal communications
              services, with a projected market of $1B annually.
