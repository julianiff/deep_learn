Abstract    :
              ***  9761131  Rostler  Science Research Laboratory Inc. will develop a
              revolutionary new concept for volumetric storage of Tbytes of information. 
              This approach relies upon femtosecond lasers, which store data in optical
              fibers.  Readout of the data is also very fast, with anticipated  speeds in
              excess of 100Gbit/s.  A bundle of fibers provides volumetric storage, and the
              ends of the fibers form a two-dimensional array which can be addressed in the
              same manner as CD-ROM or optical discs.  The enormous increase in information
              storage capacity, and data access rates promised by this technology, will meet
              the needs of electronic data processing well into the 21st century.  ***
