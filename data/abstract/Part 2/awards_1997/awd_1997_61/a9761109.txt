Abstract    :
              ***  9761109  Young    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              is directed towards the study and evaluation of a new non-explosive rock
              excavation and concrete demolition method.  The process involves injecting foam
              at high pressure into pre-drilled holes in the rock or concrete to be broken
              through a barrel incorporating a new hole bottom sealing method.  The high
              viscosity of the foam (as compared to a gas) combined with its stored energy
              characteristics (as compared to a liquid) result in very controlled breakage. 
              The pressures to break the rock or concrete are significantly less than
              required in methods based upon the use of small explosive or propellant
              charges.  Consequently, airblast and flyrock are reduced to very benign levels
              allowing the method to be applied in a continuous manner and to be used in
              urban and other sensitive environments.  The incremental breakage of the method
              combined with the mobility and simplicity of the requisite hardware give the
              method considerable potential to be highly automated.  The Phase I project will
              quantify the breakage that might be achieved in rock and concrete, investigate
              the foam viscosities and pressures required for efficient breakage and identify
              aspects of the process with a potential for automation.    The controlled foam
              injection method for rock breakage could be used to develop utility tunnels
              under existing streets and buildings, to provide access tunnels or shafts to
              existing subway systems, to modify or enlarge excavation carried out with
              tunnel boring machines or to excavate or enlarge underground space for
              buildings.  In the area of concrete breakage and stripping the method would be
              useful for demolishing concrete structures when explosive methods were
              precluded or where salvage and recycling of building or structure components
              was desirable.  ***
