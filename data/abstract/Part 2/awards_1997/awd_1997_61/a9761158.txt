Abstract    :
              ***   9761158  Nardi    This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will address the design and development of tools for the integrated
              diagnostics and service of installed electromechanical systems.  The project
              combines technologies from signal processing and classification with time and
              usage based maintenance to produce an integrated maintenance service technology
              based on condition, elapsed calendar time, and equipment utilization.  The
              integrated system is general and addresses the needs of several different
              categories of business that install and maintain electromechanical equipment. 
              The technical methodologies include pattern classification in measured signals
              and constraint-directed operations management and allocation of maintenance
              resources.    Potential commercial applications are expected in computer based
              tools for operation and management of service maintenance systems.  ***
