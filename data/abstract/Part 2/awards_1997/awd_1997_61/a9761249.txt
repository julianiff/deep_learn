Abstract    :
              ***  9761249  Plimmer         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project proposes development of microporous perfluoromembranes (both flat sheet
              and hollow fiber) via thermal inversion phase separation process (TIPS). 
              Numerous polymers (e.g. polysulfone, cellulose ester) are fabricated into
              microporous flat sheet and hollow fiber membranes by solution based phase
              inversion.  The TIPS process has been developed for polyolefins which do not
              lend themselves to conventional solution processes. Earlier attempts to
              fabricate microporous perfluoromembranes by the TIPS process have been limited
              by the high temperature and the associated volatility of the additive oils.  In
              this program, new families of soluble, non-volatile, non-crystalline,
              perfluoropolymers will be melt-blended with the crystalline, thermoplastic
              perfluoropolymer targeted for the TIPS process.  Conventional TIPS processing,
              followed by solvent extraction, should produce the desired microporous
              perfluoromembrane.  In Phase 1, we will demonstrate proof of concept on flat
              sheets and also evaluate coatings of these microporous membranes.  In Phase 11,
              we will (1) scale-up the operation, (2) do pilot testing, and (3) evaluate both
              flat sheet and hollow fibers.       Microporous perfluoromembranes are
              presently only available in flat sheet form (e.g. "Goretex").  The development
              of perfluoro based TIPS hollow fiber and flat sheet products will greatly
              expand the market.  This includes harsh chemical filtration, gas venting, and
              electronics applications.  ***
