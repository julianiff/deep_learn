Abstract    :
                                       ***                971236     Hartsough                
                 This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the
              feasibility of direct electrochemical reduction of nitrate in drinking water. 
              Current commercial treatment technologies produce large volumes of waste
              streams or add unwanted chemicals to the water and are not amenable to use in
              small scale, point of use systems.  Direct electrochemical reduction of nitrate
              as proposed offers a potentially selective and cost effective treatment method.
               No chemicals are added to the water and no waste streams are produced.
              Electrochemical cells will be designed to directly reduce nitrate to nitrogen,
              ammonia, or nitrous oxide. The cells will be safe, simple and inexpensive to
              operate, compact, and maintenance free, making them ideal for use in home and
              other point of use systems.    Four million people drink from private water
              supply wells contaminated with nitrate exceeding the US limits established for
              public health concerns. One to two percent of public water supplies also
              contains levels of nitrate exceeding these limits.  The proposed technology
              would be readily scaleable for point of use systems to remedy this potential
              health risk.                 ***
