Abstract    :
              ***   9761035  Mahoney    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will assist manufacturer's in the development of aids for people with
              disabilities.  New software concepts call for integration with existing CAD
              systems and animation packages and require various tools and facilities to
              support product conceptualization, consumer evaluation, virtual prototyping,
              and design iteration.  The new software system will support external input
              devices to interact with virtual prototypes, thereby evaluating disability
              behaviors such as spasticity, tremor, and movement constraints of disabled
              users.  The concept's potential to provide three-dimensional modeling
              comparability would support use of design information over both corporate
              intranets and the external internet.  Phase I will test various system modules
              through a design case study based on an available sotware product.    Potential
              commercial applications are expected in affordable design aid and evaluation
              tools to develop consumer-specific aids for people with disabilities. 
              Manufacturers and rehabilitation professionals need a design and evaluation
              software tools to develop aids for people with disabilities.  This new
              softwarel would provide a rapid prototyping tool specifically tailored for
              disabled individuals.      ***
