Abstract    :
              ***  9761280  Scherer    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              seeks to develop a new phenomenon, high pressure electrokinetic (HPEK) pumping,
              for applications in micro and macro scaled fluid-transport based devices.
              Preliminary HPEK experiments have demonstrated the ability to generate
              controlled, extremely high pressures in 100-micron-sized systems. This project
              proposes to assess the feasibility of scaling up the new phenomenon..  The
              proposed experiments involve the systematic study of the components, which
              comprise these devices, in order to set operable limits for a wide range of
              potential applications.  The Phase I effort will identify suitable technologies
              which can employ HPEK phenomena, including associated materials and operating
              parameters.    The commercial potential for technologies based on the new HPEK
              phenomena described in this proposal is broad and significant. This research
              potentially opens the door to an   entirely new class of fluid transport-based
              devices such as pumps, actuators, valves, and compressors.   ***
