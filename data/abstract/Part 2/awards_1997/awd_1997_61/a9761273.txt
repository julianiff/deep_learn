Abstract    :
              ***  9761273  House    This is a Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              Proposal.  Technical advances in oil recovery and increased environmental
              stewardship are providing substantial new opportunities for drilling fluid
              additives which are environmentally-benign and which offer enhanced performance
              characteristics.  We propose to examine derivatives of the natural
              polysaccharide chitosan as an alternative water-soluble viscosifying polymer in
              drilling fluids.  Specifically, we propose to: (1) produce chitosan from
              crabshell wastes; (2) derivatize chitosan to yield polymers which offer
              low-shear-rate viscosities (i.e. have yield stresses) but which are shear
              thinning; and (3) perform laboratory tests to study the performance of the
              chitosan derivatives in simulated oil drilling applications.  The project team
              for this study is a subset of a larger team which is examining how to
              commercially convert Maryland's crabshell wastes into chitosan in partnership
              with end-users who are developing large volume outlet markets for low-end
              chitosan.    If successful, this research would lead to two commercial
              opportunities.  First, large-volume markets would develop for high performance,
              environmentally-friendly chitosan derivatives as drilling fluid additives. 
              Second, supplying large-volume chitosan markets would provide commercial
              opportunities to convert seafood wastes into a value-added products.  ***
