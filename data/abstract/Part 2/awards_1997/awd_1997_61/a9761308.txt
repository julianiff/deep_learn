Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project submitted by KidSource
              OnLine, Inc will develop a new version of PersonalNews that includes a new
              adaptive feedback mechanism incorporating the user's explicit and evolving
              preferences. The research will focus on designing the prototype and
              user-testing the new functions.  The results from this testing will be used to
              develop a specification for the next phase incorporating scalability and
              performance requirements. The approach will be to build upon the success of a
              prototype of a personalized information agent called KidSource OnLine
              PersonalNews.  PersonalNews delivers a web page of prioritized content for
              parents based upon detailed user preferences and demographics.  Creating a new
              attribute will add the style of information (voice and audience) into the user
              preference model.  These features will result in a more human-centric design
              that incorporates a wider range of user capabilities and will produce results
              that are more accurate, relevant and more reflective of the user's total needs
              than can any existing technology.  This technology is applicable not only to
              the parenting market, but also to many other market segments and can be used to
              proactively deliver personalized information to disadvantaged groups in order
              to improve their health and education.
