Abstract    :
              9761265  Beetz  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to
              develop a pixel-size PhotoMultiplier Tube (PMT) on Silicon, based on a novel
              process technique relying upon photoassisted  electrochemical anodisation and
              chemical etching.  Commercial applications include:  (1) High grain fiber-optic
              receivers; (2) Planar arrays of very high speed pixel detectors for machine
              vision, line scanners, streak cameras and robotic vision systems; and (3)
              Medical, process control and diagnostic instruments.  The
              quantum-efficiency-gain bandwidth product will exceed any known pixel detector
              capable of ship-scale electro-optic integration, and the system cost in the
              applications arenas will decrease substantially.
