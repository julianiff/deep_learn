Abstract    :
              ***  9761598  Prideaux    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project is directed toward the commercialization of high-quality, reduced-cost,
              Sheared-channel Microchannel Plates (SMCPs)(TM).  Under an earlier NASA SBIR
              award, fabrication procedures were developed which were successfully used to
              produce the high-quality, 50-mm-format SMCPs for the Hubble Space Telescope
              Imaging Spectrograph (STIS), and for the Hubble Advanced Camera.  A significant
              number of 25-mm-format MCP wafers are available from the NASA SBIR award.  The
              objective is to use these wafers to optimize the procedures for fabricating
              high-quality SMCPs at a commercially-acceptable cost.  The optimum shear
              process will be established, etch and reduction procedures will be validated,
              and the performance characteristics of a number of finished SMCPs will be
              quantified.  At the end of Phase I, the goal is to have developed all of the
              data required to set up a dedicated SMCP fabrication and test facility,
              including a second-generation shear engine.      The SMCPs produced in this
              facility will have a very wide range of scientific and commercial applications
              in fast-timing and position sensitive detector systems.  These include
              time-of-flight mass spectrometry, ELTV and soft x-ray imaging and spectroscopy,
              military and civilian night-vision, low-light-level spectroscopy, and' speckle
              image reconstruction and wavefront sensing.  ***
