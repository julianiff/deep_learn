Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
              investigate new technology for the rapid electronic sortation of aluminum,
              copper, brass, and stainless steel and production of a nonferrous metal rich
              feedstock from resource recovery plant ash.  Fast new detectors and computer
              electronics can identify nonferrous metals in millisecond time frames.  This
              makes possible rapid identification and separation of one type of metal from
              another.  This new technology is needed to sort the nonferrous metal feedstock
              from resource recovery plant ash residue and from automobile shredders. 
              Current methods use hand sorting, eddy currents, and heavy media plants. 
              Virtually no waste-to-energy facilities presentlt recover nonferrous metals. 
              Eddy current separators depend on particle size and shape and do not work well
              on incinerated nonferrous metals.  Heavy media plants are capital intensive and
              cause environmental problems.  The new technology is expected to increase the
              recycling of valuable metallic components, which are presently going to
              landfills.  Nonferrous metals, discarded in waste, amount to some two billion
              pounds/year.  Applying the technology only to the recovery and recycling of
              nonferrous metals from more than 200 automobile shredders located throughout
              the USA would, by itself, have a large commercial potential.
