Abstract    :
              9761141  Kim    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              will develop an optoelectronic face recognition system, in which problems
              associated with traditional systems such as invariant recognition multi-stage
              operation, system complexity, high cost and large data storage capacity
              requirements will be overcome using a neural network-embedded optical joint
              transform correlator (JTC).   This unique combination of neural networks and
              JTC will be invariant to facial expression, facial hair, head position, camera
              scale and lighting, and can be used in a variety of security applications
              including access control systems, personal identification systems and other
              bio-metric-signature based security systems.
