Abstract    :
              ***  9761508  Eisgruber         This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I
              project proposes development of thin film copper indium diselenide (CIS)
              thermoelectric devices on rigid and flexible substrates, including both
              development of the film growth process for thermoelectrics and modeling the
              incorporation of the devices into systems with specific power generation or
              cooling requirements.  Currently, high production costs and low efficiency
              inhibit the widespread use of thermoelectric devices.  Most commercially
              available thermoelectric devices are manufactured using single crystal
              semiconductor stacks.  Single crystal fabrication technologies are fairly
              mature; To reduce production costs, new materials and fabrication technologies
              must be utilized.  Recent developments in deposition of CIS for use in thin
              film photovoltaic modules has been especially dramatic.  Interestingly, CuInSe2
              also holds great promise for thermoelectric devices.  Initial investigation of
              its thermal properties indicate a very high (exceeding unity) thermoelectric
              figure of merit.       The development of inexpensive, lightweight
              thermoelectric devices promises a huge commercial potential.  Possible
              applications include electronics cooling, precisely controlled refrigeration
              for medical applications, power generation from vehicle exhaust heat recovery,
              and silent, compact air-conditioning for use in ships and submarines.  Mobile
              applications stand to benefit significantly from the development of flexible
              thermoelectrics, as flexible substrates reduce both weight and packaging size.
