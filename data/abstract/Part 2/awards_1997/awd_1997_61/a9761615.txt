Abstract    :
              ***  9761615  Bhandari    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project will develop single source,cost-effective lanthanum precursors for the
              structural composite industry.  Oxide fibers within intermetallic or oxide
              matrices are being actively investigated for high temperature applications. 
              LaPO4 is a coating with excellent potential for both intermetallic and oxide
              matrices.  Such interface coatings are critical, but their development has
              suffered from extremely high per pound costs and coating uniformity issues. 
              The project will provide lanthanum precursors that address both these issues.
              Phase I will demonstrate chemistry, liquid source delivery, atmospheric
              pressure CVD, and continuous (multifilament) fiber coating technologies for the
              deposition of LaPO4 coatings on aluminum oxide fibers.  Coated fibers will be
              evaluated and processed into matrix composites.  Phase II will address process
              optimization for a selected coating, in conjunction with processing by a
              composite manufacturer.    An economical lanthanum CVD precursor for producing
              high-quality LaPO4 coatings on continuous, multifilament fiber tows will enjoy
              an unfulfilled market niche.  Applications of the research include power
              generation systems, aircraft engines and hazardous waste incinerators.   ***
