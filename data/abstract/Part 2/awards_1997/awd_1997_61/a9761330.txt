Abstract    :
              ***  9761330  Reynolds    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project will develop a self-calibrating optical sensor based on principles of
              photon migration for on-line measurements of particle or droplet size
              distributions and volume fraction for particulate and dispersed phase
              processes. It proposes to build a prototype instrument for use in an industrial
              setting. The novel approach consists of monitoring the time-dependent
              propagation characteristics of light as it multiply scatters through a process
              stream of high solids. The technique does not require external calibration or
              empirically derived calibration factors. Feasibility of this technology has
              been demonstrated.     While particulate processes comprise seventy to eighty
              percent of the US. chemical-based industry, no on-line measurements are
              available for the critical process parameters of particle size and volume
              fraction in concentrated process streams to enable control and effective
              optimization. The photon migration technique has immediate industrial
              applications in emulsion processing (including polymerization),
              crystallization, ceramic processing, and biotechnology.  ***
