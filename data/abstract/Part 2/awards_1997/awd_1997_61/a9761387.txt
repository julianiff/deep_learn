Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project plans to demonstrate
              how to limit the costs of the bipolar plate by the choice of materials that can
              be molded or extruded.  The usual choice of material is a mixture of graphite
              and polymeric binders.  Since the bipolar plate must exhibit sufficient
              electrical and thermal conductivity, the content of polymeric binder must be
              minimized, but maintained at a level to assure moldability.  As a consequence,
              the toughness of the bipolar plate is not very high and may retain some
              porosity.  In this effort we will synthesize a new ceramic material that is
              more conductive and stronger than graphite.  This material can be fabricated
              into the desired shapes using powder processing methods and sintered to full
              density.  If the proposed research is successful, we will have identified a new
              ceramic material that has conductive properties superior to graphite, can be
              fabricated into shapes using powder processing techniques, and pressureless
              sintered to give a material that will have potential applications as a bipolar
              plat for use in PEM fuel cells.  This material could also replace molded
              graphite electrodes in other applications that require a higher strength
              material.
