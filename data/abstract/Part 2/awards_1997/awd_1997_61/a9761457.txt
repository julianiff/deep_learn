Abstract    :
              ***  9761457  Drukier    This is a Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              proposal.  The research proposed herein addresses a critical need for high low
              cost and rapid diagnostics for pathogenic bacterial contaminants associated
              with food home enteric infections. The main goal of the proposed effort is to
              exploit the superior sensitivity of BioTraces' Multi Photon Detection (MPDTM)
              technology to develop an integrated test system for use in process diagnostics
              and monitoring in the food processing industry.  This test system will be based
              upon the complementary techniques of MPD-enhanced quantitative PCR and
              MPD-enabled direct detection of DNA. We will utilize MPD's 10,000-fold
              sensitivity advantage over current instrumentation and BioTraces' experience in
              developing ultra-sensitivity assay protocols to significantly decrease assay
              tumaround times and improve specificity by minimizing non-specific biological
              backgrounds.  Our objective is to develop tests which are sensitive to less
              than 10 pathogenic bacteria per sample with turnaround times of less than one
              hour.    The potential market for very rapid (< 30 minutes), high sensitivity
              (< 10 CFU/ml) assays for food-bome pathogens are expected to account for about
              20% of the total food quality testing market, which is currently estimated to
              be about $5 billion/year worldwide.  More generally, the quantitative PCR and
              DNA direct detection methods to be developed herein will find significant
              applications in life science research and clinical diagnostics.  ***
