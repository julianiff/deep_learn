Abstract    :
              ***  9761140  McKenna    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              proposes a novel technique for cleaning of semiconductor wafers using Acoustic
              Coaxing Induced Microcavitation(ACIM).  This technique relies on precisely
              controlling the intensity and location of acoustic microcavitation at a
              particulate  site to dislodge that particulate from the wafer surface. It will
              be effective for removing even sub-micron particles without damaging the wafer
              substrate. ACIM is a chemical-free, environmentally friendly process operating
              in a de-ionized water environment. The objective of Phase I is to establish the
              feasibility of using ACIM for fine cleaning.  Through detailed experiments we
              will assess the performance of ACIM assisted fine cleaning of post-CMP(chemical
              mechanical polishing) wafers.  The experiments will study the feasibility and
              provide information for prototype design during Phase II.     ACIM assisted
              cleaning will solve the need for cleaning without damage of precision surfaces,
              specifically the silicon wafers in semiconductor manufacturing.  It is a
              chemical free, environmentally friendly technique for ensuring
              ultra-cleanliness with precision and speed unlike other methods available
              today.  ACIM is very cost effective, and easy to implement in the existing
              infrastructure.  ***
