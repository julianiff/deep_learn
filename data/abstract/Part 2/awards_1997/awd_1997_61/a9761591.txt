Abstract    :
              ***  9761591  Vempati    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              deals with ZSM 5 synthesis, a siliceous and hydrophobic zeolite, from rice hull
              ash.  Environmental pollution associated with burning rice hulls, coupled with
              scarcity and landfilling cost, creates disposal problems to rice mill owners. 
              Rice hull ash (RHA) is siliceous and contains some aluminum, and therefore, it
              is a natural candidate for ZSM 5 synthesis.  This project will explore ZSM 5
              synthesis from RHA in the absence of templating species, i.e.,
              tetrapropylammonium hydroxide or bromide for industrial odor control. 
              Templating species account for as much as 50% of production cost because of
              chemical and disposal costs and calcination of the synthesized product. 
              Preliminary analysis indicates that ZSM 5 derived from RHA and without
              templating species may cost 1/3 as much as activated carbon and non-RHA ZSM 5. 
              Further, modified hydrophilic zeolite uses environment unfriendly chemicals for
              dealumination.    A commercially attractrive new source ZSM 5, i.e.,
              manufactured from RHA, may have a potential for applications in permeable
              barriers for organic compounds and capture of volatile organic compounds.  This
              research is expected to ameliorate environmental problems and expand markets in
              the rice milling industry.        ***
