Abstract    :
              ***  9761194  Lesko    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              proposes the development of an automated scanning microscope to permit the
              commercialization of a promising cytogenetic procedure for prostate cancer
              analysis.  The procedure is based on the specific fluorescence labeling of rare
              cells isolated from patients' blood which are then scanned and analyzed for
              cancer cell characteristics, such as cytokeratin, PSMA and chromosome
              aneuploidy.  While the sample preparation procedure is now ready for routine
              use, the current method for scanning the slide for positive cancer cells is far
              too labor intensive and time consuming to permit the successful
              commercialization of the test.  Therefore we propose to develop an automated
              fluorescence microscopy system that will scan the test slides with a speed,
              accuracy and cost that is compatible with successful commercialization.    The
              project team at CeIlGene has a proven track record for combining genetic 
              biotechnology with computer and imaging techniques and has now gained the
              additional elements necessary to make the transition from research to
              production and finally commercial deployment.    Although the initial
              commercialization effort will be directed towards prostate cancer, the proposed
              automated system will be adaptable to support related cytogenetic procedures
              that address other important medical problems with similar commercialization
              potential.  ***
