Abstract    :
              ***  9761407  Akselband    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
              project addresses novel isolation and culture methods for marine microbial
              isolates in order to take advantage of the vast diversity of ocean
              environments.  To date, little study has been directed toward natural products
              from marine bacteria due to difficulties isolating and culturing producing
              organisms.  It is estimated that fewer than 5% of marine bacteria can be
              cultured and isolated using standard methods.  Phase I will develop a method
              for isolating, culturing, and assaying marine microorganisms for active
              substances.  Single cell encapsulation will be combined with high-throughput
              screening methods to allow analysis of small subpopulations of cells producing
              substances for therapeutic and industrial products.  This technique will allow
              cloning of slow growing organisms that can not be isolated using other methods.
               Development of new isolation methods is expected to enhance rapid automated
              natural product screening of marine as well as terrestrial samples.    Marine
              organisms represent a vast potential source of novel bioactive metabolites. 
              Improved isolation, culturing, and screening methods will permit commercial
              screening for useful therapeutic and industrial products.  ***
