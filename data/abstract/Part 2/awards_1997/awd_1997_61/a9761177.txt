Abstract    :
              ***  9761177  Shdarshan    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project will attempt to model, design and fabricate Carbon-Carbon composite
              engine valves.  Carbon-Carbon (C-C)composites are materials which are
              lightweight and exhibit high strengths at elevated temperatures.  The density
              of C-C (1.7g/cc) versus 7.7g/cc for stainless steel and its inherent lubricity
              are attractive features that render this material as a candidate for engine
              valves.  A significant proportion of engine efficiency is lost in the
              combustion chamber.  If all parts can be redesigned with lightweight materials,
              the energy efficiency can be improved and the release of pollutants from
              combustion products decreased.  Extensive testing of the valves and redesign,
              if necessary, of the shapes are planned for the Phase II effort.  This process
              involves extensive dynamometer studies along with long lead times for testing. 
                Potential applications for C-C materials are in all components of the
              combustion chamber that include pistons, valves, valve guides, rocker arms and
              connecting rods.  ***
