Abstract    :
              ***  9761032  Haynes    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              will detail a method to fabricate structurally strong materials where the
              stiffness of the material can be varied electrically.  If this innovative new
              type of material is used to build structures, then changing the stiffness of
              the material changes the vibrational characteristics of the structures.  By
              continually changing the stiffness of key structural components, vibrations
              will never be able to build up at any resonance frequency because the resonance
              frequencies will continually change.  Current active damping systems use
              actuators and advanced control theory to actively interfere with vibrations.  A
              fundamental problem with these systems is that they can add energy to the
              system, and can go unstable.  They are based on some level of prediction of the
              noise characteristics and/or a model of the structure being controlled, and can
              increase instead of decrease vibrations when the predictions or models do not
              correctly represent the current situation.  In this approach, the fundamental
              advantage is that energy cannot be added to the system, and thus it cannot go
              unstable.   In addition there are practical advantages of requiring no
              actuators and requiring far less power than conventional systems.    A
              technology to minimize vibrations would have commercial value in aircraft,
              cars, space structures, and high precision manufacturing equipment such as
              machine tools or lithography machines.  An investor has been identified who is
              interested in funding an application of this technology, if the research is
              successful, to scanning probe microscopes where vibration precludes using these
              manometer resolution instruments on the factory floor for in-process control.
