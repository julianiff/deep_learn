Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to establish
              proof concept for a sensitive, rapid response, portable biosensor that can be
              utilized in the detection of undetonated explosives in air.  A prototype
              instrument will be derived from the results of this research based on the
              detection of the gas phase antibody-antigen reaction between immobilized TNT
              antibody and vapor phase TNT using Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy
              (SPRS).  The research involves two studies:  ionization of the specific
              antibody onto a specially prepared gold surface and exploration of the
              capabilities of SPRS to detect the antibody-antigen reaction.  The studies will
              also assess the limits of delectability, speed, and reproducibility of
              detection.  A need exists for fast, reliable, field portable detectors for
              undetonated explosives.  Applications can range from the detection of luggage
              bombs at airports to the detection of land mines and other explosives for the
              military.  This award is supported by the Small Business Innovation Research
              Program and the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research
              (EPSCoR).
