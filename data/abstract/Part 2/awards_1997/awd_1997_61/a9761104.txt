Abstract    :
              ***  9761104  Siparsky    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              proposal addresses the issue of waste reduction from food packaging material. 
              There have been very few commercial solutions to the problem of accumulated
              plastics waste.  After a decade of intensive research and political backing,
              plastics recycling remains specific to very few packaging systems such as milk
              containers and large carbonated beverage bottles.  Similarly, degradable
              polymers have also had a negligible commercial impact, mostly due to their cost
              and poor physical properties.  To overcome these problems, TDA Research Inc.
              has developed a low-cost degradable hybrid organic/inorganic polymer based on a
              low-cost natural material, to give a resin with considerable structural
              integrity and biocompatibility.  The hybrid polymer is stable at high
              temperatures and can be used in the manufacture of microwavable clamshells and
              dualovenables for the food packaging industry.  The proposed resin is expected
              to be cheaper than the current laminates used in the food industry.  In Phase
              I, TDA will prepare the degradable resin, mold the dual-ovenable containers and
              examine their properties.  In Phase II, TDA will collaborate with a major
              producer of biodegradable plastics to prepare 100 lb. quantities of the resin
              and carry out market testing.    The proposed degradable hybrid
              organic/inorganic material will be used to prepare food packaging that requires
              high temperature stability and excellent barrier properties.  These
              applications include dual-ovenables and clamshells, containers used to store
              ready-to-eat food in the freezer and to heat it in the microwave.  Other
              applications include barrier coatings on inexpensive paperboard.  ***
