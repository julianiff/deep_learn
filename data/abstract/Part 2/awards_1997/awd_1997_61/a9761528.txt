Abstract    :
              ***  9761528  Juhasz    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              will investigate the scientific, technical and commercial feasibility of laser
              surgical systems for the treatment of glaucoma.  The project will focus on the
              engineering and development of a novel laser delivery system as well as proof
              of concept of its application.  The project is executed in collaboration
              between Escalon Medical Corporation and the University of Michigan. 
              Approximately two million Americans have glaucoma, while another ten million
              are at risk of developing this disease due to elevated eye pressure.  Drug
              treatments for glaucoma are only modestly effective and are associated with
              side effects and poor patient compliance.  Current laser and traditional
              surgical treatments also have limited success in preserving vision.  Current
              pulsed laser systems deposit large amounts of thermal energy into the tissue. 
              The result is extensive damage to adjacent structures and complicated by
              scarring.  Near infrared ultrashort pulsed lasers are uniquely qualified to
              perform improved laser glaucoma surgical techniques, since energy threshold
              requirements for tissue ablation are nearly 100 times less than with existing
              pulsed clinical lasers.  This translates into minimal damage to adjacent
              structures and greatly reduced scarring.  Successful completion of the proposed
              project will identify optimal laser and delivery parameters which will allow us
              to design a commercial prototype in the Phase II project.  ***
