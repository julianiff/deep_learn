Abstract    :
                    ***        9761543            McNeff    This Small Business Innovation
              Research Phase I project will test the feasibility of synthesizing
              monodisperse, nonporous zirconia microspheres for use as high performance
              liquid chromatography (HPLC) supports for the analysis of
              environmentally-impactive substances.  Current HPLC supports limit speed and
              resolution in the analysis of herbicides and pesticides, and require large
              amounts of solvent, because they are porous and cannot tolerate high
              temperature.  Nonporous zirconia, coated by CVD with carbon, will overcome
              these problems. These zirconia microspheres (ca. 1 micrometer in diameter) will
              be synthesized using zirconium alkoxides and zirconium salts.  The primary
              objective is to provide nonporous monodisperse spherical zirconia particles to
              produce ultrafast chromatography columns, but the particle synthesis work will
              also benefit other industries e.g. ceramic synthesis and catalysis.    The
              primary commercial benefit of this research will be the reduction of organic
              solvent used in reversed-phase chromatographic separations of environmentally
              impactive substances.  ***
