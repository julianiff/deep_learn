Abstract    :
                This Small Business innovation Research Phase I project deals with a digital
              hearing aid with the ability to adjust a discrete number of frequencies
              independently and couple to a training computer.  This hearing aid will use a
              non-linear adaptive filter to eliminate unwanted noise and interface to a
              computer for training and feedback.  This is the first step in a development
              series to enable a computer to `teach`' or provide assistance to speech
              therapist in training hearing impaired children better language skills.  The
              first step will be to demonstrate a device capable of providing the specialized
              frequency selective amplifications.  This device will then be implemented with
              a computer (and necessary hardware) that is capable of interacting with a child
              as an aid to enhance specific sounds the child is missing.  The second step in
              the development series is to work with audiologists and speech therapists
              developing a program implementing the training computer.  The third step is to
              collect a data base of the results of the children involved as a pattern
              recognition device to speed up the process of language development.  The
              potential commercial market for hearing disabled children using this device is
              estimated to be in the 10,000's every year.  The true potential, however lies
              in the enhancement of a child's life, ability and opportunity because she is
              able to speak as normal children do.  This award is supported by the Small
              Business Innovation Research Program and the Experimental Program to Stimulate
