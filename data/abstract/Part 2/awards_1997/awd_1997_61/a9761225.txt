Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a
              computational environment which will enable optimization of magnetic resonance
              (MR) flow sequences.  The optimization (suppression or enhancement) of signal
              intensity from arteries and veins in magnetic resonance images (MRI's) requires
              a major effort by MRI sequence developers Currently, costly clinical studies in
              commercial scanners are used to optimize imaging sequences.  The goal of the
              research will be to combine a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) program with a
              MR sequence emulation module. The Bloch equation will be integrated using
              CFD-derived fluid velocities in a finite volume scheme.  The net magnetization
              within the flow field will be summed to generate a simulated echo signal. 
              Multiple echo signals will yield a k-space data which will be 2D Fourier
              transformed to display the simulated image.  The project will also apply
              Bayesian statistical methods to assess the inverse problem of obtaining
              important physiologic parameters (e.g. flow rate) given a MR echo signal.  The
              Phase I project will utilize arbitrary sequences within a laminar flow field. 
              Phase II will extend the simulation capabilities to include turbulent flow,
              injection of contrast agents, and neural net logic for the inverse problem.  A
              number of imaging system manufacturers have expressed a need for a
              computational optimization tool for MR flow imaging.  If the approach is
              successful, the cost savings could be substantial: currently, one hour on a
              commercial MR scanner is valued at around $1500, while one hour on a computer
              workstation is typically valued at around $9.
