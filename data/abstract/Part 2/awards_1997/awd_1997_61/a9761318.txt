Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project from Systran Corporation
              will determine the feasibility of constructing a dual-network PC cluster
              utilizing both networking technologies to achieve very low latency for
              synchronizing communication and providing wide bandwidth for bulk data
              transfer.  Upon proving the feasibility of this proposed concept we will
              develop a new product which takes advantage of two existing families of
              Systran's networking technologies: SCRAMNet and FibreXpress.  SCRAMNet (Shared
              Common RAM Network) is a replicated shared memory network, which features
              ultra-low latency communications, (i.e., network communications at memory
              access latencies).  FibreXpress is an implementation of ANSI standard Fibre
              Channel, which offers very high bandwidths (1-Gb/sec is available already with
              4-Gb/sec predicted by the year 2000). This research project offers to take
              advantage of both the economies of scale of mass-market commodity PC class
              microprocessors and off-the-shelf networking technology  This combination could
              make networks of PCs an attractive paradigm for achieving scalable parallel
              computing environments.  The low cost of  modern interconnection network
              components (network interface cards, hubs, cabling etc.) open the possibility
              of using multiple different networking technologies simultaneously, each to
              their best advantage.  The prototype product that will be developed during the
              next phase of this research will be primarily aimed at customers who are using
              compute-intensive MPI-based parallel software.  These customers range from
              commercial companies (such as, pharmaceutical companies who are performing ab
              initio calculations for drug design) to government customers (such as, Air
              Force Labs, which are performing large scale fluid flow calculations). The
              expectation of this project is a high level of performance, which rivals
              multi-processor supercomputers at a fraction of the cost.
