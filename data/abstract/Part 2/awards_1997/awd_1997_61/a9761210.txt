Abstract    :
              ***  9761210  Ellison    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will adapt a proprietary low pressure microwave plasma technology for
              use in a plasma-activated deposition system, demonstrating high-rate deposition
              of optical and electronic coatings.  Sputtering is almost exclusively used to
              deposit optical coatings for high value-added products, e.g. nonglare coatings
              and low emissivity coatings for windows.  Typical deposition rates are 1-2
              nanommeters per second (nm/s), and costs are of $2-10 per m2/100 nm.  By
              contrast evaporation is used for extremely high-speed, low-cost deposition of
              coatings onto commodity film substrates for applications, such as food
              packaging, at one thousandth the cost of sputtering.  Typical rates and costs
              are 300 nm/s and $0.10 per m2/100 nm.  However, evaporative coatings do not
              have the required mechanical properties or uniformity necessary for most
              optical or electrical applications.  Phase I will show that the evaporation
              process, if enhanced with a microwave plasma, will produce coatings with the
              mechanical properties required for optical and electronic applications, using
              techniques already demonstrated and commercialized in large scale
              manufacturing.  Such coatings could, thereby, come into widespread use.   
              Commerical applications are expected to include selective solar radiation
              control coatings and low cost thin film photovoltaics.  ***
