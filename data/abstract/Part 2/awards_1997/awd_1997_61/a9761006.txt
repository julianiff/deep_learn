Abstract    :
              ***  9761006  Carrig    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project uses advanced solid-state laser technology and lidar engineering for a
              compact, turn-key, eyesafe differential absorption lidar (DIAL), suitable for
              range-resolved atmospheric profiling of ozone to distances of up to three
              kilometers.  Such systems are needed in municipalities in ozone nonattainment
              status in order to target actual pollution sources.  The new DIAL system is
              based on a frequency-agile ultraviolet (UV) laser transmitter that is
              substantially smaller and more efficient than existing UV laser sources.  This
              will permit mobile remote sensors that are lighter, more compact, and
              potentially less expensive than current UV DIALS.  Further, Phase I will
              incorporate lidar transceiver technology effective in flight-qualified
              wind-sensing systems.  This includes a real-time signal processor with an
              easy-to-use graphical user interface. In Phase I a complete turn-key system
              design will be completed.  In Phase II a prototype device would be built.  The
              applicability of this lidar for atmospheric measurements of sulfur dioxide and
              particulate matter will also be investigated.  The primary market is local and
              regional municipalities declared to be in ozone nonattainment status.  The
              sensor can be modified for profiling of sulfur dioxide.  The instrument will
              also be scaleable for long-range tropospheric and stratospheric ozone
              measurements.  ***
