Abstract    :
              ***   9761485  Abramovich    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
              Phase I project will explore magnetohydrodynamic feedback and spectrum
              translation to create a new class of very broad-band, wide dynamic range
              seismometers.  The new instruments will be based on molecular electronic
              technology (MET), with force balancing feedback provided by the
              magnetohydrodynamic effect on the electrolyte, which serves as the inertial
              mass.  Radical noise reduction will be achieved via the use of signal
              modulation to produce spectrum translation.  Phase I will develop an instrument
              equal in performance to the best traditional-technology seismometers while
              retaining desirable features of MET seismic sensors, e.g., low cost, low power,
              ruggedness, and suitability for volume production.    These seismometers are
              expected to find commercial applications wherever top-of-the line traditional
              seismometers are currently employed.  Their low cost makes them particularly
              attractive for use in large sensor network and education applications.  ***
