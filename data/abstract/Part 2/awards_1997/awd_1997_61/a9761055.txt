Abstract    :
                          ***  9761055  Sekino    This Small Business Innovation Research
              Phase I project will evaluate a new class of nonlinear optical organic
              compounds, bichromophores, containing both heterocyclic donors and acceptors in
              the same molecule.  These materials have high second order optical
              nonlinearities, are less toxic and/or carcinogenic and have higher thermal
              stability than many of the chromophores conventionally studied.  Numerical
              simulations will be used to assist in the materials design.  Time Dependent
              Hartree Fock will be used to obtain the frequency dependent density matrix in
              order to calculate the dynamic hyperpolarizabilities for large molecules such
              as bichromophores.  Modern theoretical and software engineering techniques make
              feasible large scale simulations by addressing issues of CPU time and data
              storage.  Synthesis and laser characterization validation will result in
              selecting a particular type of heterocyclic bichromophore material having the
              most potential use in optoelectronic devices.    The resulting optical
              materials will have commercial applications in photonics.  Photonics is a
              critical technology finding applications in communications, 3-D data storage,
              optical computing and also medical applications.  The resulting software will
              satisfy present market demand for large molecular systems simulation software.
