Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I will develop coatings
              containing post-consumer commingled polymer (PCCP) waste.  The very large
              volume of plastics in the waste stream is a significant environmental burden. 
              The use of plastics is increasing rapidly due to the advent of new resins and
              increased efficiencies in polymer processing.  Concurrently environmentally
              benign coatings are needed to protect the civil infrastructure from the effects
              of corrosion.  Increasingly restrictive environmental regulations regarding
              volatile organic compounds (VOC's) may soon ban the use of existing coating
              systems that contain high levels of VOC's.  This SBIR Phase I will produce a
              composite polymer powder containing PCCP and a commercially available ethylene
              methacrylic-acid copolymer (EMAA).  The composite powder will be used to
              deposit barrier comings onto steel substrates using a thermal spray process. 
              Specific commercial applications are expected to include include:  i) bridge
              surfaces,  ii) pipe coatings and linings,  iii) flood-gates,  iv) chemical
              and/or water containment,  v) sealers for hazardous waste containment,  vi)
              domestic waste containment,  vii) transfer chutes, and viii) propeller blades.
