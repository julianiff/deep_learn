Abstract    :
              ***  9761329  Yializis         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project proposes a new nanostructural fabrication process for the production of
              high strength ceramic-polymer nanolaminate materials.  A patented ultra high
              speed polymer deposition process allows the formation, in a vacuum environment,
              of self supported multilayer structures with thousands of nanosize inorganic
              and polymer layers.  The polymer materials are highly cross-linked radiation
              cured mutlifunctional acrylate monomers tht have high thermal and mechanical
              stability.  The inorganic layers can be ceramic layers that include materials
              such as alumina, silica, zirconia, and titania. Crystal nucleation and grain
              growth of the ceramic layers can be influenced by functionalization of the
              polymer materials.  The proposed investigation will systematically explore the
              limits of this new process with particular focus on the mechanical material
              properties.  In the phase I work, materials such as alumina/polymer and
              silica/polymer will be processed into nanolaminate composites and the
              mechanical properties of composites with varying ceramic layer thickness and
              ceramic / polymer thickness ratios will be compared to basic bulk material
              properties.  The phase II wok will seek further optimization and in-depth
              testing of materials for specific industrial applications.       High strength,
              lightweight, abrasion resistant ceramic-polymer composites may have a range of
              applications that includes components for aircraft, automobiles, protective
              materials for corrosive and oxidative environments, and biocompatible
              orthopedic components.  ***
