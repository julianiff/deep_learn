Abstract    :
              ***  9761534  Marx  Sight Systems Inc. will develop a low cost, high speed
              critical dimension measurement tool for 0.18  m features in the IC and data
              storage industry.  This tool takes advantage of an optical technique developed
              at the California Institute of Technology, that exploits the polarization
              properties of light diffracted by a subwavelength-sized structure.  The cost
              per measurement of the tool developed will be less than one twelfth that of
              existing, competing SEM or AFM technologies.  ***
