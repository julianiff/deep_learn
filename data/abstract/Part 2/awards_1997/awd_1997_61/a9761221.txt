Abstract    :
              ***  9761221  Withers    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 project
              will produce a detailed design of a high-temperature-superconductive (HTS)
              nuclear-magnetic-resonance spectroscopy (NMRS) probe for operation in a 21-T
              (900-MHz) magnet.  High-sensitivity probes have recently been commercially
              introduced at proton frequencies of 400, 500, and 600 MHz.  The highest
              specified proton sensitivity is the 3000:1 of the 600-MHz probe.  The probe
              designed during Phase 1 will be built during Phase 2 and evaluated in the 21-T
              magnet at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, FL.  This
              probe will have a proton sensitivity of 6000:1, twice that now available.  In
              Phase 1, RF test coils will be fabricated, ready for in-field characterization
              as soon as a high-field magnet is available.  This will be the highest field at
              which RF properties of HTS materials have been measured.    Approximately 1500
              high-resolution NMRS probes are sold per year.  High-sensitivity
              superconductive probes are expected to reach 20% of this unit volume. At an
              end-user price of $80,000 per unit, this is a $24,000,000 market.  Extension of
              this product line to the highest available field strengths will provide the
              ultimate in NMR sensitivity.  ***
