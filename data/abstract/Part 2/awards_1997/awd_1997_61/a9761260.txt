Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project has the following
              objectives:  (1) To genetically manipulate C. Flavigena to synthesize increased
              amounts of the KUSP1 polyglucan and (2) investigate the feasibility of new
              applications of the polymer. C. Flavigena is a gram positive bacterium; hence
              its useful beta-1,3-polyglucan product should not be contaminated with
              lipopolysaccharide endotoxins.  The polymer is insoluble at neutral pH and
              soluble in mildly alkaline solutions; hence its gellation is easily controlled.
               Modern molecular biological techniques will be employed to develop a KUSP1
              `over-producing` strain.  In parallel we will examine the applicability of
              KUSP1-based gel systems for electrophoretic applications.  The successful
              completion of this study will result in a ready supply of this polymer at an
              attractive cost for the commercial applications listed:  a) Enhanced oil
              recovery via `in situ gellation` of the polymers in reservoirs, b)
              Encapsulation of medicines for `controlled release`, c) Encapsulation of
              agricultural chemicals, and d) Gelling agent/thickener/stabilizer in food
              products.  This award is supported by the Small Business Innovation Research
              Program and the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research
              (EPSCoR).
