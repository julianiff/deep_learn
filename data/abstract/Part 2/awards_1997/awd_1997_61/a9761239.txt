Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop
              solid-state, low cost, intelligent sensor systems for fuel cell reformer
              control technology.  The state-of-the-art sensor technology have limitations
              that are not suited for compositional monitoring of a number of reducing gases
              that are found in a fuel cell reforming process.  The proposed sensing material
              will be Ga2o3 nanoceramics that have distinct relative sensitivities with
              respect to different reducing gases at different operating temperatures.  A
              sensor array with each sensor element operating at different temperatures will
              be used in the Sensor system, and an on-chip-pattern-recognition neural network
              will be developed to relate the response matrix from the sensor array to
              analyze concentration.  During Phase I, Nanomaterials Research Corporation
              (NRC) will establish the proof-of-concept that commercially useful,
              nano-engineered sensor arrays can be prepared and those
              on-chip-pattern-recognition neural networks offer significant performance
              advantage.  Phase II effort will Seek to optimize the technology and produce
              prototypes for customer qualification.  Phase III will commercialize the
              technology.  The proposed research would provide solid-state, low cost,
              intelligent sensor systems for fuel cell reformer control technology.  Chemical
              sensor systems for compositional detection of multicomponent gas mixtures can
              also be extremely useful for environmental monitoring, automobile engine
              control technology, and chemical and petrochemical industries.
