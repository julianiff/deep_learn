Abstract    :
              ***  9761113  Zhan    'I'his Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              will develop a flexible software environment for modeling time series which
              exhibit structural features such as level and trend breaks, as well as
              outliers. Such time series occur in many applications including finance, target
              tracking, and other kinds of recognition oriented signal processing. 
              Currently, commercial software is not available that can adequately model such
              time series. The research will seek to estimate the parameters of such state
              space models using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which provide a
              feasible way of sampling from complex posterior distributions. MCMC has been
              recently applied to solve a variety of previously intractable problems
              involving high dimensional integration.    In the time series context, MCMC
              methodology will be applied to  (1) posterior densities for structural changes,
              including mixture distributions,  (2) distributions involving hidden state
              processes for modeling switching behavior and         detecting outliers,  (3)
              thick tailed distributions of the state and the observation noise processes in
              order to robustly         model anomalies and heterogeneity.    Because of the
              wide variety of applications -- in environmental modeling, engineering,
              economics and statistics -- a ready market for this software is expected to
              develop.  ***
