Abstract    :
              9761168  Hoang  This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              will develop a rugged low-cost, reliable, general purpose data acquisition and
              control system for autonomous remote platforms to collect and disseminate
              meteorological and environmental data harsh environments.  An objective is to
              communicate with a variety of instruments and sensors at high data rates via
              analog-to-digital converter board and digital input/output ports and at low
              data rates via standard serial lines.  The data acquisition design concept is
              to let the scientific users adapt specific sensors to the system without
              modification to the system hardware and software (plug-and-play-approach).  The
              innovation of this data acquisition system is to use advanced low-earth orbit
              satellites for telecommand/control and data retrieval from remote sites through
              commercially available electronic mail or the world-wide-web.  Potential
              applications include simplified communications for business professionals and
              reporters, for television networks, construction engineers, geologists, people
              living in thinly-populated areas, disaster relief operations, and in the
              shipping, air transport and trucking industries.
