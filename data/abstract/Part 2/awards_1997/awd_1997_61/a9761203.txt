Abstract    :
              ***  9761203  Hu  Nanomaterials Research Corp. will develop a novel varistor,
              from nanostructured ferroelectric materials.  The innovation is based on a
              unique varistor behaviour observed in ultrafine-grained ferroelectric thin
              films.  These varistors  are expected to  yield a new range of electronic
              applications based on the function of current regulation.  ***
