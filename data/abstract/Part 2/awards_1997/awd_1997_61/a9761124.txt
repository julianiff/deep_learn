Abstract    :
              ***  9761124  Mozhi    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              will develop an environmentally compliant pulsed plasma spray technique for
              solid polymer coatings.  The pulsed approach opens the opportunity to 1)
              deposit functionally gradient polymer coatings, 2) alternatively preheat the
              substrate and deposit coatings, 3) provide finer control and uniform
              temperature distribution for all powders, and 4) provide finer control of the
              substrate temperature.  The overall research objective is to experimentally
              demonstrate this technique.  During Phase 1, the firm will: 1) Utilize a 1-D
              code to determine optimum parameters for fabrication of a sprayer; 2)
              Experimentally demonstrate deposition of polyurethane on Al and analyze the
              coating; 3) Design an engineering prototype plasma polymer sprayer; 4) Identify
              specific coating applications that make best use of the high performance
              capability of proposed plasma sprayer.  The anticipated Phase I result is
              successful deposition of solid polymer coatings with superior properties.   
              Polymer coatings will find applications in the commercial aircraft industry,
              the auto industry for corrosion protection of cars and trucks, and in general
              to the commercial coating industry.  Applications for polymer coatings abound
              in many industries for corrosion protection, electrical insulation, and wear
              resistance,  ***
