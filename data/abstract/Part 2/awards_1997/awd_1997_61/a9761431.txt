Abstract    :
              ***  9761431  LeGore  Sensor R&D Inc. will study the feasibility of a novel
              class of highly sensitive and selective in-situ sensors which can be applied to
              detect  toxic gases.   These sensors will combine the portability and low cost
              of the chemiresistive Taguchi sensor, with the sensitivity and selectivity of
              laboratory techniques such as gas chromotography and chemiluminescence, to
              produce a product with significant market potential in applications such as
              emission monitors, process control sensors and environmental sensors.  ***
