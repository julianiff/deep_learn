Abstract    :
              ***  9761362  Xiao         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of exploiting the unique properties
              of an exciting new class of "nanophase" materials (ie. atomic-scale particles
              on the order of several manometers, where 1 nm = 10 angstroms) as the active
              ingredients for high performance rechargeable nickel alkaline batteries.  US
              Nanocorp's (USN) principals have developed proprietary techniques for the
              synthesis and processing of nanostructred battery materials.  USN has begun
              efforts to fabricate high density nickel electrodes where the active material
              is nanoporous (and mesoporous), so that the pore surface area remains high for
              effective electrolyte irrigation, yet the total pore volume is reduced in
              comparison to electrodes formulated from conventional and so called "spherical"
              nickel hydroxide.  The increased density results in higher capacity.  High
              utilization has been achieved by USN in preliminary lab cell tests.  The Phase
              II program will develop prototype cells based on optimized electrodes.      
              This novel approach can be applied to a wide array of battery materials.
              Rechargeable batteries comprise a word-wide business of more than $16 B/annum,
              of which alkaline batteries have a 20% market share ($3 B/annum).  This would
              have profound implications for improved batteries for medical, commercial
              (power tool), and consumer applications, as well as large capacity batteries
              for cordless lawn mowers, scooters, electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles.  ***
