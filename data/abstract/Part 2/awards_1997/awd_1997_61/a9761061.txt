Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project plans to demonstrate
              that compression-ignition (diesel) engines are an attractive candidate
              technology for light duty vehicles due to their much higher baseline thermal
              efficiency than spark-ignited, throttled gasoline fueled engines.  Diesel
              engines are used extensively in Class 3 to Class 8 vehicles but will require
              significant reductions in emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate
              matter before current and anticipated light duty emissions standards may be
              met.  The use of present day heavy duty diesel engine technology in a mid-size
              vehicle would imply NOx emissions of 0.8-1.0 grams per mile (g/mi.), well above
              Tier I standards of 0.4 g/mi. or ULEV standards of 0.2 g/mi.  Furthermore, the
              lack of real-time sensor technology to characterize NOx emissions prevents the
              application of recent innovations in control, which may address the nonlinear,
              varying nature of Cl engine dynamics.  In Phase I, NeuroDyne and Ion Optics
              propose to apply innovative IR `smart` sensing technology to identify and
              characterize NOx emissions using a Navistar V-8 diesel engine.  This
              combination will yield a small, low power, thermally stable and cost effective
              IR emissions sensor applicable to diesel or spark-ignition engines.  This
              effort will provide the necessary feedback information to enable the
              development of reduced emissions control in next generation vehicles.  Eaton
              Corporation has reviewed our design and has offered to beta-test the sensor for
              potential inclusion in their automotive and truck equipment product line.
