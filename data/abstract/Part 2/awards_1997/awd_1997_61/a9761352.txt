Abstract    :
              ***  9761352    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              will develop a novel optical sensing system for real time measurement of
              dissolved carbon dioxide in the cell culture medium for bioreactor systems. 
              The concentration of carbon dioxide in the bioreactor medium is an important
              indicator for respiratory and bioactivity of microorganisms and a useful
              parameter for controlling cell metabolism in reactors.  Carbon dioxide
              accumulation in the bioreactor medium has a variety of influences on microbial
              morphology, and inhibition of cell growth and product formation.  With the lack
              of reliable sensing devices, dissolved carbon dioxide in the bioreactor medium
              is not currently monitored.  We propose an optical sensor which will provide
              rapid and continuous determination of carbon dioxide concentration in the cell
              culture medium for various fermentation processes.  The proposed technique is
              based on trapping carbon dioxide in a polymer membrane which repels liquid, and
              spectral measurement of carbon dioxide specific absorption in the infrared
              region.    The probe to monitor dissolved carbon dioxide in reactors will have
              significant value to the biotechnology and pharmaceutical markets.  The field
              of human therapeutics requires close quality control of materials such as
              recombinant bacteria.  Development of a dissolved carbon dioxide sensor is
              important, since there is no sensor currently available.  ***
