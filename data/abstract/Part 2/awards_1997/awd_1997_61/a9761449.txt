Abstract    :
              ***  9761449  Valamanchili    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project will attempt to design and build a variable geometry rheometer and a
              companion package of data reduction and modeling software that allows for the
              study of field dependent fluids, under application of varying electric or
              magnetic fields.  Understanding and quantifying the phenomenology of smart
              materials is essential to their widespread use in industrial and technological
              settings, where issues of reliability and quality control are essential.  Such
              understanding requires a broad class of material models to characterize,
              interpret, and extrapolate the experiments.  By the use of plug-ins and
              fittings, the rheometer to be developed will allow for both steady and
              oscillatory experiments to be conducted in the cone-cup, plate-cup, and Couette
              geometries under conditions of both controlled stress and strain rates.  These
              geometries allow for the measurement of shear stresses and certain normal
              stress differences, as well as for cross correlations with models.    There is
              significant potential for field dependent fluids to be used in industries
              ranging from automotive to rehabilitation.  Many companies are working towards
              developing numerous devices which use field dependent fluids.  A key role will
              be played by measurement and modeling packages, that allow for the accurate
              characterization of these fluids.   ***
