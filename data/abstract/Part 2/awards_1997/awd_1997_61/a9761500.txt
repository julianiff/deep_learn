Abstract    :
              ***  9761500  Capote         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project aims to develop entirely new electrographic toners that, when combined
              with well-known electrographic printing techniques, can be used to
              inexpensively and reliably apply metallizations and dielectrics to multichip
              modules (MCM) with features as small as ten microns or less.  There is an unmet
              need today for a simplified, lower cost faster turnaround method for
              fabricating high density MCMs substrates.  The emergence of commercial
              compact-information products, such as personal digital assistants, wireless
              communicators and distributed sensor systems are creating a revolution in the
              way commercial electronics are packaged.  These products share the attributes
              of being driven by small size, lightweight, high-operating frequencies and low
              cost.  The proposal entails creation of nanophase powders which are sinterable
              during the electrographig development and fixing cycles by means of novel
              adhesive fluxes and coatings, When printed, the powders can be sintered
              together by heating to a modest temperature, forming a continuous metal film
              without having to overheat the MCM polymeric substrate.       There is an unmet
              need for providing low-cost, fast turnaround high density multichip modules and
              high density printed circuits to microelectronics manufacturers.  Such a new
              technology could reduce MCM deposition capital equipment entry cost by an order
              of magnitude while at the same time increasing metallization production
              throughput by an order of magnitude.  ***
