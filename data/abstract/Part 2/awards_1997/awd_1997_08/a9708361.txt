Abstract    :
              9708361  Ruiz    This grant provides $80,000 two-years partial salary support
              for  a technician at the University of Arizona to oversee operations  and
              maintenance, train new users and develop geochemical  separations and mass
              spectrometric techniques utilizing both the  thermal ionization mass
              spectrometer (TIMS) and the inductively  coupled plasma mass spectrometer
              (ICP-MS) in the W.M. Keck  Isotope Laboratory. This lab is actively applying
              isotopic data  to elucidate mechanisms of crustal and mantle evolution and 
              metallogenesis.  Specific examples include, Re/Os isotopic dating  of
              molybdenite to constrain metallogenic epochs in the  southwestern U.S., Re/Os
              isotopic characterization of platinum  group element (PGE) deposits in
              mafic-ultramafic complexes and  geochemical and geochronologic studies of the
              tectonics of  Mexico.  This group is also conducting developmental work on 
              coupling laser ablation with ICP mass spectrometry, a newly  burgeoning and
              potentially promising analytical technique for  micro-scale studies of trace
              element distributions in solid  geologic samples.  ***
