Abstract    :
              ***  9708939  ORWOLL  This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and
              Facilities   (CRIF) Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at The
              College of   William and Mary  acquire a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance
              (NMR)   spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
                including the following: (1) synthesis and characterization of  
              dicyanoanthracene-B-cyclodextrins, (2) polymer degradation and   stabilization,
              (3) transition metals in multidentate chelates, (4)   coordination polymers,
              (5) structure- reactivity studies of simple   organic molecules, and (6)
              organometallic complexes, polymerizations,   electronically-delocalized
              systems, thermally-stable electrooptic   modulators.    Nuclear Magnetic
              Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool   available to chemists
              for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.   It is used to identify
              unknown substances, characterize specific   arrangements of atoms within
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of   interactions between molecules in
              solution. Access to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to
              chemists who are carrying out frontier   research. The results from these NMR
              studies are useful in the areas such   as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
