              Title: Observational Studies of Stratospheric and  Stratosphere/Troposphere
              Coupling    The objective of the proposal research is to use observational 
              data, like the recent reanalyzed consistent data sets, to explore  stratosphere
              variability, stratosphere-troposphere coupling, and  equatorial troposphere
              waves.  A better understanding of the  stratospheric variability will allow
              increased confidence in global  change.  In the long term another benefit of a
              better understanding  of stratosphere-troposphere coupling will be improved
              numerical  weather forecast models and climate prediction.
