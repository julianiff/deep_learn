Abstract    :
              ***  9708881  SWEENEY  This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation
              and Facilities   (CRIF) Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at
              Hunter College   of CUNY in acquiring an electrospray (ESI) mass spectrometer
              interfaced   with an HPLC. This equipment will enhance research in a number of
              areas   including the following: (1) self-assembly of supramolecular porphyrin 
               arrays, (2) technetium complexes of metal oxides, (3) mitomycin-DNA   adducts,
              (4) the cycloaddition path to glycosal transfer, and (5)   synthesis of
              adjacently linked polyethers.     Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to
              probe intimate structural   details and to obtain the molecular compositions of
              a vast array of   organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. The
              addition of the   technique of electrospray extends the range of MS to protein
              and nucleic   acid molecular weights far beyond any other technique. The use of
                electrospray ionization in combination with high resolution provides the  
              latest technique available in mass spectrometry. It affords the chemist   one
              of the most powerful tools available for the characterization of   compounds.
              The acquisition of this capability in mass spectrometry is   essential for the
              prosecution of frontier research in many fields of   chemistry.        ***
