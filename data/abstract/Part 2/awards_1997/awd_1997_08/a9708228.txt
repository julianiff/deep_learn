Abstract    :
                This research project, which is supported by the Analytical and  Surface
              Chemistry Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary  Activities, focuses on
              the development of a toroid cavity probe for  use as an NMR detector for
              electrophoresis.  Professor Johnson and  his student at the University of North
              Carolina at Chapel Hill will  construct a toroid cavity probe, characterize its
              performance as an  electrophoresis detector, and write programs necessary for
              the  handling of data.  This instrument will be able to detect all  components
              in a mixture and the analysis time will be less than 100  msec.  These
              measurements will provide information about the  chemical interactions that
              occur in ordered media, such a micelles.   This information will be useful in
              understanding the behavior of  these materials as pseudo-stationary phases in
              many separation  processes.  In this project toroid cavity detectors will
              constructed and  designed for use in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to
               permit studies of electrophoretic processes.  In addition to the  construction
              of this new detector for nuclear magnetic resonance  spectroscopy, programs
              will be written to acquire and handle the  data produced in these experiments. 
              Analysis of all components in  a mixture will be possible and the analysis time
              will be less than  100 milliseconds.  This new instrumental capability will
              have  applications ranging from microscopic imaging to the study of the 
              interactions that occur in high pressure fluids.
