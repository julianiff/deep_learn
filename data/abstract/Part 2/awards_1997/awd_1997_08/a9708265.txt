Abstract    :
              This award renews support for the Laser Research Facility at the Harrison  
              Spectroscopy Laboratory at MIT directed by Professor M. S. Feld.  The   support
              derives from the Division of Chemistry and the Office of   Multidisciplinary
              Activities of the Directorate for Mathematical and   Physical Sciences.  The
              Laser Research Facility is a shared research   facility in which physical
              scientists in chemistry, physics,   environmental science, and engineering
              pursue a broad range of problems   using lasers and state-of-the-art
              spectroscopic techniques.  The research   is focussed in six areas:
              spectroscopy of nanostructured materials, Raman   spectroscopy, ultrasensitive
              absorption-based laser techniques,   picosecond dynamics, optical physics and
              source development, and   environmental science.  The Facility features
              undergraduate, graduate,   and postdoctoral education and training, as well as
              outreach through   dissemination of scientific results and topical seminars. 
              The Laser Research Facility, as a shared facility with state-of-the-art  
              equipment and personnel skilled in its use, enables new research  
              opportunities to be seized upon and carried out quickly, economically,   and
              effectively.  It leads to new collaborations and research programs   that would
              not exist in the absence of the facility.
