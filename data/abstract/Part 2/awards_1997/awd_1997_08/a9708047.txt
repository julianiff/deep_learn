Abstract    :
              This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
              Indiana University, studying the role of voluntary organizations in the
              migration decision-making of immigrants from Belize to the US.  The student's
              hypothesis is that migrant organizations facilitate transnational economic and
              social ties more than assimilation or the reinforcement of ethnic enclaves. 
              The assumption is that Belizeans who are active participants in migrant
              organizations have at their disposal information and economic as well as
              cultural resources which influence their circulation patterns.  The methodology
              involves traditional ethnography as well as formal surveys in Chicago and in
              Belize, the collection of life histories, in-depth interviews and participant
              observation at Belizean organizational and cultural activities.  The research
              will take place in Belize City and Chicago.   This research is important
              because it will advance our understanding of the motives and constraints of
              migrants in light of the actual social resources available to them.  Given that
              migration and transnationalism are important features of contemporary social
              life, the knowledge this project will create will be a valuable addition for
              policy makers and planners as well as scholars.
