Abstract    :
                Isotope fractionation effect during soil uptake of methane, carbon monoxide
              and hydrogen  This proposal was submitted in response to the Environmental
              Geochemistry and Biogeochemistry (EGB) solicitation, NSF 06-152.  It is being
              jointly funded by the Divisions of Ocean Sciences and Atmospheric Science.  
              The objective of this proposal is to measure isotope fractionation during soil
              uptake of carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4) and hydrogen (H2).  These
              fractionation effects are important to quantify so that continued atmospheric
              measurements of these greenhouse gases can take full advantage of isotopic data
              to fingerprint specific sources and sinks.  This will allow for a significant
              advancement in our understanding of the global cycles of these radiatively
              important trace gases.  The PI's propose to empirically measure the isotopic
              fractionation effect using soil enclosures and measuring air samples collected
              as a time-series in the headspace.  The site specific data will be extrapolated
              to regional and global scales using soil characteristics (e.g. temperature,
              moisture, porosity, composition, etc.).  Overall, the proposed measurements,
              when coupled with on-going time series measurements of the isotopic composition
              of CH4, CO and anticipated measurements of H2, will provide the framework
              needed to determine the influence of soil uptake on the seasonal changes in the
              concentration and isotopic composition of these gases in temperate northern
              latitudes and on the interhemispheric asymmetry of their isotopic composition.
