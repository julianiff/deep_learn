Abstract    :
                  9708975  Chang  Structural health monitoring is an emerging technology which
               is based on the smart structures concept by combing sensing  technology with a
              knowledge of material/structural damage  characteristics to monitor the
              condition of structures in  real time while in service.  The Objective of the
              workshop  are to assess the current state-of-the-art technologies  related to
              the field, to identify key and emerging issues in  research and development,
              and to promote exchanges and cross-  fertilization among many disciplines.   
              The conclusion of the workshop will result in proceedings  containing the
              discussion and presentation of the workshop  as well as the formation of a
              technical committee consisting  of key personnel from governments, industry,
              and academe.  The committee will be responsible for developing appropriate 
              guidelines and recommendations for government agencies and  industries to
              further pursue structural health monitoring  development.
