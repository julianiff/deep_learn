Abstract    :
              9708399  Loftness  There   is   a  major  need  for  advancing  the  scientific 
              understanding,      technological      innovation,       and 
              design/engineering   standards  for  integrating   building  systems   to  
              improve  overall  building  performance   and  environmental quality; such
              concerns exist equally  for  new  construction  and  for retrofitting of 
              existing  buildings.  Advances  in  scientific and engineering understanding 
              will  focus  on  the performance of integrated systems -  thermal,  visual,
              acoustic, spatial, and air quality, as well as  long  term integrity.  Advances
              in technological innovation would  focus   on  innovation  in  structure, 
              enclosure,   thermal  conditioning,  ventilation, lighting, power and 
              networking,  and interior space definition; the anticipated advances will  be 
              present  both in individual products and  in  integrated  systems.   Advances
              in practice would focus on the  building  delivery process, incorporating
              issues such as codes, design  standards,  education, quality assurance 
              procedures,  and  prototyping  of  flexibly  integrated  systems   to   ensure 
              organizational flexibility, technological adaptability,  and  long term
              environmental quality.    The  strategic research needs may vary significantly
              between  advancing  building  systems, integration  for  performance,  indoor 
              environmental quality, global resource  utilization,  and    the   
              competitiveness   of   the    United    States  building/construction 
              industry.  This  NSF  Research  Needs  workshop  will  be held in 1997,
              assembling  key  researchers, practitioners, government and industry 
              participants  to  map out  state-of-the-art  conditions and  to  identify 
              research needs                and  priorities.  The  workshop  report   will  
              be  distributed  to institutions, organizations, and  individual  researchers 
              active in this research area:  the report  will  also be available
              electronically over the World Wide Web.
