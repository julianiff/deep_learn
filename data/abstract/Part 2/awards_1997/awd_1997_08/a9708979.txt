Abstract    :
              9708979  Drewes  Of over a quarter of a million herpetological specimens at the
              California Academy of Sciences, 97,861 specimens bear metal tags. The metal
              tags, upon which catalog number and/or locality data are embossed, were part of
              the standard curatorial procedure during the first half of this century as
              outlined by then-curator Joseph R. Slevin in 1927. Because of their large size
              relative to the size of the specimens, and their mass, the tags have caused
              physical damage to specimens, particularly small fragile ones. Over the years
              many of these tags have corroded, making the catalog numbers they bear
              illegible. This project will replace the metal tags with fiber catalog tags
              consistent with the rest of the collection, in order to mitigate and prevent
              further damage to specimens  and loss of irretrievable data. NSF funds will
              provide dedicated technical assistance and new prenumbered fiber tags to
              replace all metal tags in the collection.
