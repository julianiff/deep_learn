Abstract    :
              Two investigators are conducting complementary numerical modeling to gain
              understanding of gravity wave propagation and spectral evolution and the
              parameterization of these effects in large-scale models of the atmosphere.  One
              employs fully nonlinear three dimensional studies of wave superposition and
              interactions to assess spectral evolution with altitude, influences on wave
              anisotropy and momentum fluxes from mean and low-frequency wave shears, and the
              dissipation accompanying wave superposition.  The other addresses wave
              propagation and behavior in low-frequency wave and mean shears at thermospheric
              altitudes where three dimensional effects are not important in determining wave
              amplitudes and mean flow interactions.  Both approaches substantially revise
              and update existing parameterization of gravity wave effects employed in
              several models of the lower and middle atmosphere and thermosphere. 
              Specifically, the revisions:  (1) more accurately describe the effects of wave
              superposition, interactions and instability; (2) replicate observations of wave
              activity, variability and effects; and (3) extend to greater altitudes than
              previously possible with parameterization schemes.
