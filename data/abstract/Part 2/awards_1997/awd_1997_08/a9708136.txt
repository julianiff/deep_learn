Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    97-08136  Ward  Ecology of hot spring microbial mat communities:
              Causes and importance of biodiversity.    The objective of this research is to
              determine whether the same forces that caused the evolution of plant and animal
              species also caused the evolution of microbial species. We use molecular
              methods to detect heretofore unrecognized microorganisms in natural geothermal
              environments, which serve as model systems for understanding the biodiversity,
              ecology and evolution of microbial species. We will study whether the bacteria
              we have detected in Yellowstone National Park hot springs evolved-like
              Galapagos finches-by adapting to specific environmental features (e.g., 
              temperature, light, pH, sulfide), and whether bacteria in geographically
              separated hot springs constitute different species (like flightless birds on
              different continents).  These findings will help us define what bacterial
              species are, and gain a predictive knowledge of their ecological importance and
              of their recovery for potential biotechnological use. Despite out extensive use
              of microbial products such as antibiotics, fewer than 1% of the species of
              microorganisms are known to science.
