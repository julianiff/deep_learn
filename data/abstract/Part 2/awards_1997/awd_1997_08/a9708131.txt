Abstract    :
              9708131  Hennage  The Quantum Optoelectronics '97 meeting is the fifth in a
              series of topical meetings that explore advances in the science and technology
              related to the interplay between photonics and electronics.  The purpose of the
              meeting is to bring together scientists and engineers who work on fundamental
              issues, new materials and diagnostic tools, and device applications, to provide
              a forum where state-of-the art results are presented and new directions can be
              determined.    Support is provided for travel for students and young faculty to
              attend this meeting, who would not otherwise be able to do so.  ***
