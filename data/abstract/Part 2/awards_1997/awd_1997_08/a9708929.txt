Abstract    :
                  The overall objective of this proposal is to establish that  a fast and
              efficient constrained Molecular Dynamics (MD)  algorithm developed by us
              recently (called the Newton-Euler  Inverse Mass Operator, NEIMO) can serve as a
              powerful tool  for understanding the long term conformational and  structural
              changes in large proteins and enzymes.  Such a  tool could be used to
              characterize the interdomain motions  in molecules and would considerably
              enhance the  understanding of structure and activity relationships.
