Abstract    :
               9708653 Stickney  This project, supported by the DMR Electronic Materials and
              CHE Analytical and Surface Chemistry programs, addresses electrochemical atomic
              layer epitaxy(ECALE) of semiconductor films, as well as the inverse process of
              electrochemical digital etching, removal of material a monolayer at a time
              through control of electrochemical potential. The approach employs UHV surface
              analysis techniques to identify and investigate surface limited reactions. The
              structure and composition of surfaces resulting from electrochemical surface
              limited processes will be investigated as a function of relevant conditions
              such as the potential and solution composition. One of the important thrusts of
              the research is to follow the evolution of defects, atomic layer by atomic
              layer.  %%% This project represents innovative, forefront research in a unique
              topical area of materials science having high potential for technological
              relevance.  The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a
              fundamental level to important aspects of electrochemistry and to the control
              of new deposition and etching processes with advantages of reduced temperature
              operation, and processing of electronic/photonic materials at reduced costs. An
              important feature of the program is the integration of research and education
              through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically
              significant area. ***
