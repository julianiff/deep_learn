Abstract    :
              9708000  Hughes    This grant provides $69,900 as partial support of the costs
              of  acquiring workstations, PC's and hard disk and tape drive mass  storage for
              the International Seismological Center (ISC).  The  ISC is the international
              organization charged with assembly of  final seismological observations
              including solutions of  hypocenters and calculations of magnitudes of global
              seismic  events.  These data are currently published in the Bulletin of  the
              ISC and the Regional Catalogue of Earthquakes in both hard  copy and on CD-ROM.
               This computational equipment will allow the  ISC to develop routines for
              interactive analysis and retrieval of  seismic data via the Internet so that
              the international  seismological community can have more rapid access to
              available  data products in their studies of deep Earth structure and for 
              earthquake hazard assessment.  ***
