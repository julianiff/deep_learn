Abstract    :
              9708057  Chang    An interdisciplinary master's graduate program is under 
              development at the Materials Research Center at Northwestern  University which
              will prepare educators for teaching  Materials Science and Technology at the
              high school and  junior college levels.  A total of six masters degree 
              students will be jointly supported by the NSF and  Northwestern University for
              a period of four years.  A multi-  disciplinary team of Northwestern faculty
              members act as  project mentors, and participating industrial partners act  as
              advisers.  Graduate students in this program take courses  in science,
              education, and engineering with a core of  materials related subjects.  In
              addition to course studies,  students engage in a year of hands-on research and
              gain  active teaching experience in regional colleges or high  schools.  The
              students also participate in organizing summer  institutes with participants
              from colleges, high schools,  and regional industries. This program is linked
              to existing  educational programs of the Materials Research Center like  the
              Research Experience for Science teachers (REST) program  and the Materials
              World Modules (MWM) program.  In addition,  a network will be formed to
              cooperate with other innovative  graduate programs at Northwestern University
              and elsewhere.  This education grant is funded through the MPS Office of 
              Multidisciplinary Activities and the Division of Materials  Research.  %%% 
              This grant promotes novel opportunities for students to  prepare for academic,
              industrial, government and non-  traditional roles (such as communication,
              business,  leadership, ethics, mentoring) and assists in integration of 
              research and training with curricula.  ***
