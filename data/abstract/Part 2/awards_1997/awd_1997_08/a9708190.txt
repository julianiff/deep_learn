Abstract    :
              CTS-9708190  Darsh Wasan  Illinois Institute of Technology    This proposal
              request a travel grant to cover expenses for ten speakers from the U.S. to
              participate in the 9th International Conference on Interfacial and Colloid
              Science (9ICSCS) to be held on July 6-12, 1997 at Sofia University, Bulgaria. 
              This conference is one of a series of important world wide forums for the
              fundamental and technological applications of colloidal dispersions,
              capillarity, self-assembled matter, surfactants, and polymers, interfacial
              dynamics at liquid/gas, liquid/liquid, liquid/solid and liquid/solid/gas
              interfaces, biocolloid and biointerface, environmental engineering, etc. 
              Previous conferences have been held in Adelaide, Australia (1994), Copmiegne,
              France (1991), Hakone, Japan (1988), Potsdam, NY, USA (1985), etc.
