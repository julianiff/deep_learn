Abstract    :
              9708533  Kamens     The main objective of this research is to dramatically
              improve our ability to calculate the equilibrium partitioning of semi-volatile
              organic toxic compounds, which distribute between gas and aerosol phases.  This
              will be done specifically for particles which have organic liquid layers, such
              as particles from diesel fuel, wood combustion, and secondary organic aerosols.
               The partitioning of compound classes which contain environmentally emitted or
              created organic acids, carbonyls, chlorinated organics, alkanes, polynuclear
              aromatic hydrocarbons, and cyclical siloxanes, will be investigated.  The
              activity coefficients  of the organics in given liquid particle mixtures will
              be calculated using the group contribution method.  These activity coefficients
              will then be used along with vapor pressures and other aerosol properties to
              calculate equilibrium partitioning constants.  Outdoor chamber measurements
              will be performed to provide gas-particle  partitioning data.  Since aerosol
              chemical composition and atmospheric humidity   strongly influence activity
              coefficient predictions, initial experiments will be carried out with known
              aerosol compositions at constant humidities.  Later experiments will
              investigate more complex particle systems.
