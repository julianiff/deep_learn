Abstract    :
              9708535  Van Cappellen  A combined geochemical and microbiological approach is
              proposed to investigate the kinetic controls of dissimilatory iron (III) and
              sulfate reduction, two of the major respiratory pathways in anaerobic
              environments.  Experiments will be performed using sediments collected in the
              saltmarsh of Sapelo Island, Georgia, where sulfate and iron reducing bacteria
              are major components of the microbial population.  The co-investigators will
              use 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes to detect sulfate- and
              Fe(III)-reducing bacteria, in conjunction with activity assays, phylogenetic
              screening, and kinetic flow-through reactor experiments.  The molecular probes
              will establish the relative abundances of sulfate and iron reducing bacteria in
              the sediments core sections, and provide independent information to
              differentiate chemical and microbial pathways.  The flow-through experiments on
              undisturbed sections of sediment cores will provide the kinetic data needed to
              derive rate expressions for the two dissimilatory pathways, as a function of
              temperature, substrate availability (organic matter, iron(III) oxyhydroxides,
              sulfate) and the composition  of the pore solution (sulfide, nutrients, pH). 
              The analysis of phylogenetically informative gene sequences will assess the
              similarity between the iron and sulfate reducing bacteria that propagate on the
              reactor systems and the naturally-occurring populations.   This proposal was
              submitted in response to the Environmental Geochemistry and Biogeochemistry
              (EGB) solicitation, NSF 96-152.  The proposed research is being jointly
              supported by the Divisions of Earth Sciences and Ocean Sciences.
