Abstract    :
                This proposal requests funds to evaluate available distributions of a variety
              of natural and anthropogenic trace substances (transient and steady-state) in
              terms of their potential to delineate pathways and mean residence times of the
              Arctic Ocean water masses and its sea ice cover.  This information is
              fundamental for our understanding of the role of the Arctic Ocean and its sea
              ice cover in regional and global climate, as well as in the redistribution of
              contaminants in the marine system, and their export from the Arctic Ocean
              through the water and ice phase.  The general approach is to integrate existing
              tracer and contaminant data sets and to combine results from the synthesis of
              these integrated data sets with model simulations.  Specifically, the
              investigators plan to check the information derived from several passive
              tracers (e.g. tritium, oxygen and Helium isotopes) for consistency with
              hydrographic data and direct current measurements, as well as with tracer
              distributions simulated by dynamical models.  In a second step, the
              investigators plan to compare this information with measured contaminant
              distributions to (i) use conservative contaminants as additional tracers of
              water and sea ice circulation, and (ii) study sources and sinks of
              non-conservative contaminants through comparison with passive tracers.
