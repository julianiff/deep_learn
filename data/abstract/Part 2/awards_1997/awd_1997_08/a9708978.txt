Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) will   assist the
              Department of Chemistry at William Marsh Rice University to   acquire a 500 MHz
              nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. This   equipment will enhance
              research in a number of areas such as the   following: (1) new synthetic
              methods towards natural products, (2)   biosynthesis of nucleoside and
              polyketide antibiotics, (3) heteronuclear   compounds of the aluminum, gallium,
              and indium metal complexes, (4)    chemical synthesis and intermediary
              metabolism of sterols, and (5)   titania nanoparticles for solar cells. 
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool  
              available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.   It
              is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific   arrangements of
              atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of   interactions between
              molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is
              essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier   research. The results
              from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such   as polymers, catalysis,
              and in biology.
