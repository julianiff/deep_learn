Abstract    :
              IBN-9708656   PI:  MOODY    The neurons that populate the mammalian brain are
              generated during embryonic development from cells that line the ventricles. 
              These cells divide repeatedly, and then migrate away from the ventricles to
              populate the brain itself.  It is critically important that the processes of
              division and migration occur correctly in order for the brain to develop
              normally.  Although it is well known that mature neurons in the brain use
              electrical signalling to process information, there is also some evidence that
              modified forms of electrical signalling are used during the processes of
              division and migration that create the brain during early embryogenesis.  Dr.
              Moody will use quantitative techniques to record electrical signals from
              individual cells lining the ventricles of the embryonic mouse brain to
              determine how such signals are used in early brain development.  By using
              living slices of embryonic brain tissue, it will be possible to identify
              individual cells according to their state of division and migration, and to
              then detemine the exact nature of the electrical signals they can generate. 
              Once this is understood, specific drugs that block different aspects of those
              signals will be used to determine whether normal patterns of division and
              migration require this type of signalling.  Results from this project will
              allow us to understand whether the normal adult forms of electrical
              communication between neurons in the brain are also used in modified form to
              mediate critical aspects of neural development.
