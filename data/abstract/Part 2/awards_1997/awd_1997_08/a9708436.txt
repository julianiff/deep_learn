Abstract    :
              University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign   The proposed research investigates
              the settlement patterns of immigrants in the U.S.  Three settlement patterns
              are defined: intended destination, initial destination, and the established
              destination.  A first objective is to develop and validate a typology of the
              immigrant settlement system and to show how the immigrant settlement pattern
              evolves from the intended to the established pattern after arrival.  A second
              objective is to determine the factors (i.e. personal, cultural, and economic)
              associated with settlement choice.  The research is organized around a set of
              theories that center on the proposed evolution of the immigrant population
              system, focusing on empirical and theoretical links between immigration,
              internal migration and settlement patterns.  Both the 1980 and 1990 Public Use
              Microdata Sample of the U.S. census, as well as, INS data will be utilized. 
              Both descriptive and inferential multivariate techniques, including the
              'expansion method', will be employed.
