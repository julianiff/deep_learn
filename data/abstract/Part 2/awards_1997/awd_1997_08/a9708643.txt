Abstract    :
              9708643  The goal of this research is to devise and perform component 
              integration experiments at the software architectural level that  determine (1)
              what component interoperability problems exist, (2)  what are solutions to
              those problems, and (3) which strategies  for integration can perform those
              solutions. The value of this  research is that it can provide developers with
              early knowledge  of potential interoperability problems among software
              components.  With this knowledge, developers can treat integration as a design 
              decision, instead of only an implementation task. With the  increased use of
              COTS applications, developers can choose between  applications with similar
              functionality but fewer  interoperability problems with in-house components,
              speeding  productivity. Using research on software architecture, design 
              patterns, and reports on integrating actual applications, the  proposed
              research will define a catalog of architectural  characteristics of software
              that contribute to interoperability  problems. Integration strategies will be
              associated with their  respective solutions to the conflicts that result from 
              interleaving component characteristics. A knowledge based  system will serve as
              an experimental testbed to determine the  best integration strategy based on
              predefined conflict  resolutions among characteristics. The research results,
              i.e.,  characteristics, conflicts, solutions, and strategies, will be  provided
              to the developer to enhance design decisions and to  formulate implementations.
