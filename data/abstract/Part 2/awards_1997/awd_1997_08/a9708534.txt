Abstract    :
              This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
              the University of Michigan.  The project is to conduct a case study of how
              families in Culver City, CA, a diverse community in Los Angeles, understand and
              act in their roles as family members.  The basic questions are to understand
              how the nuclear family has changed in light of the decline of the prevalence of
              the standard `married-couple-with-children` family to only 26% of all
              households in 1993.  Using multiple methods of surveys, formal interviewing and
              participant observation, the student will test the hypothesis that increasing
              numbers of non-traditional, non-nuclear family arrangements will be overtly
              seen as `normal` by a diverse set of respondents in light of the socio-economic
              changes of post-industrialism that the community is adapting to.    This
              research is important because it will advance our understanding of the ability
              of people to reinterpret their lived experience in a positive manner, by
              redefining the meaning of key concepts like `family`.  Understanding the lived
              process by which these core cultural features are changing will allow policy
              makers and social actors to develop programs and policies to facilitate and
              develop a more cohesive civil society.
