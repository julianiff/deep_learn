Abstract    :
              9708552  deMenocal    This award supports a conference to define the timing,
              amplitude,  and regional signatures of Holocene climate variability and discuss
               possible causal mechanisms based on the paleoclimatic record,  synoptic
              climatology, and climate modeling studies.  This meeting  will serve as an
              opportunity to present new Holocene terrestrial,  marine, and ice core
              paleoclimate data, and to evaluate these  records within the context of modes
              and mechanisms of modern  climate variability.  Contributions from the climate
              modeling  community will address ocean-atmosphere climate model responses due 
              to prescribed Holocene boundary condition changes.    Quantifying Holocene
              climate variability is particularly relevant  since it is unlikely that the
              full range of natural "warm climate"  variability is reflected in the last
              century of instrumental data.
