Abstract    :
              9708023  Perry    This grant provides $65,895 as one-half support of the costs
              of  acquiring necessary components to develop a laser-based oxygen  extraction
              system for direct mass spectrometric analyses of  molecular oxygen liberated
              from oxide and silicate minerals.  Direct analysis of molecular oxygen has the
              advantages of;  reducing isotopic fractionation that occurs when oxygen is 
              converted to CO instead of CO2 as in conventional laser  fluorination; will
              allow analysis of all three stable isotopes of  oxygen including 17O, which
              cannot be determined by conventional  CO2 mass spectrometric analysis due to
              isobaric interference;  and, will allow analysis of sub-milligram size samples,
              thereby  increasing the spatial resolution achievable in oxygen isotope 
              studies of silicate and oxide minerals. The capabilities of this  system should
              allow study of a number of fundamental Earth  science problems that might
              otherwise be difficult to address  such as, elucidation of the oxygen isotope
              history of seawater as  recorded in very small, indentifiably unaltered samples
              of  precipitated marine cherts and carbonates and microfossil tests,  and the
              determination of relative contributions of subducted  components (i.e.
              sediment, altered oceanic crust, fluids, melt)  to arc volcanics based on
              oxygen isotopic analyses of olivine  phenocrysts.  ***
