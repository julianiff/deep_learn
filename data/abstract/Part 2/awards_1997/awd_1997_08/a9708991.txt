Abstract    :
              9708991  Judd    Is a typical American "undereducated"?  This issue has been
              analyzed before, but in a fashion that ignored the risky aspects of educational
              investments.  The return to education is uncertain, but the proper response to
              this uncertainty depends on the nature of the uncertainty.  This project
              applies standard investment ideas from financial economics to human capital and
              educational problems.  It then integrates the human capital and financial
              investment decisions, and analyzes the current tax system and proposed reforms.
               The current system is, due to tax-favored savings provisions, partially a
              consumption and partially an income tax system.  Also, the current system
              allows for some expensing of educational expenses through the deduction of
              state and local taxes for taxpayers who itemize.  True consumption tax reform
              would allow expensing of all forms of savings, whether it be in the form of
              financial instruments or human capital investments.  Many so-called consumption
              tax reforms would not allow expensing out-of-pocket education costs, and
              thereby favor physical capital investments.  This project explores the
              importance of these facts in life-cycle models of education and savings.  To
              accomplish these objectives, this project also develops new computational
              methods of solving such economic problems.  These new methods will also prove
              useful in many other economic problems.
