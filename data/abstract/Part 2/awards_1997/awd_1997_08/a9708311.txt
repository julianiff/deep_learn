Abstract    :
              This project, supported both by the Social, Behavioral and Economic Research and
              the International Divisions of NSF, involves the dissertation research of an
              anthropology student from Emory University.  The student will investigate the
              relationships between indigenous Xhosa-speaking South African adolescents and
              their parents and other members of the adult generation.  Focusing on
              households containing adolescent s aged 10-19, the student will interview how
              young peoples' and their parents' definitions of adolescence versus adulthood
              vary in light of changing religious, social and economic circumstances. The
              student will first survey about 100 households in two sites with different
              socio-economic characteristics in a large suburb of Cape Town, and go on to
              conduct structured interviews, individual case studies  and intensive
              observation of adolescents in different social contexts.  The focus will be on
              the cultural meanings of adolescence in relation to male and female intimate
              practices, contraceptive use and adolescent pregnancy.   This research is
              important because it will advance our understanding of the cultural meanings
              behind behavior causing acquired immuno-deficiency disease and adolescent
              pregnancy.  Improving our knowledge of the sources of adolescent behavior will
              be an important step towards designing programs to change that behavior and
              reduce the prevalence of disease and adolescent pregnancies.
