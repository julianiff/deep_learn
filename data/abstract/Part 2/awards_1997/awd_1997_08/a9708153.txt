Abstract    :
              9708153  Azam  Bacterial production, via 3H-thymidine incorporation, is a 
              "core" parameter in biological oceanography and marine  biogeochemistry.  No
              non-radio-isotopic method is currently  available but one would be highly
              desirable for a variety of  logistical, safety and scientific reasons.  This
              project  will develop a non-radioisotopic method based on the use of  the
              thymidine analog, 5-bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU), for  measuring the rate of
              bacterial DNA synthesis in seawater  samples.  BrdU behaves as a thymidine
              analog and becomes  incorporated into newly synthesized DNA in place of 
              thymidine.  Its incorporation into DNA is quantified by an  immunochemical
              method.  After BrdU incorporation, the cells  are permeabilized and treated
              with an antibody which binds  to BrdU in the DNA.  A second antibody,
              conjugated with a  fluorochrome or a dye, is then used to quantify BrdU 
              incorporation.  Many different procedures for quantifying  BrdU incorporation
              into DNA have been employed.  Current  protocols will be tested and modified as
              necessary to  provide the simplest reliable method for aquatic microbial 
              assemblages.  An additional benefit of this approach is the  possibility to
              estimate growth rates of individual bacteria  in a sample in situ
              hybridization.  The fluorescent signal  of individual bacteria could be
              determined by  epifluorescence microscopy or by flow cytometry.  In  principle,
              the BrdU-labeling could even be combined with  rRNA gene probing and, using
              flow cytometry, growth rates  could then be estimated for any specific group of
              bacteria  in a complex assemblage.  Such a capacity would  revolutionize the
              study of microbial ecology, providing  information on growth rates in microbial
              populations at a  level of detail not possible with the current radiolabeling 
              procedures.
