Abstract    :
              These investigators continue research in basic properties of atomic and
              molecular structure and reactions of interest to aeronomy.  The work combines
              laboratory astrophysics with basic rate process models to provide broadly
              applicable methodology for the aeronomy and planetary atmospheres' communities.
               The PI will focus on electron excitation and photon absorption properties of
              atomic nitrogen, molecular nitrogen, and oxygen.  In sum, he will:  (1) perform
              high resolution absorption measurements to obtain accurate rotationally
              dependent electric dipole moments, applied to high resolution emission
              measurements for accurate definition of predissociation loss in band
              transitions; (2) measure electron excitation cross sections important to
              aeronomy, and establish a model structure for oxygen collisional and radiative
              systems; (3) establish an experimental setup for measuring atomic nitrogen
              electron impact cross sections, with an accompanying atomic model; and (4)
              reexamine the ionization-excitation cross sections of molecular nitrogen, and
              reconcile with existing accurate photoionization data.
