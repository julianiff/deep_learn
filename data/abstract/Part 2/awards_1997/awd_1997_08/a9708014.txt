Abstract    :
              The focus of this work is the preparation of benzopyranones,  
              benzothiopyranones, benzoquinolines and benzacridines, compounds with  
              potential for intramolecular proton transfer in the electronic excited   state.
               Many of the proposed target molecules have potential as radiation  
              scintillators, luminescent solar concentrators and laser dyes.  The   students
              working on the project will have the experience of conducting   organic
              synthesis and carrying out steady-state and time-resolved   spectroscopic
              studies on many of the compounds prepared.  With this   Research in
              Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award, the Synthetic Organic   Program is
              supporting the research of Drs. Charles F. Beam and Shannon S.   Martinez of
              the Department of Chemistry at the College of Charleston.    Work will focus on
              the preparation and photophysical study of   heterocyclic compounds with the
              goal of understanding intramolecular   proton transfer in the electronic
              excited state.  The research will serve   to enhance the education of a number
              of undergraduate participants
