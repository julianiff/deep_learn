                    ABSTRACT    PROPOSAL # : DEB-9708596    INVESTIGATOR(S) : MILCHUNAS   
              INSTITUTION: COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY      Although the effects of increasing
              atmospheric CO2 concentrations on primary production and other aboveground
              ecosystem processes are widely studied in field experiments, experimental
              studies of the effects of CO2 belowground have generally not been done.   The
              aims of this research are to investigate the effects of elevated CO2
              concentrations on soil C dynamics and N cycling in Colorado grasslands.  The
              main driver of  belowground responses is assumed to be CO2-induced changes in
              plant C an N allocation among soluble exudates versus tissue components, in
              addition to changes in total C and N fluxes.  The focus of the measurements is
              on root exudates, plant litter chemistry and litter decomposition, and changes
              in soil fauna, particularly nematodes. Results will be synthesized using the
              Century simulation model.  This research is part of the NSF Environmental
              Geochemistry and Biogeochemistry Program, with support from the Divisions of
              Environmental Biology, Earth Sciences, and Atmospheric Sciences.
