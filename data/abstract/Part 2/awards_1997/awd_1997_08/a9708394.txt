Abstract    :
              9708394  Shaw    This project will help professional developers provide
              resources, strategies, and materials aimed at middle school teachers who teach
              large number of Limited English Proficient (LEP) students.  The central concept
              is to work on a small scale with selected teachers and schools, test the
              feasibility and quality of the approach, and then consider expansion if the
              pilot warrants it.
