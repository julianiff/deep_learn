              Robert Buchler  Institution:  University of Florida, Gainsville      This award
              is to support the attendance of six graduate students at a Workshop on Long
              Range Correlations in Astrophysical and Other Systems, to be held at the
              University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, on 20-22 February 1997. The workshop
              will bring together experts from astrophysics, plasma physics, condensed matter
              physics, non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, and mathematics to discuss the
              mechanisms responsible for large scale structure and long range correlations.
              Such mechanisms include long range forces (e.g. Coulomb and gravitational
              forces), bifurcation in nonlinear dynamics (pattern formation), self-organized
              criticality, and violation of detailed balance.
