              This grant is awarded through the Separations and Purification Program
              sub-element of the Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of the
              Chemical and Transport Systems Division. The principal investigators are
              Roberto F. Guzman and David F. O'Brien of the University of Arizona. The
              research explores the feasibility of  a method of protein purification that
              combines the advantages and unique selectivity of molecular imprinting,
              immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography, and the high surface area of
              unilamellar liposomes modified with surface associated templated metal
              ion-chelators. The method aims to provide the means to purify proteins from
              complex media with high yields, selectivity and maintenance of native protein
              conformation. The method is a highly selective use of metal ion affinity
              chromatorgraphy that has the potential to be developed as an efficient
              purification scheme for biomolecules with multiple binding sites.    The
              production of bioactive macromolecules such as diagnostic enzymes, antibodies,
              hormones etc., is central to biotechnology. A major issue is the purification
              of these biomolecules with retention of bioactivity. The technology to be
              developed here has the potential to address these issues.
