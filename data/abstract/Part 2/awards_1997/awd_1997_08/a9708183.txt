Abstract    :
              This project is exploring a new approach to instruction-level parallelism. The 
              new approach, disjoint eager execution, uses branch prediction and eager 
              execution to maximize the number of instructions that can be usefully executed 
              on each cycle.  The set of branch paths forms a tree, in which each node 
              represents a branch instruction and each edge represents the code executed 
              between branches.  In disjoint eager execution, all of the most likely code 
              segments are candidates for speculative execution, rather than only those code 
              segments on the most likely path.  In other words, a subtree of instructions is
               executed that may not be a simple chain.    Preliminary research has included
              some simulations on benchmarks suggesting that  speedup of about 30 is
              possible.  This project includes more comprehensive  simulations to determine
              the benefits, along with architectural studies to  determine the effects of
              parallelism on cycle time of the machine.
