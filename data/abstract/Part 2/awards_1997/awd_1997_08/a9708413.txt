Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) will   assist the
              Department of Chemistry at University of Utah to acquire a   tandem mass
              spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a   number of areas
              including the following:  (1) RNA-binding polyamides via   encoded
              combinatorial synthesis, (2) phosphorus-containing molecules   based on
              2'-deoxynucleosides, (3) analysis of RNA-binding proteins and   peptides, (4)
              DNA mismatch recognition and repair by metalloenzyme MutY,   and oxidative
              alkylation and degradation of guanine in DNA and RNA   structures.  Mass
              spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural   details
              and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of   organic,
              bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. The addition of the   technique of
              electrospray extends the range of MS to proteins and nucleic   acid molecular
              weights far beyond any other technique. The use of   electrospray ionization in
              combination with high resolution provides the   latest techniques available in
              mass spectrometry. It affords the chemist   one of the most powerful tools
              available for the characterization of   compounds. The acquisition of this
              capability in mass spectrometry is   essential for the prosecution of frontier
              research in many fields of   chemistry.
