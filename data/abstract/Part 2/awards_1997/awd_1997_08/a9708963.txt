Abstract    :
                Project Kaleidoscope (PKAL), under the auspices of the Independent College
              Office, is the recipient of funds to evaluate the impact of improving physical
              infrastructure on undergraduate science, mathematics, engineering, and
              technology  (SME&T) education.  Since 1991, PKAL has been instrumental in
              assisting colleges and universities in all parts of the country strengthen
              their programs in the field of SME&T.  Central to this effort has been the
              organization's focus on facilities planning, challenging institutions to
              explore the relationship between space and programs.  Through workshops and
              publications, PKAL has been a catalyst in helping institutions articulate their
              vision of student learning that gives direction to curricular, facilities, and
              financial planning needs.    Funds will also be used to prepare a supplement to
              the  comprehensive PKAL Volume III, Structures for Science--A Handbook on
              Planning Facilities.   As the only publication of its kind, the Handbook
              features case studies of successful renovations and new structures illustrating
              innovative and creative approaches to planning and designing of space. The
              supplement will be distributed both in print and electronically, including new
              information on facilities planning, building systems, and equipping new or
              renovated science facilities. Both projects will address the continuing
              infrastructure needs at colleges and universities, ensuring that the physical
              environment for  faculty and students is safe and accommodates new approaches
              to conduct research and research training activities.
