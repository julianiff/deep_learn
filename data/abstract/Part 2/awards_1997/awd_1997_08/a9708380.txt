Abstract    :
              9708380  Noakes & Jahnke  This project will fund research at the Center for
              Applied  Isotope Studies (CAIS) to improve the state of the art for 
              instrumentation and techniques used to assess the  environmental impacts of
              sediment-associated contaminants.  This research will enable rapid, large-scale
              surveys of  contaminated distributions to be conducted in conjunction  with
              detailed process studies of contaminant pore water-  sediment partitioning and
              seafloor-bottom water exchange.  The result will be a rapid and cost-effective
              approach to  investigate relationships between the fate, distribution,  and
              bioavailability of sediment-associated contaminants that  can be performed over
              geographic regions having a broad  areal extent.  The first phase of the
              research is to create  an experimental model for laboratory and field testing
              and  evaluation.  During the second year of the project, the  experimental
              systems will be field tested and evaluated for  performance at a site in
              Charleston Harbor, South  Carolina.***
