Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) will   assist the
              Department of Chemistry at Wake Forest University to acquire a   400 MHz
              nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. This equipment   will enhance
              research in a number of areas such as the following: (1)   small molecule-DNA
              interactions, bioorganic chemistry, (2) the oxidative   polymerization of
              pyrroles and thiophenes, (3) preparation of new   compounds capable of
              interaction with the enzyme nitric oxide synthase,   (4) analysis of the
              chemistry of reactive intermediates, and (5)    transition-mediated organic
              chemistry.  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful
              tool   available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.
                It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific  
              arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of  
              interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art   NMR
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier   research.
              The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such   as polymers,
              catalysis, and in biology.
