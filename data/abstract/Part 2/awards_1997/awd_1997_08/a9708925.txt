Abstract    :
              Abstract - 9708925  Hsueh-Chia Chang        Interfacial waves are known to play
              a major role in multi-phase heat and mass transfer.  An important example is
              the efficiency of a refrigerator evaporator tube that operates in the two phase
              regime.  Recent tests suggest that its efficiency is due to the presence of
              interfacial waves.  Much experimental data exist with which to examine the
              gross effects of waves on transport rates but little data are available to
              probe the coupling between wave statistics and the transport.  This work will
              be a balanced theoretical, numerical, and experimental study of the enhancing
              effects of such waves and will lead to a better understanding of gas/liquid and
              liquid/liquid flows.
