Abstract    :
              This is an accomplishment based renewal project.  The goal of this project is to
              bring some fresh thoughts on the evaluation of empirical models or to economic
              theories; although  two established building blocks will be used.  The first
              comes from panel analysis and discusses the possibility of `spurious
              stochastics` occurring in a dynamic panel model specification, using data from
              regions that differ greatly in size, but where the size effect is not properly
              modeled.  Size itself may be slowly evolving and so not be captured by the use
              of fixed effects.  Initial simulations suggest that this is potentially an
              important problem.  One that follows from it is how to evaluate panel models,
              and thus how to compare models.  The second block is consideration of a general
              theory of forecasting, with general cost t functions and an emphasis on
              predictive distribution functions.  New tests for forecast errors arise and a
              better appreciation of the appropriate modeling strategy to use depending on
              ones objective and knowledge.  The majority of the currently available methods
              of evaluation, such as measures of goodness of fit, correctness of
              specification and encompassing, are statistical measures.  It will be argued
              that a better approach considers the value to the economy of a new model or
              theory, or at least the aid it gives to decision makers.  This is the approach
              is already taken in finance and it could be more widely used in forecasting. 
              The implications of this viewpoint will be explored and analyzed
