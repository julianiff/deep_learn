Abstract    :
              9708520  O'Melia  This is an award to provide Renewal Support for research 
              originated under NSF Award No. 91-12766 that dealt with the  theory,
              measurements and applications relating to the stability  of colloids in aquatic
              environments.  In the research being  conducted under this award, the
              investigator plans on refining  and extending the conceptual model developed in
              prior research to  more complex aquatic systems than were considered in prior 
              research based on interactions of single Brownian particles with  stationary
              surfaces.  In the renewal work, the PI will give  special consideration to
              reversible aggregation and deposition  processes, validate the model
              experimentally and apply the  theoretical and experimental results to
              considerations of  particle transport and fate in ground and surface waters.   
              Results of this research are expected to provide insight and  predictability to
              the processes by which small particles deposit  and become part of the sediment
              burden of surface waters and the  processes by which colloids move through
              groundwater aquifers.  This knowledge is likely to be applied in the
              engineering design  of processes for removal of particles from suspension in
              surface  waters and in designing systems for decontamination of  groundwater
              aquifers.  ***
