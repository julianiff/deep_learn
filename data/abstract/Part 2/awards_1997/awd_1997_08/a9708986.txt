Abstract    :
              9708986  Cinlar   This award provides funds to partially support the 1997
              Seminar on Stochastic   Processes. The seminars have become one of the most
              important regular seminar series for   probabilists in the USA. They attract
              and bring together an active group of eminent   researchers and young
              specialists in probability and stochastic processes. The emphasis   areas this
              year will be stochastic calculus, stochastic partial differential equations,
              and   numerical methods for them. The primary aim is to provide an overview of
              significant lines   of research and to enable participants to discuss their
              work in an informal atmosphere.
