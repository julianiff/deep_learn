Abstract    :
                  ABSTRACT  This project will explore the use of 30-Si in fossil marine 
              diatoms as a  tracer of diatom production, a substantial portion of  primary
              production in  many parts of the world ocean.  Surface sediments from the 
              Southern Ocean  will be analyzed and the results compared with 15-N and 13-C 
              analyses on  the same material.  The results can be used to determine  whether
              changes in  opal accumulation over glacial/interglacial cycles resulted  from 
              differential production or preservation.
