Abstract    :
              This renewal award to Gerald J. Meyer at Johns Hopkins University is   jointly
              supported by the Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry   Division and the
              Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the   Directorate of Mathematical and
              Physical Sciences. The focus of the   research is charge separation at
              semiconductor interfaces. Specifically,   organometallic charge-transfer
              complexes will be anchored to mesoporous   titania and zirconia colloidal films
              prepared by sol-gel techniques and   the photochemistry and photophysics of
              charge and electron transfer   between the sensitizer and the semiconductor
              will be probed. Studies of   molecular precursors, colloids, gels, and
              nanocrystalline films will   allow the supramolecular nature of extended solids
              to be explored at the   molecular level. In situ time resolved spectroscopic
              and electrochemical   techniques will be used to quantify electron transfer
              dynamics and   energetics.  This research will provide insights into the fates
              of molecular excited   states at semiconductor and insulator derived interfaces
              and will allow a   wide variety of novel materials to be systematically
              prepared.   Applications of the research exist in solar energy conversion,
              chemical   sensing, environmental detoxification, memory storage, catalysis and
                electro-optical switches.
