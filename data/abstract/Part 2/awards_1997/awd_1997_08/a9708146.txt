Abstract    :
              9708146  Srienc  Flow cytometric techniques have been developed which permit 
              the experimental determination of the rate, transition, and  partitioning
              functions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell  populations growing in balanced
              growth conditions.  These  fundamental physiological functions, in combination
              with  population balance equations, rigorously describe the growth  dynamics of
              cell populations.  Synchronous cultures of  Saccharomyces cerevisiae will be
              used to verify the single-  cell dynamic properties predicted by the
              theoretical  framework.  Green fluorescent protein will be used as a  marker
              protein to systematically evaluate the growth  dynamics as a function of
              environmental conditions.  The  concepts developed for growth rates will be
              extended to  evaluate metabolic rates of nutrient uptake and product  formation
              as a function of cell cycle position.  direct  interactions of individual cells
              with the growth environment  will be experimentally measured using novel
              single-cell  secretion assays.  The experimental environment will be  modeled
              using the population balance equation framework.  ***
