Abstract    :
              9708946  King         The Global Positioning System (GPS) is making a profound 
              impact on the understanding of diverse scientific problems in the  earth
              sciences such as plate kinematics, the earthquake cycle,  crustal dynamics,
              volcanic processes, global ice dynamics and  associated sea level changes, and
              atmospheric sensing. To make  effective use of this technology earth scientists
              need accurate and  efficient software to process GPS data. This award provides
              funding  for improving the documentation and user interfaces of the software 
              currently used for high-precision GPS applications. The activity is  to be a
              collaboration between scientists at the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology
              and at the University Consortium for  Atmospheric Research (UCAR). This award
              will support the work  managed by the MIT group.  ***
