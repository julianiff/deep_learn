Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    OPP-9708997  SMITH  UNIV. CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES    This project is
              designed to achieve a better understanding of the timing, volume, and
              biogeochemistry of freshwater runoff from the land surface to the Arctic Ocean.
               Rivers, deltas, and estuaries experience or influence a variety of processes
              that are relevant to problems of global change, such as greenhouse gas
              emissions, the surface energy balance, and biogeochemical cycling, and the
              delivery of freshwater, sediment, and nutrients to the Arctic shelf
              environment.  The proposed study would use multi-temporal high resolution
              synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and visible/near-infrared satellite data in
              combination with Russian ground station observations to assess: (1) the timing
              and volume of freshwater delivery to the Arctic Ocean; (2) the timing and
              magnitude of seasonal inundation of the land surface, and the indentification
              of those rivers that actively exchange water, sediment, and nutrients with
              surrounding aquatic ecosystems; and (3) the relationship between temperature,
              river outflows, and freeze-up/break-up of river, estuary, and shelf ice.
