              Abstract  ATM-9708071  Bradley, Raymond  University of Massachusetts  Title:
              High Resolution Lake Sediment Studies for Paleoclimatic  Reconstruction in the
              Canadian High Arctic    This award will support a project designed to extend
              the record of  summer temperature derived from varved sediments in the Canadian
               High Arctic to cover the last 2-3000 years.  This will place the  dramatic
              changes observed over the few centuries into a longer term  perspective.  In
              particular, conditions around 1,000 years ago,  during the so-called Medieval
              Warm Period, will be examined for its  the global significance.  Multiple
              dating approaches will be used  to provide confidence in the chronology and to
              establish a secular  paleomagnetic record for the region.  This can then be
              used as a  chronological template to help in dating other sedimentary records 
              which are low in organic carbon.  Hydrological studies in selected  basins will
              clarify the climatic controls on sediment flux to these  lakes and improve
              paleoclimatic interpretations of the varved  sediment records recovered.  By
              combining these observations with  earlier work, a comprehensive conceptual
              model of the climatic  controls on sediment flux to arctic lakes will be
              developed.
