Abstract    :
                  This study proposes to examine the hormone-behavior adaptations that
              maximize survival and reproductive success in birds breeding in the extreme
              conditions of the high Arctic.  The focus will be on a typical high Arctic
              seabird, the Dovekie (Alle alle), and two typical arctic passerines, the
              Lapland Longspur (Calcarius lapponicus) and Snow Bunting (Plectrophenax
              nivalis).  Temporal patterns of testosterone, breeding condition, and
              reproductive success will be studied, as well as adrenocortical responses to
              environmental stress.  Field studies will be conducted in northern Greenland
              using Thule AFB as a logistical staging area.  This will be the first study in
              the region using these techniques and and logistical capabilities.  Because
              these techniques are inherently risky and the logistical demands are extreme,
              the PIs have chosen to submit a proposal of limited scope under the guidelines
              of the Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) program.
