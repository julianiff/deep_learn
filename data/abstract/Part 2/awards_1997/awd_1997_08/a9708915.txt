Abstract    :
              9708915  This research focuses on applying formal methods to the problem  of
              certification of imported software. Formal systems such as set  constraints,
              Kleene algebra and Kleene algebra with tests, and  the modal mu-calculus have
              been shown to provide potent tools for  practical program analysis and
              verification. It is proposed to  develop these systems further with special
              focus on efficient  practical algorithms and to investigate their use as tools
              for  software certification. The goals are (i) to make it easy for a  software
              vendor to construct a certificate to be downloaded along  with a compiled
              object that ensures that certain safety  conditions are met; and (ii) to make
              it easy for a client to  check the certificate to verify that the foreign code
              is safe to  run locally. It is hoped that this work will contribute to the 
              elimination of untrustworthy software.  ***
