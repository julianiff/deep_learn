Abstract    :
              9708664  Miller         In a series of meetings between 1987 and 1992, a
              consensus  developed in the academic community that the timing and magnitude 
              of past eustatic sea level changes and their relationships to  stratigraphic
              sequences should be determined by drilling borehole  transects on passive
              margins.  Three crucial time intervals were  identified:  the Oligocene to
              Recent "Icehouse World," when  glacioeustatic changes were clearly operating; 
              the Cretaceous  "Greenhouse World," which apparently lacked significant ice
              sheets:   and the Paleocene-Eocene "Doubthouse World," a time for which  debate
              continues over the existence of ice sheets.         To address sequences and
              sea-level changes, the P.I.s designed  the "New Jersey Sea Level Transect" as a
              series of boreholes from  the onshore NJ Coastal Plain across the shelf to the
              slope and  rise.  The New Jersey Sea Level Transect is the first step in a 
              global campaign to evaluate relationships between global sea level  and passive
              continental margin sequences, to determine the timing  and amplitude of sea
              level variations, and to evaluate mechanisms  of sea level change.  The onshore
              component, the NJ Coastal Plain  Drilling Project, has completed 4 boreholes at
              Island Beach,  Atlantic City, Cape May, and Bass River.  This project is for
              the  completion of the NJ Coastal Plain Drilling Project by drilling a  2000 ft
              borehole at Corson's Inlet, NJ and a 1200 ft borehole at  Parvin, NJ.  ***
