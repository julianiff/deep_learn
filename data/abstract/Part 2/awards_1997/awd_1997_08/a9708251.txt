Abstract    :
              9708251  Davis    The Global Positioning System (GPS) is used by earth
              scientists for  accurately recording strain in the Earth's crust in a wide
              range of  applications that include the study of plate motions, intraplate 
              deformation, pre-, syn- and post-seismic fault motions,  pre-eruption volcanic
              activity, glacier flow, and sea level  monitoring. In such applications, the
              positioning precision  required is very demanding, usually on the order of a
              centimeter or  less in the horizontal and vertical dimensions. The GPS receiver
               and antenna system is one of significant sources of error which, if  better
              understood and corrected, could lead to significant  improvement. This award
              provides funding for a team of experts at  the Smithsonian Astrophysical
              Observatory, MIT, and the University  NAVSTAR Consortium to develop algorithms
              to extract multipath  effects from observed GPS signal-to-noise ratios,
              numerically model  GPS antenna characteristics, and develop an on-site
              Multipath  Calibration System for the purpose of reducing GPS errors below the 
              centimeter level.  ***
