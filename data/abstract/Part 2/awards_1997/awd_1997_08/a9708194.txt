Abstract    :
                  9708194  Robinson     Dr. Robinson will study stratospheric planetary waves
              - their variability, spectra, and interactions with the zonal flow - using a
              stochastically forced linear model.  This approach, which recently has been
              successfully applied to tropospheric storm tracks, will permit the PI and
              colleagues to examine the influence of tropospheric and stratospheric zonal
              flows and stationary planetary waves on a full and unbiased spectrum of
              transient and traveling stratospheric waves.  Specific issues that will be
              explored are:  (1)  the relative importance of transient and stationary wave
              activity in driving the zonal flow;  (2)  the extent to which stratospheric
              wave activity is controlled by stratospheric and tropospheric zonal flows, and
              the importance of interannual variability of the zonal flow in determining
              interannual variability in wave activity;  (3)  the importance of wave-wave
              interactions in regulating stratospheric wave activity;  and (4)  the expected
              interannual variability in wave-driving and the zonal flow in the absence of
              interannually varying boundary conditions.     Dr. Robinson is a theoretician
              with a history of effectively employing linear theory in the study of
              atmospheric dynamics.  He will evaluate the success of this approach by
              comparing his theoretical results with observations.     This award is
              supported jointly by the Climate Dynamics and Large-scale Dynamic Meteorology
              Programs.
