Abstract    :
              9708171  Giordano    The Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications (COMAP)
              is starting a high school contest in applied mathematics patterned after the
              collegiate Mathematical Contest in Modeling, which is run by COMAP.  The
              contest is being run in cooperation with the National Council of Teachers of
              Mathematics, the American Mathematical Association of Two Year Colleges, the
              Mathematical Association of America, the Society for Industrial and Applied
              Mathematics, and the Institute for Operations Research and Management Science. 
              Part of the plan from the beginning is to ensure that the steady-state
              constraints of executing the contest are thoroughly considered and to develop
              mechanisms to institutionalize the contest.
