              Abstract/Brutsaert, 97-08622    Boundary Layer Soundings and Regional Surface
              Heat Fluxes in the Southern Great P!ains    This award provides funding for
              three years for research to investigate surface heat fluxes (both  turbulent
              and radiative) at regional scales from natural land surfaces. One principal aim
              of the work  is to find ways to allow derivation of surface fluxes over larger
              areas than the characteristic scales  of 10 m to 100 m imposed by currently
              available measurement technology. Better characterization  of these quantities
              is needed for many reasons, not least of which is the need for improvement of 
              global climate models. The work is to be carried out at the DoB ARM/CART site
              in the Southern  Great Plains at the border between Kansas and Oklahoma. The
              site is highly instrumented and is  probably the best site in the world for the
              planned research, and several focused special observing  periods will occur
              during the next three years while the research is being carried out. The
              synergy  that will be achieved as a result of this cooperation will be
              excellent. The results will he of  considerable value in dynamic climate
              modeling and hydrological applications.
