Abstract    :
              Proposal Number: ECS-9708230    Principal Investigator:  David Nolte    Title: 
              Photorefractive quantum well devices and applications or optical scanning and
              femtosecond pulse processing    In this research, photorefractive semiconductor
              quantum well devices will be in investigated in the context of three different
              applications: (1) three dimensional laser scanning with the PRQW as the dynamic
              holographic thin film component; (2) a laser-based ultrasound system with the
              PRQW as the homodyne detection device; (3) femtosecond pulse shaping.
              Photorefractive semiconductor quantum well (PRQW) devices are thin film devises
              that operate as dynamic holographic media.  They are strong candidates for
              applications such as biomedical optical scanning, three dimensional parts
              recognition and ultrafast optical pulse processing.
