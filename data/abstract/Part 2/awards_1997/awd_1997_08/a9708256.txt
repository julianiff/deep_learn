              Title: Quaternary Paleoclimate Record from South America: Lake  Titicaca    A
              long and continuous paleoclimate record from tropical South  America is needed
              to answer several persistent and important  questions.  This award supports the
              recovery of such a record by  coring the deep basin of Lake Titicaca on the
              northern Altiplano of  Peru and Bolivia.  Through the preliminary analysis of a
              series of  short, mini-piston cores, it is demonstrated that the sediments of 
              the lake are suitable for climatic reconstruction.  Previous  studies revealed
              large-amplitude fluctuations of lake level in the  Holocene and Pleistocene,
              implying that effective moisture (and  probably temperature) has dramatically
              fluctuated.  Siting of a  series of long cores will be aided by
              medium-resolution, deeper  penetration seismic reflection profiling.  The cores
              will be  subsequently analyzed for chronology (AMS radiocarbon), 
              sedimentology, physical properties, geochemistry, stable isotopic  analysis of
              organic carbon and cellulose; determination of organic  and inorganic
              phosphorous, and biogenic silica; and paleobiota  (ostracode and diatom species
              compositions),  This record will  allow us to examine in detail the timing and
              mechanisms of tropical  forcing of high-latitude climate, as well as the
              linkage between  the climate of the Altiplano and the Amazon basin.
