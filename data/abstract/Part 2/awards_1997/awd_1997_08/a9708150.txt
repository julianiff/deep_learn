Abstract    :
              Abstract    Somasundaran, P./Columbia U.  EEC-9708150    This award to the
              Columbia University is to study the feasibility of establishing an
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on the characterization and
              development of novel specialty surfactants for applications in chemical,
              pharmaceutical and biological consumer products.  The Center will also
              emphasize on the development of knowledge base on the relationship between
              structure of different surfactants for specific industrial applications.  The
              research program, structure and organization of the proposed Center will be
              studied in an industry/university workshop.
