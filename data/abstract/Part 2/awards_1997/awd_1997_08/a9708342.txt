Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry  
              Program supports research on phosphorus exchange reactions by Dr. Richard   L.
              Keiter of the Chemistry Department, Eastern Illinois University.    Kinetic and
              thermodynamic studies of phosphine exchange in dangling   ligand complexes of
              chromium and molybdenum will be carried out.  The   study is prompted by the
              observation that phosphorus ligand exchange in   some tungsten complexes is
              faster than previously assumed.  In cases   where one dangling phosphine arm of
              a ligand is capable of associating   with a cis carbonyl ligand on the
              tungsten, the second phosphine arm can   displace the coordinated phosphine
              more readily.  This idea will be   tested in other metal complexes using a
              variety of ligand combinations in   various solvents.  NMR and X-ray
              crystallographic methods will be   employed.  The significance of this reaction
              is that it results in isomerization,   that is, structural modification, of the
              complex and affects subsequent   reactivity.  While repulsive forces are often
              taken into account in   understanding reactivity, attractive forces often are
              not.  This opens   the possibility of controlling substitution rates by
              employing ligands   with dangling groups that have an affinity for other
              ligands attached to   the central metal of the complex.
