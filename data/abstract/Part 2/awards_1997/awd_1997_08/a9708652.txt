Abstract    :
              By the age of 4 or 5 children come to understand that other people have mental
              states such as desires, beliefs, hopes, and fears.  This understanding provides
              a foundation for development of social knowledge and social skills.  For
              example, realization that other people are mental beings like oneself is
              prerequisite for developing an understanding of why people behave as they do,
              and how to interact successfully with others.  This project investigates an
              important issue that has received little attention:  How do children use their
              understanding of mental states in social interactions?  Specifically, the
              project focuses on children's ability to use mental state understanding in
              attempts at persuasion, and how this ability develops between age 4 and
              adulthood.  One study will examine children's persuasion attempts in real-life
              situations through analyses of a large database of children's speech.  In other
              experiments children will be presented with scenarios involving persuasion
              (e.g., a child attempting to persuade a parent to buy an animal), and asked to
              create or select a persuasive argument.  The results should further our
              understanding of children's cognitive and social development, and should also
              have implications for educating children about people and the social world.
