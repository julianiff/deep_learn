              ABSTRACT    97-07330  Wilson, Thomson, Wolfe, Armbruster  Collaborative
              research:  Floral function and phylogeny in Penstemon:  tests of   pollen
              presentation theory    This research examines the evolution of floral traits
              within the plant genus Penstemon, a member of the snapdragon family. The
              investigators will derive a "family tree" of Penstemon using DNA sequences to
              estimate genetic similarities, so that observed changes in floral characters
              can be interpreted with a proper understanding of species relationships.
              Ecological research will be focused on ways that Penstemon anther
              characteristics influence size and number of pollen doses, and ultimately,
              plant fitness in hummingbird- and bee-pollinated plants.  An untested new
              theory predicts that when pollinating animals visit frequently, plants that
              release pollen from their anthers in smaller doses per visit will donate more
              pollen to other plants. As the first test of pollen presentation theory, this
              research will help decide whether these models are correct and useful. Improved
              knowledge of pollination mechanics can help improve the economic evaluation of
              alternative pollinators of agricultural crops.
