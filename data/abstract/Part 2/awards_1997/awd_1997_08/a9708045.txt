Abstract    :
                    The proposed project is a component of the international North Water
              Polynya Study, which involves research cruises to the north of Baffin Bay on
              the Canadian ice-breaker C.C.G.S. Louis S. St. Laurent, in 1997 (summer) and
              1998 (spring-summer).  This project is to measure the surface heat budget of
              the polynya.  Specific aims are to determine:    a)  surface heat budget of NOW
              polynya, and assess its "latent" versus "sensible" character;  b)  cloud
              radiative forcing as a function of cloud-cover, cloud type, ice-cover, ice-type
              and solar zenith angle;  c)  clear sky radiative forcing as a function of water
              vapor, aerosols and solar zenith angle;  d)  turbulent exchange coefficients
              for heat and moisture exchanges in open water and vicinity of ice cover;
              dependences of these coefficients on conditions in the marine boundary layer; 
              e)  skin temperature of ocean and ice, and;  f)  influence of near-surface,
              sea-temperature gradients on air-sea fluxes of heat, moisture and gases.   
              These goals will be achieved by using high quality instrumentation, including a
              self-calibrating infrared interferometric spectroradiometer to measure spectra
              of radiation emitted by the sky, clouds, the ocean surface and ice cover.    By
              making measurements in the widest range of ice cover (from total ice cover to
              ice-free conditions), this project is complimentary to the much larger SHEBA
              and ARM programs.
