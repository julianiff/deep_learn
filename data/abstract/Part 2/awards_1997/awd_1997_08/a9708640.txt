Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) will   assist the
              Department of Chemistry at University of Missouri at St. Louis   to acquire a
              high resolution mass spectrometer. This equipment will   enhance research in a
              number of areas that include the following: (1)   studies on organometallic
              species used as polymerization catalysts, (2)   synthesis and  reactions of
              metallaborane complexes, (3) organic   synthesis and development of synthetic
              methods, (4) natural product   isolation and reactions, (5) the analysis of
              unstable organic oxidation   products in simulated environments, and study of
              self-assembled   monolayers derived from modified cyclodextrins.  Mass
              spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural   details
              and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of   organic,
              bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. The addition of the   technique of
              electrospray extends the range of MS to proteins and nucleic   acid molecular
              weights far beyond any other technique. The use of   electrospray ionization in
              combination with high resolution provides the   latest techniques available in
              mass spectrometry. It affords the chemist   one of the most powerful tools
              available for the characterization of   compounds. The acquisition of this
              capability in mass spectrometry is   essential for the prosecution of frontier
              research in many fields of   chemistry.
