              McKelvey        International treaties for achieving conservation  and
              sustainable harvest of the  world's  marine  fish stocks have proved to  be 
              elusive  and  unstable. Astonishingly violent "fish wars" have  erupted, 
              leaving cooperative arrangements  in  disarray,   fishing communities
              economically  depressed, and fish stocks at risk of collapse.  This project  is
               designed to reexamine, in the  light of  modern  game-theoretic  concepts, 
              the  core reasons for  this  instability  of  cooperative   management,  and 
              to  identify  new  institutional arrangements which might prove to  be more
              stable.        The work proposed involves formulation and  analysis of
              game-theoretic models of a bi-  national jointly managed ``shared'' fishery, 
              where the stocks are harvested sequentially as  they migrate across national
              boundaries.  The  models are necessarily dynamic, since strategic  interactions
              are conditioned by past performance,  as well as by projected future
              circumstances.  Emphasis is placed on pervasive uncertainty and  the role of
              incomplete information that is common  in decision making. Specific issues to
              be studied  are:       1)institutional incentives which have led to 
              over-investment in fleets and processing  facilities;         2) tradeoffs
              between long term goals of  conservation and sustainability and short term 
              goals of socioeconomic stability;         3) strategic interactions,
              conditioned by  the particular ecological structure of the  ecological
              community of harvested fish species;  and              4) the design of
              institutional arrangements  which can promote stable cooperative joint 
              management of a marine fishery in uncertain and  unanticipated circumstances.
