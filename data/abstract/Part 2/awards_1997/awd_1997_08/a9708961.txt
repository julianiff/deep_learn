Abstract    :
              This  award funds a Workshop on Perception of Action, to  be  held  May  18-20,
              1997 in Brewster, MA.  As computer  vision  moves  from the processing of
              static images to consideration  of  image  streams  such  as video  sequences 
              or  real-time  robotic  vision,  the problem of machine "understanding"  of 
              actions  represented in the images is becoming  increasingly  important,  for
              potential applications such as security  and  surveillance,  dynamic  situation
              monitoring,  guidance  and  verification of machine action such as robotic
              assembly, and  support  for human user access to video image and multimedia 
              databases.  This workshop will explore the current state  of  knowledge  in
              this area, and look into future prospects  for  advances  in understanding,
              including schemes that represent  action  more  naturally  than the traditional
               sequences  of  static poses or key frames.  The results and recommendations 
              of  the  workshop will be published in the form of a report,  which will also
              be made available on a web site.
