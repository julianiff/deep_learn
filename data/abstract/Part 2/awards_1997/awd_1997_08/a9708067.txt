Abstract    :
              This research is on techniques to support early system-level exploration of 
              memory-intensive behaviors for multimedia applications such as video and image 
              processing. In addition to memory, system performance, power consumption and 
              total cost are constraints being considered. Techniques and tools being
              developed  under this approach are for: (1) estimation of memory requirements
              from the  system's specification under resource, performance and power
              constraints,  enabling a tradeoff of computation time against estimation
              accuracy by system  designers;  (2) optimization of the embedded system's
              specification under area,  performance and power constraints using a
              combination of coarse-grain and  fine-grain transformations; and (3)
              partitioning, organization, and mapping of  memory structures, including
              arrays, records and pointers, for implementation of  the system specification
              into hardware and software. These techniques and tools  are being integrated
              into an exploration environment which permits system  designers to evaluate
              feasible hardware/software implementations of  memory-intensive embedded
              applications.
