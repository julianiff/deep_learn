Abstract    :
              As the number and significance of concurrent software  systems continue to
              increase, the need for reliable methods  to ensure that these systems behave as
              intended becomes more  pressing.  A number of very different analysis
              techniques  have been proposed by researchers, but experience with these 
              techniques is limited chiefly to simple academic programs  and little is known
              about which techniques and tools are  most appropriate for particular problems,
              or how to use the  techniques effectively in practice. This project involves 
              carrying out a series of experiments to gain information on  the applicability
              of these techniques to real concurrent  programs.  These experiments include
              the analysis of several  real programs as well as controlled experiments with
              special  programs designed to isolate particular features identified  in the
              analysis of real programs as having  significant impact on the utility of one
              or more of the  analysis tools.  The results of those experiments will  provide
              guidance to software developers, feedback to  researchers developing analysis
              techniques, and a set of  benchmark programs and properties that can be used in
              the  development and evaluation of additional analysis  techniques.
