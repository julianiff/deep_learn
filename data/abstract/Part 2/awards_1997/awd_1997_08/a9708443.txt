Abstract    :
              Abstract    OPP-9708443    Fair/Thorton    Place-naming is an important feature
              of culture as it intersects a juncture of thought, language, and environment. 
              In northwest Alaska, place names (toponyms) also serve to preserve language,
              annotate ethnic and linguistic boundaries, and draw attention to particular
              geographic features with reference to shelter, safety, and subsistence.  The
              goal of this project is to analyze how toponyms function symbolically and as
              cultural identity among the Inupiat.  This study is important as it seeks to
              preserve, translate, interpret, and analyze toponyms while systematically
              mapping and recording accompanying information.,  Local native experts will
              participate in the team, and information will be collected on folk tales, oral
              history, genealogies and personal narratives.  Maps, archives and final
              publication will constitute important contributions to the knowledge of this
              regions, and to both area-specific and comparative toponymy.
