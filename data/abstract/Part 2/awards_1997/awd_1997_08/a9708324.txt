Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT  EEC-9708324  Ringo      The performance of submicron CMOS
              components like transistors, resistors and capacitors are usually limited by
              the parasitic substrate elements.  Past processing micromachining techniques
              can be employed to physically remove the cause of some of these parasites. 
              This three-year continuing award will study the development of micromachining
              techniques to enhance the performance of mixed-signal circuits in a submicron
              CMOS technology.    During the first two years, a set of primitive devices will
              be developed using an advanced micromachining process to be performed at the
              Washington Technology Center.  The devices will be characterized to determine
              design rules and device models suitable for mixed-signal circuit simulation. 
              In the second and third year, primitive circuit blocks will be built to
              determine reliability and characterize the improvement in the circuit
              operation.  Research results will include the design rules and the
              specification necessary for the two past processing micromachining techniques
              developed to eliminate parasitic substrate elements.
