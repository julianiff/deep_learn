Abstract    :
              Prof. D.J. Quesnel will conduct research work in the area of particle technology
              and  prepare a related short course during a sabbatical year visit at the
              Elmgrove Facility of Kodak Co.  Six related research/education areas will be
              considered at the beginning of the visit, including powder flow, toner dusting,
              toner transfer, fine toner handling, molecular dynamic study of particle
              adhesion, and training in powder mechanics.  Based on that experience, the P.I.
              will focus his activities on a major research thrust in the second part of the
              visit.  This is a GOALI Faculty in Industry proposal.    It is expected that
              the visit will foster long term collaboration between the University of
              Rochester and Kodak Co., with benefits for both research and educational
              programs on powder technology.
