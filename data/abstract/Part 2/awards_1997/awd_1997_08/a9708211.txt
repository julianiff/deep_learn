Abstract    :
              9708211  Sanders  The grant is for partial support of the 1997 FASEB Conference
              on Smooth Muscle held June 22 to June 27.  This conference is held every three
              years and is an update of our understanding of smooth muscle structure and
              function.  New developments in molecular biology, patch clamping and imaging
              have contributed exciting new insights into mechanisms which control
              myofilament interaction, ion channel activity, Ca signaling and cell-cell
              communication. It is important to bring together experts in these fields to ask
              critical questions related to smooth muscle.  In addition to lectures, there
              will be poster presentation, and nine young investigators selected from those
              submitting poster abstracts will give short presentations in each of the
              sessions.  This conference will review recent progress in the field and permit
              extensive interaction between participants.  ***
