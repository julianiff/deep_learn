Abstract    :
              Wieder  97-08543      .BIOGEOMON, Third International Symposium on Ecosystem
              Behavior, co-sponsored by  Villanova University and the Czech Geological
              Survey, will be held on the campus or Villanova  University on June 21-25,
              1997.  BIOGEOMON is the third in a series or meetings; the previous two  were
              held in Prague in 1987 and 1993. The 1993 conference attracted nearly 200
              scientists from 27  countries on five continents. The rationale behind
              BIOGEOMON has been and continues to be that  there is a need for biogeochemists
              to occasionally meet in a setting that allows recent research  findings to be
              presented i9 an atmosphere that rosters formal and informal discussion. 
              BIOGEOMON's major focus is the biogeochemistry or terrestrial ecosystems
              (mostly, but not  exclusively, temperate forests), and the   997 conference
              will feature sessions on watersheds as units  for biogeochemical investigation
              (watershed monitoring, manipulation, and modeling), emerging tools  for and
              approaches to biogeochemical research (natural abundance stable isotopes,
              natural abundance  radioactive and cosmogenic isotopes, geographic information
              systems), and selected current topics  (acidification and its reversal;
              nitrogen cycling, limitation and saturation; carbon gas fluxes across the 
              land/atmosphere boundary; nutrient cycling as related to global climate
              change). In addition to six  keynote speakers and 36 invited speakers,
              pre-registration forms have been received from over 170  individuals in 32
              countries, indicating a desire to present an oral or poster contribution at 
              BIOGEOMON in 1997. BIOGEOMON' s primary goals are to provide a forum for the
              dissemination  and discussion of recent research findings, to explore future
              directions for biogeochemical research,  and to foster interdisciplinary,
              collaboration between researchers or all ages at regional, national, and 
              international scales. The conference abstracts will be published in the Journal
              of Conference  Abstracts, and participants will have the option of sub mitting
              a manuscript four consideration for  publication in a special issue of Water,
              Air, and Soil Pollution.
