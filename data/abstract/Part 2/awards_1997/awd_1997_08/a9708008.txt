Abstract    :
              This is a two year project to develop and deploy measurement tools across  the
              Internet to measure Internet Service Provider (ISP) performance, and to  share
              the resulting statistics.  It is being conducted by Advanced Network  &
              Services (ANS), a nonprofit networking corporation, and the Common  Solutions
              Group (CSG), an informal coalition of 22 major research  universities and
              several other organizations located around the United  States.  ANS and the CSG
              are coordinating closely with three other Internet  measurement projects being
              funded by NSF: Cooperative Association for  Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA),
              National Internet Measurement  Infrastructure (NIMI), and Internet Performance
              Measurement and Analysis.
