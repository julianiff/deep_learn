Abstract    :
              9708576  Gose    This grant provides $76,350 as one-half support of the cost of 
              acquiring a new superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM) for the  Paleomagnetics
              Laboratory at the University of Texas.  The  requested instrument will replace
              an antiquated (vintage 1976)  and increasingly unreliable ScT instruments SRM
              that has been in  continuous service at UT for over 20 years.  The 2-G model
              755R  SRM that will be purchased is equipped with DC SQUIDS which  provide over
              an order of magnitude greater sensitivity and  greater dynamic range than their
              current instrument allowing  analysis of weakly magnetized sediments and rocks.
               This new  instrument will support a diverse range of scientific 
              investigations including paleomagnetic studies of plate motions  and
              paleoanthropological and archaeological studies that take  advantage of
              magnetostratigraphy to date fossil localities.  This  facility will also serve
              as an educational tool for multiple  graduate students and as a regional
              resource for investigators  requiring magnetic analyses of samples.  ***
