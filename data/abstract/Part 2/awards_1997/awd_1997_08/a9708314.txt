Abstract    :
              9708314  Tripoli        Much of the energy that drives atmospheric circulations
              is obtained through  exchanges of heat, moisture, and momentum with the
              surface.  Lake-effect weather  events, where cold air masses are rapidly
              modified over the Great Lakes, are  excellent natural laboratories for studying
              these exchanges. The Lake-Induced  Convection Experiment (Lake-ICE) is a
              multiple-Principal Investigator project which  seeks to use this natural
              laboratory to determine how boundary layer growth  processes are controlled by
              mesoscale boundary layer convective structures and how  the modified boundary
              layer effects the production of precipitation and the larger  scale
              meteorological conditions.         Under this award the Principal Investigator
              proposes to investigate how the  convective planetary boundary layer organizes
              in response to the evolving  environmental flow structure.  The researcher will
              utilize a suite of advanced  numerical models along with observations to be
              collected during the Lake-ICE.  The  ultimate objective is to bridge the gap in
              understanding of the large eddies in the dry  convective planetary layer that
              occurs on the upwind side of the Great Lakes to that  of the linear cloud rolls
              on the lee side.          If successful, this research will lead to a unified
              theory of linear cloud roll  genesis and the interaction of the factors
              responsible for that genesis with the  larger-scale environmental flows.  This
              could lead eventually to better forecasts of  timing, location and magnitude of
              lake-effect snow events.      ***
