Abstract    :
              9708020  Burdea  Body rehabilitation is a very repetitive activity.  Virtual 
              Reality (VR) is a novel technology that can change the  quality and cost of
              rehabilitation treatment.  Computer  hardware and virtual exercises will be
              modeled after  standard procedures for the hand, elbow and knee, with real- 
              time transparent data gathering into a patients' database.  The system will
              then be tested clinically at Stanford  Medical School, on two groups, a control
              group (performing  standard rehabilitation exercises) and an experimental 
              group.  Experimental data will be analyzed in order to  quantify the efficiency
              of VR-based rehabilitation and used  to improve the system.  Remote monitoring
              of the  rehabilitation process will be performed from the CAIP  Center at
              Rutgers University.  ***
