Abstract    :
              9708499  Langreth  The work of this senior and distinguished PI contains 
              several related components.  One of them is a density  functional theory of
              long-range interaction between  microscopic and mesoscopic bodies.  Another
              looks at a  theory of electronic dissipation, non-adiabatic charge  transfer
              and potentials and rates for atoms and molecular  species moving and reacting
              at a solid surface.  A third  component  is an initial foray into the theory of
              transport  in quantum dots using techniques previously developed by the  PI for
              non-adiabatic charge transfer.  %%%  The work of this senior and distinguished
              PI is related to  the properties of metals and insulators at a surface.  The 
              work explores the new physical phenomena which are seen as  an electron, an
              atom or a molecular specie moves near a  surface.  These include very subtle,
              long range and  technologically important questions of forces between small 
              bodies and  between a small grain and a surface.  They  include complex
              questions of charge transfer, when does it  happen and how.  Finally there are
              attempts to understand  transport in very small metallic grains.  ***
