              STATE UNIVERSITY      The aims of this research are to evaluate several
              contrasting hypotheses about why productivity of mature forests often declines
              after a peak at a relatively young age.  Alternatives include (1) increased
              respiration relative to photosynthesis with tree age, (2) accumulation of
              nutrients in organic matter pools with slow rates of  turnover, (3) changes in
              allocation away from biomass accumulation, and (4) changes in hydraulic
              conductivity of trees, leading to decreased stomatal conductance and thus
              decreased photosynthesis.  Tests of these alternative hypotheses are important
              from a wide range of perspectives, from understanding the ability of forests to
              store C in response to global climate change to improving our ability to manage
              forests for timber and other products. The location of the study is a
              Eucalyptus plantation in Hawaii that has been manipulated for several years by
              varying tree density and by fertilizer application. Results thus may be useful
              to management of plantation forests as well to understanding of more general
              successional changes in  forest productivity.
