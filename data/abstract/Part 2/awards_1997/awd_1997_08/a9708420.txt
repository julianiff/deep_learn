              ABSTRACT    OPP-9708420       FALKNER, KELLY  OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY           
               This project will utilize a Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker to conduct a
              series of oceanographic transects from Baffin Bay, through the Canadian
              archipelago, to the Beaufort Sea where a large, multidisciplinary research
              program, Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean, will be conducted.  A
              measurement program of tracer concentrations will be used to track fresh water
              flow out of the Arctic Ocean through a series of outlets in the Canadian
              Archipelago. The strength and volume of the outflow will be determined within a
              framework of physical and atmospheric dynamics that control the circulation. 
              This project will add an important component to the understanding of global
              change on linkages of the Arctic Ocean to the global ocean through one of the
              least studied "valves" in the global plumbing system.
