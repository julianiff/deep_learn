Abstract    :
              9708299  DaSilva  The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisae is a very important 
              industrial microorganism, and a key laboratory microorganism  for understanding
              eucaryotic cell processes.  The strains  employed range from genetically
              well-characterized haploid  or diploid strains to the relatively
              uncharacterized  industrial polyploid strains.  The ability to introduce 
              stable foreign genes at optimum copy number is extremely  important, and the
              ability to engineer the metabolism of  this yeast has tremendous potential. 
              Straightforward  methods to stably insert a series of the same or different 
              genes at precise copy numbers have not been developed, and  the regulated
              insertion of multiple genes into the  industrially important polyploid yeast
              has not been  addressed.  This project addresses these needs by developing  and
              applying methods for the sequential integration of  pathway and product genes
              in both laboratory and industrial  (including polyploid) yeast strains.  The
              knowledge to be  obtained is to contribute to the improvement of recombinant 
              yeast expression systems, and may provide insight into  integration methods of
              higher eucaryotic cells.  ***
