Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) will   assist the
              Department of Chemistry at Ohio State University to acquire a   400 MHz nuclear
              magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer and 250 MHz and 300   MHz NMR consoles.
              This equipment will enhance research in a number of   areas such as the
              following: (1) chiral metal complexes for asymmetric   catalysis, (2)
              conformational analysis of complex carbohydrate systems,   (3) construction of
              unusual molecular systems, (4) activation barriers   for carbene
              rearrangements, (5) perforin-mediated cytolysis (6) catalytic   dendrimers for
              asymmetric catalysis, (7) high potential iron proteins,   and (8) structure and
              dynamic behavior of selected carbanionic species.   Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
              (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool   available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules.   It is used to identify unknown
              substances, characterize specific   arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
              to study the dynamics of   interactions between molecules in solution. Access
              to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are
              carrying out frontier   research. The results from these NMR studies are useful
              in the areas such   as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
