Abstract    :
              Abstract    EEC-9708968, National Technological University, Lionel V. Baldwin,
              Principal Investigator    This award provides funding to the National
              Technological University for support of the 1996 National Engineers Week
              Teleconference for Middle and High School Students.  The eighth annual Discover
              Engineering! Teleconference will be delivered nationwide during National
              Engineers Week, on February 19, 1997.  The special focus of the teleconference
              will be a very fast-paced, highly interactive look at the transition from high
              school to college, featuring a panel of three high school students, two
              undergraduates and two professional engineers.  The telecast is central to many
              local activities held during National Engineers Week wherein engineers welcome
              students and teachers to the workplace, providing tours and discussion which
              are stimulated by the telecast.
