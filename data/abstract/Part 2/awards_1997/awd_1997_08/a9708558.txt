Abstract    :
                  9708558  Haimes  The 8th Conference on "Risk-Based Decision Making in Water 
              Resources" organized by the Engineering Foundation will take  place in Santa
              Barbara, California, on October 12-17, 1997.  The  main objectives of the
              conference is to examine the state-of-the-  art in risk/benefit analysis, to
              explore the use of risk/benefit  analysis in water resources planning and
              management including  hydrologic extremes, to exchange information among
              various stake-  holders, and to identify future research activities.  Some of
              the  issues that will be discussed are: water-works safety and risk of 
              catastrophic and extreme events; how to deal with uncertainties  in data,
              models and forecasts and how they influence the  management of water resources;
              advances in risk analysis.  This  is a research area of great importance for
              the mitigation of  natural and man-made hazards and for the sound economic 
              development of regions and the Nation.  ***
