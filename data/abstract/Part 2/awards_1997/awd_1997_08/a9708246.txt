Abstract    :
              9708246  Nielson    This  research  project  entitled Dielectric,  Calorimetric,
               and  Nonlinear   Optical   Properties  of  New  Structurally-Predicted 
              Ferroelectrics   will continue the search for  new  ferroelectric  materials  
              based  on  predictions  obtained  from  a  structural  analysis of current
              crystal structure data.  After identification  of potential ferroelectric
              materials is established, verification  involves   high  temperature  synthesis
               of  the   materials   in  polycrystalline   form;   structural   confirmation 
               by    x-ray  diffraction   analysis;   material  processing,  and   subsequent
               measurement of the dielectric and thermodynamic properties of the  materials 
              as  a  function  of  frequency  and  temperature.  The  research  topics  for
              undergraduate students involve  solid-state  synthesis,   calorimetry,  
              dielectric   measurements,   computer  programming    and    interfacing,   
              x-ray    diffraction    and  crystallography, all of which are designed to meet
              the graduation  requirements for students of chemistry and physics.  %%% 
              Ferroelectrics are of increasing importance in the fabrication of  electrooptic
                 devices,   integrated   circuits,    pyroelectric  detectors,  piezoelectric
              transducers and actuators, pyroelectric  detectors,   piezopositioning devices,
               and  non-volatile  memory  elements.   The  technological importance of this 
              area  and  the  considerable industrial need for new ferroelectric materials 
              for  an  increasing  range  of applications indicate  significant  job 
              opportunities for students educated in these areas.  ***
