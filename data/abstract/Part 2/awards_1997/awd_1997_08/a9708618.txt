Abstract    :
              9708618  Hager         This award will provide partial funding (67%) for the
              upgrade  and installation of GPS  receivers in the Tien Shan Mountain region 
              in support of research to measure and explain the growth of these  tectonically
              active mountains in terms of deep Earth processes.   The Massachusetts
              Institute of Technology is committed to providing  the remaining funds.  The
              Principal Investigator and co-Principal  Investigators from the MIT Department
              of Earth, Atmospheric, and  Planetary Sciences are collaborating on this
              project with a  multidisciplinary team of scientists from Kyrgyztan, Kazakstan,
              and  Russia.  The project is supported internationally, and the U.S. is  shared
              between NSF and NASA.  ***
