Abstract    :
                    This proposal requests support to build and install an intensified all-sky
              imaging photometer (ASIP) and to investigate a variety of phenomena related to
              the dayside cusp in darkness and polar cap sun-aligned arcs.  The imager will
              be located at Heiss Island, Russia and will operate continuously during the
              winter months.  The Heiss Island imager will constitute the eastward most
              anchor of a chain of all-sky imagers currently extended for Resolute Bay,
              Canada, through Greenland and up to Svalbard, Norway.  The imager, in addition
              of being used for studies of the cusp and the behavior of polar cap arcs, will
              be able to probe the dayside aurora with high temporal resolution, diagnose
              substorm related oval expansions, detect sun-aligned arcs in the near oval
              sector, and follow polar cap patches before being reconfigured into auroral
              blobs.  The Heiss Island imager, used in conjunction with the DMSP and Polar
              satellites and with the EISCAT and Svalbard incoherent scattering radars, will
              allow US investigators to conduct research in this region populated by several
              diagnostic techniques.  The science proposed here specifically deals with 1)
              understanding the formation and motion of sun-aligned arcs near the auroral
              oval and 2) imaging dayside transient events in the cusp/cleft region with high
              temporal and spatial resolution to investigate whether merging proceeds at
              multiple sites or instead over an extended merging line.  Funds are requested
              for building and installing an imager, and analyzing, interpreting, and
              distributing the data.  Additionally, partial support for post-doctorate
              participation is requested.
