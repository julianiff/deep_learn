              Paleoclimate Implications for the Last Interglacial and the 40 to 10 ka Time
              Windows in the Eastern Canadian Arctic     This award supports a project
              addressing two major paleoclimate questions:  (1) What characterized
              terrestrial conditions in the Arctic during the Last Glacial Maximum?  (2) Were
              previous interglacials stable warm periods, or were they interrupted by periods
              of more severe climate?  The former addresses key biological concerns related
              to biotic refugia, as well as paleoclimate unknowns regarding the stability of
              the LGM climate system.  The second question addresses Heinrich events. 
              Originating only a few hundred km from the field area,  Heinrich events
              resulted in dramatic climate oscillations throughout the Last Glacial Maximum;
              however, the impacts of these oscillations on terrestrial ecosystems in the
              Arctic is entirely unknown.  The interglacial sediments apparently record a
              climate state that results in a more northerly limit of shrub tundra than in
              the Holocene (i.e., warmer summers), and allow an assessment of climatic
              stability under warmer-than-present conditions.  This award will support the
              completion of analyses of the biological proxies preserved in cores previously
              recovered and  provide improved chronological control using AMS 14C dating of
              organic material in the lake sediments of eastern Baffin Island, Canada.
