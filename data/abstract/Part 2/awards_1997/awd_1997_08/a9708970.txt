Abstract    :
              The Olmec, one of Mesoamerica's first complex societies, developed along
              Mexico's Southern Gulf Coast during the period of ca. 1,400 - 400 BC. Olmec
              archaeology has traditionally focused on the spectacular achievements of this
              culture, most notably the colossal heads and other sculptures carved of basalt
              and displayed or interred within the monumental precincts of their largest
              centers. Olmec scholars have concentrated on the riverine sites in the Olmec
              heartland where most of the monuments were first discovered and endeavored to
              understand the iconography expressed. The chronology and economic organization
              of settlement in piedmont and upland sectors which provided the source area for
              the basalt used in the monuments consequently is still poorly understood.  
              Laguna de los Cerros, long considered one of the four principal centers of the
              Olmec heartland lies within the basalt bearing source zone for these monuments
              at the base of the Tuxtlas Mountains in southern Veracruz. The site produced
              numerous sculptures in pure Olmec style. Surprisingly almost no research has
              been conducted at Laguna since its initial exploration although it is known
              that a monument workshop exists within six kilometers of the site's center.
              This suggests that Laguna may have been the center of a local piedmont prestige
              economy specializing in monument production either for local use or for export
              to larger riverine sites. Dr. Killion has postulated that control of a piedmont
              prestige technology in the production of carved monuments necessary for Olmec
              ceremonialism would have enhanced the site's elite status and power, created
              economic and political opportunities for local leaders, encouraged the growth
              of regional power and helped further the process which led to a stratified form
              of social organization.  To examine this proposition Dr. Killion and his
              colleagues will conduct a survey to produce basic settlement pattern data and
              to trace changing patterns of settlement over time. They will also undertake a
              program of stratigraphic testing and intensive surface artifact collection.
              Petrographic analysis of basalt sources and workshop localities will allow the
              reconstruction of the organization of basalt production within Laguna's
              hinterland and its potential role as a monument producer throughout the
              heartland.  This research is important because the Laguna sites present a
              unique opportunity to acquire new information on a key piece of the puzzle of
              Olmec cultural dynamics. It will shed new light on the processes which led to
              the rise of  the first Middle American civilization.
