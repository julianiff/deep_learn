Abstract    :
              This award to Andrew B. Bocarsly at Princeton University is jointly   supported
              by the Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division and   the Office of
              Multidisciplinary Research in the Directorate of   Mathematical and Physical
              Sciences. The proposal is concerned with the   materials chemistry of cyanogels
              which are novel transition metal   cyanometallate coordination polymers that
              undergo a sol-gel transition   process when prepared in aqueous media. A
              typical cyanogel  prepared from   tetrachloropalladate and hexacyanocobaltate
              contains 95% water and is   indefinitely stable. Other cyanogels based on
              platinum or tin and   cobalticyanide or ferricyanide will be synthesized and
              characterized. The   goals of the research are to characterize the cyanogel
              structure and   stoichiometry, to explore their thermal chemistry to produce
              solid-state   materials as a function of gel composition and to explore the
              application   of derived solid-state materials in the areas of materials
              science,   catalysis and electrocatalysis.  Cyanogels are  coordination
              polymers which will display novel solution   and mechanical properties. On
              heating, they will be converted to new   alloys and solid-state phases which
              may be ferromagnetic, conducting or   serve as catalysts for heterogenous
              hydrogenation and anodic oxidation of   organic pollutants.
