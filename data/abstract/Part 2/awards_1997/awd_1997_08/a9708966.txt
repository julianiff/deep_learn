Abstract    :
              9708966  Shaw  The micro-tribological properties of carbon nanotubes will  be
              investigated.  Short lengths od tube will be attached to  the tip of an atomic
              force microscope and used as the slider  in contact with surfaces of MoS2, mica
              and other materials,  as well as monolayers of carbon tubes deposited on these 
              surfaces.  Testing will be conducted with the nanotubes  filled with various
              lubricants and other liquids.  It is  expected that the technique will allow
              determination of the  effects on lubrication performance of certain molecular 
              properties of the lubricants, such as diffusivity and  relaxation time.  The
              potentially low- friction, nanometer  thick boundary lubrication film produced
              in this way has a  number of possible applications in MEMS systems and hard 
              disk drives.  ***
