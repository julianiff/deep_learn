Abstract    :
              It funds a major study that will assess issues and derive research topics and
              policy recommendations for the nature and use of National Information
              Infrastructure technologies, and for the generation, distribution, and
              protection of information content that flows within those technologies. The
              study will assess the state of the art and emerging trends, examine the
              available data, evaluate existing intellectual property law, and map the
              changing landscape of interactions among these. The information generated will
              provide critically-needed, technologically-informed input into the National
              debates on these issues
