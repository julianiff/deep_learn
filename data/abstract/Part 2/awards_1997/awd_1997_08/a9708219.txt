Abstract    :
              This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
              Case Western Reserve University.  The project is to study the nature of
              self-medication with antibiotics by women in a regional city in Zaire.  The
              student hypothesizes that self-treatment with antibiotics has become the
              preferred therapy among women regardless of variation of illness conceptions or
              severity of symptoms.  The study will collect data from women of reproductive
              age using in-depth interviews, systematic elicitation techniques and open ended
              questions from a relatively small set of women. Based on the knowledge gained a
              survey will be designed and administered to about 250 women selected through a
              multistage sampling method.  From this sample a subsample of 15 women who
              report having experience with STD symptoms will be interviewed in-depth in
              order to examine the actual context of decision making.  Pharmacists and other
              antibiotic drug vendors will also be interviewed.   This research is important
              because powerful antibiotic medications are commonly sold without prescription
              or other expert medical control all over the developing world, leading to the
              development of drug-resistant strains of disease.  The new knowledge from this
              project about how and why people self-medicate will be valuable to health
              planners and decision makers in designing programs to address health needs
              while minimizing inappropriate use of antibiotic medicinal drugs.
