Abstract    :
              This award in the Environmental Geochemistry and Biochemistry Program is  
              supported by the Divisions of Earth Sciences and Chemistry and the  
              Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).  Dr.   Carrick
              M. Eggleston and Dr. Steven R. Higgins of the Geology and   Geophysics
              Department, University of Wyoming, will develop methods to   achieve
              crystal-face specificity in the measurement of mineral surface   charge.  The
              goal of the research is to move beyond a surface-average   approach to
              information helpful to understanding mineral surface   reactivity.  The surface
              charge and potential as a function of pH and   ionic media will be measured
              using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and   in-situ optical second harmonic
              generation (SHG) spectroscopy for   representative mineral surfaces, such as,
              corundum, hematite, rutile and   quartz.  These measurements will be compared
              to results obtained after   the adsoprtion of organic molecules at the
              mineral-water interface.  Of   interest are citric, oxalic, p-nitrobenzoic, and
                4,5-dinitrobenzene-1,2-dicarboxylic acids and rhodamine.  Understanding
              reactions of organic and biological compounds with mineral   surfaces are
              increasingly important to complete characterization of   complex geological and
              environmental processes at the molecular level.    The methods currently used
              in mineral surface geochemistry are not   adequate.  Here, the capabilities of
              AFM and SHG instrumentation will be   tested as means of characterizing the
              surfaces of mineral surfaces found   in `real world` samples.
