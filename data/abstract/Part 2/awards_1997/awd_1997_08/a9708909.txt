Abstract    :
                    9708909  Schneider    This is a twelve month SGER grant to develop two
              elementary science cases relating to student knowledge of science concepts
              drawn from real-life classroom teaching.  Patterned after the cases
              successfully used to prepare other professionals such as those in business and
              law, these science cases will ground theoretical ideas and enhance analytic
              thought, reflection, and decision making in the teaching of physical science. 
              The project, based on earlier work in mathematics, will explore and answer the
              following questions:  What does a science case look like?  What are the
              essential elements of a science case?  What issues that arise in science cases
              transfer from one conceptual area in science to another? How will involvement
              in a case improve teachers' physical science content and knowledge and
              instructional strategies.  If successful these prototypes my lead to a new type
              of professional development material for science education.
