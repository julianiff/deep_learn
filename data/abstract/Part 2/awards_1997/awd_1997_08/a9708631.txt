Abstract    :
              ECS-9708631  Kamen    In this proposal, The Georgia Institute of Technology
              (Georgia Tech) and  FAStar, Ltd. (FAS) will collaborate to advance polymer
              deposition technology for large area substrates used in integrated circuits,
              flat panel displays, multichip modules and solar cells.  The advances will be
              made in extrusion coating process control with the effect of the work being to
              enhance the performance of the deposition tool and significantly reduce the
              cost of polymer material through waste minimization by applying FAS's
              deposition technique to microelectronics fabrication.    Polymer deposition is
              not only essential to the manufacture of integrated circuits, it is repeated
              many times in the making of each circuit.  Spin coating is the most prevalent
              method used in industry today to deposit polymers onto microelectronic
              substrates.  As the industry increases substrate size, the cost of each circuit
              decreases because more circuits are fabricated each time a substrate is
              processed.  However, spinning large substrates is challenged by rotational
              inertia, coating uniformity and again material loss.  Tool vendors have
              developed and recently begun to market alternative coating methods. These
              deposition methods include curtain coating, meniscus coating and extrusion
              coating.  Process control improvements are a vital need for these new, low
              per-unit cost production methods to be accepted and utilized by the
              microelectronic industry.
