Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9708227, Seton Hall University    Prof. Augustine is being funded
              by the Chemical Reactions Program (Kinetics and Catalysis) to continue his
              prior work on enantioselective heterogeneous catalysis (NSF grant 9312533) in
              two directions: develop more general chiral modifiers for supported metal
              catalysts, and support chiral homogeneous complex catalysts.  The modifier to
              be developed is based on amine derivatives of naphthyl binaphtol acetal, and so
              provide binding groups and molecular orientation to favor enantiomeric
              resolution for the hydrogenation of alpha-methyl butenoic acid.  For the second
              part of the project, phosphotungstic heteropolyacid anions will be loaded on a
              modified support (clay), or included during sol-gel synthesis of another oxide.
               Support modifiers will be vanadyl alkoxide, titanium tetraethoxide or aluminum
              isopropoxide.  The oxide-heteropolyacid combination will be used as support for
              a chiral metal complex such as RhDIPAMP.  Preparative variables will be studied
              in detail.  The hydrogenation of prochiral acrylates will be used as test
              reaction for activity and enantioselectivity.  The expectation is that the   
              electronic effects introduced by heteropolyacids can be used to fine-tune the
              activity and selectivity of the chiral modifier.  Spectroscopy (UV, VIS, IR,
              XPS, 31P, 13C, and 1H MAS NMR) will be used for catalysts characterization. 
              The research will have major significance in the pharmaceutical and
              agrochemical industries.
