Abstract    :
                It is widely held that scientific method involves attempts to disconfirm
              prevailing hypotheses -- and experiments conducted in fields like physics are
              usually designed to do exactly this.  On the other hand, a large body of
              psychological literature suggests that people instead seek evidence confirming
              hypotheses.  In this proposal, the PI suggests that this difference may have to
              do with the state of knowledge associated with a given hypothesis - when the
              state of knowledge is advanced, we seek disconfirmation of a hypothesis but
              when the state of knowledge is primitive, seeking confirmation may be more
              effective because it is more likely to result in further evidence from which to
              induce generalizations, rules and principles.  This conjecture will be tested
              in a series of experiments, some involving individuals and some involving small
              groups to allow for testing of the additional hypothesis that groups will
              perform better in induction tasks than individuals.
