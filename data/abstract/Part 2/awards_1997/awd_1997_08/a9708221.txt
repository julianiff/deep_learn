Abstract    :
              9708221  Insana  Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) techniques are to be developed 
              to detect early changes in renal microstructure that  ultimately lead to
              end-stage renal disease (ESRD).  QUS  involves analysis of echo spectra in
              frequency channels  corresponding to scattering from various anatomical scales 
              to measure the size, number density, and collagen content of  essential tissue
              microstructures.  These are among the first  techniques for analyzing
              histological properties of tissues  in vivo and noninvasively.    The incidence
              of ESRD in the United States is increasing  geometrically.  Average medicare
              costs were $46,117 per ESRD  patient  for a total of $9.5 billion in 1992.  A
              definitive  diagnosis of progressive injury leading to ESRD is now based  on
              clinical findings and biopsy; that often occur late in  the disease process. 
              Currently no test exists to establish  the presence of early kidney injury or
              to identify  populations at risk for whom prevention of progressive  injury
              should be attempted.  This investigation will examine  the potential of QUS as
              a safe, inexpensive, and noninvasive  method for early detection of renal
              injury caused by several  common conditions including diabetes, hypertension,
              and  cystic kidney disease.  This three-year, multidisciplinary  research
              project aims to develop new biomedical  instrumentation, experimental
              techniques, and models of  disease processes.  If QUS can successfully identify
               patients at risk for ESRD, the potential to prevent disease  would be
              improved, the net cost of treating the disease  would be reduced significantly,
              and the quality of life for  those patients affected would be improved.  This
              research  program is part of a new graduate-level Biomedical  Engineering
              Program at the University of Kansas.  ***
