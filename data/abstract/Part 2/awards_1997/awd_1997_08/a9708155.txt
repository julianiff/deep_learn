Abstract    :
              Vander Wall  9708155    The objective of this research is to determine the
              relative contributions of primary (wind) and secondary (animal scatter
              hoarding) dispersal to the reproductive success of four species of pines with
              winged seeds that vary in seed mass: lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta; 7
              mg/seed), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa; 55 mg), Jeffrey pine (Pinus
              jeffreyi; 146 mg), and sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana; 288 mg). 
              Scatter-hoarding animals provide several important benefits to the seeds,
              including dispersal that often carries the seed away from the source plant,
              burial of the seeds in soil, and caching the seed in microhabitats that often
              favor seedling establishment.  The variation in seed size is expected to
              influence the aerodynamic behavior of the seed and the attractiveness of the
              seed to vertebrate foragers (i.e., both primary and secondary dispersal).  As
              seed size increases, the relative effectiveness of wind dispersal should
              decrease and the relative effectiveness of animal-mediated dispersal should
              increase.    This research will make fundamental contributions to our
              understanding of seed dispersal and reproductive success in plants, especially
              with regard to the role of secondary dispersal, which has received little
              study. Further, this study will also provide information that will help
              foresters more effectively manage these economically valuable trees.  The
              critical steps of seed dispersal and seedling establishment are poorly
              understood for these pines.  The current assumption, based on seed morphology
              and cone phenology, is that these pines are wind dispersed and that animals act
              almost exclusively as seed predators.  The results of this research will fill
              this gap in our knowledge and provide scientifically sound data on which to
              base management decisions.
