Abstract    :
              This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
              New York University studying political leadership in a Mexico City lower class
              neighborhood.  The project will focus on the change of leadership style from
              the old-fashioned `cacique` or strong-man style who provides generalized
              support to followers, to a more contemporary narrowly-focused issues-oriented
              leader of collective action.  Using in-depth interviews of leaders and actors
              in collective popular movements , participant-observation of social movements,
              oral histories of local movements, and a survey of two neighborhoods the
              student will test the hypothesis that the loss of political control by the
              official PRI party is associated with a changeover in local political
              leadership style from strong-man to popular leader.   This research is
              important because is will advance our understanding of how local issues are
              resolved in the capital city of our close neighboring country.  Mexico is
              undergoing rapid political change, and this project will shed light on how that
              change is being lived out on the streets of working class neighborhoods.  The
              information will be of interest to social scientists as well as policy makers
              who need to understand why the Mexican government institutes specific policies.
