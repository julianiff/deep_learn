Abstract    :
              Anne Myers of the University of Rochester is supported by the   Experimental
              Physical Chemistry Program in her continuing studies in   which she uses
              resonance Raman and fluorescence spectroscopies to   characterize the coupling
              of electronic transitions of a chromophore to   nuclear degrees of freedom in
              the surrounding environment in liquids and   amorphous solids.  Three types of
              experiments will be carried out:  (i)   Raman linewidths for molecular ions
              will be compared under resonant vs.   nonresonant excitation conditions to test
              the hypothesis that the   previously observed increase in linewidth on
              resonance is due to coupling   of the chromophore-localized vibrations to
              solvent or intermolecular   phonons; (ii) resonantly excited emission spectra
              will be measured as a   function of temperature and the spectra will be modeled
              to better   understand the temperature dependence; (iii) low-temperature
              fluorescence   line-narrowing spectra will be measured in chromophore/matrix  
              combinations to investigate the chromophore dependence of the coupled   phonon
              frequencies and coupling strengths.    These investigations will provide
              insight to the processes that are   responsible for the broadening of
              electronic absorptions in condensed   media and to processes that affect
              chemical reaction rates in condensed   phases.  Efforts to develop practical
              optical memory devices based on   persistent spectral hole burning in solids
              will be aided by a better   understanding resulting from this research.
