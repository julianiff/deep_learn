Abstract    :
              9708272  Guidotti         This grant provides $70,295 as one-half support of the
              costs  of acquiring a state-of-the-art powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD)  that
              will be housed in a newly constructed Global Sciences  building on the Orono
              campus of the University of Maine.  This  acquisition will allow these PI's to
              continue their  internationally recognized research programs in petrologic 
              mineralogy including studies of the phase equilibria of solid  solutions in
              metamorphic rocks and borosilicates.  The  characterization of both structural
              properties and mineralogic  identification of unknowns is fundamental to these
              researchers  and the establishment of a modern XRD facility at the University 
              of Maine will benefit a number of other faculty both within the  Department of
              Geological Sciences and within the departments of  Physics and Engineering.
