              ABSTRACT    OPP-9708349       MUNCHOW, ANDREAS  RUTGERS UNIVERSITY             
              This project will utilize a Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker to conduct a series
              of oceanographic transects from Baffin Bay, through the Canadian archipelago,
              to the Beaufort Sea where a large, multidisciplinary research program, Surface
              Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean, will be conducted.  A measurement
              program of tracer concentrations will be used to track fresh water flow out of
              the Arctic Ocean through a series of outlets in the Canadian Archipelago. The
              strength and volume of the outflow will be determined within a framework of
              physical and atmospheric dynamics that control the circulation.  This project
              will add an important component to the understanding of global change on
              linkages of the Arctic Ocean to the global ocean through one of the least
              studied "valves" in the global plumbing system.
