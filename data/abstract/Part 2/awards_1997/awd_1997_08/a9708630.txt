Abstract    :
              ***  9708630  ORWOLL  This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and
              Facilities   Program (CRIF) Program will assist a junior faculty in the
              Department of   Chemistry at the College of William and Mary to acquire a
              electrochemical   analysis system. This equipment will enhance research in the
              area of   metal-containing oligomers and polymers.     The electrochemical
              analysis system is concerned with measuring the   processes and factors
              affecting the transport of charge across interfaces   between chemical phases.
              This technique allows researchers to study   electrode reactions that might
              include an unstable intermediate such as   radical ion, and to conduct
              electrosynthesis.          ***
