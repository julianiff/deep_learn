Abstract    :
              Jameson/Abstract            The objective of this research is to seek additional
              evidence about  the spatial and temporal distribution of cloud drops and
              raindrops.   Existing practice assumes that Poisson statistics describe such
              distributions  but recent results contradict this assumption.  Additional
              observations  from previous flights of research aircraft will be investigated
              along with  measurements from disdrometers.
