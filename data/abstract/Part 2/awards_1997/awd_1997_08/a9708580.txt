Abstract    :
              This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
              Rutgers University, studying the national development policy of the Thai
              government as it affects the work choices made by rural village women. The
              student will examine the development policies and rhetoric of the Thai
              government, as well as the opportunities for women to make a living in two
              rural northern Thai provinces.  The specific focus of the project will be to
              explain the role of unique cultural factors in Thailand's heritage as well as
              the social and political factors in the twentieth century which have
              facilitated the rapid growth of the sex industry (some estimates of as much as
              10 percent involvement of women in the age group 14-24) with the concomitant
              growth of STDs in general and HIV/AIDS in particular.  Using ethnographic
              methods the student will try to understand how families in the north, a source
              area for commercial sex workers, justify this work with reference to the
              traditional alternatives.  The project will evaluate different theoretical
              rationales for this prevalence, from the cultural tradition of lower female
              status associated with Theravada Buddhism, to the change from matrilineal to
              patrilineal resource flows associated with western-style capitalist
              development, to the national development policies of the government which have
              decreased economic opportunities in the north with respect to the south.  This
              research is important because it will advance our understanding of the causes
              of the extraordinary commercialization of female sexuality in the case of
              Thailand, which will help our general understanding of this process in other
              cultures.
