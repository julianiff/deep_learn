Abstract    :
              ***  9708922  GISASON  This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation
              and Facilities   (CRIF) Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at the
              University   of Illinois at Chicago to acquire an x-ray photoelectron
              spectrometer   (XPS). This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
                including the following: (1) surface chemical analysis of ion beam   modified
              polymer films, (2) high resolution XPS and surface chemistry   research, and
              (3)  analysis of reactive carbon monofluoride thin films.    The X-ray
              photoelectron (XPS) spectrometer is used for chemical analysis.   It irradiates
              a sample with a beam of monochromatic X-rays and the   energies of the
              resulting photoelectrons are measured and are related to   specific elements.
