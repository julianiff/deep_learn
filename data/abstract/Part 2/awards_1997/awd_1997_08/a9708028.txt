Abstract    :
              9708028  Borgstahl    This is a Research Planning Grant for Women Scientists and
              Engineers.  Dr. Borgstahl will study the structure of replication protein A
              (RPA) by X-ray crystallography.  RPA is essential to the maintenance and
              replication of DNA.  The recombinant protein will be produced in E.coli and
              very pure protein samples will be obtained using the latest techniques and
              established protocols.  A wide range of crystallization conditions will be
              explored to grow large well-ordered crystals.  Three strategies will be used to
              obtain diffraction quality crystals:  crystallization of intact yeast and human
              RPA;  crystallization of RPA domains and subcomplexes;  crystallization of a
              trimmed RPA heterotrimer.  Once crystals are obtained,  X-ray diffraction data
              will be collected in order to obtain a high resolution structure of the
              protein.    Replication protein A is a fundamental molecule in metabolism and
              is essential for eukaryotic life.  RPA is absolutely required for many DNA
              metabolic processes, including replication, nucleotide excision repair and
              homologous recombination.  The elucidation of the three-dimensional structure
              of RPA should provide insight into how this protein interacts with DNA and how
              it functions in its essential multidisciplinary role in DNA metabolism.  ***
