Abstract    :
              9703154  Spruck    The proposed research deals with a number of geometric
              problems in the area of Riemannian and differential geometry. Asymptotic shape
              of curvature flows, local two dimensional isometric embedding problem, complex
              Green's function and existence of analytic functions on Stein manifolds, and
              isoperimetric inequality on Cartan-Hadamard manifolds are among the problems to
              be pursued. The main tool to be used is the theory of Monge-Ampere equations.  
               The use of nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations to solve
              fundamental problems in differential geometry has been one of the great
              achievements of modern mathematics. Perhaps the most important nonlinear
              elliptic equation is the Monge-Ampere equation and there have been significant
              advances in our understanding of this equation in the last several years.
              Partial differential equations model various natural phenomena where several
              parameters vary simultaneously and their rates of change over a short time
              interval can be observed. Thus far, a general theory of such equations is very
              much lacking, especially when the equation is fully nonlinear.
