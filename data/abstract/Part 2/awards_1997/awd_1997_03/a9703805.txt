Abstract    :
                    9703805  Masri  Presently used actuators to generate control forces are
              generally  inadequate for limiting the response of civil structures under 
              strong earthquake shaking.  There is a critical need for a new  generation of
              actuators that have the capability of adequately  performing under strong
              ground motion which may induce  significant nonlinear deformations in
              structures.    The objective of this research is to develop an innovative semi-
               active damping augmentation device for controlling the seismic  response of
              dispersed civil structures.  The control procedure  uses nonlinear auxiliary
              mass dampers with adjustable (adaptive)  motion-limiting stops, located at
              selected positions throughout  the structure, to inject an optimum amount of
              "chaos" in the  structures dynamic response by disorganizing the orderly
              process  of amplitude buildup.  The degree of the structure's oscillation  in
              the vicinity of each semiactive nonlinear actuator determines  the actuator's
              actively-controlled gap size and activation time.   By using control energy to
              adjust the actuator's critical  parameters instead of directly attenuating the
              motion of the  structure (which conventional active control methods do), a 
              significant improvement is achieved in the total amount of energy  expended to
              accomplish a given level of vibration control.    A sequence of analytical and
              experimental studies by means of a  bridge model to be provided with several
              innovative nonlinear  actuators and subjected to multiple-support earthquake
              excitation  by seismic shakers will also be conducted.  ***
