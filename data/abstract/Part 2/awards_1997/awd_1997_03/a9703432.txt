Abstract    :
              In this CAREER project supported by the Physical Chemistry Program of the  
              Chemistry Division, Schmuttenmaer will use time-resolved far-infrared  
              spectroscopy with sub-picosecond resolution to study condensed phase  
              dynamics. This technique will be used to examine the dynamics of electron  
              solvation in liquids, the dynamics of photoconductivity in organic   molecular
              crystals, and the dynamics of energy dissipation in liquids.    The educational
              component involves innovation in undergraduate teaching,   including the use of
              discovery-based education, written assignments, case   studies, and the
              involvement of undergraduates in this research program.  In the recent past,
              time-resolved laser studies with sub-picosecond   temporal resolution in the
              ultraviolet and infrared spectral regions have   helped contribute to increased
              understanding of many in chemistry,   physics, biology, optics, and
              electronics.  The technological advances in   this work will allow similar
              studies to be carried out in the   far-infrared spectral region, a fertile and
              as yet untapped area where   much new knowledge remains to be discovered.
