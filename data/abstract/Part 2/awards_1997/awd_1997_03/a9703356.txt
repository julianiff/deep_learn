Abstract    :
              9703356  Lauersen  A CAREER award supports a study of contact friction.  Key 
              issues emphasized include development of energetically  consistent numerical
              algorithms for transient friction  processes, development of an integrated
              thermodynamic and  computational approach to the treatments of thermal coupling
               at the interface and of rate effects, friction anisotropy  and lubrication and
              wear.  The results will be compared with  data obtained from the automotive
              industry on the thermal  behavior of brakes and the dynamic behavior of tires
              on  rough roads.  The educational aspects of the award include  undergraduate
              student-assisted development of electronic  textbooks for basic solid and fluid
              mechanics courses.  ***
