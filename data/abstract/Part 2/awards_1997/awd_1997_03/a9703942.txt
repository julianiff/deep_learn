Abstract    :
              9703942  Conley      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour  months of
              research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Charles H. Conley, of the University of
              Texas,  Denton, to work with Dr. Moshe Flato at the Universite de  Bourgogne in
              Dijon, France.  Dr. Flato is a well-known  expert in mathematical physics.   
              Dr. Conley will study irreducible unitary representations of  gauge
              supergroups.  He is trying to generalize them to the  setting of supergroups
              and supermanifolds.  In addition, he  will complete a study on indecomposable
              representations of  semidirect project Lie groups.  He will use the
              realizations  he has found to show that the smooth indecomposable 
              representations with a preunitary composition series may be  completed to
              representations acting by bounded operators in  a Hilbert space.  In addition
              to his work with Dr. Flato,  the PI will also be able to work with active
              groups in  affine Kac-Moody Lie algebras, quantum groups, and star 
              representations.        ***
