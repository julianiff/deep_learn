Abstract    :
              9703497    Chen    This proposed work is a further investigation of certain  
              "gradient-like" flows. In particular, the focus is  on the study of the partial
              regularity, the   uniqueness and the behavior of the singularities for the  
              weak flow of harmonic maps, and the partial regularity   for the weak flow of
              H-system from a surface with a   Dirichlet boundary condition or with a free
              boundary   condition. Due to the geometric nature, these flows   satisfy
              nonlinear partial differential equations, which   rarely can be attacked by
              standard PDE methods or direct   variational method.    The aim of this
              proposed work is to find new results for   these problems and to develop new 
              methods for the study   of a whole class of geometric evolution problems with a
                similar structure. The belief is that the nonlinear   analysis method
              developed here can also be applied to  material science, such as the evolution
              of spin fields  in continuum ferromagnets, and to other areas.
