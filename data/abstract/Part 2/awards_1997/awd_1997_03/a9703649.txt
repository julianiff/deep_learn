Abstract    :
              9703649  Borland      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty  four months of
              research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twenty-four-month
              postdoctoral  research visit by Dr. Lisa M. Borland to work with Dr. 
              Constantino Tsallis at the Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas  Fisicas (CBPF) in
              Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Tsallis is a  distinguished member of the Brazilian
              scientific community,  who has an international reputation. The CBPF is one of
              the  top research labs in Brazil, housing over 70 researchers in  physics, as
              well as 150 graduate students.      This project involves the investigation of
              the dynamics of  systems with anomalous diffusion.  Specifically, they  propose
              to develop a theoretical framework ultimately  resulting in a procedure for
              determining the underlying  dynamics of anomalous stochastic processes of
              Levy-type  directly from experimental observations.  Once the  theoretical
              description is understood, they would implement  the theory as a computer code.
               This would result in a  powerful tool to analyze the underlying dynamics of
              Levy-  type processes in nature.  ***
