Abstract    :
              9703842    Friedman              The proposed research will concentrate on the
              development of new  analytic methods for solving free boundary problems.  The
              first class of  such problems are the Navier-Stokes equations used to model
              coating flow.  The second topic will be Stefan type problems where the free
              boundary has  very large oscillations and this involve homogenization and
              boundary  layers; such models arise, for example, in chemical vapor deposition.
               Next  topic will be the propagation of a crack in elastic material, where the
              free  boundary moves, with time, into the region.  Other areas of research will
               involve nonlinear systems of elliptic variational inequalities and motion  of
              particles in fluid.            The problems to be studied arise in mathematical
              modeling of  industrial processes and design.  They include the coating of
              photographic  film, the design of magnetic heads for improved sound
              transmission,  processing of semiconductors, rheological properties of
              immersions, and the  analysis of cracks in metals.  Based on our past
              experience, it is  anticipated that the analytic methods which will be
              developed will enable  one to develop very efficient numerical schemes for
              computing quantities of  interest for these models, so that improved industrial
              products can be  designed in shorter time.
