Abstract    :
              9703966  Eliel  This award will support various activities of the U.S.Mexico
              Foundation for Science, a bilateral, non-governmental organization established
              in 1991 to bring about closer ties in science and technology between the United
              States and Mexico. An initial commitment of $2 million from each country and
              funds from the private sector have allowed the Foundation to support two rounds
              of collaborative research, underwrite summer grants for young Mexican faculty
              to spend time with senior U.S. investigators, and provide fellowships for
              graduate students to complete their thesis work at U.S. laboratories.  In
              addition, the Foundation has supported the travel of outstanding scientists and
              engineers to Mexico for lectures and scientific interactions.  The Foundation
              intends to use these funds to support visits by distinguished U.S. experts to
              Mexico, summer visits by young Mexican faculty to the U.S., academic year
              fellowships for Mexican graduate students to U.S. universities, and a workshop
              to deal with environmental issues on the U.S.Mexico border.  This United States
              contribution includes funds provided by the National Science Foundation and the
              Environmental Protection Agency.  ***
