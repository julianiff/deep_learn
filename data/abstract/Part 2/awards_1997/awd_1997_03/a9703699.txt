Abstract    :
              This proposal will develop the concept for an MHD-based GGCM (Global Geospace
              Circulation Model).  The end product would be a facility, which could be used
              by the science community.  Use could include testing changes in the models and
              the development of modules for addition to the basic MHD core.  The end product
              of this project will be the definition and structure of the concept.  The
              importance of such a concept study is to help determine the best implementation
              strategy to undertake in a concerted GGCM development effort, which may be
              mounted in the near future.
