Abstract    :
              Abstract - Kosanovich - 9703252    The objective this research is the
              development of a rigorous theoretical framework that can be used to design an
              effective feedback control strategy for multi-product chemical reactors.  The
              motivation is provided by a global market economy which demands that the
              manufacture of multiple grades of a single product be made efficiently using
              the same equipment while simultaneously minimizing the production of off-spec
              material and maintaining safety and environmental constraints.  This project is
              a fundamental approach to this problem that starts with modeling and analysis
              of the multiple nature of the operations leading to a framework that permits
              the design of a hybrid supervisory control strategy.  Specifically: (1) local
              approximation models will be developed to represent the multiple process
              operations and constraints at each operating point, and (2) a dynamic
              supervisory controller will be designed to select and to switch into operation,
              the best controller from a set of possible controllers, that will provide
              superior setpoint tracking.  This research will provide new and fundamental
              insights into the transition control problem, resulting in a new theoretical
              framework that combines multi-resolution modeling and robust controller design
              with analysis of stability and performance of the closed-loop system.    The
              expected results will enhance the education of chemical engineers at the
              graduate and undergraduate levels.  Examples of this include: the development
              of numerical programs in the form of algorithms to introduce multi-resolution
              model identification; the inclusion of transition control to the existing
              process control course; the development of a laboratory experiment to provide
              active experimentation and concrete experience of the proposed concepts; the
              collaboration with industry through co-operative externship programs to expose
              students to multi-product processes; and the use of workshops and thesis
              projects with industrial students to facilitate  technology transfer.
