Abstract    :
                Lund  9703838    This research considers periodic time series and their
              applications to problems in climatology.  Because of  the periodic nature of
              weather, tides, solar radiation, and other naturally cyclic processes, many
              related  time series inherit periodicities in their statistical structure. This
              research investigates some common   questions of analysis involving periodic
              series. Specifically examined are when a time series should be  regarded as
              periodic, how a periodic series should be modeled, how to estimate trends in
              periodic series,  and how to accurately forecast future values of periodic
              series.  To settle these questions, mathematical  properties of periodic
              autoregressive moving-average time series models are explored.  The main tool
              of  analysis is the time series Innovations Algorithm, which uses the derived
              covariance structure of the  periodic models being considered to compute model
              likelihoods and best linear predictors.      The mathematical and statistical
              results developed are used to investigate some current climatological  issues. 
              In particular, the developed trend estimation techniques are applied in a study
              of North American  temperature trends.  Trend estimates of periodic monthly
              series are compared to trend estimates of  stationary yearly series.  Since the
              yearly series are obtained by averaging the monthly series - a twelvefold
              series length reduction - the trend estimates from the monthly series are more
              accurate.  This results in a  better understanding of climatic change and
              global warming.  Likewise, the developed prediction methods  yield improved
              forecasts of climatological processes.
