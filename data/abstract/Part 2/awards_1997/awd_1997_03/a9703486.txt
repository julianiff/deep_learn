Abstract    :
              Lineberger has submitted a renewal proposal to investigate the properties   of
              negative ions and their clusters in the gas phase using negative ion  
              photoelectron spectroscopy and ultrafast pump-probe excitation of ionic  
              complexes.  With these techniques both the structural information and the  
              reaction dynamics will be investigated for a broad class of systems which   are
              either chemical transients, reactive intermediates, or transition   state
              species.  Among the molecules to be studied are organic radicals   and
              biradicals, metals and metal clusters, and transition states for both  
              unimolecular and bimolecular processes.  Electron affinities,   singlet-triplet
              splittings, vibrational frequencies, and geometrical   information will be
              obtained.  Ortho, meta, and para forms of benzyne   (C6H4) will be synthesized
              using stereochemical control.  Unimolecular   processes investigated by
              ultrafast methods include the 1,2 hydrogen   shift in vinylidene to form
              acetylene.  The dynamics of ions in a solvent   cage will also be extended by
              following the appearance of products of   cage disintegration as well as
              solvent reorganization following electron   transfer in partially solvated
              ions.  One goal of these studies is to   increase the quantitative
              understanding of the processes driving the   simplest chemical transformations.
               By studying the chemical   transformations of molecules which are both
              isolated as well as   surrounded by solvent species, Lineberger will be able to
              demonstrate the   effect that different solvents have on reactivity as well as
              on the rates   at which these reactions proceed.
