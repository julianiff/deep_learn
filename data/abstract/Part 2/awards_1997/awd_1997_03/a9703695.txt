Abstract    :
              9703695    Strauss         The purpose of this project is to study mathematical
              models of waves that   occur in the theories of plasmas, of fluids, and of
              other branches of physical   science.  Stability and instability phenomena will
              be investigated, particularly  in   the kinetic theory of charged particles
              with and without collisions.  Stability   problems for a variety of other kinds
              of waves, including breathers, solitary  waves   and dispersive waves, will
              also be explored.  Energy conserving waves of  marginal   stability will be
              emphasized, and methods of mathematical analysis will be  employed in   the
              investigations.      Waves occur in many forms in the physical environment,
              such as in the ocean,   the atmosphere, biochemical processes, acoustics,
              telecommunications, and so on.   The   most complicated ones are the nonlinear
              ones, where it is difficult to predict  the   outcomes without very complex
              calculations.  Some of these nonlinear waves are   unstable, which means that a
              small change creates a large disturbance.  Which  waves   are stable and which
              are unstable will be the focus of this project.  The basic   principles for
              understanding these phenomena are mathematical.  These principles  are  
              fundamental to the creation of high-performance computing algorithms.  We  
              shall investigate the stability theory especially within the   theory of
              physical plasmas.    The stability of nonlinear plasma waves is relevant to
              such diverse applications  as   fusion energy research and satellite and radio
              communications in space.
