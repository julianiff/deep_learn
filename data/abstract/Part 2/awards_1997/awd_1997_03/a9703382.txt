Abstract    :
              9703382    O'Malley    The University of Washington proposes that the research
              project  Analytical Approaches to Singular Perturbation Problems of 
              Significance in Applications be continued, with Professor Robert  E. O'Malley,
              Jr. as the Principal Investigator.  The research  develops asymptotic methods
              to solve nonlinear boundary value  problems for both ordinary and partial
              differential equations  when solutions feature narrow boundary, shock, or
              transition  layer regions of rapid change.  The research will emphasize stiff 
              computation and dynamic metastability, through a consistently  hybrid
              asymptotic/numeric investigation.  Special notice will be  paid to
              asymptotically exponentially small terms, which have  previously received scant
              attention, since we are now well aware  that asymptotics beyond all orders can
              be of critical physical  significance.    Throughout science and engineering,
              problems often occur which  involve singularly perturbed boundary value
              problems.  The best  known example is fluid dynamical boundary layers. 
              Analytical  and numerical techniques must be combined to effectively attack 
              these important problems.  This work rests on a hybrid approach to  solving
              both ordinary and partial differential equations for  model problems motivated
              by application needs.
