Abstract    :
              Tailor Welded Blank (TWB) Forming is an important manufacturing process to
              perform precision automotive assembly.  Currently, the wide usage of TWB is
              hampered by many difficulties on the control of the forming process.   This
              research project investigates a methodology to effectively control the welding
              movement during the forming process and improve the formability.  The
              investigator will develop both undergraduate and graduate curricula and
              integrate them with the research activities.  In addition, this CAREER plan
              will explore the teaching techniques and encourage women and minority students
              to participate in engineering and research.   This is a NSF CAREER award to
              support multidisciplinary research and education activities for faculty in
              their early academic career years.
