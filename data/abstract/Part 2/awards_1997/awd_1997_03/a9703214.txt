Abstract    :
              The objective of this program is to increase use of low cost CMOS technologies 
              in super-GHz frequency applications to make benefits of communication
              techniques  available to a larger cross section of the population.  Successful
              implementation  of RF switches along with progress made by others could make a
              fully CMOS-based  single chip radio a reality, which could significantly lower
              costs of wireless  telephones, local area networks, global positioning systems
              and others.  This  program should also provide insights to ease the transition
              of mainstream digital  integrated circuit technologies to the super-GHz
              frequency range.  The research  program will implement RF switches, a key RF
              building block of radios, using low  cost bulk CMOS technologies.  More
              specifically, this program will, (1)  characterize bulk CMOS processes and
              develop models for required components, (2)  evaluate and understand model
              parameters which limit performance, (3) identify  physical causes for the
              limitations, and (4) discover approaches to overcome  these limitations to
              implement high and moderate-power RF switches operating at  900 MHz and
              possible at 2.4 GHz with performance acceptable for typical ISM band 
              applications.
