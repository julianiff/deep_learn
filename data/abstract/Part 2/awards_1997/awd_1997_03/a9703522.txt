Abstract    :
                  9703522  Buckle  This project convenes a US-Japan Workshop on Seismic
              Retrofit of  ridges and Tsukuba, Japan in December 1996.  This Workshop will 
              involve researchers and designers from both countries to discuss  progress in
              the development and application of earthquake  protective systems to bridges
              and seismic retrofit of bridges.   topics to be covered include: (1) innovative
              protective systems;  (2) design methods for base isolated bridges; (3) design
              of  utilities carried by isolated bridges so as to accommodate  movement; and
              (4) full-scale verification of performance.    A comparison of US and Japanese
              isolation designs for the same  bridge will also made.  The program also
              includes site visits to  several base-isolated bridges as well as several major
              bridges  currently under construction in Japan.    The Workshop which is
              jointly supported by NSF and Federal  Highway Administration, will provide an
              added emphasis on active  and hybrid addition, the performance of seismically
              isolated  bridges and buildings affected by the Northridge and Hanshin-  Awaji
              earthquakes will be examined.    Opportunities for the development of
              cooperative projects  beneficial to both the U.S. and Japan will also be
              identified as  a result of these workshops.
