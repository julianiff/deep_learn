                                  The biogeochemical cycling of many trace elements in  ocean
              surface waters is strongly influenced by biological  process.  Despite this
              fact, relatively little is known  about what controls the fate of elements once
              they are  incorporated into biomass.  For example, metals can be  assimilated
              into the food web, or regenerated to the  dissolved phase or exported on
              sinking particles.  Given our  lack of understanding in this area, it is
              difficult at  present to predict the fate and relative importance of  different
              pathways in metal cycling throughout the wide  range of oceanic settings.      
                The principal investigators propose here to advance our  understanding of
              trace metal cycling by quantifying for the  first time the effects of
              subcellular partitioning and metal  stoichiometires on metal biogeochemistry in
              natural systems.  There are two main approaches, consisting of laboratory and 
              field work.  The lab studies use controlled measurements and  labeled metal
              radionuclides to examine carbon:metal ratios  and the partitioning and the fate
              of metals incorporated  into biomass.  A novel dual labeling technique allows
              the  principle investigators to separate between intercellular  and cell
              surface pools of metals.  In the field, natural  assemblages of phytoplankton
              will be examined for the  cellular partitioning of the various metals, and ship
              board  incubation experiments will be conducted to examine the  rates of metal
              turnover.  The results of this study will  significantly increase our
              understanding of the role of  biological processes in chemical cycling and
              transport in  the oceans.
