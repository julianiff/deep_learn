Abstract    :
              9703908  Allen  There is an emerging paradigm of ecosystem thermodynamics that
              recasts several of Odum's principles for ecosystem maturity as an increasing
              capacity for heat dissipation. More mature ecosystems have more elaborate
              structure and pathways, which dissipate the gradient from the warm planet
              surface to cold outer space. Data from whole biomes to small experimental plots
              suggest that more mature and structurally elaborate systems have a cooler upper
              surface. The theory of non-equilibrium systems suggests that the emergence of
              complex, dissipative systems is sudden and represents the emergence of higher
              hierarchical levels. Each higher level appears as the system avails itself of
              some new means of resisting being pushed up the temperature gradient. This
              Small Grant for Exploratory Research will experiment with Arabidopsis to
              investigate these phenomena under controlled conditions.   The first phase will
              achieve replicable measurements of vegetation temperature that distinguish
              different vegetation treatments, such as plants grown in different air movement
              regimes. Arabidopsis allows such control as keeping all else equal but a single
              gene for stature in tests of increasing structural complexity of contrived
              Arabidopsis "vegetation." The goal is a protocol for distinguishing the
              temperate of contrived vegetation. Then the second phase will look for the
              emergence of the steps in cooling capacity earlier in the development of
              vegetation. Being able to predict in the ability to dissipate the temperature
              gradient will tell mechanists disjunctions were to look to explain emergent
              cooling phenomena. Such explanations will allow others to move up scale from
              physiological mechanism to phenomena of landscapes, ecosystems, and regions. It
              should also validate phenomena of emergent cooling that have been explained
              only post hoc heretofore.
