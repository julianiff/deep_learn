Abstract    :
              This project will investigate techniques for the display of importance-varying
              data in both two-and three-dimensional data domains.  The approach to this
              problem will emphasize consideration of a) the perceptual characteristics of
              human viewers, b) dynamically manipulable display environments to increase the
              number of variables that can be clearly displayed, and c) experimental
              validation of the techniques developed.  Portions of the project will be
              conducted in collaboration with the researchers in application fields such as
              meteorological monitoring, medical imaging, and public health decision-making. 
              Specific project objectives include construction of a survey of existing
              importance visualization techniques, development of new techniques to represent
              importance-varying data, comparison and validation of techniques identified or
              developed, construction of a dynamic environment for the exploration of
              importance-varying data and the development and dissemination of perceptual
              principles for effective multivariate display.
