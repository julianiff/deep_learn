Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    The principal investigator (PI) observed that holes smaller than the
              diameter of a laser beam could be created during high-intensity laser ablation
              of copper and aluminum.  The PI postulated that the holes were caused by
              self-focusing of the laser beam when it interacted with the induced plasma. 
              This proposal seeks to study the self-focusing phenomenon through a combined
              experimental and analytical effort.  The temporal and spatial profiles of laser
              beams interacting with a plasma will be measured using different laser pulse
              rates.  The experimental results will be used with analyses to give estimates
              of heat flux and investigate the fundamental mechanisms of self-focusing of
              laser beams.  The PI's educational plan includes using laser demonstrations to
              stimulate interests among primary and high-school students to learn science and
              engineering.
