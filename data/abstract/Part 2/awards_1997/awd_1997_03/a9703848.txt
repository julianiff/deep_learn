Abstract    :
              9703848  Smith       University of Alaska will operate the R/V ALPHA HELIX 
              during 1997 as a general oceanographic research vessel in  support of
              NSF-funded projects.  The R/V ALPHA HELIX is a  133' general research vessel
              owned by the National Science  Foundation and constructed in 1966.  The ship is
              schedules  for 112 operating days in 1997, of which 65 days are in  support of
              NSF-sponsored projects.  The cruises include  significant research cruise legs
              to the Aleutian, Bering,  and Chukchi Sea regions during minimum ice conditions
              in  late summer.       This vessel is part of a fleet used by NSF and other 
              research agencies to support oceanographic research.  Most  oceanographic
              research requires specialized equipment that  must be permanently installed on
              the research vessel.  Trained crew members are also required to support the 
              equipment systems and research operations.  This is the  first year of a
              planned two year cooperative award.  ***
