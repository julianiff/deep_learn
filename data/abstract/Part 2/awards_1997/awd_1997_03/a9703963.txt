Abstract    :
              ***  9703963  Halpern      This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase
              II project will enhance the capabilities of the "electron jet", or "e-jet,"
              thin film deposition source.  E-jet is a versatile source for the Jet Vapor
              Deposition (JVD) process.  JVD uses supersonic "jets in low vacuum" to deposit
              metals, semiconductors, oxides, nitrides, in alloy, multicomponent, multilayer,
              and doped structures.  JVD is a low cost, environmentally clean process with
              economic promise in semiconductor integrated circuits (IC), metal strip
              coating, protective layers, and optics.  The e-jet can vaporize any metal and
              deposit films at high rate, and its high plasma ion density enables low energy,
              high flux ion bombardment.  Deposition rate and ion bombardment are critical to
              various applications.  This project will optimize e-jet metal throughput and
              ion density in order to maximize deposition rate, extend source life, and
              control film properties.  Phase II will conduct mass spectrometer studies of
              metal atom clustering (a rate limiter), investigate hydrogen atom chemical
              energy deposition, develop a high rate powder feed e-jet, and investigate e-jet
              deposition of silicon nitride for gate dielectrics and copper for trench fill. 
                Commercial applications are expected in metal strip coating of electrical
              interconnects, silicon nitride deposition for semiconductor IC circuit gate
              dielectrics, and protective thermal barrier coatings, such as in turbine
              blades.
