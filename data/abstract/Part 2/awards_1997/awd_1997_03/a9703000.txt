Abstract    :
              9703000  Armero  The  project addresses the theoretical and numerical aspects 
              involved  in  the localized failure of inelastic  structural  members. Response
              of inelastic solids results in deformation  patterns characterized by a strong
              concentration of strains,  leading  to  highly  localized damage and fracture. 
              Typical  examples  are shear bands in metals and soils, and localized  plastic
              collapse of structural members. These phenomenon are  characterized by their
              strong nonlinearity and by their non-  smooth  character. The mathematical
              basis  as  well  as  the  finite  element formulations that predict the 
              formation  of  non-smooth  solutions  in  inelastic  directed   models   of 
              structural mechanics are developed. An educational  plan  is  instituted   at 
              the  University  of  California,   Berkeley  emphasizing  the  theoretical
              soundness  characteristics  of  mechanics  and their relation to techniques in
              computational  mechanics.  ***
