Abstract    :
              Proposal Number: ECS-9703988    Principal Investigator:  Li Yan    Title:  Mode
              locking with a hybrid neodymium laser    In this research,  a new approach to
              easily and reliably generate ultrashort ( < 100 fs) coherent laser pulses will
              be investigated.  The approach involves a novel concept of mode locking with a
              hybrid laser, which contain both a broadband inhomogeneously broadened medium
              and a narrow band homogeneously broadened medium in a single cavity.  As a
              demonstration as well as being practically useful system, a broadband
              Nd:phosphate glass and a narrow band Nd:YLF will be combined to form a hybrid
              neodymium laser.  Combined theoretical and experimental investigations of this
              system will be pursued.  The basic physics of the hybrid laser, particularly
              the roles of the two gain media in the dynamic mode-locking process, will be
              investigated.  The materials science applications for ultrashort pulse lasers
              are growing vigorously.
