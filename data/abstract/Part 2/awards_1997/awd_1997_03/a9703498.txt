Abstract    :
              9703498  Hachen    While there has been research on both social networks and job
              mobility in labor markets, there is little research on how these two important
              social phenomena are related.  This Dissertation Research Improvement project
              addresses this gap through systematically examining the effects of social
              network structure on labor market mobility.  The investigator argues that
              structural holes, defined as non-redundant contacts within networks, can
              increase the: (1) total amount of information an employee has about "a better
              job," (2) information an employer has on potential employees, and (3)
              usefulness of the information an employee obtains.  A series of models and
              testable hypotheses are formulated based on these assumptions.  Data will be
              gathered from the population of television station managers in the United
              States.   Specifically, 600 television station managers will be asked to
              complete a mail survey which requests information on the respondent's social
              network, job history and sources of job information obtained when looking for a
              job.  Include in this survey will be mangers who changed as well as those who
              did not change jobs during 1996.  ****
