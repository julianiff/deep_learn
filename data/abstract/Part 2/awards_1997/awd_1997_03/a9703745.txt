Abstract    :
              ECS-9703745  Sandberg    The general problem of understanding nonlinear mappings
              from one function space into another is fundamental to a wide range of
              engineering system studies.  The proposed work aims to build a comprehensive
              understanding of the approximation capabilities, usability and effectiveness of
              nonlinear networks intended for use in settings involving compensation,
              adaptivity, identification and signal processing.  It is founded on recent
              results obtained by the proposer showing that very large classes of continuous
              functionals, shift-invariant maps, and shift-varying maps can be uniformly
              approximated by certain conceptually simple nonlinear structures.  The project
              will address key issues concerning the advantages, limitations, design and use
              of such structures.  These include the determination of suitable network
              structures, network size, connectivity patterns and form of nonlinearity  for
              different problem classes, effectiveness of alternate identification algorithms
              and their convergence rates, and techniques for constructive/destructive
              network growth.  The proposed work will emphasize the development of an
              analytical basis for design, and will raise the understanding of the
              capabilities and usability of these nonlinear structures to a level comparable
              to that achieved at present for (static) multilayered feedforward networks. 
              Important examples of systems to which our results will apply can be drawn from
              many fields.
