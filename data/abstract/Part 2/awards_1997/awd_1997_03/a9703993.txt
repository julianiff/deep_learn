Abstract    :
              9703993  Galligan    In situ measurements of dislocation velocities and the 
              associated mobile dislocation density are performed.  These  measurements,
              carried out while a metal crystal is deforming  in an ordinary tensile test,
              are based on the intrinsic  interactions of electrons with moving dislocations.
               The  interaction can be varied by deforming a crystal in the  presence of a
              rotating magnetic field, resulting in a change  in the deformation stress.  The
              change in stress occurs at  an angle determined by the spatial orientation of
              the  magnetic field vector relative to the moving dislocations.  Measurement of
              the angle establishes the dislocation  velocity of the mobile dislocations
              during an ordinary  tensile test.  Selective alignment and rotation of the 
              magnetic field relative to the active slip system of the  deforming crystal
              allows the determination of edge and screw  dislocation velocities.  These
              dislocation velocity  measurements are carried out as a function of stress and 
              temperature, establishing how the instantaneous dislocation  velocity varies
              with these parameters.   Dislocation  velocities and mobile dislocation
              densities are also  measured as a function of changes in the strain rate.  %%% 
              These experiments provide measurements of instantaneous  dislocation velocities
              and mobile dislocation densities in  iron crystals while they are deforming. 
              This information is  presently unknown for the plastic deformation of materials
               and provides the first such measurement in iron crystals.  ***
