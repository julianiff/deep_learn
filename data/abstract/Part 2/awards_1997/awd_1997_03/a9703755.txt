Abstract    :
              This project deals with the compression of information for efficient
              transmission  and storage.  The information can be of the most general kind,
              but the approach  here takes into account the redundancy in the data which
              expresses itself as a  spectral distribution .  This is done with the help of a
              compression scheme  called subband coding.  In this scheme, the spectral
              characteristics as well as  the characteristics of the signal, which pertain to
              the human perceptive systems  such as the hearing or visual system, can be
              exploited.  We are addressing  several fundamental issues in the design and
              implementation of subband codes.    The optimization of orthonormal as well as
              biorthogonal subband coders is being  considered in this project.  We are also
              addressing the cases of nonuniform  subband coders, which are most appropriate
              for the case of audio and image  coding; and the theory of sampling and
              reconstruction of non bandlimited signals,  showing how such a theory can be
              exploited in quantization and compression of  data.  This aspect of the
              research generalizes the family of oversampled analog-  to-digital converters
              to the case of non bandlimited signals.  Another topic  under investigation is
              a special class of subband coders called cyclic coders,  which are potentially
              capable of greater coding efficiency.  This class is  especially useful for the
              compression of short blocks of independent data.
