Abstract    :
                  9703020  Abdullah  The dynamic responses of structures can produce
              situations that  can range from uncomfortable to unsafe for the building 
              occupants.  In recent years, control theories and technologies  have been used
              to reduce the dynamic responses of tall civil  structures.  Most optimal
              control algorithms involve full state  feedback control.  This type of control
              requires good estimates  of the velocity and displacement throughout the
              structure.   However, there are several important advantages of output 
              feedback control: it requires less computational effort and has  the robustness
              of a passive system.  In the research conducted  under this CAREER award,
              control algorithms will be formulated  for the optimization of feedback gains
              and controller placement  for flexible continuous and discrete structures, such
              as tall  buildings.  Tall buildings are of particular interest because the 
              control devices must be placed at floor level.  The fundamental  basis for
              these algorithms is the calculation of the gradients of  the performance
              function with respect to the gain and placement  matrices.  For the optimal
              placement of controllers at discrete  locations in flexible continuous
              structures, a mixed-integer  method will be used to optimize the placement and
              gains  simultaneously.  The effectiveness of the algorithm will be 
              demonstrated for stochastic wind loads in the frequency domain  and for
              deterministic earthquake loads in the time domain.  The  educational component
              of this CAREER award will involve creating  Web-based modules for use in
              graduate and undergraduate courses  to demonstrate the concepts of structural
              dynamics and civil  engineering control devices.  ***
