Abstract    :
              Roundoff error and catastrophic cancellation in floating point computations can 
              quickly lead to inaccurate results.  The research objectives of this project
              are  to design, develop, and evaluate hardware support for avoiding such
              errors. The  project will concentrate on hardware and instruction set
              modifications to support  variable-precision arithmetic and interval
              arithmetic.  Work will include the  development of algorithms, design and
              simulation of hardware support, and  evaluation of cost, performance, and power
              consumption of the resulting hardware.  Promising designs will be fabricated. 
              Education in computer architecture and  processor design is being addressed by
              the development of courses, by  encouragement of undergraduate and graduate
              research, and by outreach to middle  school and high school students.
