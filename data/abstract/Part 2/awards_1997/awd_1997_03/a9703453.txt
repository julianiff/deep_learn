              Ilias Perakis    Title:  CAREER:  Coulomb-induced Dynamics in the Nonlinear
              Optical Spectra of Low-Dimensional Systems:  Beyond Mean Field Theory    The
              fundamental principles of how many-body Coulomb interactions influence
              sub-picosecond nonlinear optical dynamics in semiconductors and metals will be
              investigated using a theoretical/computational approach: the coupled cluster
              approach. The extension of formal field theoretic techniques to the ultrafast
              regime has never been done in a complete or systematic manner. Many-body charge
              interactions are of importance in describing charge generation and
              recombination on ultrafast time scales. Experiments also indicate that Coulomb
              interactions among optically excited carriers could provide the mechanism that
              would allow optical switching devices to operate in the THz regime. Strong
              experimental collaborations will also be pursued. Switching is presently one of
              the most serious limiting factors in optical/optoelectronic communications,
              computing and other applications.    The educational plan involves development
              of a new multidisciplinary computational science major at Vanderbilt, with the
              strong endorsement from the department chair and university. Multidisciplinary
              computational science is growing in importance and is currently
              underrepresented in most university curricula.  A new class for freshman based
              on problem formulating approaches is also being developed, as is a general
              science course, which has basic electronic and computational aspects of the
              Internet as its theme.
