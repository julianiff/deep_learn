Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   of
              the Chemistry Division, Scoles will apply double resonance infrared   molecular
              beam laser spectroscopy to the study of various chemical   problems.  Work will
              continue on Intramolecular Vibrational Relaxation   (IVR) applied to molecules
              at increasingly higher energies, and new work   will commence applying helium
              droplet isolation infrared spectroscopy to   examining loosely bound complexes
              and free radicals in order to   understand three-body forces and solute-solvent
              interactions.  Molecules   to be investigated include linear hydrogen-bonding
              species, complexes   containing oxygen atoms, and simple molecules like propyne
              which are   solvated by helium.  In these studies Scoles will be examining
              molecules which are highly   energized in terms of the internal motions of the
              atoms relative to one   another.  Such molecules are usually more reactive than
              they are in their   unenergized state.  This work will also shed light on the
              effect of   solvents on such fundamental atomic and molecular interactions as  
              chemical reactions.  Hence, this project will be able to shed some light   on
              many different types of chemical processes, from combustion to surface  
              oxidation and catalysis.
