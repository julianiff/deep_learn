Abstract    :
              9703751    Hagedorn      This project concentrates on several mathematical
              problems in quantum mechanics  that are of interest in chemistry and physics. 
              The main goal is to study  "surface hopping models" in an effort to develop
              useful improved  approximations for the computation of non-adiabatic phenomena
              in chemical  dynamics.  A second goal is to study the effect of oscillating
              electromagnetic  fields on molecules.  A third goal is to analyze the utility
              of high order  time-independent Born-Oppenheimer approximations and to improve
              those  approximations to obtain accurate results for molecular states with
              large  vibrational and rotational quantum numbers.  A final goal is to study
              the  impact parameter approximation for many body scattering and to examine the
               high energy behavior of "charge transfer" scattering amplitudes.      The
              principal goal of this interdisciplinary project is to derive new, more 
              accurate approximations that can be used in practical situations by chemists 
              and physicists.  The equations that describe the motions of molecules in 
              chemical reactions cannot be solved exactly, so chemists and physicists must 
              rely on approximate solutions.  Improved approximations could conceivably lead 
              to applications in areas as diverse as the synthesis of new chemical 
              compounds, the design of new catalysts, or the theoretical underpinnings of 
              rational drug design.
