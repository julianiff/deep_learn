Abstract    :
              This project involves the integration of ideas from computer science,
              mathematics, and statistics, in the   context of their application to knowledge
              discovery and data mining of very large data sets. The project   has two
              general research goals. The first involves the development of novel methods for
              exploration and   identification of structure in multivariate data, with
              particular emphasis on clustering and density   estimation. The second research
              goal is the development of novel methods for modeling sequential   structure in
              data, in particular the use of graphical models to facilitate the process of
              model construction   and estimation. The technical approach is based on the
              coupling of ideas from modern statistical modeling   with computational
              techniques. A key feature of this work is the use of large-scale scientific and
                engineering data sets as testbeds, including upper-atmosphere spatio-temporal
              data records, a large   medical data set consisting of heterogeneous data types
              for the study of Alzheimer's disease, planetary   image data sets and
              associated annotations and catalogs of geologic features, and multivariate
              engineering   sensor data from online system monitoring. The educational
              component of the project consists of the   development of new courses which
              emphasize a first-principles understanding of model-exploration in the  
              context of data analysis, as well as opportunities for students to participate
              in inter-disciplinary, large-  scale exploratory data mining projects. This
              project can have a significant impact on how large data sets   are explored and
              analyzed across a wide variety of scientific, medical, and business
              disciplines.
