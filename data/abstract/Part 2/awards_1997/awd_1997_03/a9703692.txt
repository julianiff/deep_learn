Abstract    :
              9703692  Wunderlich    The present research is designed to investigate the
              smallest  level of molecular aggregation, that of the nanophase (one  or more
              dimensions is the order of magnitude of 10-9  meter,  i.e., 10-100 times the
              atomic diameter).  In nanophase  polymers a single macromolecule participates
              in many phases,  resulting in unique properties which ultimately lead to new 
              materials and applications.  The molecular mechanisms  governing
              crystallization-melting, vitrification  devitrification, ordering-disordering,
              annealing and  deformation are to be studied with a combination of  techniques.
               The details of structure and dynamics, as  expressed by the unit cell, micro
              and nanophase sizes,  orientation, strain, defects, and relaxation phenomena
              are  to be studied by X-ray diffraction, neutron scattering,  electron and
              atomic force microscopy, and solid state NMR.  On the same samples overall
              properties are to be checked  with the newly developed temperature-modulated
              calorimetry  (TMC) and other thermal analyses.  %%%  The significance of the
              work lies in the enormous  multiplicity of the polymer molecules which are
              available  for the production of new materials.  By clarifying the  connection
              between structure properties, and processing,  advances in the development of
              modern polymers are expected.  ***
