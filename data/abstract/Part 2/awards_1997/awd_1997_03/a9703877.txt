Abstract    :
                    Abstract for DMS-97-03877  H. Alexander         Alexander will study five
              problem areas in several complex  variables: 1. Boundaries of Analytic
              Varieties and Linking. Given a  smooth manifold M in complex space, when is M
              the boundary of  a bounded analytic variety? Our aim is to formulate a global 
              geometric condition that M bounds in terms of linking numbers.  The main tool
              here is the Harvey and Lawson theory.  2. Analytic  disks and Gromov's method.
              The method of Gromov's well-known  1985 paper on Lagrangian manifolds and
              pseudo holomorphic  curves was adapted and applied in a paper of the proposer
              to  study analytic disks with boundary in totally real manifolds. This  study
              will be continued. 3.  Hulls of sets in the torus. Well-known  examples of
              Stolzenberg and Wermer give polynomial hulls  without analytic structure. The
              proposer is interested in the  problem of finding hulls, without analytic
              structure, of sets in the  unit torus.  4. Fabre's Theorem. 5. Integrals
              involving  analytic functions. Possible quantitative versions of Siu's recent 
              lemma on the inheritance of non-integrability by restriction will  be explored.
                       This project involves the study of problems in complex  analysis. The
              word "complex" here does not mean "complicated"  but rather makes reference to
              "complex numbers."  Complex  numbers are nowadays routinely studied in
              high-school and a  college course in "complex variables,"  because the material
              is so  useful, is part of the basic undergraduate curriculum for  engineers and
              scientists. The current project is directed toward  better understanding
              "multidimensional complex space." Recent  research in this area of mathematics
              continues to have  applications; for example, in the engineering field of
              control  theory.
