Abstract    :
              ***  This  award,  in  the Small Grants for Exploratory  Research  mode,  will 
              explore  the  balance  between  human  operator  supervision   and  computer 
              automation  in  a   human-robot  cooperation.  The research will do this by
              finding  ways  to  combine   human  high-level  visual  perception  and   task-
               understanding  capabilities with a robot's low-level  vision  and  positioning
              precision, to optimize the  performance  of  the human-machine team in vision
              and manipulation processes.  The  focus of this initial exploration is to
              determine  ways  to  combine  prior domain knowledge and models, and  overall 
              vision  and  scene  perception  capabilities  of  the  human  operator, with
              precision and high-speed machine operation in  execution  of  complex  robotic
              tasks.   This  investigation  offers  promise of identifying new approaches to 
              allocating  human and machine roles in cooperative endeavors, which will  be
              important in a wide range of emerging applications.***
