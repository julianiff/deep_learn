Abstract    :
              DMS 9703777    Foundations of Regression Graphics  Dennis Cook  University of
              Minnesota    ABSTRACT    This research centers on finding how  real-time,
              computationally intensive, graphical methods can be used to   investigate the
              statistical structure of regression problems.  It is   based on the premise
              that the full benefit of modern computer graphics   cannot be realized in
              regression analyses without sound theoretical   foundations.  Emphasis is
              placed on the expansion and application of   an emerging theory for regression
              graphics based on dimension-reduction   subspaces, and on the implications of
              this theory for the interpretation   of standard graphical constructions.
              Graphical foundations for   regressions with a censored survival time as the
              response are given   special attention.      The ability to visualize
              statistical data plays an important role   in analyzing complex relationships. 
              For example, a measure of   the marginal impact of mandatory testing in grade
              schools   requires understanding how different socioeconomic    settings
              influence performance. Recent advances in high performance   computing, one of
              the Federal Strategic Areas, allow for the opportunity   to develop new
              graphical techniques that go far beyond traditional   graphics in both
              applicability and power. This research centers on   finding how computer
              graphics can be used to investigate complex   statistical relationships.  It
              stems from the notion that, even in   complex systems, it is possible to
              construct easily understood graphical   displays that contain all or nearly all
              of the relevant information in   the data.  This ability to preserve
              information in easily understood   displays requires new theoretical
              foundations that are an   integral part of this study.
