Abstract    :
              9703879  Talagrand   This research centers on two main tools of abstract
              probability, concentration of   measure (a versatile tool to bound the
              fluctuations of complicated functions) and the   theory of majorizing measures
              (a versatile tool to find upper and lower bounds for the   expected values of
              complicated functions). The investigator will try to pursue the   development
              of the underlying theories, and will also try to find new applications, in  
              particular to the geometry of Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces. He will also
              try to use   abstract methods to achieve progress on the understanding of mean
              field models for spin   glasses, a subject where rigorous results are very hard
              to obtain. A separate project   consists in the study of the subsets of the
              discrete cube of large dimension, and of their   extremal properties.       
              Real life phenomenon are usually affected by random events outside our control.
                Random variables that depend on many independent influences are therefore a
              good model   for the outcome of complicated real procedures. Surprisingly
              general tools have recently   been developed to rigorously control the
              fluctuations of these random variables in a wide   variety of situations, and
              they demonstrate the power and the relevance of abstract   methods to concrete
              situations. The development of these methods and the research of   new
              applications will be continued. A particular effort will be made to use these
              methods   to obtain rigorous results for spin glass models. These are
              mathematical models for some   very intriguing states of condensed matter, that
              are of considerable interest in the physics   community.
