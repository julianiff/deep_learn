Abstract    :
              The 1997 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory will be held in Ulm
              Germany June 29 - July 4, 1997. Papers presented will address new results in
              the following areas:  applications of information theory, image and speech
              coding, coded modulation, communication systems, multi-user information theory,
              cryptography and security, neural networks, data compression, optical
              communications, data networks, pattern recognition, detection and estimation,
              Shannon theory, distributed information processing, signal processing,
              error-control coding, source coding, and stochastic processes.     This
              symposium is a premiere meeting in the field of Information theory.  Travel
              through this grant will provide travel support for U.S. Participants,
              particularly graduate students and new faculty whose papers have been selected
              for presentation at the symposium, but who lack the travel funds to the
              conference site.
