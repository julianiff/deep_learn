Abstract    :
              9703712  Bradley   Strong mixing conditions for random sequences and random
              fields have been   useful in modeling phenomena in the real world in which
              observations that are ``far apart''   in time or location have only slight
              influence on each other.  In this research, several   questions are studied in
              connection with strongly mixing random sequences, and   connections with random
              fields are discussed briefly.  Question 1 deals with a possible  
              ``trichotomy'' for the asymptotic behavior of the partial sums from a strictly
              stationary,   strongly mixing sequence of random variables taking their values
              in a Banach space.    Question 2 deals with the exact location of a part of the
              ``borderline'' of the central limit   theorem under the (Rosenblatt) strong
              mixing condition.  Question 3 deals with the   spectral density of random
              sequences under a certain strong mixing condition.  Question 4   deals with a
              possible connection (or lack of one) between two strong mixing conditions;  
              the relevance of this question to an old conjecture of I.A. Ibragimov is
              discussed.   In the real world, there are many phenomena which appear to be
              ``weakly   dependent,'' in the sense that observations that are ``close'' in
              time or location may have   considerable influence on each other, while
              observations that are ``far apart'' in time or   location have only slight
              influence on each other.  For example, the annual unemployment   rate for the
              year 1998 may have considerable influence on the unemployment rates for the  
              years 1999 and 2000, but will presumably have almost no influence on the
              employment   rate in, say, the year 2050. Similarly, the fluctuations in the
              wind currents at a given   location may be highly correlated with the (wind
              current) fluctuations ten miles away, but   perhaps have no discernible
              correlation with the fluctuations 3000 miles away.  For the   modeling of such
              phenomena, much attention has been devoted in probability theory to a   broad
              type of weak dependence known under the name ``stron g mixing conditions.'' An 
               understanding of ``structural'' properties of strong mixing conditions can
              help in assessing   their appropriateness for the modeling of a given real
              world phenomenon, and ``laws of   averages'' connected with such conditions can
              provide the foundation for the statistical   inference for the given
              phenomenon.  This research deals with several questions   concerning both
              ``structural'' properties and ``laws of averages'' in connection with various  
              strong mixing conditions.
