Abstract    :
              Ziegler, Susy  University of Wisconsin, Madison   The doctoral dissertation
              research will explore the natural history of old-growth and second-growth
              hemlock-northern hardwood forests in north central Adirondack Park, New York
              state.  Three objectives are pursued: 1. an identification of the species
              composition, size structure, age structure, and disturbance regime of
              old-growth and second-growth forests; 2. a comparison of the structural
              characteristics and disturbance regimes of old growth stands with those traits
              of second-growth forests representing different disturbance histories; and 3. a
              reflection of the degree to which the Adirondack wilderness appears `natural`
              rather than shaped by human activity.  The study will provide valuable
              information on a specific wilderness area and also will increase the resolution
              of data describing disturbance regimes in this forest type in the northeastern
              U.S.
