Abstract    :
              CDA-9703088  Lori Pollock    University of Delaware    Parallel and Distributed
              Computing:  System and Application Development Infrastructure    This award
              provides support for research infrastructure based on a cluster of
              high-performance, multiprocessor workstations connected via high-speed
              networks.  It will enable new research activities in parallel and distributed
              computing systems and applications, more realistic and robust experimental
              studies, and increase the synergy among the systems research and a number of
              different, but related, application research projects.  Key systems research
              areas which the infrastructure will enable are cooperative optimization
              strategies, interprocedural optimization for distributed address space
              architectures, architectural support for multithreading on a cluster, load
              balancing and task scheduling, dynamic techniques for providing quality of
              service guarantees, and network management.  Application areas include gesture
              recognition, multimodal applications, real-time multi-agent systems,
              video/image processing and parallel symbolic analysis.  The infrastructure
              consists of 20 multiprocessor workstations, connected by both Myrinet and ATM
              networks, and sufficient local storage and multimedia equipment to support the
              parallel and distributed applications.  The infrastructure will be configured
              to provide both a dedicated system for applications researchers and a crashable
              resource for experimental parallel and distributed systems research.
