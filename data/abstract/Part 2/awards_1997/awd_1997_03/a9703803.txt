Abstract    :
              9703803  Freund    This Americas Program award will fund a 2-year cooperative 
              research project between Dr. Robert Freund, MIT, and Dr.  Jorge Vera Andreo,
              Universidad de Chile.  They propose to  study condition numbers on various
              mathematical programming  problems, with the purpose of improving various
              algorithms.  The aim is to understand the relationship between algorithms 
              performance and the inherent "conditioning" of a given  optimization problem,
              and to take advantage of such  relationships to construct more efficient
              algorithms for  convex optimization.    Convex optimization problems, and
              algorithms for their  solution, are of fundamental importance in applied 
              mathematics, operations research, and theoretical computer  science.   Through
              this research, the investigators hope to  shed new light on the underlying
              mathematics and on the  computational complexity and efficiency of solving
              those  problems.    ***
