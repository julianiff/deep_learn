Abstract    :
              9703326  Bischof  Uterine fibroids are the most common organ disease in
              gynecology  and the most common reason for major surgery in women.  Current 
              treatments include hysterectomy (surgical removal of the uterus),  myomectomy
              (surgical removal of the fibroid), and most recently  myolysis (destruction of
              the fibroid in the body).  The proposed  work will investigate the potential of
              cryosurgery of the fibroid  or cryomyolysis as a conservative alternative for
              women who  suffer from fibroids but do not wish to undergo a surgical 
              operation to remove either the fibroid or their uterus.  The  hypotheses are:
              1. The effectiveness of cryomyolysis is due  primarily to vascular injury
              (damage to the vascular network  nourishing the fibroid) as opposed to direct
              cellular injury  (damage to the fibroid cells themselves), and 2. The extent of
               cellular destruction can be predicted based on the thermal  history imposed on
              the tissue during cryomyolysis.  By testing  these hypothesis in the specific
              aims of the proposal, we will be  able to answer the following questions:  How
              low a temperature  held for what length of time is necessary to destroy single 
              fibroid cells and tissues?  Is there a difference in the ability  of
              cryosurgery to destroy the cells and tissues when they are in  the body (in
              vivo) vs. when they are outside of the body (in  vitro)?  If a difference
              exists, can it be attributed to a  vascular in injury mechanism inside the body
              (in vivo)?  And  finally, how does the size of the ice ball that is formed
              during  the surgery correlate to the amount of tissue destroyed as a  result of
              the technique?  The answers to these questions are  critical to a thorough
              understanding of the mechanism of  cryosurgical destruction and, consequently,
              to the prudent and  effective application of this surgical technique in uterine
               fibroids.  ***
