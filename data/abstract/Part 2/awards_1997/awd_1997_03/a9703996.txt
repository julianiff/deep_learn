Abstract    :
              9703996  Teichner       This project deals with topological problems related to 
              4-dimensional manifolds.  The main question to be answered is for  which
              fundamental groups the higher dimensional techniques of surgery  and
              s-cobordism theorems work.  The existing techniques include  sophisticated
              constructions of Casson-handles that answer the question  in the affirmative
              for a large class of groups.  In addition, there is  a proposed nilpotent group
              theory method for locating obstructions for  free fundamental groups.  Both
              methods will also be applied to the  link homotopy classification of disjoint
              2-spheres in 4-space as well  as to questions concerning concordance classes of
              knots and links in  3-space.       One of the most exciting mathematical
              discoveries in the last  decade is the fact that Euclidean n-space behaves very
              differently  depending on whether the dimension n equals or doesn't equal 4
              (which  is the dimension we live in, allowing time as the fourth dimension). 
              More precisely, we have all learned calculus in one real variable, and  some of
              us went on to learn calculus in n variables, i.e., the theory  of smooth
              functions on Euclidean n-space.  But very few of us were  told that for n=4
              there are (uncountably!) many such theories, whereas  for all other dimensions
              there is a unique one, namely the one we were  taught.  In mathematical terms,
              I am talking about the "exotic"  structures on Euclidean 4-space, discovered by
              Donaldson, Freedman and  others around 1983.  This project deals with similar
              questions on more  complicated 4-dimensional manifolds (technically, those
              which have  nontrivial fundamental group).  One concrete difference from
              Euclidean  4-space is that in a general 4-manifold, not every vector-field 
              corresponds to a potential energy function.  ***
