Abstract    :
              CDA-9703090  Paul Franzon    North Carolina State University    CISE Research
              Infrastructure: Experimental High Performance Computing and Communications
              Systems    This award is for the North Carolina State University to establish
              two facilities for test and verification of complex digital systems.  The
              first, larger, facility, to establish as part of the Electronics Research
              Laboratory, will include wide bandwidth logic oscilloscopes, logic analyzers,
              and signal sources, as well as technician support.  This facility will support
              our ongoing research in Experimental Systems building including Multi-Chip
              Modules (MCM) based systems, complex ICs, VLIW and other processors, DSP
              processors and communications system building.  The second facility will become
              the ECE Graduate Design Center.  In this center, graduate students will build
              and test systems in tight synergy with the ongoing research projects.  These
              students will work on these projects as part of a year long graduate design
              courses.
