Abstract    :
              The goal of this research program is to fundamentally change the activity of
              tuning parallel and distributed applications, from a manual, user intensive
              process, to an automatic one.  The project will investigate four specific steps
              towards this goal.  First, it will seek ways to not only identify the place
              where a bottleneck occurs, but also the cause of the bottleneck.  Second, it
              will develop techniques to permit programmers to evaluate different tuning
              alternatives by predicting the impact specific tuning options will have on a
              program's execution time.  Third, it will expand parallel measurement tools
              beyond computation and communication to include parallel I/O systems.  Fourth,
              it will investigate ways to close the performance measurement and tuning loop
              to create self tuning applications that can automatically adapt to their
              computational environment.
