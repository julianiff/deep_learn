Abstract    :
              CDA-9703228  Prithviraj Banerjee  Northwestern University    A Distributed
              High-Performance Computing Infrastructure    This award is for the acquisition
              of 20 high-end UNIX workstations, 50 low-end UNIX workstations, three UNIX
              fileservers, an 8-processor distributed shared memory multiprocessor, and a
              64-ported ATM switching hub.  The machines would be networked together using
              high-speed  OC-3 ATM networks with bandwidths of 155 Mbps.    As the use of
              high-speed networking moves from the laboratory to the workplace, new
              opportunities arise for the design and implementation of a high-speed
              distributed computing environment.  The goals of this project are: (1) to
              explore the use of high-speed networking and computing to investigate file
              systems and data management issues for high-performance distributed computing,
              (2) to investigate the parallel programming support of networks of high-speed
              workstations and personal computers as an alternative to stand-alone parallel
              computers, (3) to study high-performance computer-aided design of electronic
              systems in a heterogeneous environment, and to develop a Web-based CAD
              computing center, that takes advantage of high-speed networking, (4) to explore
              new instructional techniques that take advantage of the high bandwidth and high
              speed.
