Abstract    :
                      1            9703669  Chang  This  project  will  focus on studies of
              the  mechanisms  of  buckytube  and  buckybundle  nucleation  and  growth  in  
              a  controlled  direct  current  arc  discharge  and  a  thermal  evaporating
              system.  Photo-induced-fluorescence measurements  and  mass  spectroscopy will
              be used to determine  the  time  evolution  and spatial distribution of the
              carbon precursors  responsible for buckytube and nanowire formation.   A  model
               will be developed to explain the observed physical phenomena  of buckytube
              formation.  %%%  Several  areas of application are being explored  for  these 
              materials.   The  emission of electrons due to  high  fields  applied to the
              buckytube tips are being studied for possible  application to flat panel
              displays.  The electron  transport  properties  of  copper  nanowires  are 
              being  studied   for  possible   application   as  interconnects   in  
              integrated  circuits.   This is a well integrated research and education 
              project  that  has  involved  graduate  students,  postdocs,  undergraduates,
              college teachers and high school teachers.  ***
