Abstract    :
              CDA-9703470  Huttenlocher, Daniel  Cornell University    A Next Generation
              Computing and Communication Substrate    This award is to support researchers
              at Cornell to develop technologies for a new computing and communications
              substrate that provides "access to anything, anytime, anywhere".  To achieve
              this goal Cornell researchers plan to: (1) do fundamental new research, (2)
              develop integrated systems to demonstrate the power of their results, and (3)
              test these systems.  In order to develop the proposed systems, it is critical
              to test them with real systems and real users.  These researchers plan to use
              their teaching activities as a ready source of users to test their systems, as
              well as using the systems to disseminate their research results and to provide
              experimental information services.  Cornell University is moving towards a
              campus-wide hybrid ATM and switched ethernet communications network, which will
              eventually enable them to test their systems with campus-wide network of 20,000
              users.  They also expect to release their systems for use by other academic
              institutions and businesses.
