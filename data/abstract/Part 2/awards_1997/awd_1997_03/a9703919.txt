Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
              new instrument for evaluation of geologic formations at the drill bit in oil
              and gas drilling operations.  Radioactive measurement while-drilling (MWD)
              instruments are currently in use for measuring formation porosity and density. 
              However, these have limited capabilities and use active radioactive elements. 
              This research will develop an electrical neutron/x-ray (N/X) instrument, which
              may replace existing radioactive tools.  The new instrument is novel in
              offering: (1) improved measurement capabilities; (2) lower life-cycle costs;
              and (3) greatly reduced safety and environmental risks.  Phase II will develop
              a laboratory prototype MWD N/X instrument integrated into a 6.75 inch diameter
              drill collar.  Phase II will conduct:  (1) preliminary instrument design; (2)
              component development; (3) N/X instrument final design, construction, and
              testing (including measurement of neutron and x-ray outputs, response to
              simulated formations, testing at high temperatures, and shock and vibration
              tests); and (4) experimental evaluation in calibration boreholes at facilities
              of Sperry-Sun Drilling Services in Houston, TX.  Potential commercial
              application of the instrument is expected in low-risk, low-cost MWD operations
              during oil and gas borehole drilling.
