Abstract    :
              The PIs will continue to experiment with Alfven waves and wave processes
              important to space plasma dynamics.  They have developed a capability for
              launching and detecting shear Alfven waves in uniform plasmas and plasmas with
              controlled non-uniformities, allowing study under conditions analogous to those
              involved in electron and ion acceleration processes in the auroral ionosphere. 
              The continuation will extend research in the role of Alfven waves in density
              striations and their contribution to plasma transport and ion heating. 
              Complementing this study, the PI will investigate radiation of Alfven waves
              from narrow, modulated field aligned current channels.  They will also
              investigate the properties of field-aligned resonances, and the behavior of
              Alfven wave cones in a magnetic beach.  Finally, they will extend observations
              to the non-linear regime by investigating the propagation of a large amplitude
              magnetic pulse, using a pulsed slab magnetic field to generate shock waves and
              study their formation and propagation.
