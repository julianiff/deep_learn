Abstract    :
              9703783  Stamps  This grant supports the work of a young theorist at a 
              predominantly undergraduate institution. The research projects in  this grant
              are a continuation of seminal work by this PI on  dynamical properties of
              magnetic moments in magnetic thin films  and epitaxially grown magnetic
              superlattices. Here the PI is  proposing work on a possible new way of
              determining the exchange  coupling between thin magnetic films by examining the
              properties  of domain wall resonance. Other projects consist of: (1) Role of 
              structural defects on the magnetic order and magnetic phase  transition in thin
              films and (2) study of dynamic nonlinear  effects in arrays of quantum dots. 
              %%%  This young PI, at a predominantly undergraduate institution, is  being
              supported to work on the theory of magnetism in thin films  and very small
              grains. Some of the research focuses on finite  frequency behavior. The PI
              suggests that one can gather  information about the magnetic interactions by
              studying the  motion of domain walls with respect to each other, in adjacent 
              thin films. He is planning to develop a theoretical formalism to  describe the
              high power absorption in arrays of very small  grains. Finally he is also
              planning to study the relationship  between structural defects and the magnetic
              order and magnetic  phase transitions in thin films.  ***
