Abstract    :
              This award has base support from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry   Program
              of the Division of Chemistry and equipment support from the   Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities.  Prof. M. Bonner Denton of the   University of
              Arizona will investigate the use of infrared (IR) and   ultraviolet
              (UV)approaches to qualitative and quantitative measurements   of analytes
              separated using high performance techniques on thin layer   plates. 
              State-of-the-art near-infrared imaging camera technology will be   used along
              with silicon charge-coupled devices for the UV region.    Compounds to be
              studied include a number of antibiotics which will   demonstrate the utility of
              the instrumentation in the area of   pharmaceuticals, an industry which is a
              potential major user of the   technology to be developed.  State-of-the-art
              imaging technology will be used to detect and measure   quantitatively the
              compounds separated chromatographically on thin-layer   plates.  Many samples
              can be done in parallel.  The technology to be   developed has the potential to
              impact very positively on analysis in the   pharmaceutical and clinical areas
              of the health industries and on other   manufacturers of chemicals.
