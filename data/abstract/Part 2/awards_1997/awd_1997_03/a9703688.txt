Abstract    :
              9703688  Mahowald      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty  four months of
              research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Natalie M. Mahowald to work with Dr. Knut 
              Henning Rodhe at Stockholm University in Sweden.    Dr. Mahowald will construct
              and apply a coupled model for  the sources, entrainment, atmospheric transport
              and  deposition of atmospheric dust, driven by a combination of  results from 
              atmospheric general circulation and ecosystem  models for the last glacial
              maximum.  The concentrations of  mineral dust in ice-cores exhibit large
              variations between  glacial and interglacial periods with higher concentration 
              occurring during glacial periods.  Atmospheric dust may play  an active role in
              the control of global climate change on  the glacial-interglacial time scale. 
              Such control can be  brought about by the scattering of solar radiation back to
               space, by altering nutrient balances in the ocean, and by  lowering the albedo
              of snow and ice surfaces.  ***
