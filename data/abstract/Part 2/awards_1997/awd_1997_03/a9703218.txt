Abstract    :
              CDA-9703218  Andrew Black  Oregon Graduate Institute    A Wide-Spectrum
              Infrastructure for Software Research    This award is for the construction and
              evolution of an integrated, realistic software and hardware infrastructure for
              software research.  The infrastructure consists of a high bandwidth network
              backbone, reliable disk storage service, and machines running appropriate
              software such as commercial database management systems,  communications
              software such as CORBA, and other production software used in experimental
              software research.  The research supported includes both systems software
              (e.g., database systems, distributed systems, software generation) and
              applications software (e.g., speech recognition, neural nets, human-computer
              communications, computational finance).  These projects enhance their practical
              impact by applying their methodology and results to realistic software
              platforms with the major components chosen from the market place, e.g., the NT
              operating system and several Unix flavors.  The wide-spectrum infrastructure
              reflects the heterogeneity in the practical world and it enables realistic
              experiments from the above areas, which would otherwise be considered
              curiosities.
