Abstract    :
              This grant supports a workshop on the applications of Voronoi  diagrams and
              splines.  Voronoi diagrams are one of the central  concepts in computational
              geometry, and have found applications  in a broad range of scientific
              applications.  This workshop  brings together leading researchers on Voronoi
              diagrams from  various areas of expertise.  NSF funds are being used primarily 
              to support participation by young researchers.
