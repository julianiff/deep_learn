Abstract    :
              The  defining  characteristic  of  ubiquitous  computing  is  the  attempt  to 
              break away from the traditional desktop  interaction  paradigm  and move
              computational power into the environment  that  surrounds the user.  This award
              focuses on automating the capture  of  individual  and  group experiences, in 
              order  to  facilitate  access  to  a  richly integrated record of events: the 
              automated  capture, integration and access problem for ubiquitous computing. 
              The   natural  candidates  for  this  capture  are  collaborative  activities 
              such as meetings, education, and design.  This  award  will   initiate  a 
              large-scale  ubiquitous  computing  effort---  Classroom  2000---to access and
              support the rich  interaction  of  classroom  experience,  and  will  grow  to 
              support  and  assist  students  through  their educational careers  and 
              beyond.   Open  issues  include  effects of granularity of capture,  support 
              for  revision  during access, and how interactions among collaborators  affects
                capture  and  integration.   Of  special  interest   is  determining  whether
               and  how  ubiquitous  computing  technology  supports  note-taking practices
              that contribute to near-term  and  long-term educational goals.
