Abstract    :
              9703108  Useful software evolves: It is corrected, enhanced, and adapted  to new
              platforms. The cost of such software is dominated by the  costs of testing and
              maintenance; the long-term quality of such  software is dependent on the
              effectiveness of testing and  maintenance. The overall goal of this project is
              to improve the  state of the art and the state of the practice in software 
              testing and maintenance. The research component of this work  addresses
              regression testing: the testing of modified software.  This effort has two
              primary objectives: (1) to develop efficient,  effective, and practical
              techniques for selectively retesting  modified software; (2) to analytically
              and empirically  investigate factors in software and test design that affect
              the  regression testability of software, and develop techniques for  measuring
              and improving regression testability. The educational  component of this work
              investigates a maintenance-and-testing-  first software engineering curriculum,
              in which students  experience the problems of maintaining and testing an
              existing  software system and specify and design enhancements to the  system.
              The objectives of this effort are: (1) to provide  practical experience with
              testing and maintenance, and (2) to  encourage future software engineers to
              proactively evaluate the  impact of their actions on testability and
              maintainability.  ***
