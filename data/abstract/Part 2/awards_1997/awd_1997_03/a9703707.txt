Abstract    :
              9703707  Parsons      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty  four months of
              research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Geoffrey B. Parsons to work with Dr. Victor
              L.  J. Tybulewicz at the National Institute for Medical Research  in London,
              England.    Dr. Parsons proposes to study an innovative way of assessing  the
              role of a suspected participant, Syk tyrosine kinase, in  mouse B cell
              differentiation and signal transduction.  The  host lab of Dr. Tybulewizc has
              created transgenic mice that  lack Syk.  Using these mice will allow the study
              of Syk's  role in BCR (the antigen receptor of B cells) signaling as  well as
              more long-term tests of B cell function, such as  examination of the role of
              Syk in somatic hypermutation and  B cell memory. The experiments they have
              jointly developed  will shed light on how Syk functions in the mature B cell.
