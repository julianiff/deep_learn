Abstract    :
              9703678  Stanton    The supported project lies in the area of several complex
              variables; in particular, it involves the study of real hypersurfaces in
              complex Euclidean space.  Specifically, the investigator plans to find a
              complete normal form for the defining equation of a rigid hypersurface in
              complex Euclidean space; find a necessary and sufficient condition for
              analyticity of infinitesimal Cauchy-Riemann automorphisms; study the evolution
              of a strictly convex hypersurface by the Levi flow; study the off-diagonal
              small time behavior of the heat kernel on a CR-manifold; understand the
              singularities of kernels arising in the study of the Neumann problem and the
              corresponding heat kernel.    Real hypersurfaces in complex Euclidean space
              generalize surfaces in space: they are higher dimensional analogs of surfaces
              sitting inside a space equipped with a complex structure. Complex structures -
              locally, arrays of complex numbers - were first introduced in the study of
              polynomial equations; they continue to find many uses in various parts of
              mathematics, often leading to conceptual as well as computational
              simplifications.
