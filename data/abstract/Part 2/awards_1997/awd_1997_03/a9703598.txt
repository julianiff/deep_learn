Abstract    :
              The  Virtual Retinal Display (VRD) is a new form of  display  device   developed
                at   the  Human  Interface   Technology  Laboratory  in Seattle, Washington.
              This device scans  light  directly into the eye to create images at the retina.
              It  is  anticipated  that  the VRD will become a ubiquitous  display  device 
              as  it will be miniaturized to wear on a  spectacles  frame. The VRD is bright,
              yet safe and uses lasers as highly  color  saturated  sources of light. The
              research  from  this  proposal  will  be  studies  on the  fundamentals  of 
              light  perception of scanned images. These studies will allow us to  optimize
              the scan characteristics for best color, resolution  and  contrast.  We  intend
               to understand  the  features  of  temporal  and spatial integration by the
              retinal  processing  elements  of  the  scanned light and  how  that 
              integration  affects  the  image  perception. We will  then  be  able  to 
              produce  images  with  excellent color  matching  and  image  sharpness.  By
              optimizing the VRD in this research  we  will  allow  its use where image
              quality is essential, such as  in  remote surgery, or surgical training.
              Further, bright,  high  quality  images with the VRD will make it excellent for
               use  in   augmented   vision  applications,  where   images   are 
              superimposed on the real world.
