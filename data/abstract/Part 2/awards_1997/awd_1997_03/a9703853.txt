Abstract    :
                  9703853   Arnold   We will test the role of natural selection in the
              production and survivorship of hybrid Louisiana irises.  Our analyses will
              include experimental crosses within and between the species Iris fulva and Iris
              brevicaulis to produce various hybrid and parental seeds.  These seeds will
              then be placed into both greenhouse and natural environments.  The germination,
              survivorship, growth to maturity and reproductive capacity of the hybrid and
              parental individuals will then be monitored and compared.  The hybrid plants
              will be assigned to specific categories using numerous molecular (i.e., DNA)
              markers.  These analyses will thus allow an estimate of the fitness of both
              parentaland hybrid plants.  These estimates can then be used to predict the
              long-term effects that natural hybridization between different iris species may
              have on the genetic diversity and evolution of this plant species complex.  
              Natural hybridization between individuals belonging to different genera,
              species or subspecies has been recognized as a fundamentally important process
              in the evolution of many plants.  Indeed, it has been estimated that over half
              of all flowering plant species (i.e., Angiosperms) have originated from ancient
              or more recent hybridization events.  Furthermore, it has recently begun to be
              appreciated that natural hybridization and subsequent exchange of genes between
              the hybridizing groups can be equally important for animals as well.  Our
              studies of the Louisiana irises will allow a detailed examination of this
              fascinating and important process.  In particular, these studies will help
              define the role of natural selection in determining the evolutionary
              consequences of natural hybridization.
