Abstract    :
              9703921  Kirsch    WGBH is requesting $100,000 for a two-day conference for 75
              outreach professionals from public television, museums and science-technology
              centers, and community-youth organizations.  The conference will be developed
              in  collaboration with the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
               The conference will provide professional development for outreach staff in key
              organizations that conduct local and national outreach project in informal and
              formal education.  Participants will have the opportunity to:    * learn how
              they can extend the impact of major outreach projects by establishing local
              coalitions that build on the strengths and resources of public television,
              science centers, youth-serving organizations, and other agencies focused on
              science education.    * find out how outreach is carried out by organizations
              outside their fields of expertise in order to identify new approaches and
              strategies that they can adapt for their own projects, and    * develop a plan
              of action for implementing an outreach initiative that takes advantage of the
              skills they have gained from the workshop and will benefit their communities.  
                Beth Kirsch, Director of Educational Outreach for WGBH, will be PI.  She will
              work closely with Judy Kass, Director of Outreach Programs at the AAAS, and
              Joan McIntosh, an independent consultant and trainer, to develop and manage the
              conference.
