Abstract    :
              9703869  Bradlow    This research project lies in the interface of geometry and
              mathematical physics. More specifically, the investigator is to undertake a
              systematic study of holomorphic vector bundles equipped with extra structures.
              Examples of such bundles include Higgs bundles, parabolic bundles, holomorphic
              pairs, and coherent systems. These bundles have applications in several other
              branches of mathematics and physics. For example, on a Kahler surface the
              Seiberg-Witten monopole equations are equivalent to the metric equations for
              holomorphic pairs on a line bundle.    Holomorphic bundles are objects defined
              over a curved space or a manifold; they have simple local structures allowing
              algebraic calculations, and when these local calculations are pieced together,
              they often reveal important geometric properties about the underlying manifold.
              In recent years holomorphic bundles have played an important role in various
              parts of mathematics as well as theoretical physics.
