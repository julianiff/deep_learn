Abstract    :
                This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported  in the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, aims to  understand the growth and
              nucleation of thin films prepared by  laser induced vaporization by back
              illumination.  Professor Spain  and her undergraduate students at Occidental
              College  will  prepare thin films of transition metal and transition metal 
              chalcogenides on silicon and ordered organic films anchored to a  substrate. 
              These systems should yield unique and potentially  useful microstructures at
              the interface between these inorganic  and organic phases.  Students in this
              CAREER research project  will also use atomic force microscopy to characterize
              these  systems.  Another aspect of the educational thrust of this  project will
              be the radical reorganization of a combined  inorganic-physical chemistry
              laboratory course that emphasizes  the uses of lasers in science.   The
              fabrication of reliable semiconductor materials of every  decreasing dimension
              requires improved understanding and control  of the synthesis of thin films on
              substrates.  This CAREER  research project focusses on the synthesis and
              characterization  of thin films grown on silica and organic substrates.  These 
              films will be grown using laser vaporization techniques and  characterized by
              atomic force microscopy.  Professor Spain's  undergraduate students will gain
              direct experience in each of the  aspects of this research as well as be
              exposed to new  instructional materials in lecture and laboratory formats that 
              emphasize the use of lasers.  High school students will also be  afforded
              opportunities to work in this new laser laboratory  facility.  Advising and
              mentoring of all of these students  regarding opportunities in science are
              important parts of the  educational thrusts of this CAREER proposal.
