Abstract    :
              9703693  Liao   This project is concerned with the dynamical theory of
              stochastic flows generated   by stochastic differential equations on manifolds.
              The PI plans to investigate the following   problems.  It has been shown in
              some examples that a stochastic flow may be decomposed   as an asymptotically
              deterministic flow followed by a random "rotation". The PI plans to   look into
              the possibility that some general type of stochastic flows possess this kind of
                decomposition. If this is understood, then a theory of random sources and
              sinks can be   developed for stochastic flows. It has been established for
              stochastic flows contained in   finite dimensional Lie transformation groups
              that the limiting stability of stochastic flows is   completely determined by
              the structure of the group. The PI plans to investigate to what   extent this
              holds for general infinite dimensional stochastic flows.   The dymanical theory
              studies the motion of a system, whether this is a mechanical,   a biological or
              an environmental system. An important question is whether the system is  
              stable or what kind of long time behavior the system exhibits. The stochastic
              flows provide   models for systems whose motions depend on some random
              elements. Although one may   not be able to predict with certainty the path of
              a random system, the study of stochastic   flows enables one to project the
              long time behavior or pattern of the system with   confidence. The proposal is
              concerned with some basic problems in the dynamical theory   of stochastic
              flows.
