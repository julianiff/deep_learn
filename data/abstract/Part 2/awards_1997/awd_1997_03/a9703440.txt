Abstract    :
              This research is on design methodologies for low power VLSI design.  Research 
              activities include the following. First, developing an understanding of
              low-power  I/O encodings and their application to practical problems. The
              approach is to  obtain new practical Limited-Weight codes, and extend low-power
              coding methods  to other data distributions (e.g. Gaussian data) and to other
              bus models (e.g.  with cross-coupled capacitance).  Second, extending a locally
              developed  prototyping tool to system-level power estimation, and developing a
              prototyping  test-bed for validating theoretical advances and as an education
              tool. Finally,  an exploration of implementing low-power codes in real
              applications is being  undertaken with industrial partners in order to improve
              the practical relevance  of theoretical results.
