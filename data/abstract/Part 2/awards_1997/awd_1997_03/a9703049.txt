Abstract    :
              A four year program of research and teaching activities will  be carried out.
              The research program consists of fundamental  measurements of the interaction
              of high energy photons with  nucleons and light nuclei with primary emphasis on
              a  measurement of the electromagnetic polarizabilities of the  neutron,
              quantities of fundamental interest in nuclear and  particle physics. Also a
              test of charge symmetry in photon  interactions with mass three nuclei is
              proposed. Both  measurements will be carried out at the Saskatoon  Accelerator
              Laboratory. Measurements of eta meson production  with polarized photons are
              proposed for the Thomas Jefferson  National Accelerator Facility. In addition
              to the training  of students in research, teaching aspects include the  upgrade
              and development of experiments for an undergraduate  laboratory and the
              introduction of a new course for non-  science majors.
