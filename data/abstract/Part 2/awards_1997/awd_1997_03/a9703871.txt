Abstract    :
              9703871  Sommese    This award supports a conference in algebraic geometry
              designed to promote interaction among the many people in the midwestern United
              States working on algebraic geometric questions. The conference is particularly
              aimed at the many graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and more senior
              active researchers in this area, who are isolated because of location and lack
              the resources to travel.  This conference will have major speakers representing
              algebraic, algorithmic, and geometric viewpoints of the broad field.   
              Algebraic geometry has a long and important history in mathematics,
              particularly because it interacts with so many other fields of mathematics,
              such as topology, analysis, algebra, and number theory.  It has flourished
              during the last half of the twentieth century, especially in this country.  At
              its simplest and most fundamental level, algebraic geometry studies sets
              defined by polynomial equations. Such sets arise in many problems in computer
              science and robotics, and there is increasing interaction between algebraic
              geometry and these fields.
