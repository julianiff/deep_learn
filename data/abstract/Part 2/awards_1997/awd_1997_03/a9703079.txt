Abstract    :
              This project  develops the experimental software, hardware, assembly techniques,
              demonstration examples, teaching materials and techniques to enable students
              and faculty in schools, colleges, and universities to build and learn from
              experimentation with their own parallel computer.  This is accomplished using
              off-the-shelf motherboards and other components of typical persona computer
              hardware.  The premise is that this can be done at very low cost and yet
              provide a relatively sophisticated parallel computer that will allow the user
              to see most if not all of the fundamental concepts involved in parallel
              computation.
