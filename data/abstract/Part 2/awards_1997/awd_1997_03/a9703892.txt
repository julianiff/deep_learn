Abstract    :
              9703892  Schorr    This grant for $78,150 to the Information Science Institute
              of the University of Southern California will fund a workshop on research and
              development opportunities in Federal Information services.  Three meetings will
              be held, resulting in a workshop report which should be of great value to
              individual federal agencies, both research and mission, and also to
              cross-agency planning and budgeting organizations such as the Office of
              Management and Budget and the President's Government Information Technology
              Service Board.
