Abstract    :
              9703938  Allen  This award provides funding to enhance technology transfer 
              operations between university laboratories and the private sector  in Vermont. 
              The Vermont Technology Council has established four   Centers of Excellence as
              part of the state Science and Technology  Plan and funding is provided to help
              bring three exemplary  research projects from three of these Centers to
              fruition and  commercialization.  The three projects are 1) utilization of 
              whey-based edible film technology, 2) development of a reagent  kit and
              instrumentation for rapid determination of platelet  activation thresholds (of
              use for various clinical cardiovascular  applications), and 3) development of a
              thin film blister testing   system for microelectronics manufacturing.  Salary
              support is  provided for a technology transfer assistant to Dr. Paul Huyffer, 
              Executive Director of the Vermont Technology Council and recently  appointed
              University of Vermont Special Assistant for Economic  Development.  Emphasis on
              facilitating technology transfer is  expected to strengthen partnerships
              between university  researchers and industry and contribute to economic growth
              and  development for Vermont.
