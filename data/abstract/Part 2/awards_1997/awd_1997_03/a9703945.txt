Abstract    :
              The project to be undertaken is a program of research in set theory,
              investigating the axiomatic set theory Zermelo-Fraenkel with Choice (ZFC).  The
              topics to be investigated include the combinatorics of singular cardinals,
              questions about Souslin and Aronszajn trees, Woodin's theory of genepic
              iterations and "canonical" models, and the theory and applications of Radin
              forcing.  An expository book with Woodin  about Radin forcing and its
              applications will be completed. The techniques to be used in the program are
              those of combinatorial set theory, forcing, inner model theory and descriptive
              set theory. The unifying theme of the problems under consideration is that they
              are all connected in some way or other with large cardinals.   The aim of this
              proposal is to investigate some mathematical problems about infinite sets,
              using tools from mathematical logic. The theory of infinite sets lies at the
              heart of modern mathematics, in the sense that all mathematical objects can be
              represented as sets and all mathematical proofs can be  represented as proofs
              in set theory. Mathematical logic is a discipline in which mathematical
              techniques are applied to prove results about "formal systems" such as
              axiomatic mathematical theories or (more recently) computer programming
              languages. Progress on the problems should lead to new mathematics and the
              development of new logical tools.
