Abstract    :
              The Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM)  proposes to run six
              regional workshops over three years to help  local faculty design and implement
              changes to their programs  consistent with the recommendations of the SIAM
              Report on  Mathematics in Industry (MII).  The emphasis of these workshops 
              will be on facilitating local action by working directly with  faculty and
              local industry, where applicable.  In addition,  emphasis will be placed on
              exploring means of providing relevant  applied, nonacademic mathematical
              experiences for students at  locations where there is no appropriate local
              industry.  One of  the conclusions that was reached early in the MII study is
              that  universities and colleges need more experience and incentive in 
              exploring interdisciplinary programs and identifying and working  with
              industry.  This project will provide an opportunity for  university and college
              departments to obtain some insight into  how to gain this experience.
