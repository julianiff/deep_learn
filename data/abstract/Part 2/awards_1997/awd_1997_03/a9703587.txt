Abstract    :
              9703587  Hayashida      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables
               U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty  four months of
              research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Frances M. Hayashida to work with Dr. Ursel
               Wagner at the Technical University of Munich in Germany.    Dr. Hayashida
              surveyed and excavated pottery workshops  discovered at Inka administrative
              sites on the North Coast  of Peru for her dissertation research.  For this
              research  project, she will work with Dr. Wagner to analyze the  composition of
              the pottery and clay.  Production in Inka  workshops can reflect both the
              traditions of potters, but  also mandates of the state government.  By
              investigating the  manufacturing process and to better distinguish what may 
              have been a part of a "state technology", pottery and clay  samples of both
              Inka and local style pottery from workshops  will be analyzed using thin
              section microsopy, neutron  activation analysis, x-ray diffraction, and
              Mossbauer  spectroscopy.        ***
