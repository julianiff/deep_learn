Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    OPP-9703127       CURRY, JUDITH     UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO          
                                        This research project is a key component of a large,
              coordinated, multi-investigator program, Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic
              (SHEBA) Ocean.  The research program will be conducted for 14 months from a
              ship frozen into the ice pack. These investigators will measure atmospheric
              conditions of the permanent ice cap of the Arctic Ocean from a scientifically
              instrumented C-130 aircraft during the Spring and Fall in conjunction with a
              NASA research program jointly conducted at the site. These researchers will
              determine the flux of incoming heat radiating onto the ice floe as a function
              of changing cloud conditions. Their results will help determine how atmospheric
              heating is coupled to adsorption of heat by the ice. These measurements are
              critical to understanding how heat is reflected or absorbed by the ice as it
              melts in the summer and thickens in the winter in response to seasonal
              variations in climate. The aircraft measurement program makes an essential
              contribution to the SHEBA team of researchers who will measure atmospheric
              variables with a large array of instruments on the ice floe and aircraft flying
              above as well as ice and ocean property measurements made on and below the ice
              floe. The combined set of measurements in SHEBA will allow refinement of
              climate models for the Arctic region. Those improved models will lead to better
              predictions of the climate and the permanence of the Arctic ice cap under a
              proposed global warming that could occur if atmospheric carbon dioxide levels
              are increased above present levels.
