Abstract    :
              9703527  DaSilva  The use of Saccharomyces cerevisiaae to produce proteins is 
              limited by the narrow choice of vectors available for gene  delivery. 
              Currently, plasmids can be employed to introduce  single genes at low copy
              number.  When multiple copies are  delivered by delta mediated delivery, the
              multiple sets are  inserted in tandem leading to instability.  There is no 
              method available currently that can be used for the  controlled addition of
              multiple genes or multiple, non-  tandem copies to S. cerevisiae.    This SGER
              proposal will test the feasibility of using yeast  transposes, mobile segments
              of DNA that replicate by a  retrovirus-like mechanism, to act as vectors for
              foreign  genes.  A cassette will be constructed that contains the  gene of
              interest (in this case the gene for beta-  galactosidase for ease of assay)
              plus a selection gene that  can be used to select transposed yeast cells and
              latter  deleted by a "popping out" mechanism so the cassette and  same marker
              can be used to insert another gene.  The URA3  gene flanked by two direct
              bacterial his G repeats will be  used as the on-off switch.  The transposed
              cells will be  selected on uracil-deficient plates and then the cells that 
              have been "popped-out" will be selected on 5-FOA which  allows only those cells
              without the URA3 gene to grow.  ***
