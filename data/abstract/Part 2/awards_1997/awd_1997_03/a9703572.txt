Abstract    :
              MESSENGERS is a distributed programming system based on the  principles of
              self-migrating threads, which carry their own  identity and behavior in the
              form of programs. This enables  them to navigate freely in the underlying
              computational  network, communicate with one another, and invoke native-  mode
              C functions.  Thus MESSENGERS is a general coordination  paradigm for
              distributed applications development. Its main  advantages are dynamic
              composability of applications,  enabling an interactive and incremental
              development of  arbitrarily extensible applications, and the ability to 
              exploit clusters of heterogeneous workstations.  This  project investigates the
              capabilities of this new technology  primarily in the context of
              individual-based simulation,  that is, simulation where the application is
              modeled as a  collection of autonomous individuals (e.g. particles in 
              physics), each having its own state and behavior. It focuses  on issues of
              performance and scalability by developing new  techniques for load balancing
              and dynamic resource  utilization that exploit the self-migration nature of 
              the subcomputations.
