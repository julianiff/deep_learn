Abstract    :
              9703003  Clayton    Dale Clayton of the University of Utah will carry out
              research designed to elucidate factors responsible for differences in the
              specificity of parasites to one or more kinds of hosts.  Specifically, Clayton
              will first reconstruct molecular genealogies of a group of New World doves and
              of two groups of ectoparasitic feather lice.  One of the louse groups is found
              on wings and is not specific as to host species. Whereas the other group is
              found on the abdomen and is host-specific.  The genealogical analysis will
              permit identification of instances where lice have switched from one host to
              another and provide clues to macroevolutionary events involved in host-parasite
              association.  Microevolutionary events will be assessed via a series of
              experiments in a "dove-dome" (Tracy Aviary in Salt Lake City, UT) where Clayton
              will be able to carry out controlled experiments to examine factors such as (i)
              lice dispersal capability, (ii) differential lice vulnerability to host
              defenses, and (iii) different intensities of interspecific competition. The
              project will be incorporated into courseware taught by the PI, and
              collaboration has been established with Tracy Aviary for research and
              education.  Interpretive signs will be displayed and a public computer display
              will be established to explain the research in progress.  Both graduate and
              undergraduate students will be involved extensively in the project.
