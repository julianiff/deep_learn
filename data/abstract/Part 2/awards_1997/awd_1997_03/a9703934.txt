Abstract    :
              9703934  Maxwell      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty  four months of
              research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a six-month
              postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. James L. Maxwell of Louisiana Tech
              University  to work with Dr. Mats Boman at Uppsala University in Sweden.   
              This project involves the study of laser-induced chemical  vapor deposition
              (LCVD) and, in particular, the use of LCVD  to manufacture three-dimensional
              micro electro mechanical  systems (MEMS).  Few traditional micromachining
              processes  are capable of producing highly-three-dimensional MEMS  devices. 
              Three-dimensional LCVD (3D-LCVD) is a mode of  pyrolytic vapor deposition where
              high-aspect ratio  microstructures can be generated. Using 3D-LCVD, the 
              researchers plan to fabricate a three-dimensional micro-  inductor, a
              superconducting micro-inductor, and coils which  will be used to test the
              feasibility of laser-deposited Ni-  Ti shapememory actuators in MEMS devices.
              Dr. Boman was the  first to produce complex shapes and useful devices via 3D- 
              LCVD and Dr. Maxwell was the first to demonstrate feedback  control of growth
              rates during 3D-LCVD which allows precise,  continual control of layered and
              freeform growth. The  University of Uppsala has the best equipped laboratory
              for  3D-LCVD in the world.  ***
