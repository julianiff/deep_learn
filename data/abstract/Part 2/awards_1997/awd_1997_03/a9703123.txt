Abstract    :
              Nelson/Abstract  9703123         The goals of this project are:  1) to discover
              the physical  causes of snow crystal shape by the measurement of key surface 
              parameters used in crystal growth models, and 2) to improve  instruction in
              physical meteorology by introducing experiments into  a required
              undergraduate/graduate lecture course.         A new method of controlled ice
              crystal growth that was  successfully developed to measure critical
              supersaturations for  vapor growth on both basal and prism faces of ice above
              -16 degrees  Celsius.  The improvements are need to extend the range of 
              conditions measured, but will also increase control over the  crystal
              environment.  This method can be used for related  fundamental and applied
              studies in cloud physics with little or no  modification.         Five to six
              research quality experiments will be added to our  existing physical
              meteorology course for seniors and first-year  graduate students.  Each student
              would perform approximately 3  experiments per semester.  Experiments would be
              2 hours long or  more and treated like a homework assignment.  The experiments
              will  be chosen to complement the lectures and faculty research projects  and
              therefore can be used for additional undergraduate research  with the
              appropriate professor when the equipment is available.   For example;  a
              simplified version of our ice crystal growth  apparatus could be used both for
              a laboratory exercise to  illustrate crystal growth and the different snow
              crystal shapes,  and for an undergraduate research project to measure the
              effect of  electric fields on the critical supersaturations for vapor growth 
              of ice.
