Abstract    :
              9703543  McCoy  This grant to a senior, distinguished  mathematical  physicist
              is to support research in statistical mechanics.  His contributions to exact
              solutions are widely known.  In a  two pronged attack, he is planning to study
              the  integrability conditions of a given problem   and also look  for insights
              into non-integrable problems.  In particular,  he is examining the  properties
              of time dependent  correlation functions of integrable spin   XXZ chains,  of 
              the energy spectra of conformal models in 2-d, i.e. the  features which are
              important in the study of fractional  statistics, theory of combinatorics and
              the mathematical  study of q-series and the Rogers-Ramanujan identities. In 
              non-integrable systems, the project includes a study of the  Ising model in a
              nonzero magnetic field and ZN symmetric  spin chains.  %%%  This grant to a
              senior, distinguished  mathematical  physicist is to support research in
              statistical mechanics.  More specifically, this PI is well known for his 
              contributions to several  exactly solvable problems.  He  will continue his
              search for exact solutions.  He will also  continue to look for some
              understanding of what makes a  problem exactly solvable (also called
              integrable).  Finally  he is planning to consider ways of applying the insights
               gained from exact solutions to cases where exact solutions  are either not
              known and perhaps are not possible.  ***
