Abstract    :
              9703281  Giannuzzi    The goal of this CAREER research grant is to determine the
               effects of impurity grain boundary segregation on grain  boundary diffusion. 
              Attention is given to the effects of  segregating atoms on heterodiffusion
              along low angle, high  angle, and special copper twist grain boundaries,
              comparing  heterodiffusion along unsegregated and segregated twist  boundaries.
               Grain boundary diffusion of a solute is  assessed in the presence of impurity
              segregants at the same  temperatures used for the segregation experiments. 
              Systematic evaluation of segregation composition, grain  boundary diffusion
              lengths, and grain boundary structure is  performed as a function of the
              annealing conditions.  Experimental and theoretical approaches are employed to 
              model enhancement or reduction of grain boundary diffusion  due to the
              segregating impurity atoms.  A primary goal of  the CAREER education component
              of the program is to develop  innovative teaching methods, while incorporating
              recent  research findings into the classroom in the Materials  Science and
              Engineering discipline.  Multimedia and computer  usage is planned for
              videotaped and live interactive  classroom demonstrations.  Computer software
              demonstrations  and digital image computer analyses are employed.  The  effort
              includes mentoring undergraduates and exposing them  to research projects,
              curriculum development, and community  outreach.  %%%  This research is
              significant because identification of the  mechanisms of impurity segregation
              effects on grain boundary  diffusion will assist in the processing of materials
              with  specific grain boundary properties.  Ultimately, grain  boundary
              engineering could be performed to either enhance or  minimize a particular
              solid-state reaction.  ***
