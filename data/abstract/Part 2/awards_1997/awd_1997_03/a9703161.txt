Abstract    :
                    We propose to develop a statistical framework for nonlinear signal 
              processing for communications by using a recent extension of maximum 
              likelihood estimation, the maximum partial likelihood (MPL) theory.  MPL 
              allows for dependent and missing observations and sequential processing of 
              data using only the information that is available at the time of  processing.
              The inclusion of the dependent data in the framework allows  development of
              techniques for joint detection and estimation in the  presence of sources and
              channels with memory, for example to combine  maximum likelihood sequence
              detection with adaptive equalization. The  proposed research includes
              development of a new class of real-time adaptive  signal processing algorithms
              based on MPL estimation by using both gradient  optimization and
              information-theoretic alternating projections, study of  their statistical and
              dynamic properties, incorporation of order/complexity  determination into the
              scheme, and implementations in equalization, joint  equalization and sequence
              estimation, and variable rate speech coding.    The educatimn goals of the PI
              are shaped by the commitment to equip the  students with the necessary
              theoretical and practical facilities to solve  real-world problems; to help
              them mature into resourceful and creative  engineers who could meet the
              challenges of a discipline rapidly growing in  complexity. Information on
              projects in this area and on maximum partial  likelihood research can be found
