Abstract    :
              This research project focuses on two  important areas in tolerating  resource
              dynamicism: architecture-  independent checkpointing (AIC) and  primitives for
              high availability.  Architecture-independent  checkpointing is the ability  to
              save the execution state of a  program in a machine independent  manner so that
              it may be restored on  a different processing platform.  This could be on a
              different  machine, or for a parallel program,  a different parallel processing
               environment.  The PI is attacking  AIC from different angles. These are 
              applicationspecific AIC in  ScaLAPACK, semi-transparent to  transparent AIC for
              C and Fortran  programs, AIC of Java applications,  and AIC of HighPerformance
              Fortran  applications.  The result will be a  collection of methods for and 
              implementations of AIC for a variety  of widely used computing tools.  The 
              second portion of this research  project is to design and implement  primitives
              for high availability in  three currently popular tools for  distributed
              computing: ScaLAPACK,  MPI, and Java.  Currently, each is  limited in its
              support.  Occurrences  such as failures, processor  revocation and subsequent 
              availability, network partitions,  and planned shutdowns are not  accommodated.
               The PI plans to  address these deficiencies. The  result will be more robust
              tools for  distributed computing, plus  methodologies that may be  incorporated
              into the design of  future tools.
