Abstract    :
              9703329  Okikiolu    The research supported in this award lies in the general
              area of geometric analysis. More specifically, the investigator is to study
              properties of the determinant of the Laplacian on closed compact Riemannian
              manifolds under all smooth perturbations in the metric which leave the total
              volume fixed. This may have implications for the Poincare conjecture. In
              addition, the investigator is to consider the wave operator on general
              negatively curved manifolds in connection with quantum chaos theory.    This
              award is made under the Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program which
              funds projects that contain highly meritorious research coupled with a strong
              educational component. For example, the investigator of this award intends to
              run summer workshops for students introducing them to various current problems
              in geometric analysis using numerical methods. Also, she is to help develop
              inner-city K-12 mathematics and science curricula by producing a series of
              videos depicting model lessons for the inner-city classroom. The lessons will
              involve design and construction activities which lead directly to the study of
              mathematics, and incorporate elements from minority social cultures.
