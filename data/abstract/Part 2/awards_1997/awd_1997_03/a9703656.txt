Abstract    :
              9703656  Shi    This project lies in the area of Riemannian and Kahler geometry.
              More specifically, the investigator is to use the Ricci flow to study various
              problems in Riemannian and Kahler geometry. For example, the investigator
              wishes to show that a complete noncompact Kahler manifold with positive
              holomorphic bisectional curvature is biholomorphic to complex Euclidean space,
              a well-known problem in the area.    Rimannian manifolds are higher dimensional
              generalizations of curved surfaces; Kahler manifolds are a complex analog of
              Riemannian manifolds. Physicists often attempt to describe the universe as a
              Riemannian or Kahler manifold possessing certain additional properties. The
              idea behind the Ricci flow is to vary the given metric - a metric defines the
              notion of distance on the underlying manifold - over time in a special way and
              to see how the resulting family of metrics interact with the topology or shape
              properties of the manifold.
