Abstract    :
              97034927  SHAAR           The  GYRE  is  a  182'  general  purpose  research 
              vessel  constructed in 1973.  The ship is owned and operated by Texas A&M 
              University.   The vessel is scheduled for 137 days  in  1997,  of  which 30
              days are in support of NSF-sponsored programs.  The Navy  and  MMS  will use
              the vessel for 38 days in support of  programs  for NRL and Minerals Management
              programs.  In addition the vessel  will  provide 43 days in support State
              programs and  5  days  for  private  research.   The  Gyre did not provide 
              support  for  NSF  programs in 1995 or 1996.        The  GYRE is part of a
              fleet of ships used by the  National  Science  Foundation in support of marine
              science research.   Most  oceanographic  projects require highly specialized 
              equipment  be  permanently  installed  on the vessel,  thus  the  necessity 
              for  specialized ships.  The GYRE will operate in the Gulf  of  Mexico  off the
              southwest coast of the U.S.  ***
