Abstract    :
              Conditional branches constitute a significant fraction of instructions executed 
              in a typical program.  In modern pipelined processor implementations, branches 
              cause wasted processor cycles, due to the unpredictability of the next 
              instruction.  This project is exploring an alternative to branch prediction and
               speculative execution, which is to decouple the branch computations from the 
              basic blocks they control.  Branches, and the instructions that compute branch 
              conditions, are peeled out of the main program and executed on a separate 
              processor.  Both compiler backend development and processor implementation are 
              affected by this alternative, and the project takes an experimental approach to
               both.
