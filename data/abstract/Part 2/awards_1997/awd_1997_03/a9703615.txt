Abstract    :
              9703615  Wexler     This project supports the construction of a field-deployable
              Rapid Single-Particle Mass Spectrometer (RSMS). This instrument will be capable
              of providing chemical as well as size information on individual particles in
              the size range of 40 to 200 nm. This will be achieved by size selecting
              particles with a specially designed nozzle inlet, evaporating the particles
              using excimer laser radiation and analyzing the fragments using mass
              spectrometry. Chemical constituents such as organic carbon, elemental carbon,
              sulfates, methane sulfonates, and sodium chloride will be distinguishable. The
              information will be semi-quantitative due to shot-to-shot variations in signal
              intensity obtained with particles of identical composition, and due to a bias
              of the technique to surface species.  However, chemometric data analysis
              techniques are capable of classifying the obtained spectra and extracting
              information on the aerosol composition and mixing state (external vs.
              internal).    Once the assembly of the field-deployable instrument is
              completed, it will be tested at a local site to demonstrate the technique at
              ambient air conditions. The sizing technique will be calibrated and validated.
