Abstract    :
              DMI-9703531  Eager   This research project is to apply kinetic models of
              infiltration of powder materials  to the more complicated systems and joint
              geometry of practical applications. The first objective is to experimentally
              determine the different combinations of the powder interlayers as well as the
              number and relative thickness of the interlayers.  Next, with the aid of three
              dimensional printing (3DP) techniques, the powder interlayers will be patterned
              to regulate the local bonding areas, and to further reduce the residual stress
              in the joint.   Computer modeling will be applied to calculate the level of
              residual stress in the interlayers, and provide indispensable information on
              selecting the powder interlayers and their geometries (patterning). Finally, a
              new bonding agent other than Ag-Cu-Ti will be developed.  Such an alloy will
              provide improved heat and corrosion resistance as compared to the Ag-based
              alloys.   Success of the research will create a better level of understanding
              of the physics and chemistry of advanced materials joining.  By integrating
              designs of structures with joint configurations, this research will provide
              useful tools for the applications of advanced engineering materials.
