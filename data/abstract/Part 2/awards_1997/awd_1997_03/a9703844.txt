Abstract    :
                  New coding applications are often limited by the huge decoding complexity
              required by the best possible maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding. Recently
              designed sub-optimal algorithms reduce the complexity exponent of ML decoding
              two times along with an arbitrarily small increase in decoding  error
              probability. The project addresses the problem of designing more advanced
              algorithms that can further reduce the complexity exponent of ML decoding five
              to seven times.     We are going to investigate the following topics.   
              General study of sub-optimal algorithms. The goals are: (a) to obtain the
              explicit trade-offs between complexity and performance of near-ML decoding, (b)
              to generalize near-ML decoding for practically important channels, (c) to
              combine new near-ML decoding techniques with conventional trellis decoding.   
              Design of new algorithms for near-ML decoding. The goals are: (a) to develop
              new presorting procedures which reduce the complexity exponent of ML decoding
              up to three times, (b) to design new random-search algorithms which reduce the
              latter exponent up to five times.     Design of cascaded NML decoding
              algorithms. The goals are: (a) to develop cascaded near-ML decoding for
              concatenated codes, and to reduce the complexity exponent of ML decoding up to
              seven times, (b) to apply cascaded design for bursty and fading channels.    
              Real-time software implementation of designed algorithms. The goal is to
              develop fast software algorithms for codes of lengths 50 to 100 used over the
              channels with a signal-to-noise ratio of about 1 dB.
