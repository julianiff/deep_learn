Abstract    :
              Abstract  Xia    Xia will study certain automorphisms on the full Toeplitz
              algebra which are induced by homomorphisms of the unit circle.  He will study
              the problem of simultaneously diagonalizing all the Lipschitz functions on a
              given metric space modulo norm ideals of compact operators, and the dynamical
              systems related to a class of Schrodinger operators.  Another line of research
              involves Hamiltonian operators in various physical models.  One example of this
              is the two-dimensional Coulmob interactions in  a homogeneous magnetic field
              which arise in the study of fractional quantum Hall effect.    The study of
              linear operators acting on Hilbert spaces can be viewed as an extension of
              linear algebra to an infinite dimensional setting. It has historical origins
              and applications in such fields as partial differential equations, fluid
              dynamics, and quantum mechanics. The   work of Xia is concerned with certain
              operators that arise from physical considerations and have significant
              application.
