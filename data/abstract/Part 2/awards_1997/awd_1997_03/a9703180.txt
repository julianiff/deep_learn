Abstract    :
              Characterizing realistic high-performance computer  applications with existing,
              advanced tools will be a first  thrust in this project.  An information
              repository will be  created on the Web, documenting properties of application 
              programs, computer architectures, and their interrelations.  A second project
              part will improve the integration of tools  and their user interaction.
              Compilers will be enhanced to  make available to the users the information
              gathered from  their source programs. Performance analysis tools will be 
              integrated with compilation tools and developed to the point  where they can
              interpret performance and present it to the  user at several abstraction
              levels. The new tools will be  made available on the Web, serving as a "Remote
              Parallel  Programming Lab". Third, advanced capabilities of  optimization and
              performance analysis tools will be  developed. Compilers will be enhanced to
              increase their  understanding of subscripted subscript patterns, found in  many
              irregular applications.  Performance analysis tools  will be enhanced to do
              "performance forecasting", that is,  predict the performance of future computer
              architectures  running future applications. New course material will be 
              developed based on the results of these projects.  This  material will be
              brought into the existing course framework  of parallel programming, advanced
              optimizers, and object-  oriented programming at Purdue/ECE.***
