Abstract    :
                      9703855  Kulkarni    This award provides support for a conference on
              algebraic combinatorics and its  applications. The conference is to be held at
              Oakland University in May 1998.   The organizers will focus thier activity on
              recent developments and surveys in   algebraic combinatorics. The organizers
              are making a special effort to stress  applications of algebraic combinatorics
              in commutative algebra, number theory,   algebraic geometry, theoretical
              computer science, coding theory, and   mathematical physics. The organizers
              will encourage participation of minorities,  women and graduate students. This
              conference will provide a timely opportunity  for national and international
              experts in algebraic combinatorics to participate  in the active exchange of
              new ideas and techniques, and for young researchers  to broaden their horizons
              into applications of algebraic combinatorics.       This conference is in the
              general area of Combinatorics. One of the goals of   Combinatorics is to find
              efficient methods of studying how discrete collections   of objects can be
              arranged. The behavior of discrete systems is extremely   important to modern
              communications. For example, the design of large networks,  such as those
              occurring in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in   computer
              science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of  
              combinatorial research.
