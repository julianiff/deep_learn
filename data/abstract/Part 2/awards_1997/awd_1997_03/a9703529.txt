              Maris    Experimental  research  will  be performed  to  study  nucleation 
              processes in liquid helium. The first project is an investigation  of  the
              nucleation of bubbles in helium liquid which is subjected  to  a  negative 
              pressure. We plan to study how  this  nucleation  process  is influenced by the
              presence of electrons and quantized  vortices. The goal of the second project
              is the detection of  the  nucleation of solid helium at pressures above the
              normal freezing  pressure of the liquid. The third experiment is to look  for 
              the  nucleation of bubbles at the interface between liquid helium  and  a solid
              wall. As part of this last experiment, we will attempt to  measure  the 
              equation  of  state of liquid  helium  at  negative  pressure.  %%%  The  way 
              in which bubbles form in liquids is important  in  many  technologically 
              important applications.  These  include  ink-jet  printers, ship propellers,
              and liquid pumps. Bubble formation can  occur  even  in clean liquids but is
              often greatly influenced  by  impurities or solid particles in the liquid.
              Studying bubbles  in  liquid  helium is worthwhile because the liquid can be
              made  much  purer  than  any other liquid, and hence it is easier to  perform 
              experiments which are unaffected by the influence of impurities.  *****
