Abstract    :
              Abstract   CTS-9703278       The universal drive for more consistent attainment
              of high product quality, more efficient use of energy, and tighter safety and
              environmental regulations, has imposed far stricter demands on the control
              system than can be met by linear control alone.  The abundance of nonlinear
              processes in the chemical/petrochemical and biochemical industries, the
              inadequacy of linear control and state estimation for nonlinear processes, the
              market pressure for operation of the processes at their maximum capacity where
              optimum lies, and the multi-rate/delayed nature of many key process
              measurements, are the motivations for the development of controller and state
              estimators that can effectively deal with these process characteristics.    The
              research component of this project concerns multi-rate nonlinear control and
              state estimation with real-time application to industrial and pilot-scale
              processes.  The specific research objectives are: (i) to solve directly the
              fundamental problems of constraint handling and integral windup in
              discrete-time input-output (IO) linearizing control, via a model predictive
              control formulation of IO linearization, and to derive conditions for
              closed-loop stability in the presence of active input constraints; (ii) to
              study the fundamental problem of nonlinear state estimation from multi-rate,
              delayed measurements with guaranteed asymptotically stable estimator error
              dynamics; (iii) to develop a general and practical method of multi-rate
              nonlinear control within the framework of IO linearization; and (iv) to
              implement in real-time, the developed methods of multi-rate control and state
              estimation on an industrial polymerization reactor and a pilot-scale
              biochemical reactor.  The real-time implementation on the polymerization
              reactor will be carried out in collaboration with the E. I. duPont deNemours
              Company.    The instructional activities will include laboratory development,
              supervising high-school and undergraduate students to participate in the resear
              ch, and outreach activities for recruitment and professional awareness at
              Drexel.  In addition, the PI plans to focus on two activities, formulation of
              sets of open-ended industrial process control problems (each to be assigned in
              undergraduate or graduate process control courses as projects), and the
              development of interactive, media-rich computer-aided instructional modules for
              the Process Control and Process Modeling courses.
