Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project produces potentially
              single phase alpha or beta or a mixture of polytypes of silicon carbide fiber
              that will withstand high temperature (> 1400 ÝC) use.   Silicon carbide fibers
              stand out as a primary candidate among commercially available ceramic fibers
              that can be used as reinforcements to toughen ceramics for use at high
              temperatures. There are underlying sound technical and economic reasons why the
              presently available fibers have not made headway commercially. These fibers
              degrade both chemically and mechanically during manufacture of the ceramic
              matrix composite. The cost of these fibers can range from $500 to $1,000 per
              kg. depending upon the quality of the fiber and the quantity ordered. This
              project addresses a new silicon carbide fiber manufacture that uses 1) low cost
              silicon and carbon containing raw materials, 2) simple furnacing technique, and
              3) complete avoidance of fiber spinning or drawing and sintering methodology or
              polymer chemical conversion technology and chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
              methods.  The process offers relatively low risk in scale up to demand driven
              silicon carbide fiber manufacture.
