Abstract    :
              This project is developing new InterSymbol Interference (ISI) and InterChannel 
              Interference (ICI) cancellation methods in communication systems by using 
              pre/post coding via nonmaximally decimated multirate filterbanks.  It will also
               provide up to date information in ancillary areas via several undergraduate
              and  graduate courses.  These include digital communication systems, error
              control  coding, information theory and data compression, wireless digital
              communications,  and multirate filterbanks and wavelets.  It is of utmost
              importance that students  are well trained in the rapidly growing multimedia
              communications area.    It has been shown that any finite tap ISI that may have
              spectral-nulls (or  frequency-selective fading) characteristics can be
              eliminated completely by using  nonmaximally decimated finite impulse response
              multirate filterbanks in pre/post  coding.  Moreover it has been shown that the
              precoding may be independent of the  ISI channels and therefore feedback may
              not be necessary.  In this research, not  only the ISI but also random channel
              noise in communication systems is being  considered as a whole.  In particular,
              the multirate filterbank pre/post coding  for eliminating ISI, and the
              traditional error protection coding for correcting  random errors, are being
              combined to achieve better performance that existing  techniques.  This
              pre/post coding technique will also be applied to mitigate ICI  in
              multiple-user communication systems, such as wireless mobile communication 
              systems.
