Abstract    :
              ECS-9703742  Khalil  It is proposed to conduct research on the design of output
              feedback control of a class of nonlinear systems.  The class of systems to be
              considered is the class of input-output linearizable systems, which arise in
              many applications such as robotic manipulators, aircraft control, and electric
              machines.  The design procedure starts with the design of a state feedback
              control followed by the design of a robust observer to recover performance
              achieved with state feedback.  The performance of such observers are usually
              hindered by difficulties due to measurement noise and excessively large
              transient response.  The principal investigator has shown that the undesirable
              transient behavior can be eliminated by designing the feedback control to be
              globally bounded.  This proposal aims at developing a comprehensive theory for
              the design of globally bounded output feedback controllers.  Problems to be
              investigated include nonlinear separation principle, adaptive control,
              multivariable systems, application to induction motors, and implementation
              issues.
