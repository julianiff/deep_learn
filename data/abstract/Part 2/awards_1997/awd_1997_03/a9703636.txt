Abstract    :
              9703636  Anne M. Kelly    This award will support undergraduate and graduate
              student volunteers to work  on the  network, SciNet'96, at the Supercomputing
              '96 conference.    Computer networking is still a relatively young field, and
              there are very few opportunities for the practical applications that enrich and
              inform the classroom experience.  This is especially true in EPSCoR state where
              the academic research enterprise, including its Internet infrastructure,
              deserves special attention and support.  A special effort has been made to
              recruit students for EPSCoR institutions to work on SciNet'96.    Showfloor
              networks such as SciNet'96 are complete networks that offer a full spectrum of
              learning experiences in every aspect of internet technology, albeit in a
              pressure cooker environment.  Student volunteers will be under the tutelage of
              experienced professionals who have also volunteered to work on SciNet'96.   
              The student volunteers will be involved in the full gamut of showfloor
              networking, for example:  * physical infrastructure  * logical infrastructure,
              and  * network operations including crisis management
