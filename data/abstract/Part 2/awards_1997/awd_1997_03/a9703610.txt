Abstract    :
              The National Research Council will examine means to strengthen linkages between
              mathematics and the natural, behavioral, and engineering sciences, thereby
              supporting the continuing productivity and quality of the research enterprise
              in a time of constrained resources.  Toward that end, a committee will be
              formed to examine mechanisms for enriching the dialogue between the fields,
              with the principal efforts of the committee being to suggest what are likely to
              be the most effective mechanisms for collaboration, and to implement them
              through the Internet, widely circulated reports, and other dissemination
              activities, such as campus workshops convened by committee members.  The
              committee will also examine implications for graduate education in the sciences
              and mathematics, and suggest changes in graduate training intended to reinforce
              efforts to strengthen the dialogue among the sciences.    Funding for this
              activity will be provided by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the MPS
              Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, and also by DARPA.    Committee
              activities will include several meetings, two workshops, and an examination at
              doctorate-granting institutions of the role of graduate education in fostering
              linkages of science and mathematics.  For further information, please contact:
