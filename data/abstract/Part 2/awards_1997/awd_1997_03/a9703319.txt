Abstract    :
              Abstract  Proposal: CMS 97-03319  PI:  Debbie A. Niemeier, U. California at
              Davis    "Career:  Optimizing the Selection of Added Capacity  Transportation
              Infrastructure Improvements "      The increasing complexity of transportation
              systems demands  that engineers provide theoretical guidance on the issue of 
              program-specific resource allocation.  Program-specific  models in use seek to
              optimize resources within an  engineering-based funding category without
              linkage to other  funding categories.  This research will address this 
              theoretical gap and will provide the necessary framework to  optimize future
              infrastructure investments in such a way  that the overall transportation
              system productivity,  including both longevity and performance, is enhanced.   
              Specific objectives of the workplan include to:  1) develop  a new theoretical
              optimization model to dynamically allocate  funds between transportation
              infrastructure programs; 2)  specify and evaluate an empirical model for
              validation; 3)  develop new performance measures that relate funding 
              allocation to performance; and 4) develop new guidelines to  better link
              infrastructure funding policies and system  performance optimization.
              Educational opportunities will be  enhanced by including opportunities for both
              graduate and  undergraduate researchers, and by directly utilizing the  results
              in undergraduate and graduate transportation  courses.    The new theoretical
              model will allow transportation agencies  to work within a framework that
              optimizes total  infrastructure performance.  The theoretical and empirical 
              models will be used to develop new policy guidelines for 1)  assessing the
              amount of funding required to maintain a  specified level of total system
              performance, 2) optimizing  resource allocations among spending programs, and
              3) to  assist in the development of appropriate data bases to  monitor
              long-term infrastructure performance.  These results  will play a crucial role
              in advancing the concept of  evaluating and maintaining tota l infrastructure
              system  productivity as opposed to concentrating on discrete  infrastructure
              performance.      ***
