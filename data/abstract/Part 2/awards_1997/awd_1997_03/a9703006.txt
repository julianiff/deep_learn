Abstract    :
               9703006  Cruz-Rivera  The objective of the  career development  plan is to
              facilitate the early development of the P.I. as both researcher and educator. 
              The proposed research activities seek to advance the development of an
              Applications-Driven Optical Interconnect Technology (ADROIT) modeling
              framework.  The ADROIT framework seeks to capture the performance interplay
              among all major components of a system's design space for a wide variety of
              wire-based and  optical interconnect technologies for multicomputer
              communication networks.  The proposed educational activities, in turn, seek to
              enable the establishment of a  Center for Educational Excellence in Math,
              Science, and Engineering (CEMCI) that  will focus on K-12 teacher training and
              enhancement.  In particular  CEMCI will  focus on the incorporation of
              technology tools into the K-12 math an science  curriculums of Puerto Rican
              schools  ***
