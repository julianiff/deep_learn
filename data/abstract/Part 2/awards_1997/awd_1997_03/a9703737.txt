Abstract    :
                The reaction of the Si(001) surface with unsaturated organic  molecules via a
              2+2 cycloaddition is studied in this research  project supported by the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.   Professor Hamers and his students
              at the University of Wisconsin  will study ordered organic films formed by this
              route using  scanning probe microscopy, Fourier transform infrared
              spectroscopy,  Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.  These
               organic films can be derivatized, and functional strategies  developed to form
              overlayers with specific electronic and optical  properties.  The chemical and
              structural properties of these films  are correlated with the possibility of
              interesting electrical and  optical properties.  The spatially dependent probes
              used to  characterize these overlayers allow the determination of the  spatial
              anisotropy which is expected to arise.  The adsorption of unsaturated organic
              molecules on the silicon  surface forms the focus of the research supported in
              this project.   The ability to develop a flexible synthetic chemistry for
              organic  films on silicon promises to allow the connection of silicon  process
              technology for electronic devices with the broad range of  properties possible
              with organic overlayers.  A range of spatially  dependent methods will be used
              to characterize the structure and  properties of these synthesized overlayers.
