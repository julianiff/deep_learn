Abstract    :
              Abstract - Barton - 9703623    This research will investigate a rigorous and
              practical approach to the optimization of nonlinear dynamic systems coupled
              with integer decisions variables, termed mixed integer dynamic optimization
              problems.  An iteration strategy will be developed and tested that has the
              potential to avoid total enumeration of the discrete decision space, and on
              termination yields information on the distance to the global solution.  The
              work is motivated by the need to achieve better solutions to two important
              problems in the chemical industries: the development of an optimal batch
              process for a new product, and the synthesis of cost effective operating
              procedures (for example, start-up and shut-down) subject to safety and
              operational constraints.    The approach will involve decomposition to a primal
              and a master problem.  The primal problem is one in which the binary decision
              variables are fixed to yield a classical variational problem.  This primal is
              highly nonconvex and will be difficult to solve to guaranteed global
              optimality.  To take care of that problem, the PI plans to use a master problem
              based on the solution to a screening model: a simplified model of the problem
              at hand, derived via an unrelated modeling effort, that provides a rigorous
              lower bound on the solution to the overall problem.  A decomposition iteration
              based on these two subproblems will be used to explore the discrete decision
              space, and on termination, yield information on the distance to the global
              solution.
