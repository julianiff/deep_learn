Abstract    :
              9703840  Porter  The aim of this proposal entitled Structure-Property 
              Relationships Based on Inorganic-Organic Host-Guest  Assemblies is to address
              the synthesis and fabrication,  characterization, and structure property
              relations in novel  nanomaterials obtained through inclusion chemistry. 
              Systems  to be studied will include layered silicates such as  hectorite and
              montmorillonite intercalated with aniline,  thiophene, and pyrrole guests in
              the intergallery region of  the smectic clays, followed by characterization by
              powder x-  ray diffraction, scanning force microscopy, differential  scanning
              calorimetry, electron spin resonance, and impedance  spectroscopy.  The inner
              arictecture of the hybrid materials  will be studied, and the synergism between
              architecture and  observed properties such as conductivity, magnetism, optical 
              response, and chemical sensing will be probed.  The role of  non-covalent
              host-guest and guest-guest interactions will be  delineated, and the knowledge
              used to synthesize and  optimize other novel materials.  %%%  The integration
              of organic and inorganic molecular units  into composite nanostructures
              provides many possibilities  with respect to both novel structures and property
              design.  The design and characterization of these types of  nanostructured
              materials is a young field of endeavor that  presents exciting possibilities
              for designing functional  materials for applications such as sensors, molecular
               sieves, separations media, and catalysts.  ***
