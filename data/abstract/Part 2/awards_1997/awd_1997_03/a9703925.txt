Abstract    :
              9703925  Niblett    This U.S.-Mexico award will support a planning visit which 
              will allow Dr. C. L. Niblett, University of Florida, to go  to Irapuato, Mexico
              to work with Dr. Alejandro Blanco-Labra,  Centro De Investigacion y De Estudios
              Avanzados Del IPN, to  prepare a collaborative research project on the
              development  of transgenic plants, which contain plant viral genes  effective
              in controlling virus diseases.        The citrus industries of both Mexico and
              the U.S. lose  rootstock to the brown citrus aphid, and development of 
              transgenic plants containing plant viral genes has worked on  controlling
              several virus diseases.  These researchers wish  to test this approach in an
              attempt to develop citrus  genotypes which can resist Tristeza disease, the
              most  destructive virus disease to citrus.  Both principal  investigators have
              expertise in this research, and by  joining their labs and experience, they can
              rapidly test  this novel approach to control plant viruses.    ***
