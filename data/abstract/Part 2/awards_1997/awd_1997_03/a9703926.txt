Abstract    :
              Rydelek  9703926    This award supports a collaborative research project between
               Dr. Paul Rydelek of the University of Memphis and Dr. Kazuo  Hamada of the
              National Research Institute for Earth Science  and Disaster Prevention (NIED)
              in Tsukuba, Japan on the  physics of the earthquake process.  Dr. Rydelek will
              spend  one year working on this project in Japan.  NIED offers  extensive data
              on earthquakes collected from a comprehensive  network of strong motion
              sensors, conventional short period  seismometers and newly developed broadband
              seismic sensors.  The principal investigator will use the Japanese seismic 
              data to test and refine a recently developed non-fractal  model of earthquakes.
                 Understanding the geophysical processes which result in  earthquakes is
              critical to our efforts to mitigate the  destruction and loss of life caused by
              these natural  disasters.  This project will combine the expertise and data  of
              U.S. and Japanese laboratories working on earthquake  research.  The project is
              supported under the Science  Fellowship Program between the National Science
              Foundation  and the Japan Foundation Center for Global Partnership.  ***
