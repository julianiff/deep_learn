Abstract    :
                                      ABSTRACT       The proposed research seeks to
              characterize liquid sprays impacting hot surfaces in cooling applications.  The
              emphasis is on the pre-impact process and sprays with droplets that are less
              than 150 mm in diameter.  Sprays with such fine droplets are more susceptible
              to the influence of the surrounding conditions.  The goal of the project is to
              determine the optimal conditions for achieving maximum stable high heat flux in
              spray cooling applications.  Experiments will be conducted to measure the
              droplet velocity, size, and temperature under different conditions.  Innovative
              techniques such as the Exciplex Fluorescence Technique will be used to measure
              the temperature of in-flight droplets.  Finite difference simulations will be
              carried out using a k-e model to describe gas phase turbulence.  The
              educational plan includes participation of undergraduate students in the
              project and integration of the knowledge gained from the research into existing
              courses.
