Abstract    :
                9703167  Morris   The project will be conducted as part of  the NSF CAREER
              Program.   The goal of this research is to study competing mechanisms and
              product distributions of carbonaceous aerosol particles and NO2 under simulated
              nighttime conditions for urban atmospheres.   The experimental studies will
              involve laser spectroscopy, pump-probe, and matrix isolation techniques to
              investigate the heterogeneous chemistry of airborne aerosols.  Theoretical
              studies using ab initio molecular orbital techniques will be conducted as a
              parallel effort to the experimental studies of aerosol carbonaceous particles. 
                For the educational plan, the investigator will develop and implement
              research opportunities for graduate, undergraduate, and high school students.
              The PI is particularly interested in teaching experimental laboratory
              techniques to students that will familiarize them with state-of-the-art
              instrumentation and modeling techniques for atmospheric chemical research.  The
              PI intends to promote science instruction in the Washington, D.C. metro area
              public schools, especially in the areas of atmospheric and space sciences.  The
              goal of this outreach program is to enhance and to reinforce science education
              at an early stage in order to increase the number of minority students engaged
              in science careers.
