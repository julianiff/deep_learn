Abstract    :
              9703898  Huang    This  project  on the Characterization of Perfluorinated 
              Liquid-  Crystal  Compounds and Two Dimensional Behavior of Liquid-Crystal 
              Free-standing   Films   will  focus  on  the   unique   molecular  arrangement
              in liquid-crystal free-standing films that makes such  films  an  ideal 
              physical  system in which  to  investigate  the  effects  attributed  to  the
              perfluorination  of  liquid  crystal  compounds.   The free standing liquid
              crystal films, as  thin  as  two  molecular layers, is one of the best systems
              to  investigate  two-dimensional  physical  phenomena  without  the  
              complicating  effects   of   a   substrate.   Furthermore,  designing   a   new
               calorimetric system that will improve by more than five-fold  the  resolution 
              of the heat capacity measurements while allowing  for  simultaneous  heat 
              capacity and ellipsometry  measurements  will  provide several critical tests
              of theoretically predicted thermal  properties.  %%%   The unique physical
              properties of perfluoronated liquid crystals  make   them  one  of  the  best 
              class  of  host  compounds   for  manufacturing  surface  stabilized 
              ferroelectric  liquid-crystal  cells    for   fast   electro-optical  
              switching   applications.  Determining  the  properties of new liquid  crystal 
              systems  are  playing  an increasingly important role in advancing a number  of
               applications  areas that include new materials for  infrared  and  microwave 
              liquid  crystal modulators, and fast-switching  liquid  crystal displays.  ***
