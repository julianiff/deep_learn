Abstract    :
              9703884  Zheng    This project lies in the area of complex differential
              geometry. The investigator earlier showed that the ration of the two Chern
              numbers of a nonpositively curved compact Kahler surface is always between two
              and three; he now wishes to generalize that work to higher dimensional
              settings. In addition, the investigator is to pursue the remaining
              classification in the famous Kodaira-Enriques classification for complex
              surfaces. Finally, the investigator would like to construct a certain class of
              nonpositively curved Kahler manifolds.    Kahler manifolds generalize curved
              surfaces, and are based on complex numbers. The Chern numbers of a Kahler
              manifold are certain integers that are topologically invariant, i.e., they are
              quantities that are unchanged under small deformation of the manifold. Kahler
              manifolds have found applications in other parts of mathematics as well as
              theoretical physics. For example, the famous Yau-Calabi spaces used in the
              string model of the universe are Kahler manifolds.
