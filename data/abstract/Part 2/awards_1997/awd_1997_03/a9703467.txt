               Electromagnetic theory and analysis for high frequency design  problems such
              as high speed analog and digital design, interconnect technology, cellular
              communications, multipath propagation and quasioptical systems will be
              investigated.  The research will focus on embedding the circuit physics of
              nonlinear circuit devices in the full electromagnetic field physics of
              Maxwell's equations as solved by the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD)
              method.  A significant problem with the traditional FDTD technique is numerical
              dispersion. In this research the conventional 2-2 FDTD modeling will be
              interfaced to a modified 2-4 algorithm which mitigates numerical dispersion in
              the grid. Problems that are currently computationally inaccessible because of
              numerical dispersion will be significantly impacted by this research.  This
              includes many circuit problems in wireless and optical applications.    A
              significant part of the educational plan involves a design  oriented freshmen
              projects course focused on the area of assistive technology.  The students will
              design and fabricate devices for use as aids to handicapped individuals within
              the local community/specialty educational system.  In addition to the design of
              novel and successful devices, the students also learn problem formulation and
              team participation skills. Additionally, emphasis is placed on careful analysis
              and re-working of designs which failed to meet criteria for successful use, as
              defined by the handicapped client.  This work is a significant contribution to
              the building of a strong interface between the University of Colorado
              Integrative Teaching Laboratory and the local community.
