Abstract    :
              Efficient communication is at the very heart of extracting  performance from  a
              parallel or distributed system. The design of a parallel  or distributed 
              network involves a number of complex design choices.  This  research aims at 
              providing a sound theoretical basis for making these choices  and help meet 
              the challenges of the evolving National Information  Infrastructure (NII). 
              This  project will study important theoretical issues in the  design of
              parallel or distributed networks that guarantee  quality-of-service (QoS)
              performance metrics. Further,  this  effort will focus on simple implementable
              protocols for  store-and-forward, wormhole, and deflection routing.  This 
              project will investigate theoretical aspects of wireless  communication,
              including call admission algorithms, and  algorithms for mobility management.
              The education plan  includes activities  involving research into novel teaching
               methodologies, participating in teaching seminars, and  consulting with
              experienced educators. A new core  undergraduate course in algorithms will be
              developed with  the aim of integrating algorithmic theory with algorithmic 
              practice. The course will focus on a number of teaching  innovations.  ***
