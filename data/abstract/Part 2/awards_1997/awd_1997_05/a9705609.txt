Abstract    :
                This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II  project will develop an
              innovative technique for ultrahigh sensitivity trace contaminants analysis on
              the semiconductor surfaces based on laser desorption/ionization mass
              spectrometry (LDI-MS). An important analytical capability that this proposed
              project addresses is the capability of performing high speed chemical mapping
              of whole wafers at mm spatial resolution. The technique will quantify trace
              contaminants on the top surface of the target materials by (1) desorbing
              surface contaminants with low power laser pulses, (2) ionizing the desorbed
              neutrals using a high power density pulse, and (3) measuring the photoions by a
              high resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The goal of this Phase II
              research is to achieve detection limits of 108 atoms/cm2 and quantitative
              analysis over surface concentrations ranging between 108 and 10'Ý atoms/cm2 for
              a variety of technologically important elemental contaminants.  This project
              will result in an ultrahigh sensitivity technique for trace contaminant
              analysis on semiconductor surfaces.
