                This grant is awarded through the Separations and Purification Program
              sub-element of the Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of the
              Chemical and Transport Systems Division.  The principal investigator is Spiro
              D. Alexandratos.  The grant is to be used for travel support to the 1997 Gordon
              Conference on Reactive Polymers, Ion Exchangers and Adsorbents.  This Gordon
              Conference will address the theme of polymer supported reagents, their
              synthesis and use in a number of separations technologies.  The design of
              polymer supported reagents for molecular recognition systems is a central theme
              of the conference.    The conference is very pertinent to emerging areas of
              separations technology.  The precise design of molecular recognition ligands,
              their attachment onto polymer backbones for use in environmental remediation,
              chromatography, biochemical separations, adsorption etc. are new
              interdisciplinary forefront areas for separations.  The conference will bring
              together academic and industrial participants, engineers and physical
              scientists, and a mix of mature researchers and new researchers including
              students.  The focus in discussions, an integral part of the Gordon Conference
              format will aid information dissemination and enhance the educational component
              of the conference.
