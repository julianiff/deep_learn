Abstract    :
              9700814  OPELL    Aptostichus is the most diverse genus of trapdoor spiders in
              North America.  Most species are in California, where they occupy at least 13
              of the state's 16 biological regions, including desert environments.  Since
              many of these habitats are threatened, studies of Aptostichus can contribute
              significantly to an understanding of the conservation biology and ecology of
              these regions.  Despite its extraordinary diversity and interesting geographic
              and ecological distribution, this group has received little attention and only
              four of its estimated 25 species have been described.      In this research,
              Brent Opell and doctoral candidate Jason Bond will revise the taxonomy of
              Aptostichus and test hypotheses about how these species arose.  The
              phylogenetic history of the genus, and species boundaries within the genus,
              will be evaluated using both morphological and molecular (mitochondrial and
              nuclear DNA sequence) data.  The morphological data will also contribute to
              knowledge of the distributions, variations in morphological features, and
              natural histories of these spiders, while the sequence data will provide
              insights into their biogeography, speciation processes, and desert adaptations.
               The approach is novel in that it integrates morphological and molecular
              approaches to questions of species delineation, phylogenetic history, and
              natural history in spiders.
