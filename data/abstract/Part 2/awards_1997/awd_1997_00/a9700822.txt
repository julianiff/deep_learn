Abstract    :
              In evolutionary biology, life history refers to the way the stages of life are
              structured in a species.   Life history variables include gestation period, age
              at weaning and first reproduction, inter-birth interval, and life span.  These
              variables correlate highly with each other, as well as with body size, brain
              size, and dental development.  This project will test the precision with which
              life history correlates with dental development, using histological and
              radiographic methods to determine the sequence and timing of crown and root
              development in six Asian primates.  The project will use a new approach,
              controlling for the effects of body size by examining the variation in dental
              development in a gibbon, two leaf monkeys, and a macaque with similar body
              weights but differences in  life history variables, as well as a larger siamang
              and a smaller macaque.  Any patterns of correlation will be examined to
              determine how phylogenetic, demographic, and ecological effects on life history
              affect dental development.  The results of this research will provide critical
              information on dental development in species for which very little is currently
              known and permit the construction of a new model of dental development that may
              be used in understanding life history strategies in primate and human
              evolution.
