Abstract    :
                This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry
              Program, explores the interaction of halogen molecules  with the well
              characterized Al(111) surface.  It is particularly  concerned with the
              abstractive dissociative adsorption which can  occur with halogens, especially
              interhalogen molecules.  Professor                                     Kummel
              and  his students at the University of California at San Diego                 
                            will combine molecular beam scattering and scanning tunneling    
                                                 microscopy methods to probe the detailed
              dynamics of the  interaction of these molecules, with a view to understanding
              the  long range charge transfer process which accompanies dissociative 
              adsorption.  Oriented beam methods will also be used to probe the  interaction
              of pendular states of the interhalogens with the low  work function aluminum
              surface.  An understanding of the dissociative adsorption of simple, high 
              electron affinity molecules such as chlorine when interacting  with low work
              function metals such as aluminum is the focus of  this research project. 
              Probing the dynamics of this interaction  using scattering and surface
              microscopic methods will provide  information about the mechanisms of these
              reactions, which are  important in the processing of electronic materials, and
              in  corrosion processes.
