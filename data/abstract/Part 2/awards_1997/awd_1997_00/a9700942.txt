Abstract    :
              9700942  Schoener  A primary question in ecology is how a top predator affects
              other trophic levels. While many field-experimental studies have been directed
              toward understanding how food webs function, few have included very large
              terrestrial carnivores. One reason may be the general difficulty of
              manipulating such predators in limited, well-defined sites. Certain islands of
              Australia's Great Barrier Reef provide an opportunity to conduct field
              experiments on a system which contains a kind of very large terrestrial
              carnivore, monitor lizards, that is easily observed and handled. Monitor
              lizards and the next-lowest trophic level, the smaller scincid lizards, will be
              excluded or not from experimental plots in a crossed design. Skink and
              leaf-litter arthropod densities and taxonomic compositions, among other
              variables, will be recorded at regular intervals after inception of the
              experiment. To complement the experimental study, a comparison of skink and
              arthropod densities and taxonomic compositions will be performed on islands
              with and without monitor lizards naturally present. This study will help begin
              to fill the major gap in our ecological knowledge concerning the importance of
              very large carnivores in food webs.
