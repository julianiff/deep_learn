Abstract    :
              EEC-9700815  Kriz    Abstract    This award provides funding to Virginia
              Polytechnic Institute and State University, under the direction of Dr. Ronald
              Kriz, for the support of a Combined Research-Curriculum Development project
              entitled, "Combined Research-Curriculum Development: Computer Simulation of
              Material Behavior--From Atomistic to the Continuum Level."  This project will
              focus on the range of computer simulations covering and linking the physical
              length scales necessary for taking a material from laboratory to the
              marketplace.  A sequence of two courses is proposed in which state-of-the-art
              computer hardware and software will be used to teach the concepts and
              techniques  of modern material performance simulation. The courses will have
              Web-Java based modules on specific topics in atomistic aspects of Materials
              Science and Micromechanics and will stress the way in which macroscopic
              materials properties are controlled by phenomena at the atomistic and
              microstructural levels.
