Abstract    :
              MAKAR-LIMANOV, ABSTRACT  9700894    The main objects of the research in this
              proposal are locally nilpotent derivations on various algebra,  a new invariant
              which was recently introduced by  the principal investigator, and their
              possible  applications to algebraic and  geometric questions. The motivation of
              this research is the development of algebraic tools which allow one to
              distinguish rings (in commutative and non-commutative settings). The invariant
              which was originally introduced in order to distinguish some factor-rings of a
              polynomial ring with four generators also is useful in a description of groups
              of automorphisms of a certain class of surfaces and in cancellation type
              problems.  Ring theory and group theory provide a means for describing
              geometric objects through the study of certain properties like  symmetry and
              reflections and how these "operations"  leave  "invariant" certain geometric
              features of the objects of study.
