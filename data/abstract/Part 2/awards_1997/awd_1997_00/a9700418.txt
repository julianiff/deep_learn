Abstract    :
              970418  Erikson    This Dissertation Research Improvement project is a case
              study of the relationship between punishment and the development of the modern
              state.  It takes as a starting point the 1718 Transportation Act, which
              empowered Parliament to banish criminals to the American colonies, as a
              critical attempt by the English government to consolidate state power.  Rather
              than focusing on the coercive capacity of the state for waging war or
              imprisoning offenders, this project situates transportation in a state-centered
              framework to explore why, when, and how this specific penal policy was formed. 
              This study examines the ability of the state to realize its goals in an
              historical context, given the competing demands of different social groups and
              classes and the relations between the state and its publics.  Data collection
              will be done in London and Surrey national and local archives.  State documents
              will be analyzed to investigate the decision-making process leading to the
              implementation of transportation, and  local court records will be used to
              reconstruct the social conditions surrounding judicial decisions to transport
              offenders.  In addition information gathered from state and court documents,
              this project will also use media accounts to examine the relations between the
              English state and its populace within the global-interstate system.  ****
