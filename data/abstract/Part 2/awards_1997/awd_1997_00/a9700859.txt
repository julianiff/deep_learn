Abstract    :
                This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program,  focuses on the development of an understanding of the process of
              underpotential  deposition of metals on single crystal and deliberately stepped
              metal surfaces.   Professor Abruna and his students at Cornell University will
              use a combination  of dynamic electrochemical methods and X-ray scattering
              probes such as EXAFS and  X-ray surface diffraction to study these processes. 
              Real-time growth of silver  and copper electrodeposited on platinum electrodes
              will be examined, and the  effect on the structure of the adsorbed layer by
              halides and pseudo-halides will  be characterized.  This information is crucial
              to the understanding the science  and technology of electroplating and thin
              film growth.    Studies of the processes involved in the electrochemical
              deposition of thin metal  films on metal substrates is the focus of this
              research project.  X-ray and  electrochemical methods will be used to
              characterize the interfacial structures  as they are formed during the
              deposition process.  This information is useful for  understanding
              technologically important processes such as electroplating and  corrosion
              inhibition.
