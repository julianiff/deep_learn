Abstract    :
              9700668  Kapahi  Description:  This award supports a collaboration between Dr. 
              Joanna Rankin, Department of Physics, University of Vermont and   Drs.
              G.Swarup, Director of the Giant Meter-Wave Radio Telescope  (GMRT) and V.
              Radhakrishnan, Director of the Raman Research  Institute (RRI), Bangalore,
              India.  The GMRT is under the  auspices of the National Centre for Radio
              Astrophysics (NCRA) in  Pune.  The research will deal with pulsars, pulsar
              emission,  beaming and evolution, pulsar microstructure, and pulsar timing  and
              polarimetry.  It will include broad observational programs  using the GMRT and
              involves large and currently active teams from  the NCRA and the RRI.    
              Scope:  This project supports a collaboration between U.S.  astronomers and two
              of India's most distinguished researchers on  pulsars, a topic of strong
              current interest.  They will use  India's latest radio-astronomy facility
              outside Pune.  This is  the world's most powerful radio telescope operating at
              meter  wave-lengths.  This is a highly beneficial collaboration in a  field of
              science that is strong in both countries.  The project  meets the criteria of
              the Division of International Programs.  ***
