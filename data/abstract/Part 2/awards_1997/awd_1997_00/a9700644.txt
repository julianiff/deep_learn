              Pierre Ramond  Institution:  Aspen Center for Physics      This award supports
              partial travel expenses for attendees at the  Aspen Winter Astrophysics
              Conference, to be held in Aspen, CO on  5-12 January, 1997. The theme for this
              year's conference is  "Observational Tests of Cosmological Models". Theorists
              and  observers will confront theories with a wide range of  observational
              facts. Topics include: global structure; dynamical  measures of dark matter
              density; cosmological nucleosynthesis and  baryon density; galaxy structure,
              evolution and clustering; high  redshift galaxies, star formation history,
              number counts;  protogalactic and intergalactic media; large scale structure
              and  galaxy clusters; and spectrum and anisotropy of cosmic background 
              radiation.
