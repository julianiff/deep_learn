Abstract    :
              9700834  Power  Population and community dynamics in one habitat (compartment)
              are often strongly linked to dynamics in separate but adjacent habitats. In
              this way, one habitat may in effect, subsidize certain organisms in a second
              habitat. Several recent empirical studies suggest that spatial subsidies lead
              to inflated population densities or altered interaction strengths of organisms
              in recipient habitats. In river ecosystems, the export of winged adults of
              aquatic insects may be a cross-compartmental link, subsidizing watershed
              consumers and altering their community dynamics.  In rivers of northern
              Califomia, lizards (Sceloporus, Iguanidae) are at least seven times more dense
              than congeners in non-river, upland habitats. On the same rivers, the abundance
              of aerial invertebrates declines nearly exponentially with increasing distance
              from the river-land interface. Sceloporus eat primarily terrestrial
              invertebrates, but 5-25% of the insects in their diet are of aquatic origin.
              The ability of Sceloporus to track aquatic resources may be limited by cover
              availability near rivers. The PIs propose to investigate 1) the effect of
              riverine subsidies of aquatic insects on Sceloporus population and community
              dynamics and 2) how near-river cover availability may modulate the ability of
              Sceloporus to track these resources.
