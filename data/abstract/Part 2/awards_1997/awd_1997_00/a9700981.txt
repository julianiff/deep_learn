Abstract    :
              9700981  Chen  The PI proposes to uncouple heterologous protein production  from
              biomass production by improving the protein producing  machinery, i.e., the
              complex ribosomal messenger RNA  processing.  Three ribosomal regulatory
              factors, Fis, ppGpp,  and RMF, will be varied to find the improved processing 
              conditions under no-growth of slow growth E. coli  conditions.  The PI already
              has indications that these  factors have a significant effect on E. coli
              protein  processing under slow-growth, bioreactor conditions.    The
              educational plan has three components.  The first is to  coordinate development
              of a new Environmental Biotechnology  program between the Chemical and
              Environmental Engineering  Departments.  Bioremediation will be the focus of
              the  program.  The second involves facilitating undergraduate  research,
              including minority participation, an activity that  Dr. Chen is already engaged
              in.  Finally, he will be  involved in the development of 2 new courses in cell 
              engineering and environmental biotechnology.  ***
