Abstract    :
                This research project, which is supported in the Analytical and  Surface
              Chemistry Program, addresses the detailed mechanisms of  metal thin film
              growth.  Professors Evans and Thiel at Iowa State  University will combine
              experimental studies of growth mechanism  and morphology, using scanning probe
              microscopy and high resolution  low energy electron diffraction measurements,
              with theoretical  modelling of these processes.  The theoretical approaches are
              based  on atomistic lattice-gas models, and incorporate Monte Carlo  molecular
              dynamics methods.  The interaction between theory and  experiment helps to
              define the complex model systems under study,  which include both homoepitaxial
              and heteroepitaxial growth.  Emphasis in this work is on uncovering the
              detailed atomic level  mechanisms of the growth of metal thin films.  These
              metal thin  films are technologically important in the manufacture of 
              electronic devices, in the packaging and coatings industry, and in  optical
              material synthesis.  A detailed understanding of the growth  process is
              developed by a combination of experimental and  theoretical approaches,
              including scanning probe microscopy,  electron diffraction, and molecular
              dynamics modelling.
