Abstract    :
              9700674  Cohen    The local atomic arrangements at surfaces of alloys is the 
              major theme of this research.  Of particular interest is how  changes in the
              environment, such as reconstruction or  interplanar spacing normal to the
              surface or segregation  ,affect phase transitions such as ordering and
              clustering.  Strain plays an important role in such reactions, and a beam  line
              at Argonne Laboratory's new Synchrotron (the Advanced  Photon Source, or APS)
              is used employing an X-ray glancing  incidence technique.  The X-rays sample a
              shallow range of  depths producing diffuse scattering that is analyzed in a 
              position-sensitive detector.   From these data short range  order parameters
              and distortions are obtained.  Samples  include single crystals of aluminum
              alloys that are prepared  featuring a few facets with different possible
              relaxations.  After heat treatment to produce zones, concentration  profiles
              vs. depth are determined and Auger electron  spectroscopy and low energy
              electron diffraction are used to  look  for evidence of surface reconstruction
              or relaxation.  Diffuse scattering is measured vs. depth, and the surface 
              structures and displacements modeled and compared to the  bulk structure.  %%% 
              An understanding of surface structure aids in analysis of  related phenomena,
              such as corrosion of metal alloys and  crack initiation.  ***
