Abstract    :
               The objective of this research project is to apply a new experimental
              understanding of the flow behavior and strong memory of mesophase pitch, guided
              by rheological analysis, to prepare fiber with well-defined model
              microstructures that can be examined for the most effective mechanical and
              thermal performance.  Carbon fibers spun from mesophase pitch, a discotic
              nematic liquid crystal, can be heat-treated to realized highly oriented
              graphitic microstructures, and thus attain exceptional levels of elastic
              modulus and thermal conductivity.   While this research focuses on mesophase
              fiber, the results should apply to other carbon materials fabricated by
              pyrolysis through the mesophase state, e.g., needle cokes for steel making
              electrodes, thermal absorption tiles for fusion devices, and composites for
              thermal conductors and braking devices.  The research project has a balance
              between theory and experiment, and will provide valuable findings for the
              carbon fiber manufacturing industry.
