Abstract    :
              This research is on a method to detect faults in fabricated integrated circuits 
              (ICs). The method is based on the ability to identify and assess extremely low 
              levels of electromagnetic radiation produced by the IC during its dynamic 
              operation. An electromagnetic radiation (EMR) "signature" can be collected from
               an IC during its operation, and it is hypothesized that a distinction between
              a  faulty and fault-free IC can be made using the EMR signature data. Thus, EMR
              data  is being collected from fault-free ICs, analyzed, and then stored in
              memory.  Faults are being injected into the same ICs and the EMR data
              collected, analyzed,  and compared with the fault-free data. Observed
              differences between the  fault-free and faulty EMR signatures are being
              categorized, and a methodology for  detecting faults in ICs is being developed.
