Abstract    :
              Polishchuk  9700458    This research is concerned with generalizing the approach
              of character sheaves from the case of groups over finite fields to groups over
              p-adic fields.  The work involves two parts.  The first part is to devise a
              notion of sheaves on ind-schemes mimicking that of locally-constant functions
              on p-adic varieties.  The second part is to generalize the Lefschetz-Verdier
              trace formula and its application to the construction of the discrete series
              representation of a reductive group over a finite field based on the gluing of
              perverse sheaves.    This is research in the field of algebraic geometry. 
              Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one
              which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century.  In its
              origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest
              equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays the field makes use of methods not
              only from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding
              application in those fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer
              science, and robotics.
