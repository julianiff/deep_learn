Abstract    :
              9700095  Liu   It was recently shown feasible to use hard turning in selected
              conditions to superfinish surfaces.  However, just like grinding, hard turning
              as a finish process may produce thermal damage to the integrity of a machined
              surface if the machining conditions create too much heat conducted into the
              machined surface.  The objectives of this research project are: (1) to study
              the integrity of machined surface by hard turning; (2) to develop a model to
              estimate the onset and upper bound of the thermally damaged layer as a function
              of machining conditions including flank wear; and (3) to study various
              innovative methods of extending the limit imposed by surface damage (resulted
              by flank wear) for the purpose of longer tool utilization.   This research
              addresses the problem of thermal damage in hard turning, with the potential
              practical result of removing thermal burn as a major obstacle toward widespread
              application of hard turning.  It holds the promise of replacing separate
              grinding and abrasive-based superfinish as a process for finishing hardened
              workpieces.
