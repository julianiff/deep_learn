Abstract    :
              9700168  Wang  Researchers will study spin dependent tunnelling junctions
              consisting of two ferromagnetic electrode layers separated by an insulating
              barrier layer.  The growth, structure and performance of such junctions
              fabricated from Heusler alloys will be investigated.  These devices have
              significant technological potential in magentic RAM, sensors and recording
              heads.  ***
