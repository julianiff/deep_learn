Abstract    :
              9700139  Veenstra  This is an award to assist in the purchase of equipment for 
              conduct of research being conducted by seven co-investigators who  are
              investigating the fate of organic compounds when released  into the biosphere
              and concepts to decontaminate soil and to  reduce or prevent environmental
              pollution by production process  changes and by treatment of process residuals.
               The projects  being conducted by co-investigators from the School of Civil and
               Environmental Engineering and the School of Chemical Engineering  include
              development of a novel granular activated carbon  regeneration process, use of
              alternating current plasma reactors  for treatment of volatile potential air
              pollutants, biological  treatment of soil contaminated by pollutants produced
              during  production of munitions, development of a biofiltration process  for
              treatment of gases containing potential air pollutants and  development of a
              process for manufacture of sulfolane to minimize  production of environmental
              pollutants.    The proposal leading to this award, was submitted in response to
               NSF 93-155, Research Equipment Grant Program.  This award will  assist the
              seven co-investigators involved in conducting research  using equipment
              obtained with assistance from this award to  increase their competitiveness,
              efficiency and output.  The  equipment will also enhance capabilities for
              education of  graduate and undergraduate students.  ***
