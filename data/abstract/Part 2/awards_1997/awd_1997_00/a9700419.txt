Abstract    :
              James Hynes of the Chemistry Department of the University of Colorado is  
              funded by the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division to   study
              the kinetic theory of prototype reactions in solutions, small   clusters and at
              surfaces.  Quantitative predictions and qualitative   interpretations will be
              provided for experiments. The calculations will   be carried out using quantum
              electronic structure methods, molecular   dynamics, analytic theories and
              models. The solution phase research will   focus in two areas: (1) Excited
              photon transfer reactions (ESPT) in which   acidity is dramatically increased
              by photoexcitation. (2) Reaction   dynamics in electrolytes. The dynamics of
              prototype unimolecular SN1   ionization reaction of tertiary butyl chloride in
              salt solutions will be   studied. Furthermore,  heterogeneous surface chemical
              reactions    responsible for the depletion of the ozone in the upper atmosphere
              will   be investigated.  By far the majority of reactions which are of interest
              to chemists take   place in the solution phase, and the most important solvent
              is water.    The effect which the presence of aqueous solvent has on a chemical
                reaction is still not fully understood.   Hynes is applying a combination  
              of theory and computer simulations to determine the molecular nature of  
              solvent-solute interactions and their effect on the rates of chemical  
              reactions in solution.  He is also applying these theoretical methods to  
              studies of important environmental problems such as acid rain and ozone  
              depletion.
