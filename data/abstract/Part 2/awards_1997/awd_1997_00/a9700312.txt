Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9700312  John Dorgan    The Chemical Engineering, Physics, and
              Metallurgical and Materials Engineering Departments of the Colorado School of
              Mines (CSM) will obtain a variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometer which will
              be used in a wide variety of projects including the following:    1.
              Investigation of polymer and copolymer layers near solid inorganic surfaces. 
              2. Exploration of the electronic structure of photovoltaics.  3.
              Characterization of thin films from the Advanced Coatings and Surface
              Engineering Laboratory (ACSEL) in the Metallurgical and Materials Engineering
              department.  4. Incorporation into the class Experimental Methods in Materials
              Science.      The acquisition of the instrument:  1) provides a means of
              testing theories of material systems of interest to the researchers at CSM, 2)
              enables the rational advancement of the Materials Science of thin films 3)
              enhances the educational experience of graduate students participating in the
              interdisciplinary Materials Science Program, and 4) builds the scientific
              infrastructure on campus.
