Abstract    :
              The main objective of this proposal is better understanding of underlying atomic
              and molecular processes involved in the microstructural evolution of
              polycrytalline TiS2 and other powders synthesized using the thi-sol-gel process
              previously proposed by the P.I.  A secondary objective is to investigate the
              electrochemical properties of the resulted thin layer, the influence of heat
              treatment and of charging on the particulate microstructure.  The effects of
              particle size, shape, crystallite size, orientation and stoichiometry on the
              elctrochemical properties and the mechanisms involved in the evolution of the
              microstructure will be investigated using differential thermal and
              thermogravimetric analyses, scanning and transmission electron microscopy.   
              If successful, the research may provide a method to synthesize an engineered
              microstructure with optimal electrochemical properties.  Applications include
              electrochemical batteries.  The preliminary test have indicated a dramatic
              increase of the number of charging cycles for a given reduction in performance.
