Abstract    :
               9700844 Lau This project addresses basic materials research issues in the
              combination of materials associated with metal contacts to gallium nitride. 
              The proposed research emphasizes fundamental mechanisms and processes along
              with some of the practical aspects of nitride contact technology.  The approach
              involves a systematic study of barrier heights of various Schottky diodes, and
              solid state reactions to produce intermediate materials such as platinum
              silicide which lead to thermally stable Schottky barriers, and low resistance
              contacts between metals and nitrides.  The project emphasizes strong
              interlinking between materials growth, characterization, physical property
              measurements, and related device research efforts.  %%% The project addresses
              forefront research issues in a topical area of materials science having high
              technological relevance, compact and efficient light sources in the blue-green
              spectral region.  The research will contribute basic materials science
              knowledge at a fundamental level to important aspects of electronic/photonic
              devices and integrated circuitry, in general.  Additionally, the fundamental
              knowledge and understanding gained from the research is expected to contribute
              to improving the performance of advanced devices and circuits by providing a
              fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved
              materials, and materials combinations.  An important feature of the program is
              the integration of research and education through the training of students in a
              fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***
