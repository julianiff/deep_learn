Abstract    :
              9700430  den Nijs  This grant is for theoretical work in statistical physics by 
              a senior PI.  This follows a creativity extension of the  previous award some
              five years ago.  There are three  specific areas of research: In the first
              project the PI  plans to investigate the applications of general concepts  such
              as conformal invariance and methods like Coulomb gas  mappings to the scaling
              properties of dynamical processes in  1+1 dimensions.  There are plans to
              consider the earlier  proposed "z theorem" and its validity beyond the KPZ type
               growth to directed percolation.  In the second project, the  focus is on
              whether the strong coupling conformal field  theories with central charge c > 1
              exist.  The third project  is an extensive study of crystal surface phase
              transitions.  Here the PI plans to extend his earlier work on  preroughening ,
              disordered flat phases and the competition  between surface roughening and
              reconstruction.  %%%  The senior PI receiving this grant is considered an
              expert  in the application of sophisticated mathematical techniques  to
              statistical mechanics.  His recent contributions have  been in the general area
              of phase transitions at a  crystalline surface and also on a detailed
              understanding of  complex growth processes at a surface.  His previous grant 
              had received a creativity extension two years ago which  permitted him to
              explore more risky and speculative  subjects. The present grant continues the
              work begun during  the creativity extension.  ***
