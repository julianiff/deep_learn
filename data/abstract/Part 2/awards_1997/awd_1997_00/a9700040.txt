Abstract    :
              ***  9700040  Barton  This grant provides funding for research on the use of
              metamodels to allow system-level computer-aided design using disparate
              computer-based subsystem models.  Metamodels are approximating models of
              engineering product or subsystem performance models.  The research has several
              goals:  (1) to   define an architecture needed to fit the approximating
              metamodels and integrate these subsystem metamodels to allow efficient
              examination of system design alternatives; (2) to develop useful measures of
              the adequacy of a given metamodel for a given design task; (3) to develop
              sequential methods to improve the adequacy of the metamodel, providing
              additional accuracy only where it is needed as the design is refined; and (4)
              to test the methodology on an application to magnetic levitation transport
              design.    If successful, this research will  allow increased complexity for
              systems which are amenable to computer-aided design.  For many complex products
              such as aircraft, computers, automobiles, and telecommunications networks, it
              is necessary to design subsystems separately because it is too difficult to
              integrate the computer-based analysis modules to create a model of the entire
              system.  Metamodel-based integration technology will allow the construction of
              fast, approximate models for entire systems.  As a result, designers will be
              able to consider interaction among subsystems, and develop systems with better
              performance at lower cost, in a shorter period of time.  These advantages will
              be particularly important to US firms competing in the markets mentioned above.
