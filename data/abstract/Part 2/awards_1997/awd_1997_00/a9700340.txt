Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9700340  H. Monbouquette/U. Cal.    A spectrofluoremeter system to
              support the development of  luminescent metal-sorbing vesicles for selective
              and ultrasensitive detection of toxic metal ions will be purchased.  This
              equipment will facilitate extension of ongoing NSF-funded research on the
              development of metal-sorbing vesicles (MSVs) for toxic metal ion recovery from
              dilute aqueous solution.  The high selectivity, affinity, and loading capacity
              of metal-sorbing vesicles (MSVs), coupled with their potential for use in
              continuous processing, make this a promising novel technology both for the
              detection and for the recovery of toxic heavy metal ions present in dilute
              solution.  MSVs are submicron-diameter, surfactant bilayer membrane capsules
              that have been engineered to sequester reversibly metal ions.
