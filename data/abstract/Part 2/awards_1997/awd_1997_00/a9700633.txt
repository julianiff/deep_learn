              Abstract  ATM-9700633  Denton, George H.  University of Maine  Title:
              Millennial-Scale Climatic Oscillations in New Zealand During  the Last Glacial
              Cycle: PEP III Transect    Paleoclimate records from Greenland ice cores and
              North Atlantic  sediments indicate that the glacial climate over the North
              Atlantic  basin was punctuated with large and frequent abrupt climatic  changes
              (Dansgaard-Oeschger and Henrich events).  Because the  events first appeared to
              have been regionally restricted, most  explanations have invoked regional
              forcing mechanisms.  But quite  a different perspective would emerge if these
              events were shown to  be of this global-scale.  SGER award supports a
              reconnaissance  study of the glacial and vegetative paleoclimate record of the 
              massive morainal deposits of the Southern Alps of New Zealand  This  will
              establish the paleoclimate potential of this record to  contribute to our
              understanding of interhemispheric climatic  linkages and forcing mechanisms for
              the last glacial cycle.
