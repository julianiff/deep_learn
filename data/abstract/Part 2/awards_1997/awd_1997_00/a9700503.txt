Abstract    :
              Abstract - Puszynski    This is a study of the fundamentals of high-pressure
              synthesis of silicon-    nitride-based ceramics in a self-sustaining regime. 
              Aspects investigated     include particle-particle-gas interactions, product
              morphology, and phase     composition of combustion-synthesized ceramics.  The
              effort focuses on the     effects of combustion conditions and various
              additives, factors that may alter     crystal growth and the formation
              mechanisms of silicon-nitride-based     ceramics.  Quantitative data are
              obtained on the formation and crystal growth     of silicon nitride, silicon
              oxynitride, sialon, and silicon carbide during self-    sustaining,
              high-pressure nitridation of silicon powders containing amounts of     oxides,
              nitrides, halogens, and/or carbon.  Models are developed to describe     the
              complex reaction and diffusion processes on a particle level during    
              formation of single-phase silicon nitride and other solid solutions.     
              Widespread application of advanced nitride ceramics is limited by high    
              synthesis and processing costs.  Combustion synthesis is an attractive method  
                for overcoming this obstacle.  Silicon-nitride-based ceramics are attractive
              for    many high-technology applications because of their chemical inertness,
              high-    temperature stability, fracture toughness and resistance to erosion,
              corrosion,     and thermal shock.
