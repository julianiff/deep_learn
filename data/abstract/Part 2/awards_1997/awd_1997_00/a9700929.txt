Abstract    :
              9700929  Matson  This research proposal is designed to determine the effect of
              water on biological processes involved in carbon cycling in high precipitation,
              non-wetland ecosystems. While the influence of water on carbon dynamics is well
              studied in dry to mesic terrestrial systems, it remains poorly defined in mesic
              to wet ecosystems although patterns of soil carbon storage suggest that it is
              important. The experimental approach uses a naturally occurring rainfall
              gradient in Hawaii; all other state factors that can affect carbon dynamics are
              held remarkably constant among sites, while rainfall alone changes
              systematically from 2500 mm to 6000 mm. This study focuses on the effect of
              water on decomposition and net primary productivity as the primary mechanisms
              of soil carbon storage. The main hypotheses are that net primary productivity
              and decomposition are negatively affected by water in these terrestrial
              systems; that the effect on decomposition rates is stronger relative to the
              effect on net primary productivity; and that water directly suppresses both
              oxygen and nutrient availability. The effect of increasing water will be
              evaluated across the gradient by directly measuring changes in net primary
              productivity and decomposition rates, by using 13C mass spectroscopy of soils
              and plant tissue as integrated measures of carbon fluxes, and by analysis of
              the soil atmosphere and nutrient availability.  Understanding the mechanistic
              controls over soil carbon storage is important for predicting the transient
              response of the global soil carbon pool to climate change; though soil carbon
              storage increases linearly across the axis of precipitation, this masks real
              changes in the processes that control storage. This research will provide a
              robust empirical test of the effect of water on production and decomposition in
              high precipitation ecosystems, and will link changes in these carbon cycling
              processes to patterns of soil carbon storage.            NSF Form 1358 (1/94)
