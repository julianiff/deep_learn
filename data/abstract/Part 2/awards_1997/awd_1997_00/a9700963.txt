Abstract    :
              This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  
              Program, focuses on the decomposition reaction of methanol on platinum  
              electrode surfaces and on modified platinum electrode surfaces.    Professor
              Wieckowski and his students at the University of Illinois at   Urbana will use
              electrochemical methods combined with core-level electron   energy loss
              spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and a new   radiochemical
              method to characterize the reaction mechanisms associated   with these
              reactions.  The goal of this work is to understand, and   thereby prevent,
              those reactions that foul the electrode surface during   methanol decomposition
              so that these sytsems can be used as practical   fuel cells.  This work has
              enormous technological potential.  Studies of the decomposition reaction of the
              simplest alcohol, methanol,   on platinum and modified platinum electrodes will
              be studied in this   work.  Over time, this reaction fouls the electrode and
              the reaction   ceases to occur.  This prevents use of methanol, an inexpensive
              source of   energy, in fuel cells that could otherwise be used in many
              practical   applications.
