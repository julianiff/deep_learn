Abstract    :
              BENSON,  97-00416        The first part of Professor Benson's project involves
              developing the theory of  complexity and varieties for infinitely generated
              modules for finite groups,  and the corresponding theory for a large class of
              infinite discrete groups.  With his student Gnacadja, he is studying the idea
              of a phantom map between  represenations, an idea borrowed from topology. The
              second part of the   project involves the study of group actions via the theory
              of varieties for  modules, and the study of homotopy decompositions of
              classifying spaces.  The third part involves generalizations of his work with
              Jon Carlson on  Poincar&eacute; duality for finite groups. This theory has
              already been  generalized to compact Lie groups and to virtual duality groups
              in joint  work with John Greenlees, and they are currently working on the
              generalization   to p-adic analytic groups, based on the work of Lazard for the
              torsion  free case. The fourth part involves explicit computer calculations of 
              projective resolutions and group cohomology using John Cannon's MAGMA  program.
                 Representation theory is the study of how to represent abstract groups  as
              groups of matrices. Cohomology studies how matrix representations  glue
              together. Professor Benson's research centers around the cohomology   and
              representation theory of finite, infinite and compact Lie groups, the  
              algebraic topology of classifying spaces, and invariant theory for finite  
              groups. This subject is on the borderline between algebra and topology, which  
              seems to be a very fruitful area of interaction within pure mathematics.
