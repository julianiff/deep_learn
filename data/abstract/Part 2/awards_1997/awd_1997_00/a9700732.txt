              VESL:  Visions for Embedded Systems Laboratories    The VESL (Vision for
              Embedded Systems Laboratories)  project addresses three needs in undergraduate
              computer engineering education:  (1) providing students  with hands-on, 
              real-world experiences in embedded computer system development in an active,
              collaborative learning environment; (2) increasing accessibility of specialized
              laboratories to students to allow different learning paces and approaches and
              to support different contexts and types of interaction; and (3) sharing costly
              laboratory resources with other universities.    The focus for the curriculum
              development is embedded computing systems.  Research results in real-time
              computing, software engineering, and wireless systems, including such topics as
              ubiquitous computing, scheduling, monitoring and debugging, codesign, testing,
              and software prototyping, will be transferred to the instructional domain. 
              Instructional modules will be developed according to the "Open You I's"
              paradigm, which views learning as a process of Introduction, Instruction,
              Illustration, Investigation, and Implementation.  Laboratory development will
              impact introductory courses through senior design project courses via an array
              of laboratory experiences, including a radio-controlled cars project and
              industry-sponsored projects.  Realistic design experiences will provide
              students with greater insight about the functionality, reliability, and other
              properties of an embedded system.
