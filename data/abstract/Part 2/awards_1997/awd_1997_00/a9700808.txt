Abstract    :
              9700808  Satija  This grant will support the work of a female theorist who  has
              a research program of international recognition with a  strong participation of
              undergraduate students.  The  research involves properties of systems with
              competing  length scales.  One of the important aspects of these  systems is
              the existence of an exotic phase with fractal  characteristics. The conceptual
              linkage through much of this  work is the relationship between localization
              (and many  phenomena related to localization) and the universal Fractal 
              fluctuations. The proposed systems under investigation  include quantum chaos
              models exhibiting dynamical  localization and classical driven oscillators with
              strange  non-chaotic attractors. These systems will be studied by  using a
              renormalization methodology developed recently by  the PI and her
              collaborators. The possible applications  include a microscopic model of
              friction and magnetic  properties of superlattices exhibiting giant 
              magnetoresistance.  %%%  This grant supports theoretical research of  a female
              PI.  The research on nonlinear dynamical systems involves  sophisticated
              mathematical techniques with active  participation by  undergraduate and
              graduate students.  It  is part of an internationally recognized program with
              long-  standing collaborations with colleagues from around the  world.  Her
              work has applications to several currently  active areas in materials;
              including microscopic models of  friction and properties of magnetic
              superlattices.  ***
