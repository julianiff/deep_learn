Abstract    :
              9700906  Dawson  The goal of this research is to characterize the dynamics of
              windbreak colonization by tropical forest trees and to examine how the
              positioning of windbreaks within the landscape influences the colonization
              process. In particular, the effects of windbreak connectivity and remnant trees
              within the windbreaks will be evaluated. Preliminary research indicates that
              windbreak connectivity and remnant trees increase the abundance and richness of
              forest trees in windbreaks. It is hypothesized that these factors enhance
              forest regeneration by increasing seed dispersal into the windbreaks. To
              understand the dynamics of forest regeneration, a combination of vegetation
              surveys, seed trapping, soil seed bank studies, and seed predation trials will
              be conducted in windbreaks and pastures in Monteverde, Costa Rica. The seed
              rain entering different windbreak types (connected, non-connected, and with
              remnant trees) and pastures will be characterized for a one-year period using
              seed traps. The soil seed banks of windbreaks and pastures will be assessed
              using the seedling emergence technique. Seed predation in windbreaks and
              pastures will be evaluated through seed removal experiments. This research will
              enhance our understanding of the dynamics of forest regeneration in
              agroecosystems and also provide useful information for reforestation and
              conservation programs in the tropics.
