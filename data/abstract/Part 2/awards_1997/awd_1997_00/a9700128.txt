Abstract    :
              Abstract  Proposal: CMS 97-00128  PI:  Roman D. Hryciw, University of Michigan 
              "In-Situ Soil Characterization by Vision Cone Penetrometer"        The
              objective of this research program is the development of  computer vision
              methods for in-situ soil characterization.  Continuous subsurface images are
              obtained by a recently  developed Vision-Cone Penetrometer (V-CPT).  From the 
              digitally acquired images the grain size distribution of the  soil will be
              determined.  A number of possible vision  approaches will be investigated to
              accomplish this task.  They include edge detection schemes such as Hough
              transforms  along with active contouring, linear scanning, and textural 
              analysis.  Visual observation of the soil would provide a  continuous and
              unambiguous assessment of soil type and  stratigraphy.  As such, in-situ
              observation by the proposed  Subsurface Vision Probe would be highly desirable.
                 The research program includes continued improvement of V-CPT  hardware by
              inclusion of state-of-the-art digital video  recording; development of the
              previously described vision  techniques; and field testing both on the
              University of  Michigan campus and the Northwestern University National 
              Geotechnical Experimentation Site.    ****
