Abstract    :
                EEC-9700731  Manno    ABSTRACT    This award provides funding to Tufts
              University under the direction of Dr. Vincent P. Manno, for the support of a
              Combined Research-Curriculum Development project entitled, "Tufts-Rensselaer
              Thermal Manufacturing Research-Curriculum Development Program." Thermal
              manufacturing is the application of thermal-fluid sciences and materials
              science to the design and control of manufacturing and materials processes
              which employ thermal methods. This project involves a cooperative
              research-curriculum-engineering practice program in Thermal Manufacturing
              involving Tufts University and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute along with
              industrial collaborators and NASA.  The program will develop and deliver a
              number of relevant curricular modules sharing the common focus of Thermal
              Manufacturing, but spanning various formats including semester-long course
              offerings, short courses, hands-on exploration experiences, interactive
              multimedia and WWW-based venues. A major part of this coordinated program is a
              set of Annual Summer Institutes to be held in 1998, 1999, and 2000. It is a
              goal of the project that the final institute will establish the institute
              series as a long term self-supported technology development and transfer forum
              in Thermal Manufacturing.
