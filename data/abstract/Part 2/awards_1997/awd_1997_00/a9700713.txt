Abstract    :
              9700713  Harrison     This award will provide funds for travel and for materials
              and supplies to enhance the dissertation research of Mr. Scott E. Stanley, a
              doctoral student at Cornell University who is working under the supervision of
              Dr. Richard Harrison.  Mr. Stanley's dissertation research involves acquisition
              of DNA sequences from both mitochondrial and nuclear genomes in order to study
              phylogenetic relationships among higher orders of birds and among families of 
              pelecaniform  birds.  Pelecaniforms include pelicans, cormorants, boobies,
              frigate birds, and tropic birds.  The phylogenetics of orders of birds are
              controversial, particularly those between orders of large water birds,
              including pelecaniforms, procellariiforms (tube-nosed seabirds), gaviiformes
              (loons), podicipediformes (grebes), and sphenisciforms (penguins).  The work by
              Stanley and Harrison will address many of the more long-standing
              taxonomic/phylogenetic issues, and in addition, test the performance of the
              mitochondrial and nuclear eenes with respect to phylogenetic reconstruction. 
              Generation of such a large molecular data set also will provide an historical
              framework within which hypotheses concerning early avian evolution and
              morphological and behavioral evolution in birds can be tested rigorously.
              Support for training of graduate students in modern technologies is critical to
              maintain the workforce of scientists capable of addressing questions and issues
              in global biology.
