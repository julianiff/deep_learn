Abstract    :
              9700318    With passage of the Ocean Dumping Act and the lack of  containment
              facilities, the disposal of nearly 7 million  tons of dredged sediments per
              year become a major problem  for the New York/New Jersey metropolitan area. 
              The dredged  sediments in a slurry form need to be dewatered, remediated,  and
              disposed.  The contaminants (heavy metals and organics)  in the dredged
              sediments are usually attached to the clay  and silt fractions.  The action of
              applied ultrasound  techniques, coupled with extraction under partial vacuum,
              is  proposed in this study to remove contaminants and water from  dredged
              residues.  A complete treatment technology with  three different processes is
              proposed for commercial  implementation/.  In this research, two processes
              involving  ultrasound will be evaluated.  In the first process, the  fines near
              the ultrasound probe are separated from the bulk  dredged suspension and are
              removed using sub-atmospheric  pressure.  In the second process, the fines are 
              decontaminated and contaminants in water are removed using  sub-atmospheric
              pressure.  The remediated soil can be ocean-  dumped as clean material or used
              in construction.  The  extracted organic and inorganic waste will be
              concentrated  using membrane technology and disposed of in hazardous waste 
              landfills.  This technology can be easily added directly  into a dredging
              vessel to minimize material handling.  ***
