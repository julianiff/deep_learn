Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT      DMS-9700611    This project provides partial funding for a US
              delegation of 23 mathematicians to participate in the conference entitled
              "Computational Methods and Function Theory '97", which will be held in Nicosia,
              Cyprus during the period October 13-18, 1997. The general theme of the meeting
              concerns the various aspects of interaction between function theory and
              scientific computation. The US delegation will consist of senior researchers as
              well as junior investigators, chosen so as to achieve a balance between these
              two areas.    This conference is the third in a series, following CMFT '89 held
              in Valparaiso, Chile and CMFT '94 held in Penana, Malaysia. Another common
              theme of these meetings is to foster the creation and maintenance of contacts
              between scientists from diverse cultures. This is also reflected in the
              location of the meeting. Cyprus is an ideal place, traditionally serving as a
              bridge between East and West.    The US delegation will include 5 new Ph.D.'s
              who hold great promise of becoming future leaders in these fields of
              mathematics.
