Abstract    :
              9700948  Warner  The objective of this research is to describe the evolution of
              the diversity of reproductive patterns that are seen in animals today.  This
              research will allow a field test of the predictions of mathematical models that
              include considerations of within- and between-gender conflict interactions and
              their resolution.  The resolutions do not necessarily maximize the fitness of
              any of the participants, but the compromises achieved are the mating systems
              seen.  Predictions using this approach differ significantly from those made by
              precious theory, and explain the existence of patterns of mating behavior that
              appear to confer lower individual mating success.    The predictions will be
              tested in a well-known group of temperate fishes.  Using simple, non-harmful
              techniques, the distribution of mating success in certain areas will be altered
              and the redistribution of males and females will be monitored.  The model makes
              several non-intuitive predictions about male and female reactions to altered
              mating distributions.  All models, especially those proposing a new way of
              thinking about the evolution of particular characteristics, need to be tested
              so that they may be evaluated in nature.
