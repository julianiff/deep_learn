Abstract    :
              ECS-9700651  Makram      This proposal describes the existence of "unbalance" in
              power systems and draws the attention of the reader to the alarming and growing
              presence of harmonic unbalance in power systems created as a result of the,
              random use of single, double and three phase harmonic loads in power systems. 
              While prior attempts to characterize unbalance in power systems have been
              typically unclear, a review of the current literature shows no attempts to
              characterize harmonic unbalance although it is important, useful and necessary
              from both an academic and practical point of view.  Beginning with the
              development of advanced three phase load models for commonly used power system
              loads, this project endeavors to undertake the critical task of proposing a
              metric that quantifies harmonic unbalance.  This new quantitative metric that
              characterizes power system harmonic unbalance bears a large impact on the
              utility in terms of modifying existing tariff structures, better
              instrumentation & metering and power quality studies.  Using the proposed
              metric, unbalance profiles will be studied and limits for the safe operation of
              customer equipment will be established.  This proposal  aims to conclude with
              setting standards for harmonic unbalance in power systems, thereby enhancing
              basic research in the understanding of harmonic unbalance in Power Systems.
