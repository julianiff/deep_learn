Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9700210    Funding is requested for a high-speed infrared camera
              and a high-speed visible wavelength camera to conduct thermal and visual
              observations of transport phenomena in various experiments.  The equipment will
              be used to study thermal processing of molten glass, active temperature control
              in semiconductor manufacturing, heat release in turbulent diffusion flames, and
              the response of tissue to light and heat.  A total of eight investigators will
              be sharing the equipment.
