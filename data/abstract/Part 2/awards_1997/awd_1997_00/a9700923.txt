Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT, DONG    The principal investigator will investigate vertex operator
              algebras and the monstrous moonshine. Relations among vertex operator algebras,
              orbifold theory, modular functions and elliptic cohomology will be studied. 
              The principal investigator will determine various module categories and
              construct induction functor for vertex operator algebras. The Conway-Norton's
              generalized moonshine conjecture is expected to be established.     Vertex
              operator algebras are symmetry algebras in conformal field theory which is an
              important physical theory describing both two-dimensional critical phenomena in
              condensed matter physics and classical motions of strings in string theory.
              This is a research that starts out in the field of algebra but moves beyond
              that to touch knot invariants, quantum groups, integrable systems, modular
              forms, and conformal and topological field theories.  A successful study of
              this project will lead to new mathematical discoveries which will be important
              both in mathematics and physics.
