Abstract    :
                      9700199  James  Optical elastomers, formed by cross-linking of polymeric
              liquid  crystals, possess important properties, such as stress-induced  optical
              switching, stress induced shifts in phase transition  temperatures,
              piezoelectricity, etc., that make them promising  candidates for industrial
              applications such as in integrated  optics.  The response of these materials
              under biaxial loading is  experimentally investigated in this project.  The
              observations from  these experiments are being used to develop predictive tools
              that  will enhance the understanding of mechano-optical behavior of these 
              materials and thus the ability to effectively use these materials  in
              industrial setting.  ***
