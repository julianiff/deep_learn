Abstract    :
                    FRENKEL, 97-00765        Igor Frenkel plans to continue his work on
              representation theory  of affine Lie algebras, and related algebraic structures
              such as  vertex operator algebras and quantum groups.  The author proposes  
              several specific problems that should  contribute to the development of these
              subjects and to   better understanding of their interrelations.  Frenkel  also
              plans to study representation theory of a new class of Lie  algebras and
              groups, recently introduced by him and his collaborators.  Besides its
              intrinsic mathematical significance the new theory  has important applications
              to four-dimensional quantum field theory  in physics.    Representation theory
              of Lie algebras and Lie groups initially  developed at the turn of the century
              studies the structure of   symmetries and their realizations.  This theory
              encompasses many  areas in mathematics and has fundamental applicaitons to
              theoretical  physics.  In the past twenty years the study of representaiton 
              theory of a special class of affine Lie algebras and  Lie groups led to many
              new unexpected discoveries in mathematics  and theoretical physics as well as
              to a synthesis of many established  areas in both disciplines.  In particular,
              it yielded a pure mathe-  matical description of a simplest quantum field
              theory -- a prototype  theory of fundamental interactions.  It is expected that
              representation  theory of new classes of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and
              groups  might substantially deepen our understanding of mathematics and 
              theoretical physics during the next decade.
