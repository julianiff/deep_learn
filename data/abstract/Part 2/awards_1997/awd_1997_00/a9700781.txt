Abstract    :
                  Wang  9700781          This award funds research into the following two
              distinct projects.  (Project 1) In 1974, S. Lang made a conjecture which
              connects the geometry (hyperbolicity) of an algebraic variety defined over a
              number field with the arithmetic (Mordellicity) of the variety. The conjecture
              is true for curves and subvarieties of Abelian varieties. Little is known for
              other varieties. Professors Sarnak and Wang have shown that some hypersurfaces
              yield either a violation of the Hasse principle which is not accounted for by
              the Brauer--Manin obstruction or a violation of the above Lang's conjecture.
              Professor Wang will continue to  investigate this problem for 0-cycles of
              degree 1. (Project 2)   The  densities of rational points on algebraic
              varieties have  been studied extensively. Professor Wang plans to study weak 
              approximation, Brauer--Manin obstruction and the modified Mazur's   conjecture
              on the topology of rational points on the Hurwitz  families, and more
              generally, on Hurwitz spaces. Since every variety  is uniformized by Hurwitz
              spaces, this research will shed light on  these problems in the general case.  
                 This research falls into the general mathematical field of Number Theory. It
              concerns the solutions to algebraic equations in whole numbers and
              generalizations. Number theory is among the oldest branches of mathematics and
              was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within
              the last half century, it has become an indispensable tool in diverse
              applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and
              communication systems.
