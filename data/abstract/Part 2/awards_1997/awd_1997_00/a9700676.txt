Abstract    :
                  Proposal: DMS-9700676  PI: Carlen, Harrell, Loss    The proposal is for an
              International Conference on Differential Equations and Mathematical Physics to
              be held in March, 1997 at Georgia Tech. The program will include lectures on
              nonlinear partial differential equations, spectral and scattering theory,
              variational and topological methods, bifurcation and normal forms, and symmetry
              analysis. The support is to be used for travel and local expenses for speakers
              and for a discount and travel expenses for regional and minority participants.
