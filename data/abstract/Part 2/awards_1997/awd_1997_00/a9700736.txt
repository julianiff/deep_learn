Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry  
              Program continues support for studies of catalytic reaction mechanisms by   Dr.
              Richard R. Schrock of the Chemistry Department, Massachusetts   Institute of
              Technology.  Four areas of investigation will be pursued.     Efforts to
              synthesize molybdenum catalysts that produce enantiomerically   pure products
              for ring closing metathesis of dienes will be continued.    Second, the
              organometallic chemistry of complexes containing a new   boryl-substituted
              diamido ligand will be studied in order to test the   activity of such species
              for the polymerization of alpha-olefins.  The   third area of investigation
              compares the reactivity of triamidoamine   complexes containing molybdenum to
              those containing tungsten. The fourth   project involves the synthesis and
              reactions of new complexes containing   a planar triamido ligand.  Catalysts
              are important in the synthesis of specific reaction products   and their use
              can result in significant energy and chemical savings.  The   goal of this work
              is to systematically design groups attached to active   metal centers in order
              to control their catalytic effects.  The specific   systems studied contain
              nitrogen-based (amido) ligands and early   transition metals.
