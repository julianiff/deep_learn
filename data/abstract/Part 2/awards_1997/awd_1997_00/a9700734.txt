Abstract    :
                    9700734  Gopnik    The National Academy of Sciences, through the Ocean
              Studies   Board (OSB) of the Commission on Geosciences, Environment,   and
              Resources will continue providing guidance on major   ocean science and policy
              issues to the National Science   Foundation and other government agencies. The
              Ocean Studies   Board monitors the status and needs of ocean science  
              community and assists NSF in developing and maintaining   strong programs of
              ocean research responsive to scientific   opportunities and national interests.
              OSB will: 1)   contribute to the advancement of scientific understanding of  
              the ocean by maintaining continuous oversight of the health   of ocean sciences
              and stimulating their progress; 2) foster   the application of scientific
              knowledge to the use of the   ocean and its resources; 3)provide leadership for
              the   formulation of national and international marine policy and   to clarify
              scientific issues that affect ocean policy; and   4)address scientific issues
              involved in cooperative   international oceanographic research, and to improve 
               technical assistance. Several other agencies also contribute   to these
              activities and provide support for focused studies   undertaken by the OSB.
