Abstract    :
                The proposal will install and operate an all-sky camera in the  vacinity of
              Nothern Michigan University in collaboration with  Cornell University.  The all
              sky images from the camera will  overlap and extend the east-west coverage
              possible when combined  with the imager operated by Boston University at the
              Millstone Hill  Observatory.  Investigations using these data will focus on the
               equatorward edge of the diffuse aurora.  The particular phenomena  to be
              investigated are the large scale undulations along this edge  often observed
              during times of enhanced magnetic activity.  The  observations will be coupled
              with ionospheric plasma convection  measurements using the Millstone Hill
              incoherent scatter radar.   The project involves undergraduate students at
              Northern Michigan  University who will learn image processing techniques to
              manipulate  the images.  The auroral science will be mentored via strong 
              electronic collaboration links to be established between NMU and  Cornell.
