Abstract    :
              In support of the NSF's gravitational wave observatory LIGO  which is currently
              under construction, this project aims to  produce models of binary compact
              object systems by numerical  solution of the Einstein gravitational equations
              coupled,  when appropriate, to fluid matter.  Compact object here  refers to
              neutron stars and stellar mass black holes.  When  closely coupled in pairs
              revolving about each other these  systems can lose energy by radiating
              gravitational waves.  This has been seen to occur in the binary pulsar system 
              through the observation and analysis of the motions.  But  more tightly bound
              and rapidly moving systems are expected  to evolve to the point where the
              radiation would be  detectable by the LIGO facility.  Under this grant Prof. 
              Charles Misner of the University of Maryland will engage in  a collaboration,
              to produce detailed computer generated  models of such radiating systems. 
              These models would allow  the gravitational wave signals from such exotic
              systems to  be more reliably recognized and interpreted.
