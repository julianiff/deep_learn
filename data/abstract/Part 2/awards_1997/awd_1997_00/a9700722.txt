Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   of
              the Chemistry Division, Lisy will study microscopic ionic solutions   using
              both experimental and simulation methods.  The binding between   cations and
              host molecules in the presence of hydrogen-bonding solvents   such as water and
              methanol will be investigated using infrared   spectroscopy of mass-selected
              ion clusters.  Aromatic hydrocarbons and   crown ethers will serve as models
              for peptide aromatic side-chains and   ionophores, respectively.  Molecular
              dynamics simulations will be   compared with experimental observations and will
              be helpful in   interpreting the observations.  The results of these
              investigations will   help the understanding of ion-molecule interactions in
              solvated media.    These studies will bridge the gap between gas-phase mass
              spectrometric   measurements and solution-based studies.  Interactions between
              neutral   molecules and electrically charged atoms or molecules, called ions,
              are   of fundamental importance to a number of areas, including chemical  
              processes in liquid or solid solutions, and ultimately in biological   systems.
               Similarly, examining gas phase ion-molecule processes is   important for
              understanding chemical reactions in the upper atmosphere
