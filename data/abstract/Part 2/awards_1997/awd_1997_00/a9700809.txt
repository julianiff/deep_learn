Abstract    :
              EEC 9700809  Cummings      Abstract    This award funds a three year Combined
              Research-Curriculum Development (CRCD) program, entitled "Development of a
              World Wide Web Based Textbook on Molecular Simulation," at the University of
              Tennessee-Knoxville under the direction of Dr. Peter T. Cummings. The goal of
              this project is to initiate a WWW-based "textbook" on molecular simulation.  An
              electronic form of this book exists exclusively and is read via an electronic
              browser such as Netscape or Microsoft Explorer.  This electronic format invites
              the use of many novel tools that significantly enhance the learning experience
              and permits the book to adjust rapidly to advances in the field of molecular
              simulation, thereby precluding its obsolescence.    The work funded by this
              award is part of a broader project to weave molecular simulation into the
              undergraduate and graduate chemical engineering curricula at the University of
              Tennessee-Knoxville. This is important because molecular simulation is emerging
              as a practical tool of chemical manufacturers and consumers.
