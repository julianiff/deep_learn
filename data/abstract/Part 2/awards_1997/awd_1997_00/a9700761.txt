Abstract    :
              Gross 9700761  The principal investigator will continue his study of Calabi-Yau
              threefolds, which are complex threefolds with vanishing first Chern class.
              Various aspects of their geometry will be addressed.  He will continue
              developing tools of deformation theory in order to understand how various
              moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau threefolds interconnect.  These tools will also be
              applied to study the deformation theory of rational Gorenstein threefold
              singularities, which can give insights into four-dimensional birational
              geometry.  Calabi-Yau threefolds will also be considered in light of the
              recently proposed construction of Strominger, Yau, and Zaslow for mirror
              symmetry.  Among other issues this will involve studying the nature of special
              Lagrangian torus fibrations and the role that special Lagrangian submanifolds
              play in the geometry of Calabi-Yau manifolds.            This is research in
              the field of algebraic geometry.  Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest parts
              of modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the
              past quarter-century.  In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined
              in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays the field
              makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and
              conversely is finding application in those fields as well as in physics,
              theoretical computer science, and robotics.
