Abstract    :
              This research addresses combinatorial and algorithmic  problems related to
              searching and matching of strings and  slightly more complicated structures
              such as regular  expressions, arrays, trees and compounds thereof.  These 
              problems arise in a vast variety of applications, and their  impact is widely
              perceived as more and more crucial in  future information infrastructures, as
              unprecedented volumes  of information are increasingly amassed, disseminated
              and  shared.  A list would include the design of structures for  the efficient
              management of large repositories of strings,  arrays and special types of
              graphs, fundamental primitives  such as the various variants of exact and
              approximate  searching, specific applications such as the identification  of
              periodicities and other regularities, efficient  implementations of ancillary
              functions such as compression  and encoding of elementary discrete objects,
              etc.  The main  objective of this project is to abstract and clearly  identify
              these problems, develop new techniques and  efficient algorithms to solve them,
              both by serial and  parallel/distributed computation, and implement the new 
              algorithms.  This research represents a joint effort by two  teams having bases
              at Polytechnic University and Purdue  University, respectively.  These teams
              have marked  commonalities in backgrounds and complementary expertise in 
              highly specialized subareas of the field.
