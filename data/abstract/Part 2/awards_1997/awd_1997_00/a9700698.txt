Abstract    :
              9700698  Zehnder  A combined experimental and modeling study is being  conducted
              to characterize the frictional behavior of  tool-chip interface and to
              understand the relationship  between wear of the cutting tool and the dynamic 
              response of the too-workpiece system.  The experimental  observations include
              recording the dynamic temperature  variations near the tool-chip interface, the
              dynamic,  full-field surface deformations on both the chip and  the workpiece,
              and tool wear measurements.  The data  are used along with finite elements to
              develop models  to predict tool wear.  ***
