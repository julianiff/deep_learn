Abstract    :
                   This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic   Chemistry
              program funds research in the laboratory of Kenneth J. Balkus   at the
              Univesity of Texas at Dallas.  The objective is to prepare new   zeolite
              host-guest materials that would offer clear advantages in   catalytic and
              adsorption processes.  Work will contintue to exploit   occluding guest
              molecules into zeolites and other porous materials   through adsorption, ion
              exchange, complexation and templated intrazeolite   assembly.  Emphasis will be
              on the synthesis of the host matrix around   the guest molecule, which occludes
              as a well-defined species.   This   approach has already resulted in the
              discovery of the largest pore   zeolite known.  The focus will now turn to
              multidentate chelate complexes   such as phthalocyanines, polyamines,
              polyethers and Schiff base ligands.    Chiral functional groups will also be
              introduced in order to prepare   chiral host materials and to induce asymmetric
              catalysis.  New host-guest   materials will be evaluated for binding and
              activating small molecules,   such as molecular oxygen, hydrogen, nitric oxide,
              and olefins in   catalysis, separations and gas-sensing applications.       New
              materials will be prepared with spaces designed to hold   catalytically
              important molecules.  These materials hold the prospect of   functioning as
              asymmetric catalysts, chemical separators and sensors.
