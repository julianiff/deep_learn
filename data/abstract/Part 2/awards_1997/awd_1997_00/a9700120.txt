Abstract    :
              This project provides support for experimental equipment upgrading for
              structural control research at University of Notre Dame.  The new equipment to
              be purchased include a large capacity hydraulic actuator for full-scale
              component testing and new control hardware/software which will be dedicated to
              interdisciplinary research in engineering.  The equipment will be used to
              support current and future research efforts in active/hybrid, semi-active and
              passive control of structures for wind and earthquake hazard mitigation.  The
              large capacity actuator will allow for testing of full-scale control devices to
              demonstrate their scalability..  Such component testing is essential to the
              acceptance of new control technology by the profession.  In addition, new
              digital controllers are requested in support of the model testing on Notre
              Dame's seismic simulator.  Acquisition of this equipment is expected to
              accelerate development of control devices/strategies that are implementable in
              full-scale structures.
