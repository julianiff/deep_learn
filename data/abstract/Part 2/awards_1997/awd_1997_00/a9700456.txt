Abstract    :
              The GOALI industry-university collaborative research project  deals with
              simultaneous design of trajectory pattern tuned  computer controlled machinery
              for ultra-high speed and  accuracy applications such as lithography, bonding,
              and  inspection in the electronics industry as well as for the  production of
              high quality optical components instruments.  The mail goal of the project is
              to develop a trajectory-  pattern based, systematic methodology for
              simultaneous  design, optimization, and fine-tuning of all subsystems 
              (structure, actuator, control) of a computer controlled  machinery to achieve
              ultra-high performance for the classes  of specified tanks. The project also
              involves the detailed  design, construction, and system integration of a
              testbed  for high-performance machinery. The testbed will be used to  evaluate
              the effectiveness of the design methodology, the  performance of the
              constructed systems, its various  components and motion synthesis and control
              algorithms. By  designing and tuning system parameters for the actual 
              trajectory patterns that a high-performance machine is  required to perform,
              one can fully take advantage of the  interaction among the machine structure,
              the actuators, and  controllers to achieve ultra-high performance with 
              significant; cost savings. The multidisciplinary project is  to be carried out
              in a period of three years in  collaboration with three companies (Anorad
              Corporation,  Morgan Matroc Electro Ceramics Division, and OmniTek  Research
              Development, Inc.) with expertise ranging from  machine design, dynamics,
              control, design of passive and  active vibration damping elements, system
              integration, as  well as manufacturing of piezoceramic-based active 
              components. The project demonstrates how both universities  and manufacturing 
              and engineering  industry may benefit  from cooperative research in the
              development, application,  and integration of available and emerging
              technologies in  the field of optimal design and operation of ultra-high 
              performance production machinery.
