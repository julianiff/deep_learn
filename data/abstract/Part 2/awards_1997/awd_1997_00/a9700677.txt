Abstract    :
              9700677  Superfine  This project will synthesize, characterize and model
              nanotubes to understand their mechanical properties as they relate to nanometer
              scale mechanical devices and as components of composite materials. The elastic
              moduli will be measured using Atomic Force Microscopy to determine
              stress/strain relationships.  Particular attention will be paid to the failure
              modes of the tubes through the correlation of structural features and
              discontinuities in the determined moduli.  These studies will be performed on
              carbon and substituted nanotubes, filled tubes, and will be compared with
              molecular dynamics calculations.  The atomistic molecular dynamics simulations
              will be used to provide atomic scale insight into the forces which drive
              nanotube mechanical performance.  The project will begin the incorporation of
              nanotubes into mechanical device structures beginning with the simplest MEMS
              structure, a cantilever switch.  This will serve as a test bed for the
              interfacial effects which will play a critical role in the operation of a
              nanometer scale structure.  Both the characterization of the nanotubes and the
              production of prototype devices will be made possible by a unique, advanced
              interface for AFM, the nanoManipulator, which permits facile manipulation while
              measuring the normal and lateral forces exerted on the object.  ***
