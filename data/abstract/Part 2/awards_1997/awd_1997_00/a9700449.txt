Abstract    :
              Ravi-Chandar  9700449  The University of Houston proposes a three-year effort
              aimed  at investigating the phenomenon of dynamic shear banding and  shear   
              fracture   in   ductile   polymers,    specifically  polycarbonate.   It  is
              proposed to perform  experiments  to  characterize the high strain-rate
              thermomechanical  behavior  of  polycarbonate, to study shear banding and shear
               failure  and  the associated failure mode transitions, and to compare  these 
              with experiments on the metallic materials  that  are  known  to  exhibit  a 
              similar  behavior.   Split  Hopkinson  pressure  bar and torsion bar
              experiments will  be  used  to  characterize the high strain rate constitutive 
              behavior  of  polycarbonate;   high   speed  photography   combined   with 
              photoelasticity and high speed photomicrography will be used  to investigate
              the mechanics and mechanisms of shear banding  and failure mode transitions;
              temperature measurements using  high  speed  infrared detectors will be used to
              examine  the  role  of  temperature on the onset and growth of  the  shear 
              banding localization.  Similar experiments will be performed  in   a   metallic
                material  that   also   exhibits   shear  banding/shear failure mode
              transitions for comparison.  This  basic  research will lead to a better
              understanding  of  the  mechanisms  and mechanics of shear banding and failure 
              mode  transitions  in  ductile polymers.  If the reasons  for  the 
              similarities  between the observed behavior of polycarbonate  and  some
              metallic materials are understood, this work  will  provide  insight  into
              shear banding  in  a  wide  range  of  materials.   The  effect of superimposed
              static  loading  or  displacement  constraints on failure mode transitions 
              could  have  significant technological implications for the  design  of 
              structures resistant to impact damage and is proposed to  be investigated.
