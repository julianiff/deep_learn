Abstract    :
              9700973  Trumper   Many industrial operations center on the processing of an
              elongated element moving axially through successive functional stations.  In
              these processes it may be advantageous to be able to handle the product without
              directly touching it.  The classes of materials which can be acted on with
              magnetic or electric forces without contact are addressed.  This research is
              aimed to develop a general theory for electric and magnetic suspensions
              applicable to noncontact processing and experimentally verify the developed
              theory.  The associated control theory, dynamic analyses, sensors and actuators
              which are needed to implement this new technology will also be developed.  
              Noncontact processing provides many advantages for handling of materials that
              involve axial movements.  The development of noncontact processing of materials
              via magnetic or electric suspension holds promise for future material handling
              and processing.  Theoretical development of this new technology and its
              experimental verification are essential to advancing the existing
              state-of-the-art for this kind of equipment.
