Abstract    :
                 ECS-9700334  Ghosh    The proposed equipment's would mainly support research
              in the Laboratory for Visionics.  The equipment's would mainly be used for low
              level image processing, specifically in analyzing sequence of images o three
              dimensional indoor or natural scenes for the purpose of navigation, obstacle
              avoidance, target tracking an motion estimation.   The laboratory is presently
              equipped with an INTELLEDEX 386 Vision System and is being used to the limits
              of its capability.  The proposed MAXSPARC system would be used for visual
              processing in the closed loop with feedback to the Motion Planner and Robot
              Controller.
