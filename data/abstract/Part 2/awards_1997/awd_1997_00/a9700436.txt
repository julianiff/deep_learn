Abstract    :
                9700436  Pritchett    The workshop will be conducted in five working groups
              who  will address the following topics:    1.   How do we go from incremental
              to break-through    research?  2.   What are creative processes to form and
              identify  research opportunities?  3.   How to address industrial, general
              building and  infrastructure sectors?  4.   How can the engineering and
              construction industry learn  from research?  5.   How do we use what we know
              about people to achieve  results?    Attendees will address issues related to
              the five listed  topics in an open format that promotes creative thinking and 
              innovative approaches to produce research results of future  benefit to the
              engineering and construction industry.
