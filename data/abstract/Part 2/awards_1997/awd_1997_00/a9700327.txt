Abstract    :
              Tong  9700327       The  Departments of Mechanical Engineering,  Electrical 
              Engineering,  and  Chemical Engineering at  Yale  University  will  purchase  a
               high  performance,  low  vacuum  scanning  electron  microscope equipped with
              instrumented thermal  and  mechanical  loading stages.  This system  will 
              provide  new  engineering    research    capabilities    and     education 
              opportunities currently unavailable at Yale and will be used  primarily  to 
              support  research  projects  in  science  and  engineering, including in
              particular,           Thin film coatings and surface roughening of aluminum    
                  alloys-,         Thermal    fatigue   reliability   and    micro-level     
                 constitutive description of solder joints;         Reliable   
              metallizations   for   high   temperature         semiconductor devices;       
               Non-mean-field description of grain growth-,         Ferroelectric   thin  
              films  for   applications   in         microelectronics;         Atomic-scale 
              mechanisms of metal  etching  reactions         determined   by   high-speed  
              variable   temperature         scanning tunneling microscopy.         The  
              equipment  will  also  enhance  the  quality   of  engineering   teaching  and 
              broaden  the  scope   of   many  engineering  courses at Yale, including 
              Materials  Science,  Microstructural   Development   in   Materials,  
              Mechanical  Behavior  of Materials, several materials related laboratory 
              sessions, and undergraduate senior research projects.
