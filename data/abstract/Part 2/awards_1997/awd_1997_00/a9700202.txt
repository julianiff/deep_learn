Abstract    :
              9700202  Sailor  This  proposal is aimed at developing the surface  chemistry 
              of  silicon, and on obtaining a fundamental understanding of  the  radiative 
              and  nonradiative  processes  available   to  luminescent nanocrystalline
              silicon ("porous silicon").  Two  major  areas  will  be emphasized:  the 
              study  of  chemical  transformations, and the study of physisorption processes
              at  porous silicon surfaces.  %%%  The proposed work will advance our
              fundamental understanding  of  the  relationship  between surface species  and 
              carrier  dynamics  in porous silicon.  It will aid in the  design  of  specific
              chemical sensors based on modulation of the optical  properties of porous
              silicon, which will help in the  design  of stable luminescent devices or
              chemical sensors.  ***
