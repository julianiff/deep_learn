Abstract    :
              9700632  Jackson  This project is funded by the Divisions of Materials 
              Research, Chemistry and Physics.  The funds will be used to  partially support
              a symposium to celebrate the centennial of  the discovery of the electron to be
              held at Central Michigan  University on April 9, 1997.  The symposium will
              feature  four distinguished speakers who will address various aspects  of the
              impact of the electron on science and technology, as  well as prospects for the
              future.  The symposium will be  broadcast live via satellite to high schools
              and colleges  nationwide.  Instructional materials that address the  content of
              the symposium will be developed in a separate  project and distributed to high
              school teachers.  %%%   This project is funded by the Divisions of Materials
