Abstract    :
              9700876  Baum   Graduate student Barbara Whitlock, under the direction of Dr.
              David Baum of Harvard University, is studying the neotropical plant genus
              Theobroma, the source of cocoa or chocolate, and its relatives of the tribe
              Byttnerieae of the Sterculiaceae family, for taxonomic and phylogenetic
              purposes. New collections in Central and South America will augment herbarium
              materials, and help improve understanding of morphological and geographic
              variation in the group. New molecular biology evidence is being gathered, from
              DNA sequencing of a chloroplast gene and of a nuclear gene, vicilinA, suspected
              to be involved in the flavor biochemistry of cocoa. The DNA data will be used
              to infer a phylogenetic tree for the c. 22 species of Theobroma and its close
              relatives. In turn, that genealogical perspective will guide further study of
              the origins of cauliflory in this and related genera, the formation of flowers
              (and fruits after pollination) along the trunk and main stems of the plant, as
              in Theobroma cacao, the commercial source of chocolate.   Despite the
              commercial importance of cultivated cocoa, the taxonomy and phylogeny of the
              several species of Theobroma are not well studied, and new molecular methods
              applied to herbarium and freshly collected specimens will help improve
              classification and develop a phylogeny for the group. That knowledge will then
              help guide studies of the genetic and ecological factors affecting the
              evolution of cauliflory in tropical plants.
