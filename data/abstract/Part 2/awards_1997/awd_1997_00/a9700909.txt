              ABSTRACT,  MASON 97-00909       Abstract : PI will investigate the mathematical
              foundations of the theory  of vertex operator algebras, their automorphism
              groups and representation  theory, and related questions in the cohomology of
              groups and algebras and  in the theory of modular forms. Techniques are based
              on past work of the PI  and collaborators on the foundations of algebraic
              conformal field theory,  including the theory of Zhu's associative algebras,
              quantum Galois theory,  existence and modular-invariance of twisted sectors,
              and a cohomological  theory of discrete torsion and Dijkgraaf-Witten cocycles. 
                  In recent years, mathematicians and physicists alike have been developing 
              conformal field theory, which incorporates infinite-dimensional symmetry,  in
              order to understand certain critical phenomena and also (via string  theory)
              the first rigorous approach to quantum gravity. This effort is a  highly
              intensive mathematical endeavour, and the PI will investigate a  number of new
              phenomena in abstract algebra which are part of this program.  So-called vertex
              operator algebras constitute a rigorous mathematical  axiomatization of some of
              the main ideas of conformal field theory, and the  PI will continue his
              research into the symmetries inherent in these very  complicated objects in
              order to solidify the foundations of the subject and  to uncover new phenomena.
