Abstract    :
              9700209  Cieliebak    This project lies in the area of symplectic topology with
              an emphasis on symplectic manifolds with boundary. Specifically, the
              investigator wishes to give a geometric interpretation of Gromov's squeezing
              theorem and to obtain new results about the structure of Hamiltonian flows on
              3-dimensional manifolds.    Symplectic manifolds are curved spaces admitting a
              structure akin to that possessed by complex Euclidean space. Symplectic
              manifolds have applications in mechanics as well as other parts of mathematics
              including complex geometry. In Hamiltonian theory of mechanical systems for
              example, the use of symplectic manifolds results in certain conceptual as well
              as computational simplifications.
