Abstract    :
              EEC-9700568  Hendrickson    ABSTRACT    This award provides funding to Carnegie
              Mellon University   under the direction of Dr. Chris Hendrickson, for the
              support of a Combined Research-Curriculum Development project entitled,
              "Curriculum and Educational Materials for Environmentally Conscious, Green
              Products and Processes." This project's goals are to develop a series of
              project and topic modules on green design and manufacturing that would be
              tested in the classroom and documented in a manner to permit widespread
              dissemination and adoption.  The modules developed can be inserted in
              conventional design and environmental courses within several engineering
              disciplines, including Chemical, Civil, Electrical, Computer, Environmental,
              and Mechanical Engineering.  Several modules will also be developed suitable
              for business, history or society/technology courses.  Research results obtained
              from an on-going collaborative research effort in green design supported by
              several industrial partners and Federal agencies will be integrated into the
              curriculum.
