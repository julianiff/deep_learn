Abstract    :
              EEC-9700705      ABSTRACT    This award provides funding to the University of
              Washington, under the direction of Dr. Minoru Taya, for the support of a
              Combined Research-Curriculum Development project entitled, "Electronic
              Packaging and Materials."  This project's goals are to establish an
              interdisciplinary research-curriculum on electronic packaging and materials
              (EPM) at the University of Washington.  A curriculum of four courses with
              materials supplemented by new research results will be designed for teaching
              advanced undergraduate and first-year graduate students as well as engineers
              from local and regional industries as a part of the existing Televised
              Instruction in Engineering (TIE) system.
