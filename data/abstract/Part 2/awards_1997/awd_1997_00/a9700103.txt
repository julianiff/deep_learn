Abstract    :
              DMI-9700103  Wu  The metal forming process, including sheet metal forming, is
              still heavily dependent upon experience-based and trial-and-error techniques.  
              To improve the efficiency of metal forming process, analytical techniques are
              required to advanced the predictive capabilities of engineering design tools.
              The focal point of the proposed analytical techniques ties in the scientific
              understanding of the basic deformation process and its mechanics.  The study
              will result in an effective formulation that can realistically describe the
              deformation of metal forming.  The effort will be devoted to the development of
              a unified theory of anisotropic plasticity that is realistic in industrial
              applications.  Topics to be investigated include a quadratic yield function,
              kinematic hardening, the plastic strain ratio, deformation of sheet metals and
              torsion of a thin-walled tube. This collaborative research project is a joint
              effort between the University of Iowa and Alcoa.  The study will be carried out
              by use of theory and experiment.  This study is the first step toward a
              comprehensive, high-powered computer simulation and design of metal forming and
              holds significant potential for development.    This collaborative research
              project has a balance between theory  and experiment, and will provide valuable
              findings for the automotive manufacturing and Aluminum manufacturing
              industries.
