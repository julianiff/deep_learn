Abstract    :
              This project covers the construction and testing of a large scale five-story
              precast superassemblage under simulated seismic loading.  The purpose of the
              project is to provide a realistic vehicle for verifying structural  concepts,
              design methodology and analytical procedures developed in NSF research
              initiative `precast and prestresses seismic structural systems` (PRESSS) Phases
              1 and 11, and to evaluate the seismic performance of precast designs in terms
              of reduced damage and residual deformation compared with conventionally
              reinforced buildings.  The project forms the key element of PRESSS Phase III,
              in accordance with the original PRESSS master plan.  The structure will consist
              of five stories, with a two-bay by two-bay plan.  In one direction the lateral
              bracing will be provided by precast walls, and in the other direction, by
              precast frames, enabling different structural systems to be tested in
              orthogonal directions.  Different precast flooring systems will be adopted at
              different levels to investigate diaphragm action and frame-floor connection
              details.  Design will be in accordance with direct-displacement seismic design
              procedures developed as part of the earlier PRESSS phases.  Testing will
              primarily be under a multi-degree-of-freedom pseudo-dynamic testing procedure
              developed earlier for a five-story masonry building.  Sequential time-histories
              chosen to exercise the building to a series of limit states including (1)
              first-cracking, (2) first yield, (3) serviceability limit, (4) damage control,
              and (5) incipient collapse, will be applied to the structure.  Results from the
              experiment will be used to finalize design recommendations from the PRESSS
              project.  The five-story superassemblage test has extremely strong industry
              support, with more than 60% of the necessary cost being provided by the precast
              industry.
