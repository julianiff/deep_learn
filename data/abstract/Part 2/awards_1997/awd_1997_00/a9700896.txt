Abstract    :
              Raskind 9700896  This award supports work on the theory of algebraic cycles on
              algebraic varieties over p-adically complete fields and over algebraic number
              fields.  The principal investigator will define and study p-adic intermediate
              Jacobians for algebraic varieties over a p-adically complete field which have a
              p-adic uniformization.  It is expected that these will be fundamental tools in
              the theory.  He will also study higher obstructions to the Hasse principle for
              varieties over algebraic number fields.  The theory of algebraic cycles is part
              of algebraic geometry, which is the study of solutions to systems of polynomial
              equations.  This is one of the oldest fields in mathematics, but it has
              experienced an explosion of new ideas and fundamental theorems over the past
              thirty years.  Also, new applications of the theory have been found to coding
              theory, cryptography and engineering.
