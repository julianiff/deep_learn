Abstract    :
              Wainwright  9700758         The proposed dissertation research will investigate
              the  convergent evolution of pharyngeal jaw molluse crushing in  teleost
              fishes.  Five groups of percomorph fishes will be  studied to determine whether
              the same suite of functional,  morphological, and physiological modifications
              underlie this  trophic specialization in such case.  An integrative  approach
              will be used to compare the molluse crushing  capacity of the pharyngeal jaw
              apparatus in molluscivores  and closely related generalist predators: 1)
              Functional  Morphology; comparison of the pharyngeal jaw mechanism  including
              mesurements of the musculoskeletal  system,  electromyography, and in vivo
              stimulation experiments, 2)  Physiology; biochemical assays will determine the 
              physiological  nature of the muscles will be measured in the  laboratory.      
              The significance of this research will be threefold.  First, it will reveal the
              relationships among different  levels of organismal design and performance in
              the repeated  evolution of a novel feeding behavior.  Secold, it will  increase
              our understanding of how rigorously the physical  demands of mollusc crushing
              constrained the evolutionary  modification of the teleost pharyngeal jaw
              apparatus in  multiple origins of this behavior.  Third, this research  will
              elucidate presumed musculoskeletal adaptations for  pharyngeal mollusc crushing
              by testing hypothesis of  convergence among several teleost  lineages.
