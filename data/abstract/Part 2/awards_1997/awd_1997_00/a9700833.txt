Abstract    :
              Michael Tubergen of Kent State University is supported by the   Experimental
              Physical Chemistry Program in his studies to determine the   conformational
              structures of amide derivatives of amino acids using   Fourier-transform
              microwave spectroscopy.  Isotopic substitution   (deuterium, nitrogen-15 or
              carbon-13 in natural abundance) will be used   to identify the hydrogen atoms
              participating in intramolecular hydrogen   bonds as well as to characterize the
              conformation.  The structures of   solvent van der Waals complexes with these
              same molecules will also be   examined, especially complexes involving water
              and model dipeptides.     The results of this research should lead to improved
              modeling of larger   biological molecules.    The education plan of this CAREER
              award involves extensive revisions of   the undergraduate physical chemistry
              program.  Modifications, such as   incorporation of laser-based experiments and
              multidimensional nuclear   magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the laboratory
              sequence will introduce   students to modern spectroscopic techniques.  An
              aggressive community   outreach effort and a focus on research projects
              accessible to   undergraduates will be emphasized.
