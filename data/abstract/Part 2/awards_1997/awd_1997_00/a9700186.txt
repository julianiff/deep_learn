Abstract    :
              9700186    This research will develop an understanding of the role of 
              geomembrane surface roughness on interface behavior.  Through a comprehensive
              experimental program using the  recently developed and implemented Optical
              Profile  Microscopy technique to provide quantitative measures of  geomembrane
              surface roughness, it is expected to provide a  more rational basis for
              selecting design parameters and  predicting the long-term behavior of composite
              systems with  geomembrane interfaces.  A custom interface shear apparatus  will
              be made for this research, and testing will include  measurements of the
              distribution of local void ratio in the  interface region using a recently
              developed resin  impregnation - image analysis procedure to provide insight 
              into fabric and porosity evolution during shearing.    The experimental studies
              will be complemented with  appropriate analytical studies.  The quantitative
              measures  of geomembrane surface roughness and local void ratio  distribution
              in the interface region will permit the  interface strength behavior to be
              examined within the  context of state.  Within this unifying frame
              understanding,  it is expected that small changes in state as shearing 
              progresses can be related to the physical characteristics of  the geomembrane
              surface.  Numerical simulations will be  performed to study a range of
              interface conditions and  explore optimal roughness designs for mobilizing
              interface  shear.  ***
