              Research Instrumentation:  A Robot System for Contour Grinding of Objects with
              Complex Spatial Forms    The award supports the purchase of a robot system
              consisting of a robot manipulator and its controlling computer system. The
              equipment will be used for several research projects, including in particular  
               - robotic variable-axis contour grinding,    - robotic variable-axis
              curvilinear feature grinding,    - robotic polishing of objects with complex
              spatial forms, and    - programming robots to perform spatially complex tasks
              using spatial impedance control, an  intuitive Euclidean-geometric version of
              impedance control well suited for compliant motion  control of articulated
              robots interacting with other spatial systems.     These projects are all in
              the more general area of CAD-oriented robot control, where the robot software  
              interface is designed so that it is easier to use spatial geometric information
              about bodies in the environment available from CAD models. Each of these
              projects requires a robot with at least six degrees-of-freedom.     This
              research will make it easier to program robots to perform spatially complex
              tasks involving mechanical interaction with objects in the environment.
