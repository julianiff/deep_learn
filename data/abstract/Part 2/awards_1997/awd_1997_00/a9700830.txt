Abstract    :
              9700830  Schlesinger  This project, centered around the Free-Air Carbon dioxide
              Enrichment (FACE)  experiment in the Duke Forest of central North Carolina, is
              designed to elucidate changes in  soil carbon dynamics in response to an
              ecosystem-level atmospheric CO2 enrichment. In  reaching this objective, the
              research proposed here is intended to address questions  surrounding
              process-level understanding of soil function and its link with the atmosphere 
              and groundwater. Fluxes of carbon into and out of the soil system, as well as
              transfers and  storage within the soil profile, will be examined. Importantly,
              the study will capitalize on  the use of stable carbon isotope (C-13) tracers
              that will be introduced into the atmosphere  of the FACE plot with the CO2
              enrichment. This isotope tracer will allow the examination  of the rate of
              carbon incorporation into soil organic matter, the effect of soil acidity on 
              weathering rates, and the potential of a long-term atmospheric carbon sink in
              soils and  groundwater. This research is of particular interest and importance
              to global change  scientists and policy-makers interested in the "missing
              sink", soil scientists examining  carbon dynamics, and geochemists interested
              in the extent of biotic control over chemical  weathering.
