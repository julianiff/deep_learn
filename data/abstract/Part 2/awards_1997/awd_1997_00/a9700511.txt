Abstract    :
                9700511  Cleary  This well integrated Research for Undergraduate Institutions 
              (RUI)  proposal advances education and research by involving  undergraduate
              students in a study of  the synthesis of   new  transition  metal based
              materials and their characterization  with  respect  to  structure,  chemical 
              composition,  phase  transitions, and second harmonic generation efficiency. 
              The  educational benefit of this project will be derived from the 
              undergraduate chemistry training to better reflect important  scientific and
              technological issues facing society.  %%%  The materials to be synthesized and
              characterized constitute  a  new  class of layered materials with potential
              uses  that  included electro-optic devices and frequency mixing devices.  These
                device   materials   therefore   are   relevant   to  applications areas such
              as optical data storage and  optical  communications  technologies,  making 
              possible  educational  benefits  that  lead  to  a  better  understanding  at  
              the  undergraduate   level  of  education   of   scientific   and 
              technological issues facing society.  ***
