Abstract    :
                      1              9700662  Lee  This  project involves a systematic
              exploration of the  molecular  basis  for wetting, adhesion and friction in
              fluorinated  organic  thin  films, with an emphasis on the development of new
              types  of  mixed  hydrocarbon/fluorocarbon-based materials. There are  three 
              research  thrusts:  (1)  the synthesis of several  new  types  of  alkanethiols
               for  the  purpose of  assembling  structurally  and  chemically well defined
              hydrocarbon/fluorocarcon thin films;  (2)  structural  characterization of the
              newly generated  thin  films;  (3)   a  thorough  examination  of  the 
              properties  of  wetting,  adhesion, and friction in these systems.  %%%  A 
              thorough  understanding of the relationships  between  surface 
              structure/composition and interfacial properties,  this  research  will  pave 
              the  way  for  designing new and  better  fluorinated  interfaces for use in a
              wide variety of technologies ranging from  biomedical implants to information
              storage and retrieval.  ***
