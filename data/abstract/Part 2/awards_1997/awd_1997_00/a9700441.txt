Abstract    :
                This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at Cornell University to acquire a
              Siemen's SMART X-ray  diffractometer equipped with a CCD detector.This
              equipment will enhance research in a number  of areas including the following:
              (1) natural products, (2) novel solid state compounds, (3) X-ray 
              crystallographic studies of purine and pyrimidine nucleoside analogs, (4)
              application of X-ray  crystallographic to chemical ecology, (5)
              biologically-inspired advanced materials, and (6) metal  organic chemistry.    
               The X-ray diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise measurements of
              the full three  dimensional structure of a molecule. The information obtained
              gives the precise values of all the  bond distances and bond angles of a given
              molecule and it gives accurate information about the  spatial arrangement of
              the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.
