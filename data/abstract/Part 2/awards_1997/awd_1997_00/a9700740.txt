Abstract    :
              SCHWARZ.abs        This  project concerns  three topics:1) (joint with L.
              Helminck) Commuting involutions of a reductive group and properties of the
              associated fixed point groups, double coset spaces and invariants. 2) (joint
              with D. Wehlau) The  invariants of four subspaces of  n-dimensional space. 3)
              The structure of differential operators which are invariant under a  group, 
              those which are defined on the orbit spaces of the group and the  interplay
              between them.      Invariant theory: If one has an object with symmetries (for
              example, the  Euclidean plane with translations and rotations), one is
              naturally lead to  consider those properties of the object (the invariants)
              which remain the  same under these symmetries. Invariant theory is concerned
              with the  classification, description, etc. of invariants.
