Abstract    :
                      9700474  Rapinchuk      This award provides funding for a continuing of
              the congruence subgroup problem for S-arithmetic subgroups of linear algebraic
              groups over number fields. The principal investigator will attempt to prove the
              centrality of the congruence kernel for some new classes of groups using a
              variety of techniques such as different boundedness conditions (bounded
              generation and similar properties), methods of representation theory (property
              (T) of Kazhdan), etc. He will also study the properties of groups having finite
              representation type and the representation varieties of some finitely generated
              groups.       This research falls into the general mathematical field of Number
              Theory.  Number Theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole
              numbers,  addressing such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of
              one  whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics
              and  was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However,
              within  the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse 
              applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and 
              communication systems.
