Abstract    :
              This project focuses on three problem areas in the theory of  computational
              complexity.  The first part aims at showing  that in the context of
              computations which operate in limited  work space, the use of randomness does
              not significantly  increase computational power, with the goal of increasing 
              our overall knowledge about the role of randomness as a tool  in computation. 
              The second part aims at ascertaining the  computational limitations of small
              boolean circuits, with  the goal of better understanding the aspects of 
              computational problems that require more computational  resources.  The last
              part aims at improving the best known  algorithms for exact solution of the
              fundamental graph  coloring problem, with the larger goal of developing tools 
              that may be more broadly applicable to speeding up wider  classes of hard
              computational problems.***
