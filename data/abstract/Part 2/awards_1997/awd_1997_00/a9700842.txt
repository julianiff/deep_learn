Abstract    :

               ABSTRACT      Seven invited speakers from the U.S. will be provided partial
              support to attend the International Conference on Advances in Chemical
              Engineering, to be held at ITT, Madras on December 11-13, 1996.  The conference
              is organized by a national committee, with advice from an International
              Scientific Advisory Committee.   This is the first conference of this type to
              be held in Madras, although a similar Chemical Engineering conference was held
              in Bangalore about ten years ago.    The conference possesses several unique
              features: (a) an opportunity to discuss and learn about the most recent
              scientific and technological advances in a broad range of areas of chemical
              engineering, particularly areas of current importance in Asia and Europe; (b)
              there will be an industrial session, with several keynote speakers and other
              presentations on R&D and  New Technologies; ( c ) coverage of applied, as well
              as fundamental, aspects; (d ) discussions of recent and future trends in
              chemical engineering education with leading educators from India, Japan and
              Europe.
