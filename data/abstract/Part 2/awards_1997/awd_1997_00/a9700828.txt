               SUNY-Binghamton    CRCD:  High Speed Local Area Networks:  Systems and
              Application    Technological advances in microelectronics have made it possible
              to implement low latency and high bandwidth links for local area networks
              (LANS) but this does not automatically translate into high speed communication
              at the application level.  Bottlenecks arise due to the protocol stack,
              operating system and the I/O-network-memory subsystem.  It is also necessary to
              understand how novel applications make use of tight coupling and how mobile
              applications exploit the capabilities of high speed LANs for their computing
              needs.    This award will help to develop a two-semester course sequence, with
              appropriate laboratory exercises, that integrates into the curriculum new
              results relating to the design, implementation and use of high speed LANs.  In
              the traditional computer science and engineering curricula, the requisite
              information is only partially covered in a number of separate courses, making
              it difficult to understand the tradeoffs in the systems and applications
              design.    The main thrust in this project  will be to abstract out and convey
              the key concepts, reinforcing them with a series of laboratory exercises that
              involve the design of key hardware and software systems components that lead to
              a full working high speed LAN supporting one or more targeted applications. 
              Relevant topic will be gleaned from recent advances in the industry as well as
              the recent research literature.
