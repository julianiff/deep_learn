Abstract    :
                  9700916  Alstad  In natural populations, disease spread is likely to be
              affected by ecological, environmental, and genetic factors.  Many groups of
              animals have seasonal migrations,  which may strongly affect host-parasite
              interactions.  This research examines interactions between monarch butterflies,
              Danaus plexippus, and an obligate protozoan parasite, Ophryocystis
              elektroscirrha.  Three populations of North American monarchs exhibit varying
              degrees of migratory behavior, providing a unique opportunity to examine how
              geographic variation in disease prevalence relates to host movement patterns. 
              For these populations, disease incidence is inversely related to host migratory
              distance.  A non-migratory population in southern Florida shows 100% infection,
              the western migratory population is 60% infected, and the eastern migratory
              population, which travels the farthest distance, is less than 10% infected.
              This study will examine how population variation in disease prevalence is
              affected by host movement behavior, environmental differences between sites,
              and genetic factors related to host susceptibility or pathogen virulence.   
              This study will produce data important for the conservation of monarchs, which
              have been threatened in recent years by habitat destruction at many
              overwintering sites.  It will also improve understanding of how parasites
              interact with their hosts.
