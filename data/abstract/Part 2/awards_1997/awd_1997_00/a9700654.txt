Abstract    :
              EEC-9700654  Shannon      Abstract      This award provides funding to the
              University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK), under the direction of Dr. Thomas
              Shannon, for the support of a Combined Research-Curriculum Development project
              entitled, "Combined Research-Curriculum Development on Maintenance and
              Reliability Engineering."   This project's goals are to focus on the
              incorporation of the latest developments in Maintenance and Reliability
              Engineering  (MRE) into a well-structured academic program.  New courses to be
              developed will strengthen the MRE certification program that involves course
              work, industrial experience and research. These courses are: 1. Introduction to
              maintenance engineering;   2. Maintenance planning, management and performance
              evaluation; 3. Machinery condition monitoring and diagnosis; and 4) Reliability
              and life prediction technology.  The CRCD program will be managed by the
              Maintenance and Reliability Center (MRC), which was formed by the UTK Colleges
              of Engineering and Business Administration to broaden the MRE academic and
              research capability.
