Abstract    :
              The goals of this research project are: (1) to build computer-based mathematical
              models that explicitly incorporate the assemble-to-order nature of a system;
              and given a fixed model, (2) to develop efficient computational procedures for
              evaluating order-based performance measures under any given inventory-control
              policy, and (3) to explore the form of the optimal policy in the order-based
              sense.  The research will consist of modeling, mathematical analysis, and
              computation.  The basic methodologies underlying the approaches include the
              analysis of multivariate stochastic processes, dynamic programming, and the
              stochastic comparison techniques, especially those based on notions of
              correlations of random variables.  The analyses and results of the
              investigation will contribute to the understanding of the intricate
              relationships underlying the system and therefore will provide constructive
              suggestions on how to manage such systems effectively.  This, in turn, will
              enable manufacturers and distributors to respond more quickly to customer needs
              at lower cost.
