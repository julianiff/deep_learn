Abstract    :
                RESHETIKHIN      The main theme of this proposal is the study of quantized 
              universal enveloping algebras, their representations and their applications  to
              low dimensional topology and to quantum integrable models.  Among specific
              goals of the proposal are: q-W algebras their  quantization and their role in
              the representation theory of   quantum affine algebras, the duality aspects for
              q-W algebras,  tau- functions as spherical functions on Poisson Lie groups  and
              their quantization, various aspects of interrelations  between quantum and
              classical integrable systems and representation theory.      Recent decades
              were characterized by intense and productive  interaction of mathematics and
              physics. Large part of this  process was initiated in the study of classical
              and quantum  integrable systems and developed from there to various  questions
              related to conformal field theory and to  a very productive developments in the
              string theory.  On the mathematical side of this interaction are  various
              aspects of algebra, geometry and topology.  My research is focused mostly on
              the study of algebraic   structures resulted from this interaction and inspired
                by it. They are remarkable not only because they are  quite exceptional but
              also because they have   important applications ranging from low dimensional
              topology and geometry  to solid state physics.
