Abstract    :
              Stembridge  9700787    The proposer intends to continue his research into the
              applications of combinatorial methods to algebraic problems, and conversely,
              the use of algebraic methods in combinatorial enumeration.  The specific topics
              include the study of pattern avoidance and enumeration of reduced expressions
              in Coxeter groups, permutation characters arising in the cohomology of the
              toric variety of a Weyl chamber, use of the group algebra of the symmetric
              group to study immanant inequalities, and the study of generating functions for
              generalized tableaux associated with partially ordered sets.  In addition, the
              proposer intends to continue developing free software to assist research in
              these areas, and in particular, to develop a new version of a package for
              working with root systems, Coxeter groups, and characters of semisimple Lie
              algebras.      This research is in the general area of Combinatorics. One of
              the goals of Combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how
              discrete collections of objects can be arranged.  The behavior of discrete
              systems is extremely important to modern communications.  For example, the
              design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the
              design of algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of objects,
              and this makes use of combinatorial research.
