Abstract    :
                9700735  Dodziuk    In 1983, Daniel Gorenstein announced the completion of a
              major mathematical undertaking: the Classification of the Finite Simple Groups.
               In that same year Gorenstein and Richard Lyons of Rutgers University launched
              a project to write a coherent and largely self-contained proof of the
              classification theorem.  By a combination of new ideas and improved
              organization the goal was to refine the existing 15,000 pages of journal
              articles down to a more readable 5,000 page proof.  Publication of the series
              by the American Mathematics Society began in 1994 and two volumes have appeared
              to date. Recent exciting developments have accelerated the pace of activity in
              this field. This award supports a conference in which the principal players as
              well as young researchers can meet and chart the road map for future
              developments.    A group is an algebraic system  with a single operation 
              obeying certain laws. Examples of  groups are found everywhere in nature and
              their study has important applications to physics, chemistry , biology and
              communications. The finite simple groups are the fundamental  building blocks
              of groups.
