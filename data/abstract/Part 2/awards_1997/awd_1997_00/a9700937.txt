Abstract    :
                        Agboola  9700937      This award will fund research on two topics in
              arithmetic algebraic geometry. The first is concerned with Iwasawa  theory and
              L-functions. The PI will study new approaches to the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer
              conjecture and the theory of p-adic L-functions. These  approaches have their
              origins in the theory of arithmetic Galois module structure,  and they lead to
              new ways of studying the Iwasawa theory of abelian varieties and  p-adic
              representations. The second topic deals with equivariant algebraic geometry 
              and the K-theory of higher dimensional varieties over finite fields. The PI
              will  study reduced Grothendieck groups of equivariant vector bundles on
              varieties. He will  develop the geometry of locally free class groups in
              positive characteristic, and he  will explore connections with
              higher-dimensional class field theory and crystalline  cohomology.         The
              research described in this proposal lies in the field of arithmetic algebraic 
              geometry. This is a subject that blends two of the oldest branches of 
              mathematics---number theory and geometry---and which has blossomed to the point
               where it has solved problems that have stood for centuries. It finds
              applications in  fields as diverse as physics, robotics, data processing and
              information theory.
