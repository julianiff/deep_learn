Abstract    :
              This award provides supplemental funding for the First IEEE Signal Processing 
              Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communication (SPAWC) to be 
              held at La Villette, Paris, France, April 16-18, 1997.  This workshop is 
              organized by Professors Lang Tong, Georgios Giannakis and Jean-Francois
              Cardoso.   The objective of this workshop is threefold: (1) to present the most
              recent  research results in the area of signal processing applications in
              wireless  communications; (2) to provide a forum for exchanging ideas on
              current trends and  future research directions; (3) to encourage
              cross-fertilization of ideas between  signal processing and communications
              communities, and between academia and  industry.    The scope of the workshop
              includes the following key areas in wireless  communications where advanced
              signal processing techniques are making significant  impact: Array Signal
              Processing in Wireless Communications; Signal Separation,  Channel Estimation
              and Equalization; Detection and Estimation in Wireless  Systems; Modeling of
              Wireless Channels; Multi-user Wireless Communications: DDMA,  TDMA, FDMA;
              Synchronization and Tracking; Mobile, PCS and Indoor Systems;  Underwater and
              Satellite Communication Systems, and, Performance Analysis and  Experimental
              Results.
