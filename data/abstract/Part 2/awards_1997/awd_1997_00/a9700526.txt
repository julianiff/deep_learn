Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry  
              Program continues support for research on homogeneous catalysis by Dr.   George
              G. Stanley of the Chemistry Department, Louisiana State   University.  The goal
              of the work is to understand cooperativity in   bimetallic catalysis by
              studying a dirhodium complex that is active and   selective in
              hydroformylation.  This dicationic complex contains a   binucleating
              tetraphosphine ligand.  The nature of the binding site will   be elucidated
              with the aid of molecular modeling, in addition to   experimental approaches,
              including kinetic, spectroscopic and isotopic   labeling studies.  The results
              will be used to make improvements in the   regio- and enantioselectivty of the
              catalyst.  After this stage of the   research, attempts will be made to extend
              bimetallic cooperativity to   other catalytic reactions, such as
              hydrosilylation, silylformylation,   hydrocyanation, and C-C bond coupling
              reactions with alkenes and alkynes.  In some catalytic systems, the cooperative
              action of two different metal   sites has been suggested to be effective in
              promoting reactions not only   more quickly, but also shape-specifically.  In
              this project, the   potential of cooperativity in catalyst design will be
              determined.  The   ability to control reaction rates and products is very
              important in many   areas of chemical manufacturing, such as production of 
              pharmaceuticals,   polymers, and fine chemicals.
