Abstract    :
              This Research Equipment Grant will make it possible for the Department of
              Electrical Engineering at the State university of New York at Stony Brook to
              strengthen its research program on Parallel and Neural Computing.  The
              department will purchase a 128-processor CNAPS computer  and a Sun Ultra Sparc
              workstation which will be dedicated to support research in parallel and neural
              computing.  The equipment will be used for four research project s including:
              1) neural  control; 2) image processing; 3) parallel system simulation; and 4)
              Bayesian neural network for modeling and control.  These projects all require
              data intensive simulations.  The equipments selected is especially designed
              with these needs in mind.  The 128-processor CNAPS computer is a SIMD (Single
              Instruction Multiple Data)  parallel computer  ideal  for neural network and
              image processing applications.  The ultra-fast Sun workstation will allow fast,
              concurrent access to the proposed 128-processor CNAPS system and the existing
              64-processor CNAPS system.  It can also provide an infrastructure for parallel
              system simulation.
