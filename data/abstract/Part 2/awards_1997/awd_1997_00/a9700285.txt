Abstract    :
              9700285  Nemhauser  This research involves the development of solution methods
              for mixed-integer programming problems.  The objective of a mixed-integer
              programming problem is to maximize a function subject to linear inequality (or
              equality) constraints and integrality restrictions on some or all of the
              variables.  The goals of the research are to develop new methodology,
              algorithms, and prototype software for solving this class of programming
              problems.  The research addresses two specific problem domains, stochastic
              integer programming and set partitioning, which have heretofore not received
              much attention.  The researchers will investigate linear programming-based
              approximation methods, parallel integer programming, and decomposition
              techniques as methodologies for obtaining robust solutions to these difficult
              combinatorial problems.  The research results are to be implemented in openly
              distributed software systems, and will thus be accessible throughout the
              research community.   Mixed-integer programs have broad application in solving
              problems that arise in logistics and distribution, production planning,
              aircraft (flight and crew) scheduling, and resource allocation.  It is likely
              that tremendous progress in the size of problems that can be solved and in the
              time it takes to solve them will come from parallel computing, and thus this
              research has high potential to improve decision-making in such large-scale
              systems.
