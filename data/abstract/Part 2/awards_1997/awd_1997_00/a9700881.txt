Abstract    :
              9700881  Levine    This project is concerned with the study of motivic
              categories and other related constructions.  The principal investigator will
              extend the computation of motivic cohomology of varieties over a field to the
              case of a smooth base scheme of arbitrary dimension.  He plans to attempt a
              construction of a filtration on the Chow groups of smooth projective varieties
              (along the lines of the conjectural filtration of Beilinson and Bloch) by
              constructing a triangulated tensor category satisfying a universal property
              with respect to motivic cohomology and Hodge cohomology; he also will consider
              a relative version of the results of Resnikov on the vanishing of Chern classes
              of flat bundles.  The principal investigator will extend the Bloch-Gabber-Kato
              theorem to a partial computation of K-theory with mod p coefficients in
              positive characteristic p.  He will  compute the motivic cohomology and
              K-cohomology of reductive groups and their classifying spaces, giving rise to
              new invariants for etale G-torsors for reductive groups G.    This is research
              in the field of algebraic geometry.  Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest
              parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in
              the past quarter-century.  In its origin, it treated figures that could be
              defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays
              the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and
              topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields as well as in
              physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.
