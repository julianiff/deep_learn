Abstract    :
                      Nettleship  The project develops micromechanical models based on the 
              densification of an alumina powder and an Inconel N625 superalloy  powder to
              predict the path of microstructural changes occurring  during densification. 
              The effects of some processing variables on  the microstructure and
              constitutive parameters that would be needed  for the continuum mechanics
              models are also being studies.  Earlier  models have not performed well due to
              the lack of accurate values  for kinetic information such as diffusion
              coefficients as well as  due to not including the internal structure of the
              powder particles  into micromechanical models.  The factors are taken into
              account  and experimental verification of the model is performed.  ***
