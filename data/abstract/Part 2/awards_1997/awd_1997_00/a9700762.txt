Abstract    :
              EEC-9700762  Lundstrom    Abstract    This award provides funding to Purdue
              University under the direction of Dr. Mark Lundstrom, for the support of a
              Combined Research-Curriculum Development project entitled, "Designing 
              Microelectronic Technologies through  a  Network-Based Simulation 'HUB'."  This
              project will involve the development of a curriculum on the design of silicon
              and compound semiconductor technologies using advanced computer simulation
              tools.  Students will learn to design fabrication processes, devices, and
              circuits and to integrate previously gained, course-specific knowledge. Unique
              features of this program are that its objective is to bring advanced,
              research-level simulation tools into the classroom and thereby into engineering
              practice, its emphasis on bringing the computational techniques that have been
              successful in the silicon industry to the compound semiconductor industry and
              its focus on the use of simulation by engineers who are not computational
              specialists. Producing engineers proficient in the use of simulation and
              computational prototyping can have a major impact on the way that such
              technologies are developed and at the same time respond to a critical need
              continually expressed by industry.
