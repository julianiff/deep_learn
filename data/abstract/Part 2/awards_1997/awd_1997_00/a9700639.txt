Abstract    :
              9700639  Pinder  This is an award to provide support for research on an 
              approach to engineering design of systems for addressing  groundwater pollution
              problems by a mathematical procedure  that takes into consideration subjective
              information in  applying mathematical models describing groundwater models 
              movement in aquifers to design of systems for  decontamination of groundwater
              aquifers.  The investigator  plans on defining and formulating a set of rules
              that  improves the description of the relationship between  exposure to low
              doses of contaminated groundwater and  potential health-based risk-issues. 
              These rules will be  used in identifying engineering design constraints that
              must  be taken into consideration in generating least-cost  solutions to
              restoration of the quality of contaminated  groundwater aquifers. 
              Implementation of the rules to define  the subjective constraints will be
              followed by their  introduction into groundwater flow and transport models that
               can be used to formulate optimal procedures for restoration  of aquifers.   
              This research is expected to advance the state of knowledge  by which
              perceptions of qualitative concepts such as risk,  danger and importance can be
              incorporated into the process  by which engineers design procedures for
              restoration of the  quality of groundwater in aquifers.  Results of this
              project  are also expected to contribute toward potential use of the 
              procedures developed in addressing groundwater quality  restoration problems to
              solution of other environmental  engineering design problems.  ***
