Abstract    :
               Fuel efficiency and vehicle crashworthiness are two important issues for modern
              automotive manufacturing.  Current industry standards require aluminum
              structural components to absorb sufficient crash energy while limiting material
              microcracking to subcritical fractures. Thus, a successful design for
              crash-resistant aluminum components must consider microstructural material
              properties, detailed material failure mechanisms as well as the product and
              process parameters that determine them.   This research projects is a joint
              research effort between the University and an industrial partner to develop
              improved manufacturing processes for the production of extruded aluminum
              components with superior properties for automotive crashworthiness.  This
              collaborative research project has a balance between theory and experiment, and
              will provide valuable findings for the automotive manufacturing and aluminum
              manufacturing industries.
