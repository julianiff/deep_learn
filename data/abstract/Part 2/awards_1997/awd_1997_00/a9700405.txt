Abstract    :
                    9700405  Deng  A combined experimental and modeling study is being
              conducted to  characterize the frictional behavior of tool-chip interface and
              to  understand the relationship between wear of the cutting tool and  the
              dynamic response of the tool-workpiece system.  The  experimental observations
              include recording the dynamic temperature  variations near the tool-chip
              interface, the dynamic, full-field  surface deformations on both the chip and
              the workpiece, and tool  wear measurements.  These data are used along with
              finite elements  to develop models to predict tool wear.  ***
