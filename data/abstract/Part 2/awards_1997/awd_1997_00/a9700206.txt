Abstract    :
              9700206  Koster   This proposal is for the assessment of industrially important
              TiAl alloy castings.  One engineering form of that alloy, known as y-TiAl,
              currently in a research stage, is expected to be introduced in the near future
              to aerospace engineering and other cutting edge applications.  That alloy has
              two attributes similar to the Galn, which are thought to contribute to the
              enhanced segregation in the melt: (1) the difference in density of the
              elements, and (2) the different melting temperatures of the elements.  The
              research results from both TiAl and Galn will contribute to a better
              understanding of the physics of segregation and flow in thermally and solutally
              driven metallic alloy melts.  The outcomes of this research could provide
              useful experimental results that will spur the development of new fluid
              mechanical models as well as adjusting designs for industrial processing
              furnaces.   This collaborative research project addresses fundamental issues on
              fluid physics and chemical segregation study in the natural convection cell,
              combined with the industrially relevant vertical Bridgman crystallization,
              including metallurgical characterization and tensile testing, will improve the
              understanding of manufacturing requirements for TiAl alloy castings. The
              research project has a balance between theory and experiment, and will provide
              valuable findings for the aerospace industry as well as the aluminum
              manufacturing industry.
