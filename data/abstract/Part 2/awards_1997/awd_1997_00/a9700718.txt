Abstract    :
              Feeny  9700718           Ovipositing insects generally make final host-selection
               decisions on the basis of compounds present on the leaf surface.  Little is
              known about the chemistry of leaf surfaces and how  variation in
              surface-chemical profiles is related to host  selection by insects. The goal of
              this project is to examine the  leaf-surface chemistry of a single plant
              species (Daucus carota)  with particular reference to compounds already
              identified as  oviposition stimulants for one of its specialist insect
              herbivores  (Papilio polyxenes). Plant surfaces will be extracted with a 
              combination of chloroform and near-boiling water, and the  resulting extracts
              fractionated and analyzed using high  performance liquid chromatography. The
              project will include: (1)  comparisons of the surface-chemical profiles of
              leaves differing  in age, form, life history and genotype; (2) comparisons of
              the  surface-chemical profiles of plants differing in acceptability as 
              oviposition substrates; and (3) comparisons of larval performance  on plant
              genotypes differing in oviposition acceptability. These  experiments should
              determine the extent to which leaf-surface  chemical variation is correlated
              with oviposition preferences of  an insect species and subsequent larval
              performance. This research  will reveal whether chemical signals on leaf
              surfaces can serve as  keys for recognition of quality host sites by
              ovipositing female  butterflies.
