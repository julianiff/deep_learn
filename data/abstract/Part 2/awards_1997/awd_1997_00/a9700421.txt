Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the  Department of Chemistry at Wichita State University to acquire
              a 300 MHz NMR Spectrometer.  This equipment will enhance research in a number
              of areas including the following: (1) synthesis  and characterization of
              metacyclophanes, (2) studies on novel porphyrin-based chemosensors and 
              donor-acceptor systems using molecular recognition approach, (3) metal
              complexes of nitrile-  substituted trispyrazolylborates-molecular materials,
              (4) mechanism-based inhibitors of serine  proteinase, (5) molecules for solar
              energy conversion, (6) micelle-forming, water-soluble diblock  copolymers by
              group transfer polymerization, and (7) chemistry of l-ascorbic acid.    Nuclear
              Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to 
              chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
              identify unknown  substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms
              within molecules, and to study the  dynamics of interactions between molecules
              in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR  spectrometry is essential to
              chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from  these NMR
              studies are useful in the areas such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
