Abstract    :
                                      ABSTRACT       The principal investigators propose to
              study a new technique to enhance convective heat transfer from hot surfaces. 
              Arrays of concave indentations will be created on the surface to induce higher
              rates of heat transfer.  This concept was first mentioned by Russian scientists
              at an international conference held in 1995.  The Russian scientists
              conjectured that tornado-like bursts resulting from flow over the concavities
              were responsible for the enhanced heat transfer.  Preliminary experimental
              measurements by the principal investigators did show enhanced heat transfer,
              but not the presence of tornado-like bursts.  The proposed work will include
              comprehensive experimental measurements using the transient liquid crystal
              technique to establish the full effects of concavities.  Three-dimensional
              numerical simulations using a finite-volume based computer code will be carried
              out to reveal the flow behavior.
