Abstract    :
                9700401  Hsu    At low load, reinforced concrete without cracks behaves as  an
              elastic, isotropic material and its behavior is governed  by two material
              constants: the Young's modulus E and the  Poisson ration v.  At service load,
              however, a moderate  amount of cracking is expected and acceptable.  Such 
              cracking transforms reinforced concrete into a nonlinear,  non-isotropic
              material.  The biaxial behavior of post  cracking membrane elements are
              governed by three moduli and  two Poisson ratios of concrete to be determined 
              experimentally.  The research agenda also includes the  development of a finite
              element program to predict the  behavior of shear walls.  This program can be
              used to verify  the functional applicability of the five proposed mechanical 
              properties.
