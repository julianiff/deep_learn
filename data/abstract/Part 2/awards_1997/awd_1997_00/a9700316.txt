Abstract    :
              The project will (1) assess the efficiency and effectiveness of  investments in
              information technology (IT); (2) identify the  organizational and IT management
              practices associated with  achieving greater value through IT, and (3)
              disseminate result in  academic, business and policy circles. These issues will
              be  addressed at firm, industry, and country levels, based on several  large,
              detailed, longitudinal databases that will be coupled  together for more robust
              analysis than was heretofore possible.  The study will include data on IT in
              five to 15 industry sectors  in 50 countries from 1980-95, and on 200 large US
              firms for the  1990-95 period. Existing databases will be updated annually, and
               new databases will be built. The study will shed new light on  whether, how,
              and why IT makes a difference in effectiveness and  efficiency across a global
              spectrum of use, helping to clarify  our understanding of the well-known
              "productivity paradox". It  will produce a definitive body of research that
              uncovers the  potential payoffs from IT investment and illuminates the 
              mechanisms by which they can be harnessed.
