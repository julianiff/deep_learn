Abstract    :
              LUNTS  97-00964  This project is a study of the localization construction  for
              quantum groups with emphasis on the roots of unity  case. It is a continuation
              of the joint project with Alex Rosenberg where the localization was constructed
              for the generic case. The second part of the project is the study of the
              Kodaira-Spencer Lie algebra which arises in deformations of algebraic
              varieties. This is the "mirror dual" picture to the one developed  recently
              with Eduard Looijenga.  Quantum groups are algebraic objects which  have
              recently arisen from physics. However, these objects whose study not only has
              applications to physics can also be used to study various questions of a purely
              algebraic nature.
