Abstract    :
              9700869  Rao  Description:  This award is for a US-Indo research collaboration
              in the  field of electrochemical sensors based on new cyanometalate modified 
              electrodes.  The co-investigators are Andrew Bocarsly of Princeton  University
              and Prabhakara Rao of the Central Electrochemical Research  Institute (CERI) in
              Tamil Nadu.  Their studies will focus on the structure  and reactivity of
              platinum(II) and palladium(II) complexes with  cyanometallates that form
              polymeric structures.  These materials form  hydrogel-like structures with
              unusual photochemical and electrochemical  properties.  Bocarsly's interest is
              the solid-state properties of these  materials, while Dr. Rao will pursue the
              potential sensor applications of  these systems.  Both groups are strongly
              grounded in electrochemistry and  the use of electrochemical methods.  The
              expertise and facilities available  at these two laboratories are complementary
              and should be enhanced by  the collaboration.    Scope: This research will add
              an international component to domestic  research that is currently funded by
              the NSF Division of Chemistry.        The discussions leading to this
              collaboration have been thoughtful,  deliberate and point to the potential that
              solid scientific work of mutual  benefit will result.  CERI is a research
              facility of the central government  that is managed by the Council of
              Scientific and Industrial Research  (CSIR). The mission of CSIR laboratories is
              to conduct research consistent  with national priorities and India's
              development as an industrial nation.    ***
