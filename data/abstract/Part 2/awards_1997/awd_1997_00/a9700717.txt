Abstract    :
              Honeycutt  9700717    The study is composed of two central objectives. The 
              first objective is to test the hypothesis that the  absolute rate of DNA change
              in a mitochondrial genome is  influenced by the mode of replication of the
              genome. The  process of replication yields a displaced strand of DNA.  DNA in
              this displaced single-stranded state is expected  to be more susceptible to
              spontaneous mutation than the  normal double-stranded state of the DNA. Thus
              the  hypothesis yields a testable prediction; the amounts of  detectable DNA
              change should be proportional to the time  that a DNA strand is displaced
              during the replication  process. The second objective is to use a DNA data set
              to  determine the relationships of a closely related group of  Notropin
              shiners. This group is a member of the most  taxonomically diverse family of
              North American freshwater  fishes. Knowledge of these relationships is basic to
               understanding the taxonomic and ecological diversity of  this group. Each
              objective of this study will be obtained  from different analyses of the same
              mitochondrial DNA  data set.
