Abstract    :
              This project focuses on three problem areas concerning linear constraint query
              languages. Constraint database systems integrate database technology with
              constraint solving techniques to deal with applications involving spatial or
              geographical datasets and arithmetic computations. Linear constraint databases
              are generally represented by quantifier-free logical formulas over some
              arithmetical domain such as the real numbers (the real closed field) with
              addition. Conceptually, constraint queries are evaluated in closed form using
              quantifier elimination algorithms. The first part of this project aims at
              developing efficient query evaluation algorithms for linear or dense order
              constraint queries and syntactic forms for representing constraint databases so
              that efficient query evaluation becomes possible. The second part aims at
              showing the complexity of properties of constraint query languages including
              query containment, equivalence, satisfiability, and disjointness using a new
              technique based on abstract machines. The third part aims at developing
              incremental evaluation techniques for recursive (non-first-order) and
              topological queries. This project will provide complexity results and efficient
              algorithms as a theoretical foundation for the design of constraint database
              models, query languages, and systems.
