Abstract    :
                  9700696  ROOT   The role of population differentiation in the evolution of
              species interactions is not well documented.  Selection can differ by
              population, leading to coevolutionary interactions in some areas and non
              reciprocal evolution in other areas.  The pea aphid, a pest of legume crops, is
              attacked by the parasitoid, Aphidius ervi.  Pea aphids in New York which
              specialize on alfalfa are two or three times more resistant to parasitism than
              pea aphids specialized on clover.  Resistance is genetically determined and
              physiologically based.  It is not a product of host-plant induced effects or
              either insect species on the two crops.   The proposed research focuses on
              three areas.  1) A survey of pea aphids on both crops from two other
              geographical area, Maryland and France, will indicate the generality of the
              observed pattern of relative resistance.  2) Reciprocal transplant experiments
              in the lab will determine whether the insects are locally adapted within their
              geographic region.  3) An experiment will be performed to ascertain the
              relative magnitude of genetic variation for resistance in pea aphids from
              clover and from alfalfa.  This will indicate if lower levels of genetic
              variation in clover could be slowing the evolution of resistance despite strong
              selection in both crops.   This research is important in enhancing a basic
              understanding of the evolution of species interactions, and will provide
              insight in the effects of the evolution of species interactions on the efficacy
              of biological control programs.
