Abstract    :
              This research project deals with modeling, analysis, design  and experimental
              verification of a novel tuned distributed  vibration damper (TDVD) for
              intelligent vibration control of  structures. Recent advances is smart
              materials make it  possible to adjust the parameters of dampers and absorbers 
              on-line, and thus dramatically broaden the utility of  dampers and absorbers in
              industrial applications. Although  much progress has been made, dampers with
              spatially  distributed inertia have been overlooked. Many dampers and 
              absorbers have a characteristic lumped mass, which limits  their operation to
              relatively narrow frequency bands. Since  the structure to be controlled may
              have a wide frequency  spectrum, it is desirable to have wide-band dampers with
               relatively simple configuration and realizable control  algorithms. The TDVD
              is unique  in that an elastic bar is  introduced in its configuration. The
              distributed inertia of  the bar enables the new damper to provide wide-band 
              augmentation, leading to vibration reduction by up to  several orders of
              magnitude, compared to conventional  dampers. The major objectives of this
              research are to  understand the damping amplifying mechanism of the TDVD; to 
              investigate TDVD-structure interactions; to develop TDVD-  based vibration
              control algorithms; and to experimentally  justify the feasibility of the TDVD
              in real engineering  problems.
