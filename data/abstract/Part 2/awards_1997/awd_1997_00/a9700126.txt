Abstract    :
              DMI-9700126  Bhatacharya     The use of starch-based polymers in the manufacture
              of injection molded plastic products has been shown to be viable for making
              biodegradable plastic products.  The production of such products is
              substantially more difficult than synthetic polymers and currently relies on an
              inefficient trial-and-error approach. The major barrier to large-scale
              commercialization of starch-based polymer injection molded products is the lack
              of experience with the molding properties. Without confidence in the material's
              performance, industry is reluctant to commit to the large-scale production
              needed to make injection molding of starch-based polymers economically
              attractive. This research project seeks to develop the necessary understanding
              so that starch-based polymers can be used with the same assurance as synthetic
              polymers.  The objective of this proposal is to create the engineering
              methodology needed to routinely design products with environmentally-friendly
              starch-based polymers. This design methodology will be fine-tuned and tested by
              conducting case studies involving all stages of the product and process design
              for candidate starch-based polymer parts. The research project has a balance
              between theory and experiment, and will provide valuable findings for the
              biodegradable product manufacturing industry.
