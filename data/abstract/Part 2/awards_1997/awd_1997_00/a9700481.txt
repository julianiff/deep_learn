Abstract    :
              Motif-based hidden Markov models (MHMMs) are a new extension of  hidden Markov
              models (HMMs), which are the most promising method  available for
              characterizing families of biological sequences. An  MHMM is an HMM based on
              conserved regions (i.e. motifs) within a  family of biological sequences, as
              discovered by our existing  MEME software. Motif models discovered by MEME
              serve conceptually  as individual model states in an MHMM. Therefore, Unlike 
              traditional HMMs, MHMMs closely model only the relatively highly  conserved
              regions of the proteins in a family. Therefore, MHMMs  will be trainable from
              small datasets. In addition, MHMMs will  have a more general topology than
              standard HMMs, which are  linear, so MHMMs will be capable of modeling repeated
              occurrences  of a motif in a single sequence. Although MHMMs are applicable to 
              genetic sequences. the work proposed here will focus on families  of protein
              sequences. This proposal describes plans to develop  the algorithms necessary
              to train MHMMs. Our software will be  made available through a web server, like
              our existing MEME  software  Grundy et al., 1996 .
