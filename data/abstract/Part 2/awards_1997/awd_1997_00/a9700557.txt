Abstract    :
              EEC-9700557      ABSTRACT    The award provides funding to Northwestern
              University, the University of Michigan, the University of Wisconsin-Madison,
              and Argonne National Laboratory under the direction of Dr. Raymond Krizek, for
              the support of a Combined Research-Curriculum Development project entitled,
              "Geoenvironmental Engineering:  A New and Strategic Curriculum."  The objective
              of this project is to develop a series of twenty 10-hour educational modules in
              the rapidly maturing area of geoenvironmental engineering.  These modules will
              be used selectively to complement an existing course on a related topic,
              present an entire course or series of courses to complement a program, or
              update practicing  professionals via continuing education.
