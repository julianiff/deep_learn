Abstract    :
                9700012  Harmon    Highly Confined Concrete can be much stronger and more 
              ductile than unconfined concrete.  For this reason,  confinement is being used
              extentensively for seismic  retrofit of columns and for new construction. 
              Current  design procedures were developed to meet immediate and  pressing
              design needs.  They are based on results of full  scale tests simulating
              existing bridge pier conditions in  California.  In order to extend the design
              procedures to  more general design and loading conditions, design  procedures
              should be formulated which are based on  fundamental mechanical principles. The
              results of this  research narrow range of design parameters.  The objective  of
              the research would be to extend these principles to  cyclic loading and to
              perform tests to demonstrate their  application to column and bridge pier
              design as well as  formulate design procedures.
