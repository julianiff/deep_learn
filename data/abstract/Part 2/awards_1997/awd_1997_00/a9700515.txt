Abstract    :
                    9700515  Morris  Most organisms live in unpredictable environments, and
              must make decisions such as where and when to reproduce using incomplete
              information.  Despite numerous theoretical studies that have predicted how
              animals should behave in the face of such uncertainty, few field studies have
              quantified the ways that animals respond reproductively to mortality risks that
              are spatially and temporally unpredictable.  Even fewer studies have quantified
              how well animals use information to reduce reproductive risks, when compared to
              either naive or omniscient strategies.  In a seasonal lowland rain forest in
              Peru, the frog Edalorhina perezi and other amphibians preferentially lay eggs
              in small tree-fall pools, where the eggs and tadpoles experience mortality
              risks that differ among pools and change temporally depending on unpredictable
              rainfall.  By observing frog egg-laying behavior and movement among pools, I
              will assess how well they distribute their offspring.  My approach will combine
              observations of risks and frog behavior in natural pools, an experiment using
              artificial pools to test the frogs' abilities to track changing risks, and a
              model to determine how well the frogs perform compared to other strategies that
              range in risk-assessment capabilities.
