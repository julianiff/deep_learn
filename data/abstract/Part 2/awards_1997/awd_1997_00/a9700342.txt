Abstract    :
              9700342  Frenkel  A two-wavelength transmitter concept will be implemented in a
              current pulse frequency division multiplexing fiber-optic communication system
              currently in place at New Mexico Highlands University.  This implementation
              will increase the capacity of the system, and promises an increase in capacity
              of local fiber-optic communications networks to that of 100's of GBIT/s.  ***
