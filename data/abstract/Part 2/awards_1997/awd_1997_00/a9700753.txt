Abstract    :
              EEC-9700753  Harmon      ABSTRACT    The award provides funding to the
              University of California-Los Angeles,   under the direction of Dr. Thomas
              Harmon, for the support of a Combined Research-Curriculum Development project
              entitled, "Virtual Reality in the Environmental Engineering Curriculum." This
              project's goals are to incorporate recent developments in environmental
              restoration research to the civil and environmental engineering curriculum; to
              do so using recent breakthroughs in virtual reality programming language (VRML)
              and to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach as a teaching tool
              and its potential to infuse the engineering curriculum with currently
              developing techniques.  This project will link the recent research results in
              Civil and Environmental Engineering with those of an investigator in the field
              of visualization and virtual simulations in UCLA's School of Architecture and
              Urban Design.  The tangible product of the proposed research will be an
              interactive site investigation software (ISIS) package.  The design project for
              the course will be based on a virtual reality/real time simulator of a
              hazardous waste site.  The students will visualize the site at the computer
              terminal, and travel throughout the site using a mouse-controlled cursor.
