Abstract    :
                This Research at Undergraduate Institutions project, supported in  the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focusses on the  preparation and
              characterization of chiral nuclear magnetic  resonance shift reagents formed by
              coupling paramagnetic lanthanide  ions with chiral resolving agents.  Professor
              Thomas J. Wenzel and  his undergraduate students at Bates College will combine
              the  results from this work with known chromatographic retention data  for
              optical isomers so that the assignment of the absolute  configuration of
              enantiomers can be made from resolved nuclear  magnetic resonance spectra. 
              This work has application in the areas  of the pharmaceutical industry and in
              magnetic resonance imaging  reagents.  Methods that permit the direct
              determination of the configuration  of optical isomers will be developed by
              Professor Wenzel and his  undergraduate students at Bates College.  Reagents
              will be prepared  that interact with optical isomers in a way that leads to
              resolved  nuclear magnetic resonance spectra.  Knowing how these reagents 
              shift nuclear magnetic resonance spectra will permit the assignment  of
              configuration to the optical isomers.  This work has potential  for application
              in pharmaceutical chemistry and in the are of  magnetic resonance imaging.
