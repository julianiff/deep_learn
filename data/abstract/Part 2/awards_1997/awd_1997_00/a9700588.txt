Abstract    :
              ECS-9700588  Tannenbaum    The proposal deals with partial differential equation
              methods for the control of distributed and nonlinear systems.  In particular,
              the focus is  on the benchmark area of certain key semiconductor manufacturing
              processes including etching, deposition and lithography.    We will also
              discuss some new directions we are taking on the robust control of distributed
              parameter systems using skew Toeplitz theory.  This allows one to reduce the
              design of H   -optimal and suboptimal compensators to finite dimensional linear
              algebra problem, the dimension of which only depends on the McMillan degrees of
              the weights and not the (state-space) dimension of the plant.  Thus even for
              infinite dimensional systems, we are reduced to finite matrix manipulations. 
              We will also consider some time-varying generalizations of these ideas.
