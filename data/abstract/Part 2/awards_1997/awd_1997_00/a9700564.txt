Abstract    :
              Kleiman 9700564  This project is concerned with free resolutions related to
              monomial ideals and toric varieties.  It is in the interface between
              commutative algebra, algebraic geometry and combinatorics.  The goal of the
              project is to build minimal free resolutions in some special cases, construct
              non-minimal structured resolutions, and obtain bounds on Betti numbers.  Some
              of the problems are closely related to Groebner basis theory and integer
              programming.  This is research in the field of algebraic geometry.  Algebraic
              geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has
              had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century.  In its origin, it
              treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations,
              namely polynomials.  Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from
              algebra, but from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding application
              in those fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and
              robotics.
