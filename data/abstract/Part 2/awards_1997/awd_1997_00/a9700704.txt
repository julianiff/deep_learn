Abstract    :
              Harrison  9700704           Pheromones are used by a large number of insects to 
              attract mates.  In the Lepidoptera pheromone binding  proteins (PBPs) play a
              role in the binding and transpmrting  of pheromones in the male antennae.  PBPs
              should be subject  to directional selection to bind new pheromones efficiently 
              when a pheromone changes, but this prediction has not been  tested rigorously. 
              Three different methods will be used to  detect selection; each method involves
              comparison of PBP  gene sequences obtained from a set of moth species.  The 
              first approach uses population genetic test that detect  excess nonsynonymous 
              substitutions that may occur in  response to a change in pheromone.  A second
              method uses  relative rates test to look for increases in nonsynonymous 
              substitution along branches along which a change in  pheromone has occurred. 
              Several different classes of  changes in pheromones will be examined.  The
              final method  for detecting selection involves analysis of PBPs in species 
              which have independently evolved to use the same pheromone;  the goal is
              identify convergence in the amino acid sequences  of these PBPs.  Demonstration
              of selection acting upon these  PBPs would be important for the study of
              protein evolution  and pheromone communication.
