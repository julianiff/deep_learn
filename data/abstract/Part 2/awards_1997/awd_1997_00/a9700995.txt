Abstract    :
                  9700995  Edwards   This award will provide funds for materials and supplies
              to enhance the dissertation research of Mr. Gary Voelker, a doctoral student at
              the University of Washington who is working under the supervision of Dr. Scott
              Edwards.  Ms. Voelker's dissertation research involves acquisition of
              mitochondrial DNA sequences from 40 species of the avian genus Anthus in order
              to generate a well-resolved phylogenetic hypotheses among species of the genus.
               Species of this genus are distributed world-wide, providing Mr. Voelker and
              Dr. Edwards an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the relative roles of
              dispersal and vicariance on a global scale.  Those roles are the subject of
              intensive debate, and the work proposed in this study represent one of the few
              situations where the effects of dispersal can be adequately assessed.  The
              research also will permit rigorous testing of two long-standing and competing
              hypotheses concerning the evolution of migration in avian groups, and in
              addition, provide the first phylogenetically-controlled study that will examine
              the evolution of morphology in relation to migratory behavior.  Consequently,
              results from the work will be of general interest across taxonomic and
              organismal groups.  Support for training of graduate students in modern
              technologies is critical to maintain the workforce of scientists capable of
              addressing questions and issues in global biology.
