Abstract    :
              Abramovich  9700520    In this project, the principal investigator will study
              semistable reduction problems, making use of the Alteration method of de Jong,
              the Torifying Blowup of Abramovich and de Jong, and Toroidal Geometry of Kempf,
              Knudsen, Mumford and Saint-Donat.  He will work on generalizing his results on
              fibered powers to the logarithmic case, and continue the study of stably
              integral points on abelian varieties, using the compactified moduli spaces of
              Alexeev and Nakamura.    This project falls into the general area of arithmetic
              geometry, a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number
              theory and geometry.  This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful
              having recently solved problems that withstood generations.  Among its many
              consequences are new error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both
              modern computers and compact disks.
