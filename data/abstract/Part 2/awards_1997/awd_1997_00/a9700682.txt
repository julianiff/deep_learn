Abstract    :
              9700682  Aberbach    This award supports work on several problems in commutative
              algebra.  These include studying Huneke's relation-type conjecture for
              parameter ideals, localization of parameter test ideals, and localization of
              tight closure in general.    This research is concerned with a number of
              questions in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.  Algebraic geometry
              studies solutions of families of polynomial equations.  One can either study
              the geometry of the solution set or approach problems algebraically by
              investigating certain functions on the solution set that form what is called a
              commutative ring.  This dual perspective creates a close connection between
              commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.
