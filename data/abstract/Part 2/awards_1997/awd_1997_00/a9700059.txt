Abstract    :
              This project is for the development of a decision support tool for concurrent
              design of multi-component systems, such as power tools, that are subject to
              multiple views, such as design, manufacturing, and marketing considerations. 
              The developed numerical tool will determine design attributes of a product
              system such that, given the product market demand, the highest possible utility
              of the design is achieved.  The utility of the product design at the system's
              level will be modeled by a single utility (or objective) function.  This
              function will be formulated to meet the goals of a business.  The objective
              function at the systems level will be a function of the objectives at the
              subsystems (or components) level.  The objective functions at the subsystems
              level will be formulated based on performance, quality, and cost metrics.
              Appropriate constraints will be imposed.  The model will allow interactions and
              tradeoff explorations by a top-level decision maker, at the system-level, and
              by decision makers at the subsystems level.  An application of the model to the
              design of a power tool will be demonstrated in order to obtain a compromise
              collaborative design solution.   If successful, the results of this research
              will lead to increased level of concurrency in the engineering design process,
              reduce product design development time, reduce cost, and as a result make the
              US industry more competitive in the global marketplace.
