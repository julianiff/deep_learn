Abstract    :
              9700928  Leonov    This grant involves cooperative research between the 
              Department of Polymer Engineering, The University of Akron  (Akron, OH) and the
              Laboratory of Rheology, Institute of  Petrochemical Synthesis, the Russian
              Academy of Sciences  (Moscow, Russia).  Several fundamental problems in
              molecular  rheology will be investigated in the course of this work.  The
              primary objectives of the work are the following:  Analytical and numerical
              studies of a self-consistent  condition for polymers with long and flexible
              chains.  A  molecular approach to linear viscoelastic behavior of  polymers
              using looping concept.  Experimental studies of  slow relaxation processes in
              narrow distributed polymers.  A  theory of relaxation interaction in liquid
              crystalline  polymers using a mean field approach to elaborate a  constitutive
              equation for liquid crystalline polymers of  nematic type.  %%%  This research
              helps to lay the theoretical and experimental  foundations for the
              understanding of polymer flow and  processing.  ***
