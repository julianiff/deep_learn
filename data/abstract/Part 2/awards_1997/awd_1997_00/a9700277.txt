Abstract    :
              This research project investigates novel vibration control techniques based on
              the concept of shaping structural eigenvectors to achieve desirable vibration
              or acoustic response. There are two primary  motivating factors of this project
              one is that passive and semi-active methods do not suffer from the high energy
              requirements and lower stability margins of active methods, and the other is
              that eigenvectors which are shaped in a desirable manner provide improved
              response for response for a wide range of excitations. The field of vibration
              control has a great deal of attention during the last 15 years and much of it
              has been directed toward active vibration control. Most research, however, has
              focused on, (a) active methods which try to alternate the vibration (by damping
              or cancellation) without regard for power required, (b)passive methods which
              attempt to maximize a structure's damping, or (c) an intelligent combination of
              the two. This research shows that eigenstructure assignment methods, which do
              not focus on either of those approaches, can be very effective in vibration
              control under a wide range of conditions, and that eigenstructure assignment
              can work in concert with conventional vibration control methods for better
              performance with reduced power costs.
