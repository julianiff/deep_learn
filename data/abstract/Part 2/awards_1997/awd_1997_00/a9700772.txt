Abstract    :
              EEC-9700537      ABSTRACT    The award provides funding to West Virginia
              University  under the direction of Dr. Julio Davalos, for the support of a
              Combined Research-Curriculum Development project entitled, "Advanced Composite
              Materials in Civil/Mechanical Engineering Curricula:  Combined Analytical,
              Experimental, and Computer-aided Approach to Active Learning."  The objective
              of this project is to develop primarily undergraduate courses in design
              analysis of advanced composite materials (ACMs) and hybrid materials for
              civil/mechanical  engineering students.  The instructional program will consist
              of self-contained modules on introductory and advanced courses in ACMs,
              reinforcement of concrete, wood, and steel.
