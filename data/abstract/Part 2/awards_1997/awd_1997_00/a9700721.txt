Abstract    :
              9700721  Bass   A number of problems from four areas of probability theory are
              to be studied. The   first, which has applications to partial differential
              equations, is an investigation into the   squared Laplacian by means of both
              ordinary Brownian motion and by iterated Brownian   motion. The second area
              arises out of both economics and physics and is a stochastic   bifurcation
              model. One has an ordinary differential equation whose behavior is controlled  
              by a stochastic process. The third area is diffusions on fractals, together
              with a study of   their properties. These have applications to physics as well
              as partial differential equations.   Finally, uniqueness for superprocesses
              will be investigated, resulting in applications to   partial differential
              equations and to mathematical biology.     Probabilistic techniques will be
              used to study a number of different models that   arise in economics, physics,
              and biology. These include the behavior of rational players in   economics,
              field theories in physics, and populations in biology. The results should also 
               have applications to the theory of partial differential equations in
              mathematics.
