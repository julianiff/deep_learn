Abstract    :
              ***  9700278  BEYERLEIN  This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation
              and Facilities   (CRIF) Program will enable the Department of Chemistry at
              Clemson   University to acquire a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)  
              spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas  
              including the following: (1) prodrug: DNA interactions of bifunctional  
              enediynes, (2) asymmetric organocopper conjugate additions, (3) novel  
              fluorinated polymers and materials, (4) main group clusters and their  
              transition metal complexes, and (5) preparation and characterization of  
              highly water-soluble fullerene materials.       Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
              (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool   available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules.   It is used to identify unknown
              substances, characterize specific   arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
              to study the dynamics of   interactions between molecules in solution. Access
              to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are
              carrying out frontier   research. The results from these NMR studies are useful
              in the areas such   as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.        ***
