Abstract    :
                    9700387  Dargush  The main objective of this work is to develop an active 
              aerodynamic control system to mitigate vibrations in both the  along and the
              across wind directions for tall, slender structures  subjected to strong wind
              loads.  The control system will use the  energy of wind flows to supplement its
              power requirements.  Five  tasks will be undertaken: experimental wind tunnel
              studies on  cross section models; modeling using single degree of freedom and 
              coupled wake-body formulations; continuum modeling based on  boundary element
              formulations; development of a control algorithm  for parametrically excited
              systems; and assessment of full -scale  performance potential.  The results
              from this work will help  improving, among others, the performance of tall
              structures  located in sites where wind hazards are common, will enhance the 
              understanding of controlling bluff body vortex shedding, as well  as noise and
              vibration.  ***
