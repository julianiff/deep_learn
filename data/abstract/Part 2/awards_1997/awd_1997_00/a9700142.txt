Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   of
              the Chemistry Division with funds for instrumentation provided by the   Office
              of Multidisciplinary Activities, Continetti will continue studying   the
              dissociation dynamics of transient molecules and molecular clusters   in the
              gas phase using a technique developed in his laboratory, neutral   dissociation
              dynamics, which is a combination of negative-ion   photodetachment and
              neutral-fragment translational energy spectroscopy.    Issues to be examined
              include isotope effects in the dissociation of O3,   transient molecules of
              interest in combustion and atmospheric processes,   and the photochemistry of
              dimer anions.  This research project will examine the molecular structure and
              electronic     composition of a number of unstable and transient molecules
              which are   difficult to study by other techniques.  Possible applications of  
               information obtained from this research include combustion chemistry,  
              atmospheric reactions, chemical vapor deposition, and supercritical water  
              reactors.
