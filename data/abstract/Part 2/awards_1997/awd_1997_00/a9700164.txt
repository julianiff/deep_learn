Abstract    :
                  9700164  Hunsperger  the objective of this research is to develop a 
              nondestructive evaluation (NDE) method for detecting  corrosion of embedded or
              encased high strength steel rods  and cables.  The proposed method involves
              using Time Domain  Reflectometry (TDR) to locate and evaluate corrosion sites. 
              TDR is a well established technique in the field of  electrical engineering and
              has been used for many years to  detect breaks in transmission lines. 
              Preliminary numerical  simulations indicate that TDR shows promise for being
              able  to detect both surface and pit corrosion of steel strands  embedded in
              concrete.    A reliable, accurate, and economical method for detecting  the
              location and magnitude of the corrosion will lead to  increased levels of
              safety for our civil infrastructure, and  may enable significant savings to the
              public by reducing  maintenance costs through early corrosion detection.
