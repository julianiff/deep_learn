Abstract    :
              Lewontin  9700941         We now know that natural selection can result in 
              exquisitely precise convergence at the molecular level.  One  area in which
              molecular convergence has been demonstrated is  vision.  Opsins, the proteins
              that are primarily responsible  for determining the spectral sensitivity of a
              photoreceptor,  have undergone convergent evolution in response to selection 
              for similar sensitivities.  The purpose of this research is  to extend these
              studies by investigating opsin evolution in  a group of butterflies famous for
              mimicry.  This study tests  whether or not opsin amino acid sequences are
              correlated  with the convergently acquired mimetic morphologies.  Because
              butterfly eyes are in part like morphologies will  have resulted in the
              evolution of like opsins.       The methods employed will be to finish
              sequencing the  opsin genes of pairs of mimetic Heliconius butterflies, and 
              then to examine the pattern of opsin amino acid substitution  by mapping the
              opsin sequences on a recent phylogeny of this  group based on mitochondrial
              DNA.
