Abstract    :
              This project investigates algorithmic techniques for  optimization, with an
              emphasis on problems related to  graphs.  The goal is faster and more
              space-efficient  algorithms.  A special focus is the use of semidefinite 
              programming for modelling graph optimization problems.  A  new approach to
              approximately solving semidefinite  programming problems is being pursued. 
              Using the work on  semidefinite programming as a guide, the project studies 
              improving the efficiency of a broad class of approximation  algorithms for
              optimization.
