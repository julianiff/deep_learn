Abstract    :
                  9700477  Gross    This award supports research of Pavel Etingof, David
              Kazhdan and Benedict Gross in several areas of the theory of quantization,
              quantum groups, special functions, representation theory and number theory.  
              Etingof will work on the new theory of dynamical quantum groups and special
              functions, and continue the joint work with Kazhdan on quantization and the
              theory of quantum groups.   Kazhdan will continue his work on the discrete
              series for GL(n) and on minimal representations over local fields and will work
              on the theory of algebraic integration.   Gross will continue his work on a
              construction of motives with Galois gpoup G2, via an exceptional theta
              correspondence, and will study Galois representations associated to "algebraic"
              automorphic forms.       This project involves research in Algebra and Number
              Theory. Algebra can be though of as the study of symmetry in the abstract. As
              such, Algebra has direct applications to areas of physics and chemistry. In
              particular, the modern theory of gauge fields in physics uses algebra
              extensively.  Number Theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole
              numbers,  addressing such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of
              one  whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics
              and  was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. Modern Number
              Theory  and Algebra are very technical and deep. However, within the last half
              century, they have become indispensable tools in diverse applications in areas
              such as data transmission and processing, and  communication systems.
