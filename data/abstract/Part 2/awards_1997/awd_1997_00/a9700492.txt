Abstract    :
              9700492  Groisser    The proposed workshop and special semester are in the area
              of mathematical physics with an interdisciplinary theme. Planned talks of the
              workshop cover several topics of current interest centering around
              Seiberg-Witten theory and symplectic geometry. The proposed activities are to
              be hosted jointly by the Department of Mathematics and the Institute for
              Fundamental Theory (IFT) at the University of Florida. The IFT is a research
              center designed to promote interdisciplinary research and communication among
              specialists in high energy physics, astrophysics, condensed matter physics, and
              mathematical physics.    The 1990s can be seen as a period of remarkable
              interface and unification between theoretical physics and mathematics. For
              example, the recent discovery of N. Seiberg and E. Witten on electric-magnetic
              duality has had an enormous impact in low-dimensional geometry and topology;
              conversely, cutting-edge mathematical ideas are providing a new language for
              string theory.
