Abstract    :
                 P. I.:  Merle Froschl    This project is building on and expanding Playtime
              is Science, EEC's early childhood, hands-on, parent/child science activity
              program, providing a major focus on the needs and capabilities of children with
              disabilities.  Playtime is Science has been piloted in schools and
              community-based settings at four national sites with funding from the NSF, the
              Toyota USA Foundation, and the Dewitt Wallace-Readers Digest Fund.  During this
              national pilot, Playtime is Science was found to be effective for children with
              disabilities.  The sample, however, was small and further development is needed
              to adapt the program successfully in a variety of settings, to test the
              activities with children with a wider range of disabilities, and to create
              disability awareness training to address attitudinal barriers.      The goals
              of Playtime is Science for Children with Disabilities are (1) to increase the
              ability of teachers, staff and parents to motivate and empower children with
              disabilities in grades Pre-K through the third grade to develop their science
              skills in a supportive environment; (2) to help children with disabilities
              build on their strengths and develop confidence and skill in science which will
              persist beyond school, and will inform later career options; and (3) to provide
              opportunities for parents of these students to become involved in their
              children's early science learning and to convey positive messages and
              expectations to their children about science.    Specific objectives are: (1)
              to pilot test and adapt the activities in inclusive and special education
              settings; (2) to build science skills based on the problem-solving abilities
              already developed by many children with disabilities; (3) to conduce training
              in program facilitation for teacher, staff and parents; (4) to develop, field
              test, and publish a Facilitator's Guide which will enable Playtime is Science
              for Children with Disabilities to be used in schools and after-school programs
              throughout the country; (5) to in stitutionalize the program in participating
              sites; (6) to disseminate project results and materials through training,
              conferences, networks, and publications; and (6) to conduct ongoing evaluation.
                 EEC will work with teachers, staff, parents and children in three different
              types of setting in New York City:  (1) four early elementary public school
              classrooms inclusive of children with and without disabilities; (2) three early
              childhood programs, including an inclusive Head Start center, a special
              education program serving children with a range of disabilities, and a child
              development center serving pre-school children with visual impairments; and (3)
              a large, inclusive after-school program.    By fostering positive science
              experiences, and by increasing parent and staff expertise in enthusiasm for and
              encouragement of science activities, this project will enable children with
              disabilities to gain confidence and skills which will help them succeed in
              science.  By acknowledging and building upon the individual strengths of
              children with disabilities, it will create an inclusive environment that says
              "science is for everyone".
