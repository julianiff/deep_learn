Abstract    :
              9700288  Danai  The objective of this GOALI research is to develop an efficient
              and robust method of tuning and regulation for injection molding processes, so
              that the desired quality of injection molded parts can be readily achieved and
              consistently ensured for commercial production.  An important feature of this
              method will be its ability to select the machine inputs that will minimize
              production cost while satisfying the part quality constraints. The research
              will be conducted at both theoretical and applied levels with close interaction
              with industry partner.  At the theoretical level: (1) the form of the I-0 model
              will be revised to allow for incorporation of qualitative measures of part
              properties; (2) process dynamics will be integrated in the I-0 model in order
              to enhance robustness in presence of process transients and external
              variations; and (3) an optimization strategy will be adopted in the virtual
              search method (VSM) to trade off product quality for reduced product costs.  At
              the applied level, an extensive industrial collaboration program will be
              conducted at GE Plastics with other industry liaisons to identify the stringent
              requirements of production.  The solutions obtained to the application
              requirements in this phase of research are expected to prepare VSM for wide
              area dissemination.  This project will provide valuable leveraging to
              contribute fundamental knowledge in the area process controller for the
              injection molding industry
