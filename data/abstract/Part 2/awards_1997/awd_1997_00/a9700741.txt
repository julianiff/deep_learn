Abstract    :
              EEC-9700741  Salam      Abstract      This award provides funding to Michigan
              State University under the direction of Dr. Faithi Salam, for the support of a
              Combined Research-Curriculum Development project entitled, "Real-time Sensing
              and Control Computing for Automotive Systems." This project proposes to bring 
              research results in the area of real time sensing and control systems into the
              design of a two semester senior level capstone course which will integrate
              electrical engineering and mechanical  engineering curricula.  This curricula 
              development effort will involve a collaborative effort of several universities
              and industrial sponsors from the Big Three automotive producers and other major
              automotive suppliers.  The proposed class format will simulate a
              micro-industrial research environment where industry partners and others would
              select the automotive systems and theme for the year and faculty and industrial
              sponsors would work with the students on projects which would give them a
              hands-on feel of a high tech environment while generating new knowledge which
              feeds back into research on real-time sensing and control.
