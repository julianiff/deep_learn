Abstract    :
              The University of California at Irvine Chemistry Outreach Program   directed by
              Professor James S. Nowick is being supported by the Special   Projects Office
              of the Chemistry Division for a three-year period of   transition from a pilot
              program to long-term funding from the private   sector.  The Chemistry Outreach
              Program aims to improve high school   students' interest in and knowledge of
              chemistry by sending teams of   graduate and undergraduate students to local
              high schools.  The   university students inspire the high school students by
              performing   chemical demonstrations and discussing chemistry, beginning with
              freshmen   students who are encouraged to enroll in chemistry classes.  The
              program,   which reaches about two thousand high school students per year at
              dozens   of Southern California high schools, will establish a web site for  
              dissemination of the instructional materials that it develops and for  
              propagation of this model program as a grassroots effort in educational  
              outreach.  The Chemistry Outreach Program is a university-based effort to
              improve   scientific literacy and inspire young people to pursue careers in
              science   through the vehicle of chemistry demonstrations and discussions in
              high   schools provided by undergraduate and graduate students from the  
              university.
