Abstract    :
              9700004  Noakes  This grant provides funds for the purchase of a multi- 
              dispersive x-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer that will  be incorporated
              into a CAIS-designed shipboard system for  rapid data collection, analysis, and
              mapping in aquatic  environments.  The Continuous Sediment Sampling and
              Analysis  System, or CS, uses a submersible pump mounted on a towed  sled to
              deliver a continuous stream of surface sediments to  a shipboard processor. 
              Samples can be immediately analyzed  for elemental constituents using XRF
              spectroscopy.  The  multi-dispersive instrument incorporates both wavelength- 
              dispersive and energy-dispersive systems in one unit,  providing superior
              analytical results for sediment elemental  constituents by improving
              reliability and reducing the  minimum detection levels that can be measured.
