Abstract    :
               This grant is to purchase a positional measurement system dedicated to support
              of research in manufacturing engineering and ergonomics.  The positional
              measurement system is a video based data acquisition tool which captures the
              location of key components for manufacturing workstations through optical
              sensors and analyzes them using state-of-the-art software.  The equipment will
              be used in several projects, including: (1) the effects of force production and
              fatigue on movement accuracy; and (2) a predictive model of assembly process
              times to improve design for assembly and operational scheduling.  These
              research projects constitute the core investigation of an innovative
              methodology to enhance the effectiveness of manufacturing systems.     The
              positional measurement system enables the increase of speed and accuracy in
              which time and position data can be collected, thus reducing the time required
              to collect the data.  It substantially enhances the research capability and
              academic infrastructure of the institution in manufacturing engineering.
