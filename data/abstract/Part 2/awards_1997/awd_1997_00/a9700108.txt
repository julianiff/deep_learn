Abstract    :
              This starter grant award to the University of California at Los Angeles supports
              the research of Professor  Benjamin J. Schwartz.  The theme of the research is
              ultrafast studies of condensed phase chemical  reactivity.  Both experimental
              and theoretical studies explore the details of solute-solvent coupling in 
              different charge-transfer-to-solvent systems, particularly alkali metal anion
              systems.  Experiments take  advantage of the newest generation of solid-state
              ultrafast lasers, allowing direct one-photon excitation  of the
              charge-transfer-to-solvent band in the iodide system, for example.  Spectral
              studies in both the  ultraviolet and infrared wavelength regimes will
              distinguish between the various physical pictures  proposed for
              charge-transfer-to solvent.  Additional studies varying the solvent, the ion,
              and the excitation  conditions will provide an essentially complete
              understanding of the dynamics important in these  reactions.    This research
              will advance the fundamental understanding of solution phase chemical
              reactivity through  both experimental and theoretical study of solvation
              dynamics.
