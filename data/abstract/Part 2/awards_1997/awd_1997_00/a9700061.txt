Abstract    :
              Finite-model theory is the study of first-order logic and  its extensions on
              classes of finite structures.  In recent  years, several extensions of
              first-order logic have been  investigated in the context of finite-model
              theory.  Fixpoint logic and the finite-variable infinitary logic IL  have
              turned out to be of particular importance.  The study  of fixpoint logic
              generated interactions with both database  theory and complexity theory, while
              the finite-variable  infinitary logic IL proved to be a useful tool for
              analyzing  the expressive power of fixpoint logic.  In addition to  being a
              proper extension of fixpoint logic, IL enjoys a game-  theoretic
              characterization and possesses interesting  structural properties, such as the
              0-1 law.  This project  studies variable-confined logics, that is, logics with
              a  fixed finite number of variables.  This is motivated by the  fact that the
              number of variables is considered a logical  resource in descriptive complexity
              theory and has  computational implications also in the evaluation of  database
              queries and in program verification.  Various  aspects of variable-confined
              first-order, fixpoint, and  infinitary logics, ranging from expressive power,
              algorithms  for deciding truth and validity, and asymptotic  probabilities, are
              studied.***
