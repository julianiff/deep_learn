Abstract    :
              This research focuses on the distance of electron and `positive hole`  
              migration in DNA.  The working paradigm is is that photogenerated   electrons
              and holes migrate from the site of initial generation to   removed sites at
              which strand cleavage or oxidative damage occurs.    Photoactive benzo(a)pyrene
              derivatives are covalently bound,   site-specifically, to commercially
              available DNA fragments  with a   defined  base sequence.   Strand cleavage
              patterns within these defined   systems will be established by high resolution
              gel electrophoresis, and   correlated with the efficiencies of DNA strand
              cleavage and oxidative   damage to assess electron-hole migration distances,
              and the sites within   the biopolymer at which hole-initiated oxidative damage,
              and   electron-initiated strand cleavage occur.    Phototherapeutic and
              photosterilization applications have focused   attention on the mechanism by
              which photoactive reagents oxidatively   damage and/or cleave DNA duplexes. 
              With this award, Professor Geacintov   will elucidate the distances of charge
              migration in DNA fragments having   a defined base sequence thereby identifying
              the sites at which strand   cleavage and oxidative damage occur.
