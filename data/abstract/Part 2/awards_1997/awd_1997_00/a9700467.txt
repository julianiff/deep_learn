Abstract    :
              This research project deals with an in-depth analysis of  rotating mechanical
              systems. Such systems are modelled by  ordinary differential equations with
              periodically varying  coefficients. The models are very often high-dimensional,
               possess non-linearities that cannot be neglected, and depend  on many widely
              varying design parameters. The point-mapping  based methodology used in this
              research combines the  advantages of analytical methods that allow qualitative 
              analysis and the ability of numerical  methods to analyze  high-order systems
              with parameters varying over a large  range. The point mapping approach results
              in an analytical  representation of discrete-time dynamics of the rotating 
              system. The equations for steady-state solutions, conditions  of stability and
              bifurcation of these solutions, and  sensitivity of the system's behavior to
              design parameters  are formulated in terms of closed-form algebraic equations. 
              The analytical formulation allows design tradeoffs to be  performed using
              computer algebra. The research includes  development and implementation of the
              theoretical and  computational aspects of the point mapping based  methodology,
              and study of important classes of rotating  systems. In each application, a
              detailed sensitivity and  design tradeoff analysis as a function of system
              parameters  is performed using high-speed computation algorithms.
