              Abstract.    Statistical wavelet modeling and computational research have,   in
              recent years, become burgeoning areas in both theoretical   and applied
              statistics, and are beginning to impact developments   in statistical
              methodology and in various applied scientific fields.  Wavelet ideas are
              developing in statistics in areas such as   regression, density and function
              estimation, factor analysis,   modeling and forecasting in time series
              analysis, spatial statistics,   with ranges of application areas in science and
              engineering.  The emerging interests in Bayesian statistical modeling and
              wavelets   is generating exciting new directions for the interface of two
              research areas, with significant potential for future impact on applied work.  
               This international research workshop, focused on the interface of  wavelets
              and statistical science, is held in recognition of the recent   growth and
              current vibrancy of research at the interface of the   disciplines.  The
              meeting will provide an opportunity to summarize   the current status of
              research on wavelets in statistics, to explore   the applied impact that
              statistical wavelet modeling and wavelet in   statistics are having, and to
              suggest and stimulate novel theoretical,   methodological and computational
              research directions.  The workshop is   planned at an opportune time to assess
              and address the dual question   of the future prospects: for significant
              contributions of wavelet   ideas to statistical science and application, and
              for furthering   watelet-based technology through the use of statistical
              concepts and   models.
