Abstract    :
              9700811  Webster  One of the goals of parental investment theory is to explain
              parental decisions based upon costs and benefits of the behavior.  Recent use
              of molecular techniques has reveal that, in many systems, offspring are not
              necessarily sired by their social fathers  Several studies have considered
              whether this reduction in paternity affects male parental care, and mixed
              findings have resulted.  Few, however, have gone further to examine the
              mechanisms behind the observed male behavior.      This two-year project will
              examine factors influencing male responses to reduced paternity in a North
              American passerine, the Black-throated Blue Warbler.  Variation in parentage
              within broods has been detected in previous seasons; a combination of
              multilocus DNA fingerprinting and PCR-amplified microsatellites will be used to
              identify genetic fathers of all offspring in upcoming years.  Focal
              observations and experimental manipulations will both be used to distinguish
              between a set of alternative hypotheses set forth to explain male parental care
              patterns in response to reductions in paternity.  This study will help explain
              the currently poorly understood patterns of within- and between- species
              variation in parental care provide information about factors influencing male
              adaptive responses, and add to knowledge of the breeding ecology of this
              species.
