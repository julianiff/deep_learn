Abstract    :
              9700680  Fung    This  project involves the further development and
              implementation  of  new  nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)  techniques  and 
              their  application to the study of liquid crystals of current  interest,  viz.,
              ferroelectric and antoferroelectric systems.  The NMR  data  will  be  combined
              with Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) results  to  be  generated through a
              collaboration with colleagues at  the  University of Colorado.  This
              comprehensive approach will be used  to  advance  a theoretical modeling
              approach that will contribute  to  the understanding of molecular conformations
              and interactions  on  the  phase  behavior of liquid crystals, and perhaps  to 
              the  formulation of new low-viscosity nematic mixtures.  %%%  The  synthesis
              and properties of new liquid crystal  systems  are  playing  an increasingly
              important role in advancing a number  of  applications  areas that include new
              materials for  infrared  and  microwave  liquid  crystal modulators, and
              fast-switching  liquid  crystal  displays.   Furthermore, since  the  phase 
              behavior  of  liquid  crystal mixtures formulated to optimize certain materials
               properties is often complicated and unpredictable, the  focus  of  these 
              studies  should advance significantly  the  use  of  these  systems for
              industrial uses.  ***
