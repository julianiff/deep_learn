Abstract    :
                    9700356  Boyd  The basic work towards the development of new micro-fluidic
              MEMS  devices that convert the latent heat of liquid/vapor transformation  into
              the work of the shape memory alloy martenistic transformation  with no need for
              complicated kinematic linkages is being conducted.   These devices have
              industrial applications such as arterial clamps,  medical catheters, stenosis
              blocks, drives for micropumps, etc.   The thermomechanics of coupled
              solid/solid liquid/vapor phase  transformations is being studies.  Both
              analytical studies and  their experimental verification are being conducted. 
              Nickel-  titanium (NITINOL) materials are being studies in this work.  ***
