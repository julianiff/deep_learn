Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT  Proposal Number CTS-9700055  Principle Investigator: Lucht    This 
              is a grant for the purchase of an electron-bombarded charge-coupled device
              (EBCCD) digital camera system.  The EBCCD is a new type of array detector which
              uses a back illuminated CCD (BCCD) chip as the anode of a vacuum photodiode. 
              The  gain process is much less noisy than the gain process in multi-channel
              plates (MCPs), the basis of the gain process for nearly all intensified CC
              cameras at present.  The EBCCD offers numerous advantages compared to
              MCP-intensified CCDS, including better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), greater
              dynamic range, and much better image quality. The EBCCD also has better
              sensitivity at low light levels.  An important feature for combustion
              applications is that the EBCCD can be gated by turning the voltage between the
              photocathode and anode on and off with minimum gate widths down to at least 100
              nsec.  Thus the EBCCD can be used for laser imaging measurements in flames,
              whereas the unintensified BCCD cannot be used for such measurements because of
              background flame luminosity.
