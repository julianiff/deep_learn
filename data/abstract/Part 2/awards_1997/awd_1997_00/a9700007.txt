Abstract    :
               Rapid prototyping by curing polymers with laser light has created considerable
              interests in industry to generate three dimensional parts directly from
              Computer Aided Design (CAD) drawings to aid design processes.  Laser cladding
              by layers offers the possibility of fabrication of 100% dense metal component.
              The objective of this research is to develop a Laser Aided Metal Deposition
              System (LAMDS) capable of forming near 100% dense three-dimensional objects
              directly from CAD drawing.  The project will develop a fundamental
              understanding between the process parameters for laser aided metal deposition
              of H13 steel with deposit dimension with 10-100 micron accuracy, microstructure
              and mechanical properties.   The research project has a balance between theory
              and experiment, and will provide valuable findings for the tools and dies
              manufacturing industry.
