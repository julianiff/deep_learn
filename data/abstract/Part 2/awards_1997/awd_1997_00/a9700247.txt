Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT  Proposal Number: CTS-9700247  Principal Inveqtigator: Wirtz    This
              is a grant to purchase a low-intensity CCD camera system with a controller,
              monochromator and three-dimensional motor controlled microscope stage.  This
              system will be used for imaging the transport of fluorescently-labeled
              macromolecules. An innovative magnetic force technique will be used to generate
              calibrated forces on fluorescently-labeled macromolecules, such as DNA,
              allowing for measurement of transport coefficients, e.g. relaxation time,
              friction coefficient and diffusion time.  It is expected that this system will
              offer unique advantages for research in polymer and colloidal science and
              engineering.
