Abstract    :
                The detailed understanding of the mechanisms of action of extreme  pressure
              lubricant additives is the focus of the research of this  project supported in
              the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  Program.  Professor Tysoe at the
              University of Wisconsin-  Milwaukee investigates these questions by using a
              combination of  ultra high vacuum surface spectroscopic measurements, thin film
               growth studies, and tribological investigations of model systems.   Building
              on the understanding of chlorine containing extreme  pressure lubricant
              additives developed previously in this  laboratory, this project explores the
              mechanisms of action of  sulfur and phosphorous containing additives.   A
              connection  between the surface chemistry of these materials and their 
              operation as lubricants is sought in this work.  A detailed  microscopic
              understanding of tribological processes is of  considerable utility in a number
              of technologically important  areas, including metalworking, disk head
              lubrication, and the  transportation industries.  Understanding the atomic
              level processes occurring when one  material slides over another in the
              presence of a lubricant  molecule is the focus of the research of this project.
               A  combination of surface spectroscopic studies and direct measures  of
              friction forces for a series of model lubricant molecules will  provide this
              understanding.  Friction and wear is a relatively  underexplored area of
              surface science, and the work of this  project will contribute to our growing
              understanding of this  technologically important area.
