Abstract    :
              EEC-9700702      Abstract    The award provides funding to the University of
              Notre Dame under the direction of Dr. Michael M. Stanisic, for the support of a
              Combined Research-Curriculum Development project entitled, "Vision-Based
              Control of Dextrous Manipulators in High Precision Tasks."  This project will
              develop a four-course sequence for upper-level undergraduate and entry-level
              graduate students at the University of Notre Dame.  The sequence will teach
              students about the design and control of a new class of dextrous manipulators,
              capable of manufacturing tasks which are prohibitively difficult or costly to
              achieve with existing technology.  The capstone course in the sequence involves
              students programming a dextrous manipulatory to perform such manufacturing
              tasks, tasks drawn from an Industrial Advisory Panel, which is a key element of
              this project. The research aspect of the proposal extends the technologies
              involved, developing a new type of singularity-free manipulator, as well as
              extending the calibration-free, vision-based control algorithm to an easily
              used "point-and-click" means of task programming.
