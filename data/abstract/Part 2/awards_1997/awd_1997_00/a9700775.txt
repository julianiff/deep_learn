Abstract    :
              EEC-9700775      ABSTRACT      The award provides funding to Colorado School of
              Mines under the direction of Dr. Rahmat Shoureshi, for the support of a
              Combined Research-Curriculum Development project entitled, " Combined
              Research-Curriculum Development on Diagnostics, Health Assessment, and
              Predictive Maintenance of Engineered Processes and Systems."  This project
              proposes to develop and incorporate a research-based comprehensive curriculum
              in the area of diagnostics, health assessment, and preventive maintenance.  The
              key objective of the program is to educate a new generation of engineers who
              would have analytical background knowledge, and appreciation for the vital area
              of diagnostics and health assessment of processes and engineered products.
