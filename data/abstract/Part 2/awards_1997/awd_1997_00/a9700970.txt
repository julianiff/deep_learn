Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to lessen the impact of the increasing speed 
              disadvantage of memories when compared to processors.  The focus in this
              project  will be the design and evaluation of profiling techniques and hardware
                assists to allow better utilization and performance of the memory hierarchy.
              The  planned efforts are to (1) improve the efficiency of on-chip caches by
              using  better code and data placement informed by profiling;  (2) determine
              when it is  advantageous to bypass the data cache;  (3) take advantage of page
              and burst  modes of modern DRAMs;  (4) investigate methods to reduce data
              latency by  prefetching;  and (5)  design hardware assists at the main memory
              interface for  compaction or partial transfer of data.  These techniques will
              be evaluated using  trace-driven simulations or profiling of binary executables
              for SPEC benchmarks  and commercial applications.
