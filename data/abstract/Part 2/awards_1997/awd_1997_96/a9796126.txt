Abstract    :
              ***  9634786  Chen         This grant provides funding for research on an
              innovative approach to rapid modeling of flexible manufacturing systems (FMS). 
              The objectives are: (1) to develop an effective analytical modeling technique
              capable of capturing the effect of material handling devices and the impact of
              component reliability and maintainability on overall system performance and (2)
              to enhance the understanding of interactions among the components of FMS via
              rapid approximation of critical system parameters not presently attainable in
              existing analytical models.         This research, if successful, will have a
              significant impact on the manufacturing science base.  Its unique features
              include (1) elimination of sophisticated simulation modeling and lengthy
              modeler training, (2) reduction of project implementation costs, and (3)
              reduction of project implementation lead time.  This powerful approach to
              modeling automated manufacturing systems also has a potential to enhance the
              functionality of the emerging manufacturing execution system being pursued by
              many major US Corporations.    ***
