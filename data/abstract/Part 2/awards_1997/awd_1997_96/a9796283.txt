Abstract    :
              9504536  Jones       This project will attempt to refine the use of Sr isotopes 
              in fossil fish teeth for precise age control of otherwise-  undatable
              sediments.  Two questions will be addressed, one  dealing with the best
              cleaning method for removal of all coatings  and the second examining evidence
              for alteration (diagenesis) of  the teeth themselves.  ***
