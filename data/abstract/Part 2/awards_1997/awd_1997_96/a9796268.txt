Abstract    :
              This award is for support for a program to make high resolution  studies of
              variations in the concentration of methane, the oxygen-  isotope composition of
              paleoatmospheric oxygen, and the total gas  content of deep Antarctic ice
              cores.  Studies of the  concentration and isotopic composition of air in the
              firn of the  Antarctic ice sheet will also be continued.  One objective of 
              this work is to use the methane concentration and oxygen-isotope  composition
              of oxygen of air in ice as time-stratigraphic markers  for the precise
              intercorrelation of Greenland and Antarctic ice  cores as well as the
              correlation of ice cores to other climatic  records.  A second objective is to
              use variations in the  concentration and interhemispheric gradient of methane
              measured  in Greenland and Antarctic ice cores to deduce changes in 
              continental climates and biogeochemistry on which the atmospheric  methane
              distribution depends.  A third objective is to use data  on the variability of
              total gas content in the Siple Dome ice  core to reconstruct aspects of the
              glacial history of West  Antarctica during the last glacial maximum.  The
              fourth objective  is to participate in collaborative studies of firn air
              chemistry  at Vostok, Siple Dome, and South Pole which will yield much new 
              information about gas trapping in ice as well as the  concentration history and
              isotopic composition of greenhouse  gases, oxygen, trace biogenic gases and
              trace anthropogenic gases  during the last 100 years.
