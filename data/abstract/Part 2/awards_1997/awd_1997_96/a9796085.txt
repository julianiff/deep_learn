Abstract    :
              This research is on formal analysis of the scheduling problem in  high-level
              synthesis.  Problems being addressed are: (1) finding  the length of the
              control step (clock estimation); (2) determining  the type of functional unit
              that will perform each operation (type  mapping); (3) computing the lower bound
              on overall schedule length;  and (4) estimating the lower bound on the number
              of functional  units.
