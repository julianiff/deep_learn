Abstract    :
              ***  9633594  Lindell    This research will assess differences in the extent to
              which  social units located in areas with different levels of  seismic
              vulnerability vary in their adoption of earthquake  hazard adjustments, and
              also will identify variables  predicting these differences in adoption
              behavior. The study  will examine measures that function actively
              (preparedness),  as well as passively (mitigation), at the time of earthquake 
              impact to minimize deaths, injuries, property damage, and  loss of function.
              The study will involve two different types  of social units--households and
              complex organizations, with  the latter category divided into private
              businesses and  government agencies. Government agencies will be divided 
              further into those with an emergency component  in their  mission statements
              (e.g., fire and police departments,  emergency management offices) and those
              without such a  component (city manager's offices, finance departments,  social
              services, etc.). The research project also will  address characteristics of the
              physical and social  environment affecting each of these types of social units.
               Variations in the physical environment will be examined by  studying social
              units at high (southern California) and  medium (western Washington) seismic
              risk.***
