Abstract    :
              9410752  Baruah      The project will investigate approaches to deal with the 
              performance depredations resulting from transient overloads  in time-critical
              applications. The research aims to  understand the behavior of resource
              allocation algorithms  under overload conditions, with the goal of building 
              overload-tolerant systems. More specifically, the project  will address the
              following problems    a). Identification and analysis of new performance
              metrics      for characterizing systems with overload conditions.        b).
              The design and analysis of scheduling algorithms for      systems with overload
              conditions.        c). Applicability of various computational paradigms (e.g., 
                  randomized, parallel) to the design of overload-tolerant      systems.     
                d). The identification of heuristics and guidelines that may      assist the
              designer of overload-tolerant systems.            The result of the project
              will play a role in the design      of systems and algorithms that guarantee
              optimal or near      optimal performance.        ***
