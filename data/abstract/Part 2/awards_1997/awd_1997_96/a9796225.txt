Abstract    :
              OCE 96-33465  Bogden    The project will apply a generalized inverse method to
              the problem of   estimating tides and residual currents in under-sampled fields
              such   as those generated by Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs)  
              operated from moving ships. Shipboard ADCP sampling suffers from   inherent
              limitations which necessitate separation of tides and low-  frequency flows
              during post-processing. The generalized inverse   method will improve on
              existing least-squares fitting techniques by   explicitly including dynamical
              constraints. In addition to   development and assessment of the generalized
              inverse method,   emphasis will be placed on evaluating and designing optimal
              sampling   strategies for use in field studies.
