Abstract    :
              9453145  Lindsey    The Midland Public Schools plan to enhance all their
              elementary  teachers in science.  This project builds on their focusing on 
              elementary science beginning in 1989.  At that time they partnered  with the
              community and developed a centralized materials and  technical support system. 
              The project will take place over a three  year period, and will combine the
              resources of the Midland Public  Schools, private industry, universities, and
              the community, to  support a well-defined, inquiry-based, hands-on science
              teaching  methodology in each of Midland's 12 elementary schools.  The 
              institute will consist of a two week summer institute for an  initial group of
              118 teachers.  Twenty-four (two from each of the  12 buildings) of these
              teaches will be prepared to become science  mentors for their schools.  A final
              week will occur during the  school year.  Trained along side of the teachers
              will be substitute  teachers.    In each of the subsequent two years, an
              additional 70 teachers will  participate with the core group of 24 leaders and
              24 substitutes.    The project requested $713,936 from NSF with
              institutions/agencies  and the school district providing 229% in cost sharing.
