Abstract    :
                   PI will test the assumption that Paleozoic crinoids had only              
              ligamentary articulations, rather than the muscular arms of modern             
              crinoids, by a variety of methods, including experiments and                   
              observations on modern crinoids, isotopic analyses, and studies of             
              fossil crinoids.  This project will improve our understanding of               
              crinoid functional morphology and provide new information for                  
              studying preservational and evolutionary patterns.
