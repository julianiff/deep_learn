Abstract    :
                    This project will investigate the lives of women and children in two Yupik
              Eskimo communities on Saint Lawrence Island, Alaska, and in Chukotka, Russia. 
              The people of both communities, Gambell and Sireniki, are close kin and still
              strongly identify themselves as Yupik, but they have experienced very different
              histories of contact with Western policies and cultures.  The researchers will
              work with elders, with family groups, and with Yupik women in community work
              forces.  Life histories will be recorded as well as documentation of
              childbearing tasks, interactions of families and in education settings. 
              Analysis of words related to emotions and values will also be carried out.  The
              special features of the research are the circumpolar comparisons, the
              combinations of multifaceted methodologies, the attention paid to women,
              children and family life and a focus on cultural psychology, the nature of
              personhood, and the socialization of emotions and values.
