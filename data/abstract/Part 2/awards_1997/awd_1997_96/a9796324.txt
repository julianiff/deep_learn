Abstract    :
              9522963  Nnaju    Research conducted under this award is to develop a product
              assembly modeler (PAM), which provides detailed information for successful
              mechanical or manual assemblies of a product.  This modeler includes
              requirements for the assembly environment, feasible approach directions,
              precedence constraints, symmetries, and spatial relationships.  The spatial
              relationships of the design give product specifications, functional
              requirements, and define the mating  positions and degrees of freedom of motion
              of components.  PAM is equipped with its own on-board graphics capabilities for
              visual assistance.    This research applies the mathematical theory of symmetry
              to spatial reasoning in an effort to simplify the computation and geometric
              complexities of product assembly.  If successful, the result will be a
              stand-alone product assembly moderler, designed to assist in the assembly of
              product that accurately demonstrates the designer's intentions.
