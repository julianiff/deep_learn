Abstract    :
              9615789  Lathrop    This grant provides $83,279 as partial support of the costs
              of  developing an experimental dynamo via testing of a prototype  apparatus
              which thermally forces convection of liquid Sodium in  an annulus in an attempt
              to generate a magnetic field.  In order  to achieve large enough fluid
              velocities in this apparatus, the  titanium rotor which has been designed to
              handle large stresses  will need to be rotated at 25,000 rpm.  Such high
              rotation rates  are necessary to overcome the scaling problems of an
              experimental  apparatus designed to model the Earth's geomagnetic field.  The 
              development of an experimental dynamo has been a fundamental  unsolved problem
              in geophysics and an unfulfilled dream of  international researchers for the
              last 40 years.  The technical  difficulties of creating a laboratory sized
              system capable of  generating a large enough magnetic Reynolds number to
              simulate  the Earth's geodynamo have been daunting.  This instrument, which 
              has already been built and used for preliminary tests will shed  light on the
              physics of fluid dynamos and has the potential to  produce a magnetic field for
              the first time in a laboratory  experiment.  ***
