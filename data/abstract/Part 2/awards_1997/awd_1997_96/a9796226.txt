Abstract    :
                                                                            9222669  Ho  This
              action is to instrument 0a permanent reinforced earth  structure or tried-back
              wall located in a seismic region of  California.  This geotechnical structure
              utilizes inclusions  (such as tie-backs, soil nails, reinforcing strips and 
              geotextiles) to provide stability.    The purpose of the instrumentation is to
              provide a means to  collect data on the response to a future earthquake: the 
              response of these structures to seismic loading is unknown.  The measured
              response will be compared to the predicted  performance, thereby providing the
              necessary link between  design and performance.  Periodic maintenance of the 
              instrumentation and the retrieval of measured data will be  coordinated between
              the U.S. Geological Survey and  Washington State University.  ***
