Abstract    :
              9400180  Raj       The goal of this research is the development of a new  
              manufacturing design concept for the synthesis of single crystal   thin films
              of complex oxides from metalorganic precursors.  The   concept embodies
              molecular control for layer-by-layer growth, large   area single crystal growth
              of thin films, low environmental impact,   and a table top design that is
              economical and flexible.  The   concept employs pulsed injection of very small
              amounts of liquid   precursors directly into a low pressure reactor in order to
              achieve   atom-layer by atom-layer growth of single crystal films.  The use  of
              an  ultrasonic nozzle to obtain reproducible deposition per  pulse is a special
              feature of the research.  The specific objective   of the research is to
              develop viable models for the processing   parameters that can be used to
              tailor manufacturing systems, based   on the proposed concept, for specific
              applications.             The process that will result from this research will
              enable   monolayer-level control for the growth rate of the single crystal  
              films used in microelectronic devices and, at the same time, allow  
              considerable flexibility, cost-effectiveness and manufacturing   potential for
              making films of various compositions of large area   substrates.
