Abstract    :
                Gary, Dale  AST  9618538      The Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) Solar
              Array  provides a unique capability for  imaging and spectroscopy in a broad
              range of microwave  frequencies.  The array will be used by  investigators at a
              number of institutions to study the  physical parameters of the solar
              atmosphere,  with particular attention to conditions in active regions  and the
              temporal and spatial development  of solar flares.  During the grant period,
              the facility will  be upgraded to include two new  antennas which will
              effectively double the baseline for  imaging and double the spatial resolution 
              in the east-west direction.  Upgrades to the data  acquisition system will
              increase observing time  by 40% and provide a more responsive analysis system
              for  users, including those accessing data  remotely.  ***
