Abstract    :
              9632879  KJER  This study involves a molecular phylogenetic analysis of higher
              level (suborder and family) relationships among members of the caddisflies
              (Insecta: Trichoptera) based on sequence data from both the mitochondrial and
              nuclear genomes.  Knowledge of the phylogeny and evolution of this group of
              aquatic insects is of interest to freshwater ecologists, behavioral biologists,
              biodiversity advocates (Trichoptera larvae are classic water quality
              indicators), and historical biogeographers.  In particular, the evolution of
              case and retreat making behavior of the immatures has been the center of
              spirited debate.  Three competing hypotheses have emerged for the evolution of
              these traits that differ in their presumed character state homologies and
              transformation series (TS).  The molecular phylogeny provided by this
              investigation will be used to test the alternate TS, using character mapping;
              preliminary results suggest that putative homologies of some behaviors will
              need to be reassessed. This research will also address methodological issues
              such as weighting schemes, Transition-transversion bias, and how to incorporate
              secondary structure concerns in rRNA analysis; these methodological concerns
              are of broad interest to the systematic community.   This award will help
              support training of graduate students in modern methods of molecular systematic
              analysis and enhance our knowledge of this important element of insect
              biodiversity.  Caddisflies are important elements of fresh water ecosystems and
              their species composition in streams has been used to assess and monitor water
              quality.
