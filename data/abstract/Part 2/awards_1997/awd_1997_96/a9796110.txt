Abstract    :
              9406567  Gordon      The PI will continue his research using the shapes of
              marine  magnetic anomalies due to seafloor spreading for estimating  accurate
              paleomagnetic poles for oceanic lithosphere.  These new,  more accurate, poles
              permit testing of plate reconstructions,  testing for the motion of hotspots
              relative to the spin axis and to  one another, testing of the axial geocentric
              dipole hypothesis and  estimating the time-averaged quadrupole component of the
               paleomagnetic field, and investigating other problems of global  tectonics,
              geomagnetism, and geodynamics.  ****
