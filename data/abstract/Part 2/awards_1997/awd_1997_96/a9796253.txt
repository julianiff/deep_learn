Abstract    :
              9634612    Cane    This award will support a study of the relationship between
              radiocarbon variability and   circulation in the upper waters of the tropical
              Pacific Ocean.  Specific topics include:   1. the   physical processes which
              determine the distribution and variability of tropical sea surface   Carbon-14;
                  2. the physics determining the observed thermocline inventory of bomb  
              Carbon-14;  and,   3. the pathways and timescales for the exchange of
              thermocline waters   between the subtropical and tropical gyres.  This is a
              collaborative study, in which scientists   at Princeton will focus on analysis
              of historical records of C14 found in coral reefs, while   scientists at
              Columbia University will apply numerical modeling techniques to the problem.
