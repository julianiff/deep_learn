Abstract    :
                  9310085  Liu  The purpose of this research initiation award (RIA) is to
              conduct  research to determine the thermomechanical properties and behavior  of
              VLSI semiconductor devices.  Experiments and analytical studies  will be
              performed to measure the material response and the  interfacial strength for
              various bi-material combinations such as  thin specimens of metal/polymer,
              silicon/metal, fiber reinforced  layer/metal, and fiber reinforced
              layer/patterned metal at elevated  temperatures and various moisture levels. 
              The emphasis of these  experiments will be on determining the mode dependent
              interface  fracture toughness for delamination.  Then, damage tolerance 
              analyses of packaging devices, based on analytical/numerical  modeling, will be
              performed and the results will be compared to  data obtained from experimental
              test chips.  ***
