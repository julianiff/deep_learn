Abstract    :
              9306493  Fleming    An important function of estradiol(E2) is to regulate growth
              and  differentiation of endometrial cells by causing changes in their  RNA
              transcriptional program. Experiments are planned to allow  detection of
              changing mRNA levels in cultured human endometrial  cells in response to
              physiological concentrations of E2. The  Ishikawa cell line has been shown to
              retain its ability to  respond to E2: proliferation can be stimulated and
              specific  proteins can be induced. Changing levels of mRNAs will be studied  in
              a systematic way during the first 24 hours following the  addition of E2. Other
              mRNAs (secondary responses) will not appear  for many hours because their
              induction requires the synthesis of  a protein induced as part of the primary
              response. Experiments  are suggested to detect these two different classes of
              mRNA.  Additional experiment are planneed to look for other classes of  mRNAs
              induced by E2 in these cells and to study and compare  characterstic responses
              of different classes of mRNA to different  inhibitors.  ***
