Abstract    :
              9522516  Hammer  This proposal is on research to use rat basophilic leukemia
              (RBL)  cells to study the relationship between chemical recognition and  cell
              adhesion under hydrodynamic flow.  Antigen-coated  polyacrylamide gel
              substrates will be synthesized, and the  adhesion of murine immunoglobulin E
              (lgE)-coated RBL cells to  these substrates will be measured in a
              parallel-plate flow  chamber.  Adhesion will be measured with optical
              videomicroscopy.   Studies which use multiple lgE-antigen pairs with different 
              properties of chemical recognition will be performed.  The effect  of adhesion
              on flow rate, antigen and lgE surface densities, and  rate and affinity of
              chemical binding will be measured.  Also,  the conditions that promote optimal
              cell detachment, such as  applied hydrodynamic force and soluble antigen
              competitor  concentration, will be determined.  In addition, and advanced  form
              of flow chamber and a computer simulation method will be  developed.  ***
