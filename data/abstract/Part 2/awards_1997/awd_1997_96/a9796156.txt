Abstract    :
                   The major thrust of this research is to explore the argument              
              and generic concept of applying concurrent engineering concepts to             
              the design of advanced manufacturing systems.  The central theme               
              is threefold:  (1) to identify the framework and develop                       
              implementation guidelines necessary for robust manufacturing system            
              design by concurrently considering critical issues including                   
              maintainability, reliability, decomposability, operation, and                  
              management; (2) to substantiate the "design for operation and                  
              management" concept through development and extensive                          
              experimentations of two realistic operation and planning models for            
              flexible manufacturing systems (FMS), namely, the Part-Selection               
              Model and the Tool Assignment Model; and (3) to lay solid                      
              groundwork for further research into the tools and modules to                  
              realize design for maintainability, reliability and                            
              decomposability.                                                               
                   Advanced manufacturing technology, such as flexible                       
              manufacturing, is still a very expensive and high risk solution                
              which demands an extremely customized approach to system design and            
              configuration.  It is not what an FMS user has purchased but how               
              the FMS user will operate it in an overall and totally integrated              
              way that makes the effective use of the new technology.  The PI's              
              industrial experience has provided a vivid testimony for the above             
              statement.  The plausible remedy is to revolutionize the typical               
              process of acquiring a manufacturing system where the system                   
              designer (FMS supplier) passes down whatever is done to the                    
              operation personnel and wishing that the FMS will live up to the               
              performance level as required by the management.
