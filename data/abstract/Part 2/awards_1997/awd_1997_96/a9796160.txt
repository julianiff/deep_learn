Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a Presidential Young Investigator award to an individual               
              who has begun an exciting research program on small RNA plant                  
              viruses.  He has, in addition, a record that shows great promise               
              as a teacher and research mentor, and has taken initiatives in                 
              establishing interactions between his institution and regional                 
              undergraduate institutions.  He thus shows great promise in                    
              developing the interests of young people in science and in serving             
              as a role model for potential future scientists.//
