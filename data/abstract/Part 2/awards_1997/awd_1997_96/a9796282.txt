Abstract    :
              9317522  Christensen         The Southern Sierra Nevada Continental Dynamics
              Project  (SSCDP) involves multidisciplinary traverses across and along the 
              Sierra Nevada Range in order to ascertain the structure of the  crust and upper
              mantle beneath this terrane.  The objectives of  this research are to resolve
              the cause of uplift of the Sierra  Nevada cordillera and the relationship of
              this terrane to the  adjoining Death Valley extensional province and the
              southern San  Joaquin Basin.  Complimentary to these goals, this project
              involves  a collaborative effort to characterize the physical properties of 
              systematically collected samples along these traverses.  These data  will make
              a significant contribution to constraining seismic models  proposed as a result
              of remote sensing methods and will directly  complement the ongoing
              petrographic analysis of the variable  lithologies extant in this region.  ***
