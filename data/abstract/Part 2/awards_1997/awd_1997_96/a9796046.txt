Abstract    :
              9319409  Subramanian       A new computational prototyping tool is proposed for 
              conceptual design and simulation of opto-electromechanical devices.   The
              primary objective is to improve the quality of designed  products and to reduce
              the number of physical prototyping  iterations by using this tool in early
              design.  A compositional  technique of constructing complex design topologies
              by putting  together known design fragments in a systematic manner is used.  
              This process is grounded in a set of primitive design fragments  which are
              parameterized solutions to specialized sets of design  constraints.  The focus
              is on multi-domain designs, in particular  designs with electrical, optical and
              mechanical components; instead  of single domain designs.  Constraints are a
              unifying  representation in the design process.  The behavior of multi-domain 
              devices is specified as sets of constraints, the process of  generating
              alternate conceptual designs is that of constraint  solving, and the design
              tool as a  whole is embedded in a  constraint programming environment.  The
              constraint-based  unification achieves rapid generation of conceptual
              alternatives,  and tight integration of design with fast simulation to verify 
              behavior.
