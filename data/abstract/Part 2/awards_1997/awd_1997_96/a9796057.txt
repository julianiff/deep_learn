Abstract    :
              9320440  Wolpert      This award will provide funds to purchase a
              high-performance workstation and laboratory bench equipment to facilitate the
              design and testing of elaborate custom integrated circuits in support of a
              number of research projects including the following:     (1) Examination of a
              Neuronal Algorithm Using VLSI-Based Models: This project is an evaluation of
              the singularity of the relationship between the hardware and software of
              biological neural networks.  It involves implementing a custom VLSI-based model
              of a well-documented network of biological neurons and comparing the electrical
              signals resident in this network with those of its biological counterpart.    
              (2) A Multichannel Sensor for Extracellular Potentials: The objective of this
              project is the development and evaluation of a multipolar nerve cuff electrode
              that can not only sense impulses from outside of a nerve bundle, but discern
              their point of origin within the fiber.  In the final phase of this study, the
              electrodes will be installed and tested on a preparation of lateral eye and
              optic nerve of Limulus, the horseshoe crab.    (3) An Intelligent Signal
              Detection System: The main objective of this project is to study and develop a
              generic, modular and expandable software/hardware platform interfaceable with
              the existing monitoring systems where many visions can be developed, tested,
              evaluated and integrated.  ***                  <o\  #    CONTROL HLP
