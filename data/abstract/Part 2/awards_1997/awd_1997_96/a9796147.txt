Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to develop modular and  parallelizable
              algorithms for problems in adaptive filtering,  robust estimation, control, and
              structured matrix computations.  A  major motivation for this work is the need
              to properly identify,  model, and exploit convenient structures that might
              exist in a  particular problem in order to develop a computationally effective 
              solution.  An intrinsic and relevant part of the proposed work is  to first
              identify common ingredients, as well as to explicitly  clarify, the
              interrelations and interplays that exist among several  problems in the
              disciplines of control, signal processing, and  mathematics.    In this regard,
              the proposed research develops a unifying point of  view that simultaneously
              addresses a variety of seemingly unrelated  problems in estimation, control,
              adaptive filtering, and matrix  computations.  It shows that the solutions to
              many applications in  these areas turn out to share a key and surprisingly
              simple  ingredient, namely, that of computing the triangular factors of 
              matrices that exhibit structure.  The significance of this  particular fact
              and, more generally, of the proposed research as a  whole, is that it enables
              several well-understood concepts from  matrix theory and linear algebra to be
              applied in order to simplify  the derivation of a variety of algorithms, to
              propose new  computationally efficient variants, and to exploit new forms of 
              structure.    The proposed research consists of theoretical investigations and 
              algorithm implementations.  The techniques developed in this work  have
              applications in several areas including, among others, new  windowing schemes
              for adaptive RLS filtering, analysis of gradient-  based algorithms, and
              modular and square-root algorithms for  instrumental variable methods, robust
              estimation, and control.   Equally important is the development of a systematic
              and unifying  methodology.
