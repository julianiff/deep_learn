Abstract    :
              Most existing models of mobile computing systems assume the  presence of
              stationary base stations connected by a high  bandwidth wireline network
              backbone. Such systems are not  suitable for digital battlefield situations and
              emergency  response operations. Hence, there is a need for mobile  computing
              systems with mobile base stations. The flexibility  and robustness of such
              systems is at the cost of  increased complexity. Some of the problems that
              arise are:  (i) Difficulty in providing cellular coverage to the entire 
              service area all the time. (ii) Changing configuration of  cells complicates
              wireless channel allocation. Also, some  wireless channels are needed for
              communication links  between the mobile base stations. (iii) Mobile base
              stations  and the backbone links between them are resource poor  compared to
              their static counterparts. (iv) Changing  cellular configuration makes location
              management and  communication handoffs between cells more complicated.  In
              order to solve some of the problems mentioned above, a  five step approach will
              be adopted: (i) Formalization of a  taxonomy of mobile computing systems based
              on the mobility  pattern of base stations. (ii) Development of stochastic 
              models with different base station mobility characteristics.  (iii) Employment
              of analytical results in the development  ofdistributed algorithms for cell
              planning, channel  allocation, location management, and handoff management. 
              (iv) Simulation experiments to measure the performance of  these algorithms.
              (v) Software implementations of the  algorithms. Time and resource permitting,
              the software  solutions will be ported to off-the-shelf computation and 
              wireless communication devices.***
