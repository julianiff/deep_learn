Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Majumdar  9625812      Fundamental development of scanning thermal
              microscopy and application of the technique to microscale heat transport in a
              variety of electronic devices and interfaces is proposed.   The goal is to
              obtain a spatial resolution of 1-10 nm and a temporal resolution of 10 ns in
              temperature measurement.  Thermal probing of self-assembled conducting polymers
              and polymeric light-emitting devices will be attemped.  In addition,
              temperature measurements of vertical cavity surface emitting lasers and
              interfaces of related quantum structures are planned.  The scanning thermal
              microscope will also be applied to reliability studies of solid-solid
              interfaces, such as diamond on silicon.
