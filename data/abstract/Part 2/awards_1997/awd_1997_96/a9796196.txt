Abstract    :
              This grant will continue operations of the Big Bear Solar  Observatory.  Some
              activities planned include:  (1) monitoring  images of the Sun in many
              wavelengths via the Internet; (2) mapping  Yohkoh HXT flare images, comparing
              with OVRO microwave images and  Big Bear optical and magnetic field maps; (3)
              investigating the  solar chromosphere and solar spicules; (4) studying the
              nature and  evolution of solar magnetic fields, particularly in the quiet Sun; 
              (5) studying high-resolution sunspot phenomena; (6) searching for  high
              tangential velocities in granulation associated with shock;  (7) pursuing
              smaller programs, student projects, and special  campaigns; and (8) improving
              instruments, including installing an  additional digital camera, a spot tracker
              on the 25 cm telescope,  and a computerized dome drive.***
