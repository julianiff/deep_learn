Abstract    :
              Professor Lindblom will continue his theoretical research on  gravitation and
              astrophysics.  He will emphasize  astrophysical situations in which strong
              gravitational  fields play a significant role.  These problems can be  divided
              into four major areas:  a) the pulsations and  stability of relativistic stars,
              b) superfluid hydrodynamics  in neutron stars, c) dissipative relativistic
              hydrodynamic  theories, and d) fundamental mathematical problems in 
              relativistic stellar structure.  Specific research problems in each of these
              areas will be  carried out, for example: a) A new approximation method to 
              evaluate the modes of rapidly rotating fully relativistic  stellar models will
              be developed.  This approximation is  based on the fact that gravitational
              radiation couples only  weakly to the modes of primary physical interest in
              neutron  stars.  b) The program to evaluate the effects of superfluid 
              hydrodynamics on the gravitational radiation instability of  rotating neutron
              stars will be continued.  The next step is  to finish debugging the computer
              codes that evaluate the  modes of rapidly rotating superfluid neutron stars. 
              c) The  relationship between the dissipative relativistic fluid  theories of
              divergence type and the Lagrangian based  dissipative relativistic fluid
              theories will be  investigated.  It is hoped that the set of theories which 
              belong to both classes can be identified and that these will  contain a strong
              candidate to be THE theory of dissipative  relativistic fluids.  d) Further
              investigations into the  possibility of determining the nuclear equation of
              state by  measuring the masses and radii of neutron stars will be  carried out.
