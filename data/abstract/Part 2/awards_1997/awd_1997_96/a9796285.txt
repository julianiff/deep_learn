Abstract    :
               9722761 Cargill This GOALI proposal addresses basic materials science issues in
              a collaborative program between Columbia University and Philips Laboratories to
              understand fundamental phenomena and interactions between electron-hole pair
              recombination, atomic displacements and defect generation in ZnSe-based
              heterostructures. Research at Columbia will involve T-dependent CL microscopy,
              spectroscopy, and x-ray microbeam mapping of microstructure and strain. Philips
              Laboratories will provide state-of-the-art MBE-grown samples and devices
              characterized electrically and optically. The joint activities include staff
              exchange with the PI and graduate students spending time at Philips, and with
              the co-PI, T. M. Marshall from Philips spending time at Columbia. Additionally,
              an on-going collaboration with Brookhaven NL will continue in connection with
              the x-ray microbeam work. The proposed research emphasizes understanding of
              fundamental mechanisms and processes along with some the practical aspects of
              electronic/photonic materials technology. This project is supported by the
              DMR/EM program and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA). %%%
              The project addresses forefront materials science research issues in a topical
              area of materials science having high technological relevance.  The research
              will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to
              important aspects of electronic/photonic devices and integrated circuitry, in
              general.  Additionally, the fundamental knowledge and understanding gained from
              the research is expected to contribute to improving the performance of advanced
              devices and circuits by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for
              designing and producing improved materials.  An important feature of the
              program is the integration of research and education through the training of
              students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***
