Abstract    :
              9528919  Krasucki  This (i) Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) and 
              (ii) cooperative US-India research project investigates  distributed systems,
              using reasoning about knowledge:            * During the run of the distributed
              system,  processes acquire knowledge about the state of the system  through
              messages.  The goals in this area are to (a)  characterize changes in the state
              of knowledge of processes  due to communications and (b) relate knowledge 
              structure of the system to the temporal structure on event  occurrences in the
              system;            * The third research goal of this project is to (c)  attempt
              to modify a model, created by economists to reason  about rational agents
              communicating values of certain agreed-  upon function, so that it can be used
              to design and analyze  protocols leading to distributed consensus.  ***
