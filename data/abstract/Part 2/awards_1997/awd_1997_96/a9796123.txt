Abstract    :
              9458319June 26, 1994  Iatridou  This award provides support to Dr. Sabine
              Iatridou under the  National Science Foundation's Young Investigator Awards
              program.  The objective of this program is to recognize outstanding young 
              faculty in science and engineering, to enhance the academic  career of recent
              PhD recipients by providing flexible support for  research and educational
              activities, and to foster contact and  cooperation between academia, industry,
              and institutions that  support research and education.  Dr. Iatridou has
              already made  significant research contributions to the field of linguistics, 
              and she has the potential to become a leader in academic research  and
              education.    This award will allow the investigator to build on her existing 
              research on the convergence of linguistic inquiry, philosophy,  and cognition. 
              Her main area of interest is in the relation  between meaning and form in
              natural language.  During the next  few years she will undertake a
              cross-linguistic study of  counterfactual conditionals.  This is a topic at the
              interface of  syntax, semantics, and pragmatics, relating linguistic structure 
              to cognition and language use.  The research is of great  importance to
              linguistic theory because it promises to overcome a  major longstanding problem
              in the field: current syntactic  analyses are too superficial to support a
              realistic  representation of the semantics of human utterances, while  current
              semantic analyses are so abstract that they give little  indication of how to
              constrain linguistic representations.  The  work promises to be the touchstone
              for future work in this area.
