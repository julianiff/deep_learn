Abstract    :
                9402285  Jasiuk  This research is to study the local fields and effective
              properties  of composite materials.  In particular, building on some recent 
              efforts in other problems, the possibility of reducing the number  of
              independent variables will be evaluated.  Various interfacial  conditions will
              be considered.  The resulted of this study will  apply to any heterogeneous
              material and therefore contribute to a  more fundamental understanding in
              materials science.  ***
