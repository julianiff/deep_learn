Abstract    :
                   The eastern Mediterranean ophiolites form discontinuous                   
              linear belts of oceanic fragments immediately north of the                     
              Bitlis-Zagros suture,  which marks a congenital  collision                     
              zone in the Alpine-Himalayan orogenic belt.  The                               
              paleogeography and timing of this ocean closure however is                     
              very complex and poorly understood.  This project will study                   
              the Alihoca ohiolite which occupies a key position between                     
              the relatively undeformed and stratigraphically complete                       
              ophiolites to the south (Troodos) and deformed and                             
              fragmented complexes to the north.  It is juxtaposed against                   
              a continental fragment of Afro-Arabia affinity and intruded                    
              by island-arc rocks, thus potentially preserving evidence of                   
              subduction and collision zone tectonics.  The main thrust of                   
              the work is field mapping, structural analysis followed by                     
              petrologic and geochronologic studies.  Results will test                      
              current models for the evolution of the eastern                                
              Mediterranean during the Mesozoic.
