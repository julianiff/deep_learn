Abstract    :
              9412706  Sundaram  The focal point of this research proposal is the
              understanding of  the use, efficacy and limitations of classical and
              semi-classical  methods in describing the dynamics of strongly coupled quantum 
              systems.  Since the strength of the interaction precludes the use  of quantum
              perturbation theory in these systems, non-perturbative  intuition is derived
              from a classical description of the  dynamics, which is most often
              nonintegrable or chaotic.  A number  of important issues of both practical and
              formal consequence  arise from the quantization of dynamics with a classically 
              chaotic limit.  In particular, we propose to investigate 1) the  periodic orbit
              expansion starting from exact expressions of the  trace of quantum propagators,
              the contributions of analytically  continued orbits and the possibility of
              conherence (scarred wave  functions) associated with these so-called 'ghost'
              orbits,2) the  effects of noise introduced via parametric fluctuations on de 
              stabilizing scarred wave-functions and 3) scarred wave functions  in higher
              dimensions with specific application to the problems of  stabilization of
              ground state atoms in super-intense laser fields  and to the noise spectroscopy
              in the interaction of Rydberg atoms  with microwaves.    ***
