Abstract    :
              9410157  Mukherjee  This project deals with the planning of closed paths for non
               holonmic systems which are characterized by the non-  integrable nature of
              their differential constraints. These  constraints manifest themselves in a way
              that closed  trajectories of the independent variables of the system  result in
              a change in the dependent variables. In certain  nonholonomic systems, closed
              paths in the space of  independent variables can be so designed that the net
              change  of dependent variables is zero over these closed paths. Such  systems
              are important in a manufacturing environment for  example, kinetically
              redundant manipulators operating under  pseudo inverse control  ***
