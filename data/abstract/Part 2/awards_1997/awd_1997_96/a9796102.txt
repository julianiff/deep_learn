Abstract    :
              This research is applying the principal investigator's previous  work in the
              area of nonlinear circuit theory to make major  enhancements to the way
              designers simulate analog circuits.  In  particular, improvements to the
              continuation methods of solving dc  operating points of circuits are being made
              guaranteeing that all  of a circuit's operating points will be found during a
              single  analysis.  Moreover, continuation methods are being applied to 
              sensitivity analysis of circuits; for example, by making  observations of a
              continuation curve, a designer could determine  whether a circuit is prone to a
              latch up condition.  Erroneous  models are thought to be a major source of
              convergence problems and  erroneous results in circuit simulation.  Another
              enhancement to  circuit simulation includes checking the accuracy of transistor
               models by verifying that all models satisfy passivity and the no-  gain
              condition.
