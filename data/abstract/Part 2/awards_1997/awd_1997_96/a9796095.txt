Abstract    :
              This project in molecular electronic structure theory is supported by the   NSF
              Theoretical and Computational chemistry Program.  Ab initio electron  
              propagator theory (EPT) is applied to the computation of ionization  
              potentials, electron affinities, and related properties.  Improved   computer
              codes for EPT computations will be developed using algorithms   adapted from
              other areas of ab initio theory.  These include the   computation of second and
              third-order quasiparticle and renormalized   self-energy for large molecules
              using direct generation of   electron-repulsion integrals,  density basis sets,
              and elimination of   energy denominators using Laplace transform techniques. 
              These methods   will be implemented in parallel code for a small cluster of
              workstations.    The theory will be applied to multiply charged carbon cluster
              anions and   to organometallic radicals.    Like all ab initio methods for the
              calculation of the electronic   structure of molecules, electron propagator
              theory (EPT) is based on the   fundamental equations of quantum mechanics.  
              The EPT equations provide a   more direct route to the rigorous calculation of
              electron excitation   energies and thus of spectroscopic excitations,
              ionization energies, and   electron affinities.  The emphasis in this project
              is on the development   of improved computational methods and their
              implementation on parallel   computers, particularly, on clusters of
              workstations.
