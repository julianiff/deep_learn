Abstract    :
              To function correctly in the nervous system, each nerve cell  must produce an
              appropriate neurotransmitter, the chemical  it uses to communicate with other
              nerve cells.  Little is  known about the mechanisms that govern this choice
              within  developing nerve cells.  The work proposed here will  identify genes
              that control neurotransmitter choice, the  decision of a neuron to produce a
              specific set of proteins  that synthesize and handle a specific
              neurotransmitter.  Since the same neurotransmitters are used by organisms 
              throughout the animal kingdom, the same types of genes  probably regulate
              neurotransmitter decisions in simple and  complex organisms.  Therefore, this
              problem will be studied  in a simple organism which is readily amenable to
              genetic  and molecular analysis, the nematode.  We can easily mutate  the genes
              of these animals and observe the results of such  mutations.  By isolating and
              analyzing mutants that lack the  neurotransmitter serotonin, genes that are
              required for the  specification and function of serotonin containing neurons 
              can be identified.  If genes are identified that control  neurotransmitter
              choice, it is very likely similar genes  control such decisions in higher
              organisms.
