Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   of
              the Chemistry Division, Gullion will develop a high-resolution   magic-angle
              spinning NMR technique which allows measurement of   internuclear distances
              between dipolar and quadrupolar nuclei.    Specifically tailored pulse trains
              synchronized with the sample rotation   will recouple the dipolar interactions
              between the desired spin pairs,   providing structural information of complex
              solids in a straightforward   manner.  The first applications will be to the
              interactions between bound   water and cellulose as well as to a polymer blend
              of cellulose with   polyacrylonitrile.  These experiments will fill a void in
              MAS NMR   distance-measuring techniques.  Solid-state NMR techniques similar to
              those being developed in this work   have been applied to a number of
              interesting chemical systems, including   biological solids, zeolites, and
              polymers.  As such, they demonstrate the   importance and wide applicability of
              these structural techniques to such   diverse areas as materials science,
              structural biology, and the study of   catalytic systems.
