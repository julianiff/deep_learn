Abstract    :
              9629081    Via    A basic process generating biological diversity is speciation,
              when populations of one species diverge and eventually become separate species.
               The genetic changes that produce population divergence and speciation are
              poorly known.  The goal of this project is to determine the number and effects
              of genes that influence divergence between populations of a single insect
              species, pea aphid, that infests two host plants.  Pea aphid populations on
              alfalfa and clover are highly genetically divergent and significantly isolated
              due to habitat choice, and so appear to be incipient species.  Quantitative
              trait loci (QTLs) influencing host plant choice and survival and fertility on
              each host plant will be mapped on chromosomes using molecular linkage map
              analysis, as well as biometrical analyses.    Studying the genetic basis for
              speciation is fundamental for understanding the generation of species
              biodiversity.  It is also useful for understanding how pests adapt to new
              hosts, and how much gene flow there can be between related pest species.
