Abstract    :
              9417958  Liou       This project will study the emplacement mechanisms of 
              ultrahigh-pressure rocks that have been recently discovered  in the Dabie
              Mountains in China.  These eclogitic rocks  contain minerals that indicate
              extremely deep burial, and  the processes by which they were uplifted to the
              surface are  unknown.  The project will attempt to identify the strain  history
              and deformation rates along major faults that bound  the eclogitic rocks. 
              Thermobarometry, metamorphic phase  relations, and geochronology of the rocks
              within and on  either side of the deformation zones will be used to assess  the
              temperatures and pressures during deformation and the  magnitude and timing of
              vertical displacement.  This project  will be the first study of the tectonic
              history of these  ultrahigh-pressure rocks.  The results will provide an 
              understanding of the physical processes operative in the  deepest levels of
              collisional orogens, and will illuminate  the linkage among deep and shallow
              levels to tectonism.
