Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT  CTS-9407126  SUNY - Stony Brook  P.I.:  Surya Raghu      This
              proposal has the objective of determining the interdependence of conditioned
              scalar dissipation, production and turbulent advection in the passive mixing of
              a jet of gas with ambient air.  The proposed experiments are based on the
              equation for the one-point probability density function of a conserved scalar
              quantity in a turbulent shear flow.  All the quantities needed to determine a
              satisfactory balance of the terms in the pdf equation will be measured. 
              Rayleigh light scattering technique will be employed to measure instantaneous
              concentration and a specially calibrated hot-wire will be used to obtain axial
              and radial velocity fluctuations in the jet.  The experiments will be conducted
              at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  The results
              obtained from this work will aid us in better understanding of the scalar
              transport phenomenon in a turbulent shear flow which is of great technological
              relevance to a variety of industrial and environmental flow situations.  The
              proposed measurements will also serve to check the accuracy of earlier data on
              conditioned dissipation, which were obtained in the absence of measurements of
              conditioned scalar production and advection and, therefore, could not be
              subjected to a balance of the pdf equation.
