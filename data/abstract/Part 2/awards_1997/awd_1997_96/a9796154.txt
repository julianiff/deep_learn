Abstract    :
              9503274  Ziurys  Dr. Ziurys will carry out a joint laboratory and observational
              investigation of molecules containing refractory elements that are of
              astrophysical interest.  The laboratory program entails the measurement of the
              pure rotational spectra of such molecules at millimeter/submillimeter
              wavelengths, while the observations include astronomical detection and
              subsequent study of these species in interstellar clouds and circumstellar
              envelopes of late-type stars.  The molecules of particular interest are simple
              metal-bearing carbide and nitride radicals.
