              OPP 9614287  Andrews  OPP 9615046  Leventer    Abstract  The late Quaternary
              extent and pattern of retreat of the West  Antarctic Ice Sheet is an important
              control on interpretation of  ice core records from the region and it has
              important  ramification regarding the global water budget (in sea level 
              terms), the timing of meltwater contributions to the ocean, and  the synchrony
              (or lack thereof) between events in the Northern  and Southern Hemispheres. 
              This award supports continued  research on the chronology of ice retreat from
              the western Ross  Sea and an  extension of areal coverage for this research to
              include the  eastcentral Ross Sea.  The study will use a series of piston, 
              Kasten, and grab samples from research cruises in 1994 and 1995  on the RVIB
              N.B. Palmer by researchers from Rice University,  University of Colorado,
              Boulder, and Hamilton College.  Various  physical and biological parameters of
              the cores will be used to  map changes in the environments over time with a
              concentration  on sediment properties, foraminifera, and diatoms.  At this 
              time, ninety-two carbon-14 dates (plus 18 pending dates, all  based on
              acceleratormass-spectrometry) have been obtained from  cores collected prior to
              1994 and from the 1994 and 1995 cruises  by the research groups at Hamilton
              College and the University of  Colorado, Boulder. Emphasis will be placed on
              obtaining  additional radiocarbon dates supplemented by several other 
              chronological methods including: sources and ages of volcanic  ashes,
              uranium-series dating of solitary corals, and amino acid  racemization.  The
              three major research questions are:  1) What  was the position of the grounding
              line during the Last Glacial  Maximum from the western to east-central Ross Sea
              and what was  the timing of retreat from this limit, was it synchronous across 
              the region, and what was the rate of retreat ?  2) Is there  evidence from the
              history of carbonate accumulation on the outer  shelf banks, and from cores on
              the slope of the Ross Sea that  the  ice was grounded on the shelf break at
              some time prior to  marine isotope stage (MIS) 2, possibly at MIS 4 (Goodwin, 
              person. commun. 1996)?  3) What are the paleoenvironments in the  areas of the
              Ross Sea at the millenial/century time-scales  during the latest Pleistocene
              and the Holocene? In particular,  what is the history of changes in surface
              water productivity and  sea ice extent?
