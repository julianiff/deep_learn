Abstract    :
                This project involves the research and training of a cultural anthropologist
              at the University of Kentucky.  The funds will allow the researcher to study
              the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and data from remote sensing to
              further his research on contemporary ecology and the history of land use in the
              Guinea savanna climatic zone of western Africa.  The overall goal is to provide
              a theoretical explanation of the sociocultural and historical causes of
              production problems with an empirical study of local and regional food
              production, resource exploitation, and ecological change. The data to be dealt
              with include ethnographic and ecological materials on agriculture and forest
              ecology, historical data from European traveler accounts as well as African
              oral traditions, and analysis of aerial photographs and Landsat satellite
              imagery.  This research is important because the investigator will provide an
              African-centered model of tropical forest dynamics to contrast and compare with
              the widely cited Amazonian model, to advance our understanding of the
              human-landscape interactions in this critically important type of ecosystem. 
              In addition the project will increase the nation's technical expertise in
              combining ethnographic information with GIS and remote sensing data.
