Abstract    :
              9309668  Thevanayagam  The objective of this research is to develop a
              fundamental understanding of the relationship between the macroscopic response
              of soils upon an excitation by an alternating current and micro-structural soil
              parameters and the geo-environment in which it is present. A fundamental model
              will be developed aimed at quantitatively linking the observed electrical
              response to the basic soil compositional, micro-structural and environmental
              factors. The basic driving force behind this research is related to the idea
              that all the factors that affect the electric response of soils affect its
              mechanical and flow behavior properties. A technology of predicting the basic
              soil parameters will have various applications. If one could invert the
              observed electric response of soils to predict these basic parameters then it
              will be possible to forecast macroscopic engineering behavior parameters for
              geotechnical and geo-environmental applications.   ***      ~     @ j   0>
