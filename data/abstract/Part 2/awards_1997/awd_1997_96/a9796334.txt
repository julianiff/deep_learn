Abstract    :
              The proposed project involves the development of a  stochastic individual-based
              simulation model of parasitoid  behavior within a tritrophic context.  This
              model will be  used to investigate the role of learning in a) determining 
              foraging success, and b) facilitating changes in the size  and composition of
              parasitoid populations.  In the process  of addressing these larger questions,
              the model will be used  as an experimental tool for testing specific hypotheses
               drawn from current theory in insect learning, and as a tool  for organizing
              current data and identifying key questions  for future investigations of
              tritrophic interactions.  The  model will be based on a review of the current
              literature  and developed using an iterative feedback process involving 
              empirical studies with live parasitoids.  Informal  collaborations will be
              encouraged during all phases of model  development; the resulting comprehensive
              and user-friendly  model will be available to all interested researchers.
