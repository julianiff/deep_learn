Abstract    :
                    9527544  Morton  Current trends in the computational sciences lean toward
              distributed and parallel computing as a tool for flexible and efficient problem
              solving across a broad spectrum of disciplines.  Businesses increasingly depend
              on client/server computing platforms for achieving flexible network
              capabilities with outside entities, such as the emerging "Information
              Superhighway."  Meanwhile, parallel processing methods are increasing utilized
              to solve large-scale problems in shorter periods of  time.    While the issues
              of client/server programming and parallel processing of large-scale problems
              are considered  mainstream" in major research centers and organizations,
              institutions such as Cameron University lack local access to such technology
              and are unable to benefit from the advantages of these approaches.  With the
              introduction of large amounts of free, reliable software, along with low-cost
              hardware, much of this technology is now accessible to those with appropriate
              computing skills.  The PI intends to make use of these resources, demonstrating
              the enormous benefits that such use provides to small undergraduate
              institutions, while providing an infrastructure for education and research
              activities in parallel and distributed computing at Cameron University.
