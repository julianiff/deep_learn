Abstract    :
              9507504  Fendler    The objective of U.S.-Hungary research project, between Dr.
              Janos  Fendler of Syracuse University and Imre Dekany of Attila Jozsef 
              University, is to pursue fundamental work required to develop a  simple and
              versatile technique for constructing stable and robust  organic/inorganic
              composite self-assembled nanostructured films.   The researchers have
              demonstrated layer-by-layer self-assembly of  ordered nanostructured films
              composed of alternating layers of  cationic polyelectrolyte and anionic solid
              nanoparticles.  They  believe that this suggests a viable membrane-mimetic
              approach to  engineering advanced materials.  As a result of this project, the 
              researchers hope to achieve a high degree of stability and  relative ease of
              systematic chemical and physical manipulation  that will enable them to derive
              nanostructured films with desired  mechanical, optical, electro-optical,
              electrical, magnetic, and  electromagnetic properties.    This chemistry
              project in organic dynamics fulfills the program  objective of advancing
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading  experts in the United States and
              Eastern Europe to combine  complementary talents and pool research resources in
              areas of  strong mutual interest and competence.   ***
