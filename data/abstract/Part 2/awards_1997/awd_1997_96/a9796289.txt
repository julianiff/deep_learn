                                             Abstract  9423489  Lyons   This is a project to
              investigate how energy from the solar wind  enters Earth's magnetosphere.  The
              rate of energy transfer is  controlled by the electric field along the
              separatrix, which is the  boundary between open and closed magnetic field lines
              at the surface  of the magnetosphere.  For this study, ground-based
              observations  will be used to measure the rate of reconnection of magnetic
              field  lines across the separatrix.  Both the motion of the separatrix and  the
              flow of plasma across it must be measured simultaneously.  The  investigators
              will measure these quantities using radar and optical  techniques with a time
              resolution sufficient to resolve changes  associated with the growth and
              expansion phases of auroral  substorms.  The results will be used to test
              models of plasma  convection in the magnetosphere and to evaluate the accuracy
              of  reconnection theories.  The variation in reconnection rate  associated with
              auroral substorms and dayside transient effects will  also be studied.   ***
