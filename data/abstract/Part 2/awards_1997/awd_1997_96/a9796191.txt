Abstract    :
              9403567  Weitsman       The research entails the symplectic geometry of moduli 
              spaces associated with Riemann surfaces. The focus will be on the  use of
              methods from the the theory of toric varieties to study  moduli spaces of
              vector bundles and certain conjectures  concerning the moduli of curves. It is
              also planned to study the  relation between the symplectic geometry of the
              moduli space of  vector bundles and certain 3-manifold invariants. The research
               has potential applications to other areas of mathematics and also  to quantum
              gravity and string theory in mathematical physics.  ***
