Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research the objective of                          
              which is to obtain a better understanding than now exists                      
              of chemical reaction mechanisms that influence the fate of                     
              pollutants in natural waters and in water being subjected                      
              to chemical treatment processes.  The research focusses on                     
              photocatalytic degradation of hazardous chemicals that are                     
              adsorbed on surfaces of semiconductor particles and                            
              involves the application of dye sensitization to the                           
              semiconductor surfaces to enhance absorption of light and                      
              the chemical transformation process.                                           
                                                                                             
              This award provides initial base-level support for this                        
              Presidential Young Investigator and funds to match $37,500                     
              of  the total of $134,000 from the following sources:                          
              Lyonnaise des Eaux (France) - $39,000, Rhone-Poulenc                           
              (Connecticut) - $10,000, Midland Resources, Inc. (Kansas)                      
              - $5,000, and the Occidental Chemical Corp. (New York) -                       
              $80,000.   Results are expected to advance the                                 
              understanding we now have of chemical mechanisms that                          
              influence the fate of pollutants in natural waters and in                      
              engineering design of treatment processes for removing                         
              pollutants from water and wastewater.
