Abstract    :
              9315251  Liou         The objective of this research is the development of light
               scattering programs for nonspherical ice crystals using both the  theoretical
              and experimental approaches.  The proposed theoretical  studies include the
              application of the newly developed geometric  ray-tracing/Monte Carlo method
              applied to complex ice crystals such  as capped columns, spatial aggregates,
              and graupel.  For ice  crystals with size parameters less than about 30, we
              propose to  develop a numerical technique, referred to as the finite difference
               time domain method, for the solution of the scattered field.  The  proposed
              laboratory experiment uses a laser light-scattering analog  measurement for a
              single crystal.  Initial experimental  arrangements and preliminary results are
              presented and the proposed  experiments for the measurements of the phase
              matrix elements for  crystals of various shapes and sizes are outlined.  ***
