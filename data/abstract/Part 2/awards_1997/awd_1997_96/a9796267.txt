Abstract    :
              9409045  Massone  The research proposed in this application is concerned with 
              investigating the relevance of dynamic motor maps in the  design of control
              systems for biological and artificial  plants using a computational, neural
              network based approach.  Dynamic motor maps are found in one area of the brain
              called  the superior colliculus. The superior colliculus plays a  major role in
              the control of gaze shifts, that is, a  combined movement of the head and eyes.
               Dynamic motor maps  exhibit a number of interesting properties that make them 
              very general, flexible and effective devices that can be  employed to control
              not only the head and eye movement  system, but any kind of system.  The
              specific aims of the  project are to: (1) continue and extend ongoing studies
              of  dynamic motor maps in the oculomotor system, (2) extend the  use of dynamic
              motor maps to the arm motor system, and (3)  study mechanisms of hand-eye
              coordination by coupling the  eye motor map and the arm motor map.  ***
