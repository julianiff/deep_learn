Abstract    :
              9457003      ABSTRACT  CTS-9457003  PI-Chen     Experimental and theoretical
              investigations were proposed to study the fundamental heat transfer mechanisms
              in quantum structures and semiconductor device processing.  The proposed
              experimental studies would focus on the measurement of the thermophysical and
              radiative properties of superlattices and the development of an emissivity
              independent pyrometry temperature measurement technique for monitoring device
              processing.  Theoretical studies would be directed at understanding the heat
              mechanisms in quantum structures and modeling the thermal characteristics of
              quantum devices.
