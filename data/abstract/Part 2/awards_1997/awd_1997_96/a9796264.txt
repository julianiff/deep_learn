Abstract    :
                  The objective of the this project will be to conduct research in  the
              development of database technology and to meet the challenging  requirements of
              engineering and scientific applications, such as   design automation and the
              Human Genome project.  This will aslo  involve graduate students in research
              projects aimed at developing  object-oriented database technology that supports
              1)  the  integration of complex data types, 2)  the maintenance of  customized
              database interfaces for individual tools, and 3)  the  entensibility of the
              system without discrupting existing database  uers and tools.
