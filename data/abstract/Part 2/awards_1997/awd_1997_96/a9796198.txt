Abstract    :
              9625319  Murphy  This CAREER project emphasizes research on the behavior of 
              systems that utilize axially moving materials in a  manufacturing environment,
              and educational aspects in the  field of vibrations and stability. A wire
              electro-discharge  machining process, and high speed band saw systems, are 
              chosen as two examples of research projects. For the former,  a full vibration
              and stability analysis is carried out in a  multi-mode, three dimensional
              traveling wire model; the  effects of non-uniform thermal loads, caused by
              sparks, are  examined; the effects of multi-span coupling and span guide- 
              wheel coupling are considered; and the wire whirling problem  is studied in
              addition to a characterization of chaotic  response of the wire using fractal
              dimensions and Lyapunov  exponents. Similarly, in the case of high speed band
              saws,  the use of shape memory alloys embedded into the blade is  investigated
              to increase structural stiffness at high  temperatures. In the educational
              area, undergraduate and  graduate courses are developed in vibrations,
              acoustics,  aeroelasticity, and nonlinear dynamics; and undergraduate  students
              are encouraged to get involved in the PI's research  program.***
