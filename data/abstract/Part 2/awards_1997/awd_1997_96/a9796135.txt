Abstract    :
              9309149  Papadimitriou  This research will focus on the development of  a
              multi-parameter stochastic characterization  of earthquake acceleration time
              histories.   The stochastic models will consider important  ground motion
              features including the  nonstationarities in both the amplitude and  frequency
              content of the ground shaking which  have significant influence on the dynamic 
              response of structures.  The parameters of the  stochastic model will be
              probabilistically  related to variables accounting for the  seismic environment
              at a site, so that the  ground motion model can become an integral  part of a
              seismic hazard assessment.  Response  characteristics of linear and nonlinear, 
              including hysteretic structures subjected the  stochastically defined ground
              motions will be  studied to evaluate the effect of various  ground motion
              features and their associated  uncertainties.  ***
