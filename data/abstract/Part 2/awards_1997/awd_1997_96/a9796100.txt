Abstract    :
              9505859  Raj    The  objective of the proposed work is to develop predictive 
              methods  for  the design of directional microstructures  for  the purpose of
              obtaining very high resistance to deformation  and  fracture  at very high
              temperatures.  The  approach  is  based  on  coupling the local atomistic
              mechanisms  of  time  dependent  nucleation and growth of cavities at 
              interfaces,  and  the  long range relaxation of the stress concentrations 
              accompanying cavitation, with the stochastic distribution of  nucleation sites
              in the specimen.  The proposed work is both  experimental and theoretical.  The
              results will  be  applied  specifically to high temperature silicon nitride
              ceramic.  %%%  The  proposal is aimed to develop predictive methods for the 
              design  of  directional microstructures for the  purpose  of  obtaining  very
              high resistance to deformation and  fracture  at very high temperatures.
