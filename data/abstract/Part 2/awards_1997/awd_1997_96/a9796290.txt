Abstract    :
              This  project  is  the developing and implementing  (at  Michigan  Technological
               University  and Arizona State  University)  course  materials  for  an
              improved undergraduate number  theory  course.  This  new  course incorporates
              many of the ideas and  innovations  that  have  been  successfully employed  in
               earlier  mathematics  education  reform projects.  New features to be 
              integrated  into  the  course are: the use of guided discovery as the primary 
              mode  of  student  learning;  the  use  of  Mathematica  to  facilitate 
              numerical experimentation; collaboration between students to work  on  forming
              and investigating conjectures; a diminished  emphasis  on lectures; and,
              student lab reports detailing results that have  been  obtained.  The target
              audience for the proposed  course  is  preservice  secondary  mathematics 
              teachers,  who  comprise  the  majority of students in the course. During the
              first year of  the  project,  all materials for the proposed course will be
              prepared:  pre-lab   worksheets   and   homework  assignments;   Mathematica 
              notebooks; documents to be distributed to students that  describe  the  nature
              of the course and expectations for lab reports;  and,  an instructor's guide to
              assist in implementation at other sites.  All  materials  will be free and
              available to interested  parties  via anonymous ftp.
