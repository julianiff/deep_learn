Abstract    :
              This CAREER award provides support for the construction of a research and 
              education program in visual information processing.  This field is inherently 
              interdisciplinary, and includes portions of computer science, electrical 
              engineering, applied mathematics, psychology, and neuroscience.  Yet,
              educational  curricula often do not cross these disciplinary boundaries.    One
              objective of this award is the construction of an educational curriculum, 
              starting next year with the introduction of two innovative foundational
              courses.   The first, an undergraduate lecture course entitled "Foundations of
              Vision:  Perception and Computation" will cover a broad range of material in
              vision  science, from perceptual psychology, to single-cell physiology, to
              computational  theories of visual processing.  The second, a graduate
              lecture/laboratory course  entitled "Fundamentals of Image Processing and
              Computer Vision", will cover basic  tools, both theoretical and applied, that
              are common to these two fields.    The second objective of this award is the
              study of a set of basic and applied  research issues in visual image
              processing.  The research will be based on the  family of "steerable pyramid"
              image representations, and will include the use of  this representation in an
              adaptive context, rotation-invariant pattern matching,  noise removal and
              enhancement, representation of texture and orientation content,  and
              differential recovery of three-dimensional scene structure.
