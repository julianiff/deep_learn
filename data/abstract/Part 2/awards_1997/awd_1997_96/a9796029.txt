Abstract    :
              A large number of applications from information processing as  well as science
              and engineering require processing large amounts  of data.  Particularly, in
              the science and engineering domain,  the so called ``grand challenge
              applications'' fall in this  category.  Thus, it has become apparent that I/O
              performance much  more than CPU or communication performance may be the
              limiting  factor in future parallel computing systems. Many software and 
              hardware components play a key role in I/O operations and any one  of them can
              cause severe bottlenecks.  The disparity between the  performance of disk
              systems and CPU (and interconnect)  performance requires the use of large-scale
              parallelism (and  supporting software) to address the scalability and
              performance  problems in I/O subsystems. But parallelism in the I/O systems 
              introduces complexities for the system software including  compilers, runtime
              systems and file systems.    This research addresses many system software
              problems in the  parallel I/O domain.  To ameliorate the I/O bottlenecks, the 
              following are necessary:  1) techniques for sophisticated runtime  systems that
              incorporate the notion of collective I/O, data reuse  and prefetching; 2)
              compiler analysis to identify various  optimizations including data access
              reorganization, opportunities  for overlapping computations and I/O, and data
              staging to handle  limited memory for out-of-core computations; and 3) file
              systems  optimizations to recognize collective access patterns for 
              coordinating accesses of processes that are part of parallel  programs, and
              using these access patterns for prefetching, buffer  allocation and replacement
              strategies.  Traditional interfaces  for file systems lack the necessary
              semantics to permit the above  optimizations. Thus, it is necessary to develop
              interfaces  between the compiler and the runtime systems, and the runtime 
              system and the file systems, that facilitate the flow of semantic  information
              about access patterns to enable optimizations.  This  res earch pursues the
              design and development of techniques for  compiler analysis, mechanisms and
              algorithms for runtime systems,  and interfaces and optimizations for file
              systems to enable  high-  performance I/O in parallel computers. These
              techniques are being  evaluated by implementing them on parallel systems.  ***
