Abstract    :
              This CAREER award supports the research and professional  development of
              Professor Clara Chan. Chan will investigate the  polytope algebra and its
              connections to the algebra of piecewise  polynomial functions and cohomology of
              toric varieties. She will  also continue her work on cubical polytopes. The
              main focus of  the educational plan is to bring more advanced technology into 
              undergraduate mathematics courses at Virginia Tech, especially in  the area of
              Discrete Mathematics.    The research component of this project is in the
              general area of  Combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient
              methods  to study how discrete collections of objects can be arranged. The 
              behavior of discrete systems is extremely important to modern  communications.
              For example, the design of large networks, such  as those occurring in
              telephone systems, and the design of  algorithms in computer science deal with
              discrete sets of  objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research.
