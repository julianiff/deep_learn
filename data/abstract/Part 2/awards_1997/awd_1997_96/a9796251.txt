Abstract    :
              9407606  McCourt       In an intriguing and challenging application of both
              molecular  and morphological data to a problem in phylogeny, Professor Richard 
              McCourt at DePaul University will be studying the algal group known  as
              stoneworts, the Charophyta.  Representatives of all seven genera  of living
              members of the group will be analyzed for a number of  genes by nucleotide
              sequencing methods, to acquire data on  mutational differences among the
              species.  Morphological features  of these same taxa along with data on the
              rich record of fossil  forms of these algae, acquired in collaboration with
              French  paleobotanical colleagues, will be integrated with the DNA results  to
              reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of the charophytes.       The
              charophytes are relatively large and complex for algae;  they have growing
              regions at the apex of branches and flagellated  sperm cells that are more
              similar to those of certain land plants  than to other green algae.  As one of
              the algal groups closest  phylogenetically to the land plants, the charophytes
              are likely to  show evolutionary adaptations that will help understand the 
              sequence of changes in the origin of land plants.  As well, their  fossil
              record provides an opportunity to calibrate rates of  molecular change in
              genes.
