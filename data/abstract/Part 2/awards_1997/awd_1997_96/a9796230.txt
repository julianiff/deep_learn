Abstract    :
                  9507082  Napoli    A contributing factor to the enormous diversity observed
              for plant  form is the outgrowth of lateral buds, and the subsequent formation 
              of a characteristic shoot system. This proposal is a renewal of  previous
              funding supporting a genetic analysis of axillary  branching and apical
              dominance. Previous work demonstrated that  sufficient genetic diversity can be
              induced through mutagenesis in  order to make a genetic study of axillary
              branching possible. Three  genetic loci have been identified in Petunia hybrida
              that control  the degree of axillary branching. The recessive alleles condition
               the phenotypic expression of increased branching potential or  decreased
              apical dominance (dad). The following objectives will be  pursued: 1) continued
              developmental and physiological  characterization of dad1 and dad3 mutants, 2)
              genetic studies to  isolate second site suppressors of dad1 and dad3, along
              with the  genetic characterization of suppressor mutants, 3) double mutant  and
              triple mutant analysis employing dad mutants and increased  apical dominance
              mutants, and 4) transposon tagging to clone the  dad1 gene. A transposon
              tagging system using the maize element  Dissociation (Ds) has been developed in
              this laboratory for an  inbred genetic line of P. hybrida. The Davis collection
              contains  159 plants containing independent Ds donor loci. Ds can be 
              transactivated to excise from donor sites at a high frequency in F1  progeny
              resulting from a cross to provide active transposase from  Activator (Ac). Dr.
              Napoli has analyzed 51 of the Ds donor loci and  have demonstrated the
              occurrence of pre-meiotic events giving rise  to germinal excision events. Two
              donor Ds loci have been mapped to  approximately 2.8cM of the dad1 gene. A test
              cross has been  initiated to tag and clone the dad1 gene.  ***
