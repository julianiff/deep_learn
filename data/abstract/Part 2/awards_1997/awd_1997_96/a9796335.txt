              ABSTRACT    97-14944  Thorp  SGER: Effects of a major flood on secondary
              production of zooplankton in the Ohio River: Implications for ecosystem theory
              and river management.    In March, 1997, the Ohio River valley experienced its
              worst flooding since 1964 (a 100+ year flood). This research will consider the
              effects of this large-river flood in the context of current theoretical models
              that have never been empirically tested in the temperate zone. The
              investigators will study the influence of flood events on zooplankton
              productivity and the source of nutrients to the river food web. The relative
              contribution of nutrients from upstream reaches as opposed to the floodplain
              will be measured. Current management strategies for large rivers and their
              floodplains assume that a model developed in the tropics (the Flood Pulse
              Concept) is applicable to temperate rivers.  This model predicts that most
              riverine animal biomass derives from production within the floodplain and not
              from downstream transport of organic matter produced elsewhere in the basin. If
              this model is not applicable to large temperate rivers, this research will have
              very broad-reaching implications.
