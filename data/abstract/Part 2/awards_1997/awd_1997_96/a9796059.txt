Abstract    :
              This research will analyze the pollen from selected peat cores from  the tundra
              of Beringia, the ancient subcontinent which now includes  Alaska and
              Northeastern Siberia.  The arctic tundra is a major  ecosystem which plays a
              significant role as a major repository of  the world's carbon.  Whether
              northern peat is still accumulating  soil carbon or may actually be losing
              carbon is a question with  important consequences for global change scenarios. 
              This work will  use plant eaology and soil studies to interpret pollen records.
                Pollen analysis offers ecologists a long-term perspective on  vegetation
              change in this complex environment.    Interactive activities include: 
              teaching a course directly related  to this research and introducing students
              to the tools and methods  used to understand past environmental change.  In
              addition, a  seminar will be offered entitled Women in Prehistoric Society.  
              This course is an exploration of the traditional biases toward  gender roles in
              prehistory, which will enable Dr. Eisner to extend  her visibility and
              contribution to other departments at the  University of Alaska Anchorage.
