Abstract    :
              This project is establishing a laboratory capable of supporting an undergraduate
              specialization in computational science.  Computational modeling is rapidly
              becoming an important scientific research technique.  However, a large number
              of students in the physical, natural, and social sciences are completing their
              undergraduate training without any experience in applying computational tools
              and modeling techniques to problems in their own discipline.  The focus of this
              project is the new course sequence within the Mathematics and Computer Science
              Department that is giving students the needed background and experience.  These
              new courses are introducing the core concepts of computational science,
              including procedural and non-procedural programming, modeling, scientific
              visualization, numerical libraries and toolkits, and parallel algorithms and
              architectures.  Students are using these concepts to solve large-scale problems
              drawn from their own scientific field.
