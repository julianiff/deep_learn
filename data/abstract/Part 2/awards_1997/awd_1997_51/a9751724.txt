Abstract    :
              This project is improving the undergraduate computer science curriculum through
              the development of the new Experimental Computer Science Laboratory (ECSL),
              which is dedicated to experimental work in the systems design area.  The
              project is developing laboratory experiments for three undergraduate courses in
              computer architecture, operating systems/systems programming, and network
              security.  The ECSL is an experimental facility where students can get
              practical experience with performance measurement and the analysis of computer
              hardware, system software, and networks. Students can also experiment with
              software monitors, workload tracers and generators, benchmarks, and advanced
              simulation and visualization tools.  Students are gaining experience with
              dynamic phenomena such as page faults, system and networks saturation, pipeline
              stalls, system bottlenecks, and cache thrashing.  The new laboratory is
              enhancing activities that have previously been severely restricted because of a
              laboratory timeshare with courses in the software design area.  The project is
              establishing the ECSL as an isolated independent subnet with eight Sun Sparc 5
              workstations, a Sparc server, and a DEC Alpha server.  *
