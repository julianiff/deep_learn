Abstract    :
              The Mathematics Department is committed to increasing the use of new and modern
              technology in the classroom and curriculum.  The introduction of mandatory
              mathematics laboratories as an integral part of selected courses is viewed as
              one significant way to increase the success and retention rate of developmental
              mathematics students.  The purpose of this project is to integrate a graphical,
              numerical, and analytical approach in teaching selected developmental
              mathematics courses taught at the college.  For this purpose, the project's
              specific objectives are to adapt and synthesize methods from other successful
              reform efforts in teaching of developmental mathematics; modify these methods
              to meet the needs of a diverse student population; and utilize various
              commercial and locally available or developed software to support the delivery
              of mathematics instruction.    This project secures the necessary laboratory
              equipment to expand and modernize the old laboratory so as to permit the
              incorporation of mandatory mathematics laboratories into the Basic Mathematics
              course and the Introduction to Algebra and Geometry course; provides faculty
              development activities to all instructors and laboratory assistants on the use
              of the new equipment, software, and instructional methods; provides additional
              mathematics instruction (an added 2 laboratory hours per week), in a laboratory
              environment, for our students which emphasizes graphical and numerical
              techniques, as well as more traditional methods.    With this project, the
              number of computers in the mathematics laboratory increases from 24
              workstations to 78 workstations connected to a network supported by three
              servers.  The expanded laboratory has the capacity to support approximately
              1,300 students who enroll in these two developmental courses each semester, and
              is available to another 3,000 enrolled in other mathematics courses.
