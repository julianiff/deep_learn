Abstract    :
              The Computer Numerical Control (CNC) Technology Project is designed to address
              the curricular need for providing undergraduate machining students and area
              industry technicians with the opportunity to study advanced (up-todate) CNC
              conversational programming applications.  The specific project objectives are
              (1) to implement up-to-date CNC conversational programming applications
              incorporating additional CNC curriculum materials/courses into drafting and
              design, general engineering, and machining programs and (2) to increase the
              number of industries served and the number of area employees trained through
              the efforts of the college's Center for Business and Industry and participation
              in the Manufacturing Technology Consortium (MTC).  The college seeks to
              implement the curriculum reforms and industry training through the acquisition
              of a Mazak Vertical Machining Center with Mazatrol M-Plus Control, a Mazak
              Quick Turn 10 Universal Lathe with Mazatrol T-Plus Control, and Mazatrol
              software for off-line programming.  The target audience for this project is
              community college students enrolled in industrial/manufacturing technology
              programs and returning adult students seeking to upgrade their skills in CNC
              programming applications.  The college is collaborating with four other area
              colleges and regional industries through the MTC.  This project broadens the
              base of both the college and the MTC to provide advanced technological
              education to students in credit and noncredit programs across a 17-county
              region of southwestern Virginia.  *
