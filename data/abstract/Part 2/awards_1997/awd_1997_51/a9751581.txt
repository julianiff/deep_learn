Abstract    :
              The primary purpose of this project is to enhance and reform the learning of
              mathematics in the undergraduate curriculum according to the current calls for
              change in pedagogy predicated by the Mathematical Association of America and
              the American Mathematical Society.  To implement this nationally promoted
              educational reform program, the university is providing a computer-assisted
              technology classroom, the use of which brings new methods of mathematical
              instruction to the students, prepares them for the use of technology and
              industry-standard mathematical software, and increases their capacity for the
              application of mathematics to other disciplines.      The project strives to
              accomplish the following objectives:  provide computer-assisted instruction and
              learning facilities and disseminate the information regarding the activities
              made possible by these facilities; increase the amount of mathematical content
              taught in courses and its retention by students; motivate students to learn
              with the use of open-ended, real-world applications; emphasize active,
              creative, problem-solving approaches to learning through group work, class
              projects, discovery exercises, and other reform-oriented methods of
              instruction; use technology as it naturally fits into course work so it becomes
              an integral, rather than a peripheral, part of learning; acquaint students with
              changing and emerging technologies in order to make graduates more competitive
              in the marketplace.  *
