Abstract    :
              The focus of this project includes building an observatory to serve two new
              courses in astronomy and planetary science; enhancing post-secondary science
              education for all students by bringing an astronomy component to the basic
              sciences curriculum; increasing awareness of the different fields of science to
              students majoring in the Associate of Science degree; and providing a resource
              for training the laboratory skills in planetary and astronomy science to area
              teachers in the elementary, middle, and high schools.    The department is
              building an observatory with remote access capability to area schools.  This
              upgrade is being done through a 16 inch Meade Schmidt-Cassagrain telescope in
              conjunction with a 416 CCD Autoguider/Imager.  The system is connected through
              a computer to a network of computers in the area.  Four 16 inch Dobsonian
              telescopes are being used for experiencing the original incoming photon from an
              astronomical object and enhancing the hands-on observation techniques for the
              students.    This project is introducing astronomy to a remote area of the
              country, with a high concentration of many minority populations, and taking
              advantage of the clear skies of northern New Mexico.
