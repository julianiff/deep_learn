Abstract    :
              This project provides support for equipment to improve and enhance instruction
              in a previously existing molecular genetics laboratory.  The new equipment can
              also be used to introduce new laboratories in cell and molecular biology in two
              core curriculum courses that are required of all biology majors (Modern Biology
              Laboratory) and many nonmajors (Principles of Biology II).  The Molecular
              Genetics course is designed to introduce students to current theories,
              techniques, and methodologies in cell and molecular biology.  A major
              limitation of this course is the lack of sufficient equipment for a large
              class.  Class size is currently limited to six students.  The new equipment
              allows 10 to 12 additional students to perform laboratory work simultaneously. 
              Key pieces of equipment allow students' exposure to additional experiments and
              techniques.    The equipment can also be used to enhance laboratories in other
              courses.  Some basic cell and molecular laboratories can be incorporated into
              two core curriculum courses.  These two courses affect both majors and
              nonmajors.  Other courses affected include Cell Physiology and Special Topics
              in Biology (independent student research).  Finally, the equipment can also be
              used in the department's outreach program for high school teachers and high
              school students.  New equipment includes an ultraviolet spectrophotometer, a
              refrigerated, high-speed centrifuge, electrophoresis apparati,
              microcentrifuges, micropipettors, a shaking waterbath, and a PCR thermocycler.
