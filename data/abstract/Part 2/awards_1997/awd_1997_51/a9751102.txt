Abstract    :
              The mathematics department at Rancho Santiago College, a large, urban community
              college, is building on the success of the department's curricular efforts to
              further enhance student learning in  mathematics.  A computer classroom is
              being used to provide a technologically-integrated curricular approach to all
              Precalculus, Calculus, and Linear Algebra classes. The particular goals of the
              effort are to:    1. infuse cooperative team building, active learning and
              discovery-based learning into mathematics pedagogy to meet needs of students
              with diverse learning styles;  2. use relevant application-based data and
              problems to motivate student success and interest in mathematics;  3.
              incorporate elements of reform calculus that emphasizes the relationship among
              data, graphs, and functions into precalculus level courses;  4. provide
              students with computer skills they will use in further studies.
