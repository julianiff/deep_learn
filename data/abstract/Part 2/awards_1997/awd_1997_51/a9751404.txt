Abstract    :
                This proposal seeks funds for the acquisition and development of laboratory
              equipment to revitalize the Physics Junior laboratory and Senior Capstone.
              These courses are pivotal in the undergraduate physics training as they help
              students make the transition from classroom-based instruction to
              laboratory-based learning. This project acquires experiments and apparatus to
              develop platforms in atomic and molecular, nuclear and particle, laser and
              optical, and solid-state and materials physics that use modern state-of-the-art
              setups. With such platforms, not only is it possible to more effectively teach
              experimental techniques and elucidate the usual ideas in these areas of
              physics, it is possible, for the first time in this physics department, for
              students to easily design and perform their own experiments. Such experiments
              enable students to pursue curiosity-driven learning toward understanding
              important effects not only in these areas of physics, but also into the physics
              of everyday phenomena. An added bonus of such experimental platforms is the
              ability to use this equipment to maintain and revitalize the physics outreach
              programs to high school students through the summer scholars program and to
              improve our new Research Experience for Undergraduate program.
