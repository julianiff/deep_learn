Abstract    :
              The revision of the 10-year-old general chemistry laboratories curricula for
              science majors at this historically black university includes the use of
              technology and aims at the development of the scientific mind.  The students
              keep a laboratory notebook and design, carry out, and present a project. 
              Multimedia interactive pre-labs and post-labs extend the impact of each
              experiment on the learning process.  Simulated experiments not only eliminate
              the anxiety of following a procedure for the first time, but also give the
              student the opportunity to experience several related experiments.  The
              relation between daily experiences and concepts learned in the lecture is
              pursued.  Measurement and data analysis are emphasized as the best means of
              deriving the fundamental principles of chemistry.  Graphing calculators and
              spreadsheets are used to display data and to search for relations between
              variables.  Calculator-based laboratory units facilitate data acquisition, with
              less stress on instrument handling and more on data handling in the early
              laboratory sessions.  The use of numerical and graphical analysis, the
              experience with technology, and the development of written and oral skills
              better prepare the students for the more advanced laboratories and ultimately
              for graduate school and the job market.  *
