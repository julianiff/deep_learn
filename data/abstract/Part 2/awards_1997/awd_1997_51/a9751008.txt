Abstract    :
              This grant has allowed the introduction of infrared spectroscopy into first
              chemistry courses and expanded the use of IR in the organic courses.  Students
              in freshman chemistry laboratories will use the instrument to identify
              functional groups and analyze unknown compounds.  Student in the organic
              laboratories use the instrument to collect and process data as well as to do
              spectral database searching.  These important functions are not currently
              available to the students.  *
