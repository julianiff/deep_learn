Abstract    :
              The goal of the project is to set up a Quality Engineering Laboratory to teach
              statistical methods to industrial and manufacturing engineering students with
              the use of an integrated sequence of part fabrication and assembly (using some
              purchased parts) exercises resulting in a final product, where students collect
              relevant data at each stage and learn to use appropriate statistical methods to
              improve the quality of the product. These exercises not only give students
              hands-on experience in various manufacturing and measurement processes, but
              also enable them to see applications of key engineering statistical methods in
              a holistic way in the context of a single production process. The synergistic
              effect of making parts, measuring them, and analyzing data statistically
              enhances the understanding and appreciation of production methods as well as
              statistical methods. The impact of this project goes beyond about 150 students
              per year taking the engineering statistics courses.    The new laboratory
              represents a significant upgrade of the laboratory that was set up at the
              beginning of this academic year and that has some basic experimental setups and
              measurement instruments, but no fabrication facilities. These setups continue
              to be used as necessary.  *
