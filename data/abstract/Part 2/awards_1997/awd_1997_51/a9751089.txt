Abstract    :
              This project incorporates modern instrumentation in cellular and molecular
              biology in order to upgrade the laboratory components of courses in
              introductory biology, research methods in the natural sciences, genetics, cell
              biology, and microbiology, and thereby introduce undergraduate students to
              current research technologies in molecular biology.  This project directly
              supports a new research-driven curriculum implemented in the biology department
              in 1994, which focuses on hands-on and collaborative problem solving as a way
              of leaming.  Modernization in the laboratory instruction of the rapidly
              expanding area of molecular/cell biology complements and balances recent
              advances in the experimentally based study of animal systems (physiology and
              developmental biology) attained by the recent implementation of new, modern
              equipment and laboratory experiences in these areas.    To achieve the
              interrelated goals of improvement in the way students leam about molecular
              biology and their understanding of concepts and proficiency in the technologies
              and techniques required to conduct modern investigative projects addressing
              questions of gene expression and regulation and cellular differentiation and
              metabolism, the college is implementing new laboratory sessions utilizing DNA
              techniques designed specifically for undergraduate laboratory instruction.  The
              inclusion of basic methodologies such as DNA isolation, restriction enzyme
              analysis, and gel electrophoresis of DNA and protein into biology laboratory
              exercises beginning with the introductory biology course, a general education
              requirement for all students, significantly influences students' education and
              appreciation of modern molecular technologies and their impact on society. 
              Biology majors, through the laboratory component of a series of advanced
              courses, graduate with technical proficiency and improved conceptual
              understanding of recent advances in the cellular/molecular basis of living
              systems.  *
