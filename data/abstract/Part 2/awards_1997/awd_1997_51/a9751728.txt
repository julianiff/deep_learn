Abstract    :
              This institution owns and operates an 85-foot research vessel, the R/V Vantuna.
              In addition to meeting the instructional demands of students enrolled in marine
              science courses, the R/V Vantuna is involved in educating and giving
              field-based experiences to students in teacher preparation programs.  Extensive
              educational outreach efforts aimed at K-12 and students in  2- and 4-year
              college programs in the area are conducted by this program. However, since the
              boat was initially outfitted 25 years ago, oceanographic sampling gear and
              methods of data analysis have moved well beyond its original capabilities. This
              project is augmenting the equipment on the boat with sophisticated electronic
              sampling and photodocumentation gear that allows students to learn
              state-of-the-art techniques and collect numerical and visual data to support
              integrative studies. The uniqueness of this project comes from the extended use
              of oceanographic data in linking field and classroom activities. Not only are
              many students, and especially future teachers, being given access to
              sophisticated equipment to learn modern oceanographic techniques, but the high
              quality data they collect is being made universally available for analysis
              through an extensive database. This approach is extending the value of the
              oceanographic experience beyond those groups traditionally served, and
              benefiting off-campus groups who can sample the database by searching the
              Internet.
