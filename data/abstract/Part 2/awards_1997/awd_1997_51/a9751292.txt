Abstract    :
              Recent educational research has shown that the traditional lecture style of
              teaching is ineffective. These studies show that, to effectively learn,
              students must actively participate in the learning process and engage the
              material. The department is creating a new environment for teaching science and
              mathematics courses that uses a participatory and discovery-based approach to
              learning. A multimedia classroom/laboratory is being developed to facilitate
              the participation of all students in the learning process. This classroom is
              being equipped with 15 computer workstations with interfaces for experiments
              and video projection equipment. The classroom is providing a powerful,
              flexible, vivid, and easy-to-use computer environment for each student.
              Students are not being merely passive spectators in a lecture, but rather
              active participants in an exciting learning experience. The result is a deeper
              and clearer understanding, longer retention, and greater excitement about
              learning. Students are becoming masters of the material and not slaves to it.
