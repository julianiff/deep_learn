Abstract    :
              Networked computer laboratories are used for instruction in Introductory
              Physical Geology, Introductory Physical Geography, Environmental Geology, and
              Historical Geology.  These laboratories are used to enhance student learning
              through access to information services over the World Wide Web, instructional
              routines on CD-ROMs, visualization exercises using digital imagery, simulation
              of research experiences, modeling of physical processes, use of real-time data
              sets, and collection and analysis of data and interfacing with the computer
              laboratories.  A special focus of these activities will be toward preparation
              of in-service teachers, who will need to use these skills in their professional
              careers.  Evaluation of computer-assisted learning can be undertaken by
              monitoring impacts on student performance as a result of this instructional
              mode and evaluation of the effectiveness of existing computer-assisted learning
              materials now available through commercial and academic sources.
