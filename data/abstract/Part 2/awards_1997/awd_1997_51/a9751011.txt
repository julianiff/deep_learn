Abstract    :
              Acquisition of a high performance capillary electrophoresis (CE) instrument is
              permitting this exciting new technique in separation science to be incorporated
              into our undergraduate chemistry curriculum through a specially designed set of
              experiments.  These experiments are having a significant impact on our
              Quantitative Analysis and Instrumental Analysis undergraduate laboratories. The
              effect of these expedients includes:  an introduction of CE principles and
              methodologies in both laboratory experiences; the development of experiment
              which demonstrate micellar electrokinetic chromatography as a technique for the
              separation of neutral molecules in the Instrumental Analysis Laboratory; and a
              comparison of capillary gel electrophoresis to traditional slab gel
              electrophoresis for the separation of DNA fragments in the Instrumental
              Analysis Laboratory.  In addition, undergraduate CE research projects are
              included.  *
