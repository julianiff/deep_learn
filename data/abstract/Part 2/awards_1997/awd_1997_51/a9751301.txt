Abstract    :
              Fourier-transform nuclear magnetic resonance (FT-NMR) is an essential tool used
              by chemists and should be an essential part of the undergraduate education of
              scientists.  Two problems meet those attempting to implement FT-NMR in the
              undergraduate curriculum: the expense of the instrument and the ongoing
              maintenance cost.  This solution has educational, scientific, and economic
              merit.  The addition of a new electronics and a new C13 probe, the Anasazi
              ERT60/90 system, to an existing permanent magnet creates a system that can do
              multinuclear, 1- and 2-dimensional FT-NMR at a moderate cost.  A series of
              projects take advantage of this system's ease of gathering data to use
              throughout a student's 4-year education, for both majors and nonmajors.  An
              undergraduate who saw this new system demonstrated last summer remarked
              "organic students in the future will love you for getting this instrument."  *
