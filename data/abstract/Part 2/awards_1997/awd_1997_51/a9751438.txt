Abstract    :
              This project is developing the Basic Technology Concepts Laboratory.  The
              laboratory is being incorporated into the Fundamentals of Technology and
              Technology Applications courses.  The laboratory is serving as the cornerstone
              for hands-on learning activities in the planned Engineering-Preparatory
              program.  The laboratory includes equipment and activities related to basic
              engineering principles, including rate, resistance, energy, power, momentum,
              waves, and vibrations, and activities dealing with advanced topics such as
              alternate energy, optoelectronics, lasers, telecommunications, and
              instrumentation and control.  The laboratory is also being used for summer
              workshops for secondary students and in-service teacher training activities.  *
