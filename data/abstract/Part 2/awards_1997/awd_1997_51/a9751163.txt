Abstract    :
              Molecular structure is of central importance in all chemical research.  Since
              the 1950s, two techniques have revolutionized the science of structure
              determination: x-ray crystallography, particularly with the development of
              direct methods, and nuclear-magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.  This
              project incorporates modern NMR into the undergraduate curriculum and
              undergraduate research.  NMR experiments and theory of increasing
              sophistication are introduced starting in the sophomore year.  Among the
              undergraduate research that uses NMR are projects in environmental toxicology
              and art conservation.  *
