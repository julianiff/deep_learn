Abstract    :
              This project enhances the chemistry curricula by incorporating the theory and
              practice of gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) analysis in the general
              chemistry, analytical chemistry, and organic chemistry courses.  The college
              has previously had access to outdated GC instrumentation but no access to MS
              instrumentation of any type.  Incorporating a GC/MS instrument enhances the
              curricula by reinforcing lecture topics, upgrading existing experiments, and
              allowing the introduction of new experiments.  The new GC/MS is the
              Hewlett-Packard G1800A GCD system.  This state-of-the-art instrumentation
              greatly benefits the students with the opportunity to gain hands-on experience
              in the operation of an instrument that is widely used in university,
              government, and industrial laboratories.  Lectures in the respective courses
              introduce students to various levels of complexity in regard to the theory of
              GC/MS.  The students gain experience in sample preparation, analyzing data, and
              fundamental operations of the instrument.  *
