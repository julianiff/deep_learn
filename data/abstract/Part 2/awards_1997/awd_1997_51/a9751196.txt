Abstract    :
              This residential college for women is acquiring, through this project, an HP-GCD
              high performance gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GC-MS) system. Chemistry
              students at all levels can use the instrument to discover and learn the
              principles and techniques of chromatographic separation and analysis by mass
              spectrometry. Specific applications for the GC-MS throughout the curriculum
              include use in student-designed research projects in the general chemistry
              course; general introduction to the principles of operation of a GC-MS and its
              application to reaction product analysis in the organic chemistry laboratory;
              theory, operation, and optimization of a GC-MS and its analytical applications
              in the instrumental analysis laboratory; use as a substance identification tool
              in the analysis of water and soil samples in the environmental chemistry and
              biology laboratories; correlation of theoretically predicted fragmentation
              patterns with experimental MS data in the physical chemistry laboratory; and
              essential laboratory instrument for independent study and summer research
              projects, especially for those projects involving environmental and synthetic
              organic chemistry.  *
