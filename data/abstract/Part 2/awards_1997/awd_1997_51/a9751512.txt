Abstract    :
              The Archaeological Studies Program is part of the Sociology/Archaeology
              Department.  In 1993, the university completed an institutional strategic
              planning process in order to emphasize the priorities and strengths of the
              institution.  Archaeological Studies was specifically singled out as a program
              of exceptional strength and given high priority for resources.  Unlike most
              archaeology programs, which tend to focus on one type of archaeology, this
              program is designed to be comprehensive and interdisciplinary.  The curriculum
              includes coursework in prehistoric archaeology, classical archaeology, human
              osteology, geoarchaeology, historical archaeology, cultural anthropology, and
              cultural resources management.  All of this fields are integrated by the
              unifying theme of cultural ecology.  A minor in geoarchaeology is being added
              in 1997.      This program is actively involved in the preparation of new
              classroom teachers Through the Archaeology Education Program.  The Archaeology
              Education Program actively involves the School of Education students in
              hands-on learning in the science of archaeology and prepares them to
              incorporate this training into their classrooms.  Classes offered to teachers
              include "Archaeology for Teachers," "Archaeology Field School for Teachers,"
              and "Laboratory Methods for Teachers."   The new laboratory facilities will
              enable this program to significantly improve these courses.  The staff members
              of the Archaeology Education program are certified teachers, which allows them
              to help education majors incorporate appropriate material into classes designed
              for students from the Kindergarten to the 12th grade level.    *
