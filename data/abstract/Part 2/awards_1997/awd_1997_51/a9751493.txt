Abstract    :
              Computing technology has rapidly evolved from a focus on the single workstation
              to a focus on shared resources over an intranet or the Internet.  The Computer
              Information Systems (CIS) and the Engineering Departments are struggling to
              keep pace with these rapid shifts in computing technology.  A critical need, as
              pointed out by advisory groups, is to develop skills for software technicians
              such that they can productively function in environments requiring visual,
              event driven, distributed, object-oriented computing (VEDOC) solutions. 
              Teaching focus toward this end is moving rather slowly, largely inhibited by
              obsolete or inadequate equipment.  This project is designed to develop the
              computing hardware/software and curricular revisions necessary to train
              students in cross-platform hardware and VEDOC environments.    This project is
              based upon X-Window GUIs, Linux operating system, and Tcl/Tk.  These software
              tools are freely available and have already been implemented.  Underlying
              hardware is to be developed and curricula revised to meet project objectives. 
              Java is deployed in a later stage of curricula development.    Undergraduate
              students seeking the M.S. degree (a software technicians degree) through the
              CIS Department, undergraduate students seeking the A.S. Engineering Computer
              Science transfer degree, and students retraining are affected by this project.
