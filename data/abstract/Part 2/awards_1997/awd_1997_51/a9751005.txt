Abstract    :
              Fourier transform infrared and ultraviolet/visible spectrometers have been
              introduced to students in the first semester general chemistry laboratories at
              St. Edward's University.  Student use these instruments to incorporate
              spectroscopic measurements into three existing groups of experiments; basic
              experimental techniques, qualitative analysis, and quantitative analysis.  The
              integrated spectroscopy components include both experiments that emphasize
              spectroscopy and the use of spectroscopy to supplement existing experiments. 
              The experiments reinforce discussions of the electromagnetic spectrum and
              chemical bonding presented in the lecture portion of the course.  This project
              will more than double the number of students who acquire a working knowledge of
              modern spectroscopic instrumentation and techniques.  *
