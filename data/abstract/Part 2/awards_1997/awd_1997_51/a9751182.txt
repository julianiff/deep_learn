Abstract    :
              This project addresses the exposure of undergraduate psychology students at all
              levels to human psychophysiological demonstrations, exercises, and experiments.
               Despite psychology's strong position in the life sciences, undergraduate
              students have not been exposed to a life-science orientation to the field. 
              When they have been, they have not been given hands-on opportunities to
              encourage further scientific interest in the field.  This project provided a
              computer-based modular instrument system for physiological data acquisition,
              analysis, and control in an undergraduate laboratory designed especially for
              this type of data collection.  In the Foundations of Psychology course, teams
              of five are addressing questions associated with general psychology topics such
              as "polygraph" measurement and its accuracy, biofeedback related exercises, and
              brain activity measurement.  In the more advanced Biopsychology course,
              approximately 35 percent of laboratory time is being devoted to teams of four
              students addressing questions in basic arousal, evoked potentials, and
              overnight sleep phenomena.  As part of the major requirement in Senior Methods
              Seminar, some majors are opting to conduct an individual research project in
              this area.  The impact of this project is to strengthen the student perception
              of psychology's contribution to neuroscience and to encourage new scientists.
