Abstract    :
              As part of the department's effort to build an integrated undergraduate earth
              science education program, this project is developing an environmental
              engineering geophysics field program.    This field program provides students
              in four different departments at this institution and students at Biosphere 2,
              in Arizona, with multidisciplinary, inquiry-oriented, field-based geophysical
              experiences.  These experiences address local and regional environmental,
              engineering, and geological problems.  This program and the curricular
              materials developed in it are being made available to other earth science
              departments as a model.    The university is purchasing two conductivity meters
              (for shallow and medium depth applications), a magnetometer/gradiometer, a
              seismic reflection/refraction system, and two generic Windows/Linux field
              laptops with basic visualization software for in-field data analysis and
              preliminary processing.  This equipment completes the instrumentation pool for
              the geophysics field classes.  *
