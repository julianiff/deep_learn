Abstract    :
              Basic to the philosophy of the Plastics Engineering Technology bachelors degree
              program, a graduating student should be prepared to make a positive impact upon
              entering the plastics industry.  This requires possessing engineering
              technology skills in plastics materials, design, and processing, and the
              graduate must also be prepared to develop and present new ideas.  As a
              cornerstone to the program of study, the students use leading-edge computer
              technologies, including solid molding, finite element analysis, mold flow, mold
              cooling, and polymer flow; have a comprehensive laboratory experience resulting
              in an understanding of the operation of processing machinery and proper
              processing conditions to produce high-quality parts; are required to develop
              and range an engineering project; and present the project before their peers
              and professionals in their field.    The object of this project is to develop a
              national model for the appropriate integration of the interaction of the
              mechanical properties of a plastic, the effect of processing on mechanical
              properties, and the relationship of part design to overall part performance. 
              It is necessary to obtain an instrumented puncture impact testing system to
              accomplish this goal.  The justification for this equipment is based on the
              innovative way in which the new equipment is used.  *
