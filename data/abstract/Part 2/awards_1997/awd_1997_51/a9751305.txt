Abstract    :
              For enhancement of the curriculum in cell biology, this project provides a
              Philips EM208S transmission electron microscope with a digitized imaging
              system.  The Philips 208S allows students to use electron microscopy in their
              investigations of new and emerging areas of biology.  The instrument permits
              new exercises in the Cells and Tissues laboratory course; allows the
              introduction of electron microscopy into laboratory courses in Microbiology,
              Plant Physiology, and Neurobiology; enables fine-structure studies in
              individual projects in the Microbiology laboratory course; and expands the
              opportunities for electron microscopic investigations for students
              participating in independent research.  The new equipment builds upon a 26-year
              history of undergraduate use of a temperamental (and now almost antique) RCA
              EMU4B.  By contrast, the Philips 208S, with its automated controls, digitized
              imaging system and printing capabilities, substantially upgrades and expands
              the capabilities for instruction in electron microscopy.  The ability to
              digitize images enables students to (1) collect data in finished form during
              one laboratory period, obviating the need for long hours in the dark room; (2)
              record the images for later analysis; and (3) print them for research
              presentations and reports.  Display of the image on the computer screen allows
              groups of students to view a specimen simultaneously without lengthy dark
              adaptation.  The Philips 208S, with computerized settings and automated
              controls, can be used by students with minimal supervision after introductory
              instruction.  Finally, it is relatively easy for faculty to maintain without
              the assistance of a dedicated technician.  The Philips 208S provides effective
              access for our undergraduates to a key modern instrument in their laboratory
              courses and impart technological skills important for continued work in
              biology.  *
