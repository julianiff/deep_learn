Abstract    :
              This project is addressing major changes in student demographics, levels of
              preparedness for college, and innovations in pedagogy made possible through
              computers and telecommunications.  The department is creating a combined
              classroom/computer-based laboratory for psychology.  Curricula in three courses
              (Physiological Psychology, Research Methods, and Statistics) are being revised
              to fully integrate computer-based learning and the Internet.  These courses are
              being will be taught in the classroom/laboratory.  In addition, students in
              Introduction to Psychology are being given an opportunity to use computers to
              review and reinforce concepts learned in class and from their textbook. 
              Innovative CD ROMs, computerized study guides, simulation software, and the
              Internet are being made available to help students succeed and continue in
              their study of psychology.  *
