Abstract    :
              In recent years, the field of biology has become more focused on the study of
              life at the cellular and molecular levels of organization.  Therefore modern
              biology is more dependent upon instrumentation and technology.  The Biology
              Department is integrating molecular methodologies into several laboratory
              courses.  As the department continues its effort to provide more investigative
              opportunities for students in the laboratory setting, it is vital that it
              continues to incorporate techniques of molecular biology.  The courses directly
              impacted by these reforms include Honors Microbiology, Immunology, Cell and
              Molecular Biology, Virology, and Biotechnology.  The equipment being used to
              implement these improved opportunities for learning includes apparatus for gel
              electrophoresis and power packs, a hybridization incubator, speed vacuum
              centrifuge, 4 C microfuge, transilluminator, dot-blot apparatus, CO2 incubator,
              and an inverted microscope.  *
