Abstract    :
                The Integrated Natural Resources Technology Program demonstrates an
              interdisciplinary approach to educating technically advanced field technicians
              for ecosystem-based management.  The program differs from traditional natural
              resources and resource-related programs that focus on individual disciplines
              such as forestry, fisheries or wildlife.  Instead, the project embodies a
              systems perspective to information gathering, data analysis, and ecosystem
              management.  The program, a two-year, high-tech technician curriculum with a
              three-year option for students transferring to a four-year institution is: 1 )
              developing, implementing, evaluating, and disseminating an outcome-driven
              curriculum; 2) developing and implementing a Summer Institute to assist
              community college faculty in adopting an integrated perspective; and 3)
              developing and implementing integrated field experiences.  It has strong
              support from local public and private natural resources employers and from
              education--the program articulates with three university and two high school
              natural resources programs.  The program has identified skills to be acquired
              by students in the program, conducted an employability survey to ensure these
              skills meet employer needs and that jobs are available, developed curriculum
              framework, and acquired agreements to collaborate with employers in developing
              cooperative work experiences.
