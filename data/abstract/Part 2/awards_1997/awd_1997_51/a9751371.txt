Abstract    :
              The primary goals of this project are to develop undergraduates' ability in
              applying molecular techniques to answer questions in the biological and
              environmental sciences and to expand the scope of student research in these
              areas.  Techniques such as DNA sequencing, protein polyacrylamide gel
              electrophoresis, polymerase chain reaction, and tissue culture need to be used
              in undergraduate laboratories if we expect students to be competitive in
              graduate school and in the workplace.  The Biology and Environmental Science
              Departments are incorporating these molecular techniques into upper-level
              biology and environmental science courses as part of their effort to encourage
              undergraduate research.  Students apply a broad range of molecular techniques
              to environmental and biology studies and gain better understanding of
              biological functions of nucleic acids and proteins.  Success of the program is
              determined by conducting pre- and post-tests of students' knowledge and ability
              to apply molecular techniques and by monitoring student research projects.  The
              degree to which curricula changes prepare graduates for the workplace and
              graduate study is also assessed.  Evaluation results and student papers can be
              presented at the educational sessions of several scientific meetings to allow
              other colleges to consider using this approach to improve their biology and
              environmental science laboratories.  Approximately 240 local high school
              science teachers, the 7,000 high school students that they teach, and 125
              Upward Bound students and their instructors can also use most of the new
              equipment.  *
