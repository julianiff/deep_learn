Abstract    :
              This project will develop a Multi disciplinary Mechatronics Laboratory at GMI. 
              The proposed laboratory will benefit undergraduate students in two mechatronics
              and two other related courses.  Mechatronics is the synergistic integration of
              mechanical, control and electronics engineering and computer control for the
              design, manufacturing and control of products and processes.  Intelligent
              automobile suspensions, anti-lock brakes, robots, CNC machines and many
              consumer electronics are examples of mechatronic products.  Developing such
              products requires multi-disciplinary knowledge and skills.  Towards this end,
              undergraduate mechatronics courses have been developed at GMI.  Since these are
              multi-disciplinary courses, they require a laboratory that is fundamentally
              different from traditional mechanical engineering labs.  Experiments and
              projects for this course have been designed and planned in a sequence that will
              allow the students to acquire a complete mechatronic product design experience.
               This laboratory will provide the students with cross-platform knowledge and
              skills necessary for today's engineer.  Upon completion of the laboratory,
              students will be able to design mechatronic products involving mechanical
              design, controllers, sensors, actuators, intelligent algorithms and interface.
