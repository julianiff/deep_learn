Abstract    :
                   This project enhances the plant biology curriculum by utilizing instruction
              that increases critical thinking skills.  The objectives of the project are to
              increase student quantitative skill levels, provide students with exposure to
              the process of science, increase the level of interest in plant biology, and
              allow more opportunities for student research projects.  These objectives can
              be met by utilizing modern scientific methodology and computer-assisted data
              analysis in Botany, Advanced Plant Biology, and Research Project courses.  The
              Plant Biology course enrolls a significant number of K-12 prospective teachers.
                    An ultraviolet/visible spectrophotometer with computer analysis software
              allows for examining absorption spectra of isolated plant pigment, direct
              measurement of enzymatic rates, and measurement of protein during column
              chromatography.  A photosynthesis package that includes a leaf chamber, oxygen
              sensor, data logger, and software allows for measurement of photosynthetic
              rate, light compensation point, light saturation curves, and photosynthetic
              action spectrum.  Mini SDSPAGE equipment allows for an examination of protein
              changes during stages of plant development.  A notebook computer allows for
              data collection from multiple instruments and use of the photosynthesis package
              in the greenhouse.  The scanner allows electrophoresis gels to be imaged so
              that protein bands can be quantified using public domain software.  The success
              of the project is based primarily on measurements of student performance and by
              student evaluations.   *
