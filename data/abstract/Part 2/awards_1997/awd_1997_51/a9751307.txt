Abstract    :
              Many concepts in statistics are abstract and difficult to teach, especially to
              non-science-majors.  The goal of the Virtual Lab in Statistics is to develop
              laboratory materials that promote hands-on student-centered learning of
              statistics and, as a result, increase students' understanding of concepts in
              statistics as well as their motivation for learning statistics.  The emphasis
              is on topics that have important applications in the social sciences; special
              attention is paid to techniques pertaining to the analysis of data from
              experiments and to the use of exploratory graphical tools.    The proposed
              laboratory provides an integrated set of materials and activities for use in
              undergraduate-level statistics classes.  The materials consist of (a) case
              studies that include data from real experiments, (b) interactive computer
              simulations of important statistical concepts, (c) detailed discussions and
              explanations of statistical issues related to the case studies and the
              simulations, and (d) a set of statistical experiments that students can
              undertake to discover important statistical relationships and principles.  A
              tool kit allowing instructors to design their own simulations has also been
              developed.  *
