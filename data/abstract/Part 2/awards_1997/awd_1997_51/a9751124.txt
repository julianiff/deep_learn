Abstract    :
              Greenfield Community College is creating a laboratory/classroom with
              state-of-the-art software and hardware for teacher demonstrations and a second
              location where faculty can incorporate computer technology into mathematics
              classes which is also available at other times for students to work on
              mathematics projects out of class.  This project is building on previous
              successes in implementing a reform-oriented, technology-integrated calculus
              curriculum.  This project allows faculty to integrate into the curriculum
              contextual problems to be solved individually or in groups as a central part of
              the students' conceptual development.  Computer work is thus becoming integral,
              rather than peripheral, to calculus classes.  Further plans include integrating
              computer technology into precalculus and college algebra and ultimately
              statistics courses.  Evaluation of project outcomes is being assessed through
              classroom action research and classroom assessment techniques and disseminated
              through the college website.  Professional presentations and a teleconference
              are also being planned.
