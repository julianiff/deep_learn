Abstract    :
                  This is a proposal to provide equipment for an undergraduate neurobiology
              course and for undergraduate independent research involving neurobiology
              techniques.  Each year the laboratory course will impact 12 students, with at
              least 2 more students able to use the equipment for independent research.  An
              additional 171 students enrolled in other courses will also benefit through the
              equipment being used in laboratory exercises or lecture demonstrations.  The
              course helps fill a significant gap in the undergraduate education at the
              University of Tennessee, Knoxville, in that there are no laboratory courses
              devoted to the rapidly growing area of neuroscience.  The proposed course will
              compliment the lecture course, Foundations in Neurobiology (BCMB 415),
              currently being taught by the PI and Co-PI.  The proposed laboratory course is
              an intensive semester-long analysis of the neural circuitry controlling feeding
              behavior in the snail, Lymnaea stagnalis.  During the course, students will be
              exposed to a variety of neuroanatomical and electrophysiological  techniques
              while they learn basic principles associated with the field of neurobiology. 
              In addition to completing 5 formal exercises, students will also be given the
              opportunity to conduct their own hypothesis-driven experiments.  Required
              written reports and an oral presentation of the results of their independent
              project  will provide students with further training necessary for advancing in
              the field of neuroscience.  Finally, lab exercises will be disseminated
              electronically via the development of a neurobiology laboratory page accessible
              via the World Wide Web.
