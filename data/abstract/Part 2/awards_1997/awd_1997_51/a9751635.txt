Abstract    :
              This institution is purchasing Silicon Graphics workstations and accessories to
              set up an interdisciplinary computer-aided design and World Wide Web-based
              classroom/laboratory for educational instruction and student projects. 
              Professor Schneider, of the Mathematics and Computer Science Department, and
              Professor Gillison, of the Art Department, are initiating a new undergraduate
              course of study in computer imaging, graphics, and the World Wide Web that have
              courses based in the classroom.  Professor Schneider is collaborating with
              several high schools from the Bronx to train teachers and students in these
              fields.  Professor Linda Keen and students in the Mathematics and Computer
              Science Department use the workstations to visualize dynamical systems.
