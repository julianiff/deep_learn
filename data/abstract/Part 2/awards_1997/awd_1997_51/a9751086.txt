Abstract    :
              Computational methods complement experimental and theoretical methods as a means
              for advancing chemical knowledge.  Therefore, it is essential that the
              undergraduate chemistry curriculum include a meaningful computational
              component.  In general chemistry, students are using software packages to
              enhance their understanding of microscopic properties and the relationship
              between microscopic and macroscopic properties.  In an introductory
              computational chemistry course, students are being exposed to different
              computational methods and the practical applications of electronic structure
              methods.  In organic chemistry, these skills are being applied to studies of
              the relationship between reactivity and electronic structure.  The
              spectroscopic applications of computational methods are being emphasized in
              physical chemistry, while students in inorganic and biochemistry courses are
              undertaking more complex, multifaceted projects involving structural
              predictions based on DFT-gradient optimizations, crystal structure
              visualizations, and drug binding affinity to active sites.
