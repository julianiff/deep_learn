Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics is completing the implementation of a program to
              provide computer-laboratory-enhanced Calculus I and II to all of its science
              and mathematics students.  The program is fully operational for Calculus II. 
              This project provides the additional computer laboratory capacity to implement
              the Calculus I component.  In doing so, the project demonstrates a means of
              expanding networked, instructional computing laboratory capacity which is an
              alternative to the conversion of general instructional space.  This expansion
              is done through a portable system that extends extant, fixed laboratories
              through a wireless Ethernet technology.  The system permits networked
              instructional laboratory environments to be set up on an hourly basis in
              general classroom settings without renovation or cabling.
