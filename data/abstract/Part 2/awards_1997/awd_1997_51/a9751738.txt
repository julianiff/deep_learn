Abstract    :
              In the mid-eighties, mathematics and science programs were discontinued at
              William Woods University (until recently a women's college) and students were
              to sent to the neighboring Westminster College (formerly all male) for these
              classes.  Enrollment in these classes suffered significantly.  In the past six
              years, tremendous efforts have been made to bring science and mathematics back
              to the WWU campus.  As a result of these efforts mathematics and biology majors
              are now offered on campus. This program is bringing physics programs to WWU
              campus.   The objectives that are being addressed are (1) offering an
              introductory calculus based 2-semester physics sequence, (2) setting up the
              undergraduate physics laboratory, (3) exposing students to role-models, (4)
              conducting a summer workshop for teachers, (5) developing an interdisciplinary
              upper-division physics course, and (6) setting up a student support system.   
              The introductory courses and accompanying laboratories are being conducted in
              an investigative, hands-on approach, integrating technology and current
              research, providing students with the opportunity of constructing their own
              knowledge in an active fashion.  Cooperative learning is an inherent part of
              everyday activities and the emphasis will be on critical thinking and deep
              understanding.  Self-directed student research and presentations by students
              locally and at meetings is strongly encouraged.  *
