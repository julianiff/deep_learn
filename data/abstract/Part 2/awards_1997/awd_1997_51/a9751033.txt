Abstract    :
              The Department of Biological Sciences at Florida International University has
              increased its enrollment from 510 in 1991 to 1234 majors in 1996.  Though the
              Department has adequate funds for regular supplies and maintenance of
              physiological labs, it lacks funds for upgrading equipment to introduce new
              technologies and challenging experiments to undergraduate students.  Our
              existing physiological equipment and outdated APPLE IIE computers are
              inadequate for providing rigorous lab courses.  The requested Biopac Systems
              and computers with modems, Windows 95 and CD-ROM will provide numerous precise,
              accurate physiological recordings, on-line instant analysis of the recorded
              data, efficient reference search, internet group discussion, and multi-media
              applications.  Students will be able to use new advanced technologies to
              conduct innovated physiological experiments.  It is estimated that the
              requested equipment will benefit approximately one-thousand eight-hundred
              students per year in physiological experiments in seven courses.  The requested
              computers with interactive CD-ROM for multimedia applications can also benefit
              many other courses.  Funding for this project would significantly enhance the
              development of our future physiology program and attract many talented students
              physiological research.   *
