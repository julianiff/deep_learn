Abstract    :
              Laboratory courses are an excellent environment in which to master basic
              knowledge obtained in course lectures.  However, it is evident that many
              laboratory environments are computer controlled so that automated testing,
              measurement, and device protocols are becoming standard.  Therefore, this
              project is making all of the introductory laboratories computer driven.  In
              particular, it is enhancing the education of the students in the following
              areas:  (1) system design and integration; (2) computer interfacing and data
              acquisition, including computerized instrument control; and (3) testbed design
              and automated testing.  The software implementation is being accomplished
              through National Instrument's LabVIEW Software, while the hardware
              implementation is being accomplished using a Pentium-based personal computer
              with GPIB card.  A Lab-PC+ multifunction I/O board is performing data
              acquisition and control of GPIB compatible instrumentation, which is being
              connected to the PC computer and controlled via LabVIEW drivers.  In addition,
              computer controlled laboratories are allowing faculty to greatly modify the
              content of the laboratory curriculum so that a more integrated connection
              between the theoretical courses and the laboratory offerings can occur. 
              Finally, laboratory experiments with more design content can be offered.  *
