Abstract    :
              This project is providing equipment for new undergraduate courses in
              Computational Chemistry and Data Visualization.  Computational Chemistry is
              aimed at chemistry majors, and Data Visualization is designed for
              non-science-students in the undergraduate core curriculum.  Although different
              in content, both courses have the same laboratory exercise format and require
              the same computational equipment.  The Computational Chemistry course is
              designed to generate an understanding of the interplay between basic theory and
              computational methodology, the circumstances under which computation is the
              preferred tool for problemsolving, and the accuracy with which those problems
              can be solved. The Data Visualization course includes both the methodology of
              quantitative analysis of visual information and the experimental process of
              image acquisition.  The idea that the process of image acquisition cannot be
              divorced from the analysis process is emphasized because the methods of data
              generation influence both the interpretation of the data and the methods of
              data analysis.  The goal of these classes is to enhance critical thinking about
              scientific problems.  Computation can assist in achieving that goal.  *
