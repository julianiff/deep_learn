Abstract    :
              This project equips a classroom with a network of PCs to teach neural systems in
              the undergraduate curriculum. Since the mathematics of adaptive systems are
              beyond the knowledge of the undergraduate, the project teaches the concepts
              through simulation. An undergraduate textbook integrating a hypertext and a
              commercial simulator is being written to explain the concepts. Students use the
              simulator in every lecture to comprehend the concepts of adaptation.
