Abstract    :
              This project brings current FT-NMR technology to science and non-science majors
              at Huntington College.  Students in general chemistry courses will be
              introduced to the theory and use of NMR through demonstrations.  Hands-on use
              of the instrument and analysis of spectra is initiated in the organic course
              and continues throughout the remainder of the curriculum.  Two-dimensional
              techniques, such as COSY and HETCOR, provide students with the training and
              experience required for industrial employment or graduate school.  The NMR
              spectrometer improves the scope of undergraduate research and sparks interest
              in science.  The project enhances the education and training of faculty and
              students from local colleges in special courses.  This expands the impact of
              the project on a wider audience which includes underrepresented groups.  The
              project is evaluated by feedback from participating colleges, the number of
              students in courses and undergraduate research projects, formal presentations,
              publications, and surveys of faculty and students.  Dissemination is occuring
              through presentations, publication, the Web, and interactions with educators at
              scientific meetings.  *
