Abstract    :
              This project incorporates field-flow fractionation (FFF) into the physical
              chemistry laboratory.  This relatively new technique is rapidly gaining
              acceptance as a method for separating and  characterizing macromolecules and
              particles with diameters ranging from 0.002 to 100 micrometers in diameter. 
              The method is superficially similar to chromatography, but the basis of
              separation in FFF is the interaction of particle flow down a channel with an
              external field applied perpendicular to the direction of flow.  Separation
              occurs because particles differ in their tendency to be forced into slow
              carrier streamlines adjacent to the channel wall.  Besides being a new and
              promising technique, FFF is an ideal vehicle for introducing students to an
              experimental investigation of transport properties.  For example, in normal
              mode flow FFF, the retention time of an eluted particle depends on the
              diffusion constant of that particle.  Diffusion measurements have been made for
              macromolecules and other particles over the wide range of 0.002 to 1
              micrometer.    This project adopts FFF diffusion constant measurement as the
              primary nonequilibrium component of the junior-level physical chemistry
              laboratory.  It joins experiments that characterize porous solids, measure
              activity coefficients electrochemically, ascertain enthalpies of combustion or
              solution, and establish rate constants of chemical reactions.  Addition of the
              proposed FFF experiment also complements these exercises with one that is
              computer controlled.  *
