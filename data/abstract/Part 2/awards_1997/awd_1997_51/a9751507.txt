Abstract    :
              For many years, the Physics Advanced Laboratory course at Reed College did not
              fulfill its goal of familiarizing junior-level students with the concerns of
              contemporary experimental physics research.  Rather than a systematic
              introduction to experimental research, it was chiefly an advanced electronics
              course.  The faculty have recently redesigned the Advanced Laboratory to (1)
              more effectively expose junior-level physics majors to the concerns and
              techniques of modern experimental physics research, (2) develop students'
              skills as autonomous researchers, and (3) construct an instructional laboratory
              in a cost-effective manner.  The laboratory consists of flexible,
              component-based research stations that can be configured for both guided
              experiments that model well-designed research projects, and, with alterations
              to the experimental parameters, independent student projects.  In order to
              broaden the scope of the Advanced Laboratory, resources for experiments in
              astronomy and radio astronomy are being added.  There is a growing consensus
              that research-based science curricula, involving hands-on, investigative modes
              of learning, greatly aid the development of scientific maturity in
              undergraduate students.
