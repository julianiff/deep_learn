Abstract    :
              This project is developing and implementing curricular strategies that can
              improve the retention and graduation rate of women students. Women students
              typically make up 20 percent of the lower-level classes, but only 12 percent of
              the upper-level classes. A computer science laboratory that is run by and for
              computer science students is being implemented. The laboratory is giving women
              computer science students systematic experiences that are developing their
              confidence and ability to accept positions of increasing importance and
              responsibility in a computing environment. The new laboratory is the vehicle
              for providing these experiences. In addition to attracting and retaining women
              to the curriculum, this program is significantly benefiting all of the students
              in the computer science program.  *
