Abstract    :
              Since computer-based methods such as molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics,
              Monte Carlo techniques, computational reaction dynamics and computational
              quantum mechanics continue to grow in popularity among researchers both in
              academia and industry, it is becoming more important to introduce these
              methods, both in concept and in practice, at the undergraduate level.
              Acquisition of two high-speed computer workstations is permitting an adjustment
              to the upper-division chemistry curriculum so as to include introductions to
              these methods for all chemistry majors.  This project enhances the
              undergraduate chemistry experience through (1) modification of existing
              courses, (2) development of a suite of interconnected and computationally
              oriented independent study course options, and (3) computational support for
              undergraduate research opportunities. Implementation of this project is raising
              the appreciation of all chemistry majors for the range of computational methods
              applicable to chemical problems. Curricular enhancements developed in the
              course the project will be communicated to the chemical education community
              through presentations at appropriate meetings and publications.  *
