Abstract    :
              Computer science majors can significantly enhance their ability to solve
              problems through introduction to exploratory research programming.  This kind
              of programming is not typically found in computer science classes in the normal
              course of study but is comparable with the kind of explorative study performed
              regularly by other science majors.  The objective of this project is to
              introduce students to exploratory programming techniques in the framework of
              large-scale, ongoing software projects.  Throughout the laboratory, students
              pursue five different projects pertaining to mobile robot navigation and having
              exploratory components.  These projects introduce students to current
              technology such as X-Windows programming and Unix TCP/IP network programming,
              while also requiring students to program sophisticated hardware devices such as
              stereo vision system, and various sensors.  Students receive excellent training
              in research programming and large-scale team programming projects to benefit
              those who go on to strong software development firms or excellent graduate
              schools.  The equipment benefits not only the university students and faculty,
              but also the Mathematics and Science Center and local area high schools.     *
