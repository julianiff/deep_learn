Abstract    :
                Oakton Community College is reforming its mathematics offerings by:  (i)
              applying and assessing effective pedagogical approaches and technologies that
              meet the needs of a diverse student body; (ii) conforming to a new policy of
              the Illinois Board Higher Education to raise and align the mathematics
              standards for students in baccalaureate transfer programs; and (iii) meeting
              the expressed needs of business and industry to use a learning format that
              parallels the workplace and emphasizes technology and teamwork.    The goals of
              the project are to (a) increase students' ability to use software tools to
              solve realistic problems in a team environment; (b) employ cooperative learning
              techniques; and (c) increase student enrollment and retention in mathematics
              classes.  The design includes a variety of teaching and learning techniques
              including cooperative and experiential learning and visualization techniques
              within a technologically integrated laboratory/classroom that simulates the
              academic research or industrial workplace setting.  Undergraduate students team
              together to work on realistic problems using the Internet, interactive
              multimedia applications, and Derive to extend their problem-solving
              capabilities.  Cooperative learning activities are being supported by a
              laboratory/classroom equipped with notebook computers and TI-92 graphics
              calculators.    The project's significance exists in the faculty's efforts to
              develop the use of new pedagogies in mathematics.  These approaches are being
              shared through traditional and electronic media.  The project also provides an
              opportunity for undergraduate students to have a rigorous and exciting
              encounter with mathematics as well as achieve mastery in the use of
              mathematical applications and technology to solve real-world problems.  *
