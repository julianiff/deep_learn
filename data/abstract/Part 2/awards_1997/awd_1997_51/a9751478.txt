Abstract    :
              To promote manufacturing education and prepare engineering students to face the
              challenges of manufacturing in the future, this project provides a flexible
              assembly line and a rapid modeling machine for use in an innovative new
              manufacturing practicum.  The 3-credit-hour manufacturing practicum, available
              to all engineering students, provides practical instruction in manufacturing
              process engineering, hands-on experience with basic production equipment in a
              supervised laboratory, and visits to manufacturing firms to see the current
              state of the art.      The manufacturing practicum demonstrates through case
              study and hands-on experience the importance of efficiency in a production
              system one that provides cost-effective, high-quality products that are
              produced with a minimal cycle time in a flexible manufacturing environment. 
              The manufacturing practicum can be taught using the multimedia lecture room and
              the manufacturing laboratory and employs tours of manufacturing plants within
              central North Carolina.  *
