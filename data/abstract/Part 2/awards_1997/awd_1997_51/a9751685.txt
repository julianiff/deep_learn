Abstract    :
              During the past 5 years, a tremendous growth of the wireless communications
              technology has been fueled by a widespread use of cellular phone and GPS
              (global positioning system).  Wireless communications is a highly
              interdisciplinary area that requires a coverage of subjects from
              communications, electromagnetics, and digital and analog electronics.  It has
              become apparent that the traditional electromagnetics and communication courses
              are not adequate to teach the wireless technology within one-quarter period,
              and a new course has been developed.    The purpose of the proposed Wireless
              Lab is to introduce measurement techniques, simulations, and hardware design in
              the new wireless communications course.  This is implemented by creating new
              laboratory projects and improving those offered in the experimental course
              EE400.  In the new wireless communications course, a teaching method is
              employed that emphasizes the combination of theory, simulations, and hands-on
              experiments.  *
