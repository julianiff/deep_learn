Abstract    :
              Any undergraduate program in chemistry that prepares students for graduate work,
              teaching, or industrial employment needs to provide significant and substantial
              exposure to the theory and practice of modern nuclear-magnetic resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy.  This technique is unrivaled as an instrumental method for the
              determination of molecular structure and is finding increasing applications in
              other areas of chemistry including analytical and physical chemistry.  It is
              also an essential component of any instruction in the area of biochemistry.   
              In the chemistry program, exposure of students to modern NMR has been severely
              limited by the previously available instrumentation.  Only old, unreliable,
              continuous wave, 60-MHz instruments have been available for most of the
              curriculum.  This project provides a high-field, superconducting NMR that
              allows routine use of H, 13C, 19F, 31P, and correlation spectroscopy throughout
              the curriculum.    Initial and comprehensive exposure starts in the sophomore
              organic laboratory sequence and is followed by uses in analytical, physical,
              and inorganic laboratory sequences.  A new biochemistry curriculum can also be
              greatly enhanced by acquisition of this instrument.  The extensive
              undergraduate research program also benefits greatly from this acquisition.  *
