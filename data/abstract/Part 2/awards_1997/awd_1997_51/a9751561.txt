Abstract    :
              The profound advances in computer technology during the past decade have
              propelled the need to educate every undergraduate student with the latest
              enhancements in technology to the forefront of educational objectives.  To
              address this need, this project enhances the digital laboratory facilities of
              the Engineering Technology (ET) program.  The objective is to enrich the
              quality of undergraduate digital laboratory instruction by providing an
              environment to conduct learning about, and use of, Programmable Logic Devices
              (PLDs), a key advance in digital electronics.    Eight personal computers, a
              laser printer, networking equipment, eight copies of ALTERA design software
              (PLD), and one programming unit are provided through this project.  This
              digital laboratory equipment is networked to the building's existing 10-BaseT
              Ethernet network, allowing each computer to communicate with the laser printer.
                 This project can have a great impact on ET education.  It enhances student
              learning through laboratory use.  Its impact on K 12 education can be even
              deeper.  This is realized through workshops directed to students and teachers
              in the Detroit Public School (DPS) system.    *
