Abstract    :
              Remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) have become important
              tools in research and environmental analysis and management.  These techniques
              allow for effective hypothesis testing in environmental research.  Access to
              equipment and training at the undergraduate level are vital to the preparation
              of science students for graduate school and future employment.  This is
              especially critical for minority students who are underrepresented in these
              disciplines.  In response to this situation, the Dominguez Hills Information
              Technology (DoIT) Laboratory is being developed through this project.  The
              laboratory focuses on the integration of remote-sensing and GIS technologies. 
              The missions of the laboratory are (l) making available technical training in
              the earth and environmental sciences to student groups that traditionally have
              not had access to such programs and to future elementary and secondary school
              teachers, (2) providing access to remote-sensing facilities and instruction for
              students of the four other state university campuses in the southern California
              area which cannot be supported by their home departments, including extension
              programs; (3) providing area community colleges an avenue for their science
              technology students to seamlessly progress into a 4-year academic institution,
              and (4) providing access to communications, data and programs now available on
              the internet through the recently installed Internet backbone.  *
