Abstract    :
              The linguistics program takes an empirical approach to the science of language. 
              Students are encouraged whenever possible to experiment and find out for
              themselves, drawing their own conclusions based on real data.  To this end, a
              linguistics laboratory, intended to serve as a place where students can do
              their own research, as well as a place for class demonstrations, has been
              developed.  The laboratory had contained a Mac-Speech-Lab run on a Macintosh II
              acquired in 1990.  While this program has been very helpful and has seen a lot
              of use, it lacks the capability to do many crucial types of linguistic
              analysis.  This project expands the research capabilities of the linguistics
              laboratory to encourage student learning and research in other components of
              the speech signal such as air pressure and flow variables, vocal fold dynamics,
              and the articulatory acoustic interface.  The new equipment supplements the old
              equipment with instruments to record and analyze many different kinds of speech
              data.  These different types of analysis are available for expanded student
              research in the existing courses, as well as serve as a basis for a new
              full-semester course in experimental phonetics, replacing the intersession
              offering of acoustic phonetics.  Some of the new equipment is also occasionally
              being used for demonstrations in foreign language classes, as well as for a
              supplementary unit on speech for students in the physics department.  *
