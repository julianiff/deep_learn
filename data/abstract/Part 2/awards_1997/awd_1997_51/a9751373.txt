Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Departments at the two schools (Carthage College and Concordia
              University) reviewed their laboratory curricula and recognized a need for more
              multiweek, project-based experiments.  Such experiments better mirror real
              world chemistry, foster critical thinking skills, and demonstrate how different
              instrumental techniques and different areas of chemistry can be integrated to
              solve a complex problem.  The acquisition of a Bruker Avance 200-MHz FT-NMR
              spectrometer with a quatro-nuclear (IH, 13C, l9F, 31p) probe and variable
              temperature capabilities allows these goals to be achieved.  With this
              instrument, laboratory projects using high-field NMR can be incorporated into
              eight upper-level courses.  In addition, the spectrometer strengthens and
              diversifies projects available to students interested in undergraduate
              research.  Semiannual poster sessions and meetings with colleagues at several
              other liberal arts colleges in the area can be organized to evaluate
              educational objectives and share results with other institutions.   *
