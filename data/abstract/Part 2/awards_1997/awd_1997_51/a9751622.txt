Abstract    :
              Current work with Ostrinia nubilalis, in the introductory biology laboratory
              courses, has resulted in successful learning experiences for students.  This
              course enrolls large numbers of students (2,000/year) many of whom are
              elmentary education majors.  This insect has great potential for development as
              a model organism.  With its short life cycle (approximately 5 weeks) and ease
              of culture, Ostrinia nubilalis could duplicate this success in a wide range of
              laboratory settings. This project fully develops Ostrinia as a model animal
              system that can be used in investigative laboratories in beginning biology. 
              During its development, ongoing evaluation is taking place.  The work being
              done with Ostrinia may be presented at the Association for Biology Laboratory
              Education, the National Association for Research in Science Teaching, the
              National Science Teachers Association, and the National Association of Biology
              Teachers.  As part of these presentations, peer feedback can be solicited.  *
