Abstract    :
              Through the purchase of a new diode-array ultraviolet/visible (UV/VIS)
              spectrophotometer with computer interface, this project is integrating the
              concepts, practice, and specialized uses of UV/VIS spectroscopy into the 2-year
              curriculum.  In the general chemistry course, the instrument is being used as a
              tool for learning the fundamentals of quantitative analysis and identification
              and is allowing for more choices for independent laboratory projects.  Students
              at the organic chemistry level are taking advantage of the increased options
              for the instrumental analysis components of their organic laboratory projects. 
              The project is also introducing non-science-students to modern instrumentation
              by demonstrating its uses in a hands-on, problem-solving context.  At all
              levels, experiments are being devised that use the UV/VIS spectrophotometer to
              clearly illustrate instrumental methods, applications, and limitations.  *
