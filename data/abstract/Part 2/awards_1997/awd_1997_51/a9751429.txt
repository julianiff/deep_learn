Abstract    :
              In 1991, the university undertook a complete overhaul of its Computer Science
              curriculum. The overhaul was provoked by a critical self-analysis which
              concluded that contemporary curricula, including that at the university, did
              not prepare students well for either industry or graduate study.  Students were
              training to write 300-line programs, by themselves, from scratch, in a dead
              language.  Obviously, this system is the antithesis of what is needed by a
              contemporary computing professional both more rigor and more skill development
              were sorely needed.  As part of the overhaul, a new curriculum philosophy and
              overview were detailed; seven new core courses were developed, incorporating a
              closed-laboratory component in four of the courses.  With the closed laboratory
              playing such a critical role in the success of this curriculum, the laboratory
              equipment must be up-to-date and reliable.  In this project, support for two
              types of equipment purchase is provided for the closed-laboratory activities:
              new PCs for the laboratory classrooms and a new robot for software engineering
              projects.
