Abstract    :
              The Department of Physics has had a substantial involvement in astronomy
              education over the last 11 years.  Faculty and students in the Physics
              Department have begun a vigorous program of stellar photometry research
              projects that has resulted in faculty and student papers and presentations at
              professional and student meetings.    Remotely-controlled and robotic
              astronomical observatories are now a reality, and several are currently
              operating successfully.  Telescopes in these observatories are controlled via
              telephone lines by completely remote operators who are, in some cases,
              thousands of miles away from the observatory.  Robotic or automatic telescopes
              can be programmed to run completely independent of the astronomer, making
              numerous observations throughout the entire night.    A remotely controlled and
              robotic telescope is a logical extension of the previous efforts of this
              institution in astronomy education and research.  This facility is a
              multipurpose facility, performing university teaching, teacher education,
              research, and community outreach.  It is also providing an avenue for the
              university to begin a distance education program with area high schools.  *
