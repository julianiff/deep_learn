Abstract    :
              This project is upgrading the undergraduate teaching and research facilities in
              the Geography/Geology Department. This upgrade is being accomplished with a
              complete x-ray diffraction (XRD) system. The XRD system being acquired is a
              Rigaku MiniFlex+ package, including a heat exchanger, computer system, software
              to carry out searches of the ICDD files, and the licensing fee to use the ICDD
              files. This system is propelling undergraduate student education and research
              into the realm of modern instrumentation.    All of the geology and
              environmental studies (earth science option) majors are being introduced to
              x-ray theory and analysis throughout their tenure. This instrument is being
              used in introductory geology classes as well as in upper-level classes for
              majors. This instrument is being used in classes on mineralogy, sedimentology,
              and soils, as well as in senior research, which is required of majors. The
              quality of undergraduate education and research is being greatly enhanced by
              the addition of an XRD laboratory and is leading to better preparation of
              students for graduate school or careers in government and industry.  *
