Abstract    :
              This project enhances undergraduate chemical education at all levels by
              integration of a GC/MS into the curriculum.  The GC/MS provides user-friendly
              interfaces, and the presence of network connections in classrooms and
              laboratories allow for remote access.  Students in an introductory course for
              nonscience majors are being introduced to the instrument through analysis of
              familiar substances such as spices, coffee and perfumes; within this context,
              concepts relevant to chemical literacy are introduced.  This course is a
              required one for students interested in elementary education, and the approach
              of giving such students access to major instrumentation, if successful, will be
              adapted to a variety of educational programs concerned with teacher education. 
              In the courses for majors, the instrument provides increased capabilities for
              analysis of organics in air, water and soil samples in environmental chemistry,
              and is an important addition to the laboratory program in organic chemistry and
              instrumental analysis.  The instrument also is providing an important tool for
              pursuing the departmental goal of increasing undergraduate research.   *
