Abstract    :
              Software quality is becoming an increasingly important issue to organizations
              that use and develop software.  Educators need to emphasize quality as a
              foundation concept in undergraduate computer science education.  This project
              outlines a novel approach, called adversarial testing, that encourages students
              to develop high quality programs and to develop test cases for that program. 
              This approach can be easily incorporated into any course that involves
              significant programming laboratory exercises.  In adversarial testing, students
              are motivated by natural competitive instincts to attempt to expose faults in
              their classmates' solutions while at the same time defending against
              fault-revealing test cases produced by their classmates.  This technique leads
              students to a deeper understanding of the sources of faults in software and of
              different techniques for building reliable, robust software.    This project
              uses a World Wide Web-based testing server that manages the program and test
              data associated with courses and students, performs the tests, and accumulates
              and reports the results of testing.      Adversarial testing is introduced into
              five required and two elective courses in the computer science curriculum.  In
              the context of these courses, both the short-term and long-term effects of
              having students solve programming laboratory exercises with adversarial testing
              is studied empirically.     *
