Abstract    :
              High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is one of the most effective tools
              available in the modern chemistry laboratory for separating complex mixtures. 
              The objective of this project is to educate chemistry majors, and selected
              non-science-majors and honors students, in the theory and use of this powerful
              separation technique.  Introductory courses are stressing qualitative
              separations of simple mixtures using HPLC, while the more advanced courses are
              investigating chromatographic theory, instrument optimization, and quantitative
              complex separations.  Incorporation of HPLC into the chemistry program is
              providing students with the ability to recognize how and when to fully exploit
              chromatographic separations in solving chemical problems.
