Abstract    :
              This project is introducing students to the applications of Gas Chromatography
              Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) in the separation and identification of components in
              a mixture.  Exposure to the technique depends on a student's major.  General
              chemistry students enrolled in the course for non-science-majors are performing
              at least one introductory experiment based on guided, hands-on experience. 
              Both chemistry majors and science majors with organic and analytical chemistry
              requirements are being exposed to the technique throughout their academic
              careers with a series a experiments designed to increase their level of
              proficiency.  *
