Abstract    :
              This project provides undergraduate students with hands-on experiences in
              inspection techniques in this institution's semiconductor manufacturing
              training program.  The Microelectronics Technology certificate and degree
              programs are designed to prepare students for entry-level positions in the
              semiconductor manufacturing and production industry.  The testing and
              validation equipment supported by this grant include:  optical inspection
              stations (used visually demonstrate the impacts of particle contamination and
              to inspect mask openings, wafers, completed circuits, etc.), scanning electron
              micorscopes (used to observe film quality and othe photolithography
              properties), profilometers (used to measure oxide layer properties), film
              thickness gauges, and other equipment to provide students with state-of-the-art
              experiences relating to semiconductor manufacturing.
