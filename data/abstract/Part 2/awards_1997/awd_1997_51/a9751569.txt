Abstract    :
              "Integrating Virtual Reality in a Computer-Based Laboratory" is carrying out a
              plan to provide community college science students at Quinebaug Valley
              Community-Technical College with state of the art tools for analyzing
              scientific data.  Three existing technologies are being implemented in a single
              facility:  1) a traditional computer-based multi-purpose science laboratory, 2)
              tools for analyzing real-world data from the internet, and 3) virtual reality
              technology for viewing data from multiple perspectives.  This integrated lab
              utilizes computerized student experiment stations with multiple sensing
              devices, an especially robust UNIX workstation, and a variety of data analysis
              software tools.  The lab enhances students' understanding of science in several
              ways.  a) Students are able to perform more thorough analysis of their own
              experiment.  b)  Through virtual reality, students are able to view "virtual
              experiments" from multiple perspectives.  4)  Students are able to utilize huge
              amounts of real-world data which are readily available on the internet, thus
              gaining a better sense of what science is all about.  No one aspect of this
              project is particularly novel.  The innovation comes in putting together
              existing tools in a laboratory which can serve as a model for undergraduate
              science.
