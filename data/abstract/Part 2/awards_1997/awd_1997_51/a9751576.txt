Abstract    :
                   The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of
              Michigan-Dearborn seeks funding for equipping a student-tutor and technology-
              based Mathematics Learning Center (MLC).  The equipment requested includes
              computer hardware and related software and audio-visual workstations.  Creation
              of this new facility is proposed for the purpose of improving access to the
              mathematics program for students at three levels (I) the freshman remedial
              level (II) the freshman-sophomore calculus sequence level (III) the
              junior-senior concentrators' program level, with emphasis on nonconcentrators. 
              Existing data show wide discrepancies, in courses at these three levels having
              a specified prerequisite course, between students who completed the
              prerequisite course at UM-D and those who did not.  The MLC will facilitate
              access to the mathematics program for large numbers of students who currently
              experience difficulty in joining a structured sequence of mathematics courses
              at a stage other than the beginning.         This proposal has the endorsement
              of the Department Executive Committee.  More than half the full-time faculty in
              the Department have contributed actively to its formulation.  The MLC Committee
              chair, the principal investigator in this proposal, is the department chair. 
              It also has the enthusiastic support of central administration, demonstrated
              through a number of grants, including a recent $12,000 salary grant for a
              program development pilot project, currently under way   *
