Abstract    :
              This project focuses on equipment being used to set up advanced undergraduate
              laser experiments to be integrated into a preexisting senior physics laboratory
              and research program.  The project addresses the need of the department to
              provide senior-level students with a solid background in lasers in a hands-on
              laboratory setting.  A two track sequence of coordinated experiments, of
              increasing degrees of difficulty, is being created to familiarize senior-level
              students in physics with advanced laser technology and applications.  Well
              tested laser experiments are being integrated into an innovative sequence that
              enhances student learning.  These experiments are providing an in-depth
              experience with lasers, and giving advanced students the confidence and
              knowledge to develop research projects using lasers.  The first track of
              experiments examines the properties of infrared laser diodes and uses them to
              perform two advanced spectroscopy experiments.  The second track of experiments
              concentrates on the properties and applications of tunable-dye lasers and
              includes six different experiments of increasing degrees of sophistication.  *
