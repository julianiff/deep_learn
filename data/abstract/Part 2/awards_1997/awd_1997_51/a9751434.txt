Abstract    :
              The curriculum in psychology has traditionally enjoyed a heavy emphasis on
              faculty student interaction.  However, the laboratories have not kept pace with
              the state of the field.  This project is broadening the emphasis on interactive
              learning while enabling students to explore issues which are topical and
              current.  Through the introduction of an eye-movement laboratory, the
              laboratory components in cognitive, sensation and perception, social
              psychology, industrial psychology, health psychology, and human factors are all
              being dramatically enhanced while the year-long introductory course is being
              greatly improved.  This equipment is having an exciting effect on student
              faculty collaborative research, as well as the Senior Research Thesis
              requirement, by opening up concepts and techniques that were previously
              inaccessible.  *
