Abstract    :
              This project is purchasing a computer-controlled ion chromatograph and
              autosampler for the analysis of common inorganic anions, organic acids, and
              cations; an aluminum oxide ring mill vessel for rapidly crushing small,
              fine-grained rock and soil samples; and a powder diffraction database, CD-ROM
              computer, and x-ray diffraction (XRD) control and database search software to
              enhance the current XRD instrument. The new equipment is enhancing sample
              preparation and chemical analyses of natural water, rocks, soils, and other
              environmental samples. This enhancement is driven by ongoing efforts, in the
              Department of Geology, Civil Engineering, Chemistry, and Biology, to replace
              abstract laboratory exercises with those that cover similar concepts but
              involve hands-on sample collection, preparation, and analysis. The object, in
              addition to teaching the skills and concepts, is to give introductory and
              advanced students a better understanding of the nature of science and the
              purpose of analytical research and measurement.   *
