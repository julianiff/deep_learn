Abstract    :
              With a goal of producing innovative mathematics teachers, this project is
              exposing pre-service teachers to a variety of pedagogical methods in a
              technology rich environment. Visualization, experimentation, and real
              applications are being used to foster the understanding of mathematics. To
              achieve this goal, the department has begun several initiatives, including the
              integration of graphing calculators and computer software into the courses.
              Twenty-five PowerMacs, software packages, and a laser printer are being
              purchased to equip one classroom and an adjoining laboratory. This project is
              being piloted through four courses: calculus III, mathematical modeling, linear
              algebra, and geometry. The first three courses are taken by all majors in K-12
              teaching options, and geometry is taken by all future secondary mathematics
              teachers.
