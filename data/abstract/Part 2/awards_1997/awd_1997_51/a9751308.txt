Abstract    :
              This project is providing better spatial analysis tools for students at various
              levels in the cartography/geographic information system (GIS) curriculum. 
              Primary objectives of the project include (1) improving the integration of
              activities and concepts in the sequence of courses; (2) providing more
              opportunities for linkages to local and state organizations; (3) incorporating
              additional field experiences, particularly the use of global positioning
              systems (GPS); and (4) developing an advanced-level GIS course that builds in
              more sophisticated spatial analyses and provides a capstone experience for
              senior students.  *
