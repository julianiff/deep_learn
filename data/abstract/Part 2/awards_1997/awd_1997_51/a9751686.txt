Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to introduce a laser photolysis experiment in
              the undergraduate physical chemistry laboratory.  The students in the
              laboratory course represent a significant number of underrepresented groups who
              are being strongly encouraged to pursue careers in science and technology.  The
              new laboratory is a simplified version of the current experimental methods in
              kinetic measurements.  At the same time, it conserves all the main features of
              modern chemical kinetics.  The main teaching objectives of the new laboratory
              are (1) to make students familiar with one of the modern approaches of studying
              fast chemical reactions laser photolysis combined with a transient
              spectroscopy; (2) to familiarize students with the concept of isolation of an
              elementary reaction and the pseudo-first-order conditions; and (3) to
              demonstrate the kinetics and mechanism of ozone formation and hydrocarbon
              oxidation in the atmosphere.  The new experiment is assigned to students in the
              four sections (18/section) of physical chemistry laboratory each academic year.
               Several faculty are evaluating the effectiveness of this experiment for
              undergraduates and working to modify the experiment when necessary to fit
              logically into the existing program.  In addition, the laboratory is being used
              in research on kinetics of oxidation of halogen substituted radicals conducted
              by undergraduate students during summer and regular semesters.
