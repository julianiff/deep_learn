Abstract    :
              This project is equipping a basic paleomagnetics laboratory within the
              Department of Geology. The new laboratory is addressing the increasing needs of
              undergraduate students for exposure to analytical methods, scientific
              experimentation, and the interpretation of quantitative data. Inclusive of the
              paleomagnetic equipment into the first-year course, Processes and Concepts of
              Geology, is introducing a general student audience to laboratory procedure and
              data analysis. This laboratory is stressing the contribution of paleomagnetic
              results to the development of plate tectonic theory and enabling students to
              see the relationship between experimentation, hypothesis formation, and
              testing. Paleomagnetic laboratory modules are also being designed for the
              structural geology course and for two new courses in geophysics and
              geoarcheology. Together, these courses are affecting a wide selection of both
              majors and non-science-majors. The new laboratory is also being used to support
              student research as part of their independent study research, which is a
              requirement for all student. Students and faculty at neighboring institutions
              are being invited to use the paleomagnetics laboratory.  *
