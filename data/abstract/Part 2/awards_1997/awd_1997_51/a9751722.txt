Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to enhance the electromagnetics and communications
              (EMC) curriculum.  This goal is accomplished by incorporating electromagnetic
              compatibility concepts and measurement principles more fully into the
              undergraduate curriculum; providing students with real-world practical
              experience in using state-of-the-art equipment; and providing students with the
              opportunity to carry out both individual and group projects that include
              design, implementation, simulation, and EMC testing.    The project improves
              three existing courses (Introduction to Engineering Electromagnetics,
              Electromagnetic Waves, and Communication Systems) by incorporating EMC-related
              experiments.  It also develops a new advanced Electromagnetic Compatibility
              course.  In the laboratory portion of the course, students conduct the
              following experiments and measurements: signal spectra; time- and
              frequency-domain measurements; surface and common-mode currents; radiated and
              conducted emissions; and immunity testing.  An integral part of the course is a
              design project.  Students have the opportunity to design, simulate, test for
              EMC compliance, and redesign their devices, if necessary.    To offer hands-on
              experience to the 80 to 90 students per year who enroll in these courses, the
              project requests a G-TEM cell, a spectrum analyzer, a signal generator, a power
              amplifier, a line impedance stabilization network, and an EM modeling software
              package.  Results of this project can be disseminated through the publication
              of a laboratory manual, presentation at EMC symposiums, and technical papers in
              IEEE Transaction in Education and Transactions of American Society of
              Engineering Education.   *
