Abstract    :
              The department is purchasing a laser system to upgrade the undergraduate
              instructional research and laboratories.  The new changes are affecting two
              distinct courses in the curriculum.  One is the laboratory component of a
              course in physical optics.  It is offering new laboratories where the students
              are assembling, studying, and using pulsed-dye lasers in several optics
              experiments.  Pulsed-dye lasers are good for pedagogical purposes because they
              are simple to assemble and use, and because they can be set to emit tunable
              visible radiation in a wide variety of wavelength ranges.  The other course is
              an upper-level laboratory, Advanced Topics and Experiments, which consists of
              independent research-oriented projects.  The new acquisition is improving the
              projects in the area of atomic physics, involving experiments with Rydberg
              atoms, that are resulting in the acquisition of original data.  The aim of
              these projects is for students to do semester-long independent research as part
              of the curriculum.  *
