Abstract    :
               As analytical instrumentation becomes more sophisticated yet more routine,
              college raduates from a variety of disciplines need to become familiar with
              available methods of chemical analysis in their respective fields. This not
              only includes chemistry graduates, but also those in other fields such as
              agriculture, forensics, etc. This work proposes the acquisition of a basic gas
              chomatograph/mass spectrometer system to be used across these discipline
              boundaries. Though the major use of the equipment is in the chemistry
              curriculum, there are also substantial components proposed in the agricultural
              science and criminal justice areas. ln addition to the standard uses of this
              instrumentation in the chemical curriculum, it will be used in agriculture
              courses in topic areas such as pesticide analysis and tracking of 15N for
              nitrogen balance concerns. In the area oi criminal justice, the instrument will
              be used in a criminalistics course concerned with drug analysis, identification
              of arson accelerants, and a variety of other topics. Though students are
              required to cross disciplines in their educational process, there is no similar
              requirement for the instructors of those courses. The addition of this
              instrumentation and its interdisciplinary use will help open the communication
              channels between these particular disciplines on campus and will likely lead to
              enhanced cooperation and a strengthening of undergraduate education.  *
