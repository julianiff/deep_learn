Abstract    :
              This project provides a new high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) system
              that is crucial to the chemistry and environmental chemistry teaching
              laboratories and replaces a 12-year old HPLC used for all chemistry teaching
              and research laboratories.  The new instrument can be used at all curricular
              levels from introductory chemistry laboratory to senior research projects.  The
              HPLC system is the centerpiece of the separations instrumental analysis course
              and plays an important role in the environmental chemistry program.  It is one
              of the principal tools used to teach trace analytical methods for water and
              soils, as well as the analysis of foods, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals and the
              semipreparative scale separations of proteins and organic reaction products. 
              The acquisition of this essential analytical technique allows the university to
              provide undergraduates with the training, background, and experience in modern
              instrumentation that is expected by employers and graduate schools.  *
