Abstract    :
              This project is a response to recent national mandates for improvements in
              undergraduate science education with innovations in teaching and laboratory
              experiences for students.  The goals of this project are to integrate modern
              instrumental and computer methods throughout the chemistry curriculum in order
              to receive ACS accreditation for our program.  An older EM360 NMR is being
              upgraded to a Fourier transform (FT) instrument with C-13 capabilities. 
              Experience with this instrument is better preparing students to enter the
              workplace or to go on to graduate school.  Students are using the instrument in
              organic laboratory as a routine method of structure determination as well as an
              analytical tool to help them solve assigned chemical puzzles.  In advanced
              laboratories they are investigating chemical kinetics and doing more complex
              analyses using methods such as 2-dimensional NMR.  Finally they are using the
              FT-NMR as a tool in their research.  Thus, the instrument should provide 
              motivation for students and  better prepare them for careers in chemistry or
              related fields.   *
