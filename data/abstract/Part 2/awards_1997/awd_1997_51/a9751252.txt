Abstract    :
              This project involves the development of an integrated laboratory facility to
              enhance the instruction of students in the areas of analysis, design, and
              management of telecommunication systems and computer networks.    The facility
              consists of three interconnected laboratories: Telecommunication Systems
              Laboratory; Digital Signal Processing Laboratory (Video, Speech, Image, and
              Data Compression); and Broadband Laboratory (ATM, SMDS, Frame Relay, and ISDN).
                 The facility enhances student instruction in two critical ways:  (1) By
              incorporating computer-aided design and engineering (CAD/CAE) in all affected
              courses and (2) by providing hands-on experience in real networks,
              technologies, and instrumentation through the Telecommunications Education
              Research Network.  *
