Abstract    :
              Nonmajor biology students need exposure to sophisticated laboratory
              instrumentation.  Within the context of environmental science courses, the
              university faculty seeks to utilize gas chromatography to expand the exposure
              of students to the relationship between field sampling and laboratory analysis.
               An instrument with accompanying computer interface and software are used for
              student training.  The instrument is used routinely in nonmajor environmental
              science courses, major environmental science courses, and limnology.  The
              instrument can be used for independent undergraduate research projects.  The
              gas chromatographer is heavily utilized for student laboratory projects that
              explore the presence of toxic components in local surface waters.  The gas
              chromatographer allows students to explore gas chromatography as one of the
              most commonly used techniques for environmental chemical analysis.  *
