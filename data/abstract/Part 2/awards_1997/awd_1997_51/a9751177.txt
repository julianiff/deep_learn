Abstract    :
              This project establishes a computer classroom/laboratory dedicated exclusively
              to mathematics courses.  This laboratory contains 24 workstations for students
              and one workstation connected to a data-video projection system.  Two more
              workstations are located in the Mathematical Sciences Department and can be
              used by the faculty for course development and preparation.  This project
              affects 350 students in five courses:  Multivariate Calculus, Linear Algebra,
              Differential Equations, Numerical Methods, and Operations Research.  Students
              use the classroom/laboratory to actively engage in problemsolving, data
              analysis, and application exploration.  The faculty use the
              classroom/laboratory to stimulate the students with innovative techniques
              involving computer technology.  The classroom/laboratory empowers the students
              to become involved in class projects and individual research.  This project
              helps the department to attain its goals of incorporating computing technology
              into the undergraduate mathematics curriculum.  *
