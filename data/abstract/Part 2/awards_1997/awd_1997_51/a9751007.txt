Abstract    :
              This project supports the creation of a center for the study of relativity.  The
              center is housing the equipment for students to study the effects of relativity
              through three activities.  The first activity involves the measurement of the
              speed and lifetime of cosmic ray moons.  These measurements confirm that the
              speed of light is the maximum speed, and that the moon lifetime is dilated
              during flight.  The second activity verifies the relativistic relationship
              between energy, momentum, and velocity by measuring the energy of betas from a
              radioactive source after they have passed through momentum and velocity
              selectors.  The third activity investigates relativistic effects with computer
              calculations that model phenomena such as scattering.  Advanced students are
              conducting research projects in the center using the new computer.  The
              laboratory is also serving as a center for recruitment.  The walls have
              posters, photographs, and explanations of the equipment and calculations. 
              Results of research by students are also being prominently displayed.  This
              tactic allows potential majors to feel the excitement of scientific research
              experienced by their peers. This center is, therefore, serving an important
              recruitment tool, as well as a state-of-the art laboratory and research
              station.
