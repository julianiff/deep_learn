Abstract    :
              This project is improving the learning, retention, understanding, application
              and appreciation of physics concepts and principles by students enrolled in all
              introductory physics courses.  It is also providing a model of recent
              technology and curriculum materials for 2-year colleges.  This goal is being
              accomplished by acquiring faster and more powerful computer technology that can
              update, expand, extend, and broaden the current use of microcomputer and
              digital video technology in physics.  This technology provides quick graphical
              feedback that makes possible a larger number and variety of experiences, which
              can motivate and challenge students.    Software and hardware is being acquired
              for a new laboratory of networked microcomputer workstations equipped with high
              speed digital video capture and laboratory interfaces with appropriate sensors
              and probes.  The workstations also include shared laser printers and a local
              physics network server.    This project is encouraging students to support
              science by improving their experiences in physics, as well as increasing
              science literacy.  It is helping to prepare students in physics courses for the
              next century and to stimulate other community colleges to consider adapting
              these approaches.  *
