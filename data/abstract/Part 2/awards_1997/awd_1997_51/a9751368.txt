Abstract    :
              Through this project, the Electrical Engineering (EE) Department establishes an
              undergraduate fiber-optics communications and photonics laboratory.  This new
              facility is unique in the region.  The communications area of the EE curriculum
              is enhanced by this project.  A total of 11 experiments are taught in a new
              one-credit laboratory course, EE 472, concurrent with the Fiber Optic
              Communications course, EE 471.  The laboratory is also used for extra
              individual projects assigned under Special Topics, EE 493, or under Senior
              Design Projects, EE 464/465.    The objectives of this laboratory are to (1)
              optimize students' learning by using a practical framework with hands-on,
              integrated, and inquiry experiences to reinforce classroom theoretical concepts
              of basic photonics and optical fibers; (2) provide students with practical
              skills needed for handling and testing fiber optic systems; and (3) stimulate
              students' curiosity and eagerness to pursue research and independent study in
              the area of fiber-optic communications, photonics, and sensing.   
              Interdepartmental ties also enable the facility to be used by Engineering
              Physics and Electronics Engineering Technology students.  This facility also
              provides a resource that may have long-term and far-reaching effects through
              outreach programs and workshops targeting precollege students, school teachers,
              and the engineering community in the vicinity.   A laboratory manual, including
              a revised set of experiments and necessary equipment, can be published and made
              available to interested faculty in other institutions.  A comprehensive
              assessment for the project will be administered by a panel consisting of the
              Office of Academic Evaluation and Assessment at the university, an external
              evaluator, and the faculty participating in the project.  *
