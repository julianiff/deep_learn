Abstract    :
              This project is expanding the learning experience for students in the
              undergraduate laboratories for chemical engineering and environmental
              engineering. More than 100 students a year are benefiting from this
              improvement. Students are designing and conducting more realistic engineering
              experiments on more complex systems. These experiments are similar to
              situations encountered in industrial, government, and commercial work
              environments. This project is also expanding the opportunities for students to
              have interactive Internet access in the laboratory stations. Two methods are
              being employed. The first method is to expand the number of experimental
              stations that have computerized data acquisition and control equipment in these
              laboratories. Thiq goal is being accomplished with six new personal computers
              and associated hardware and software for measurement, data acquisition and
              control, analysis, reporting, and presentation of results. The second method is
              to expand Internet access to the laboratories with the development of software
              and networking for the monitoring and control of equipment. These improvements
              are adding systems for students to experience hands-on experiments with
              engineering equipment. They are also adding systems and capability for remote
              interaction with the laboratory equipment. This measure is allowing for
              cooperative laboratory experimentation among other schools.  *
