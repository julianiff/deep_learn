Abstract    :
              This project significantly improves the teaching of modern chemistry by
              incorporating advanced Fourier-transforrm nuclear magnetic resonance (FT-NMR)
              instrumentation, theory, and techniques throughout the department curriculum. 
              The speed of FT-NMR can be used as a tool by general chemistry students to
              analyze kinetic data.  Organic students are exposed to the instrument's ability
              to obtain carbon-13 spectra as an aid in the identification of organic
              structures.  Analytical students learn multidimensional FT theory and
              techniques and gain practical knowledge of the operation of FT-NMR
              spectrometers.  Physical chemistry students use FT-NMR technology to
              investigate first hand the phenomena involved in spin-lattice relaxation and
              other electric and magnetic properties of atoms and molecules.  Inorganic
              students can better analyze mrganometallic synthesis products using carbon-13
              and COSY techniques.  In addition, the students can remotely process and
              manipulate their FT-NMR data, freeing up the instrument for use by other
              classes.  The addition of this equipment and its associated teaching techniques
              to the department better prepares students by creating an environment where
              chemical principles, theory, and analysis are learned through first-hand
              experience.  *
