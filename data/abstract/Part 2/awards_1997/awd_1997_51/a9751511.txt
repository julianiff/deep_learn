Abstract    :
              This project integrates molecular biology into all levels of the biology
              curriculum.  Molecular biology is not a field by itself; instead, it is a means
              by which almost all aspects of life can be studied.  This project stresses
              inquiry-based learning and exposes students to investigative approaches to
              exploring life at the molecular level.  The number of students actively
              exploring biology at a molecular level is expected to increase fivefold (from
              80 per year to 400 per year).    Approximately 145 of the students exposed to
              molecular biology each year are nonmajors.  As a result of this project, 100
              percent of the college's biology majors can use molecular approaches to enhance
              their understanding of critical biological concepts in at least three courses
              and in as many as eight courses.  This innovation allows students to engage
              essential concepts in biology using techniques such as DNA isolation,
              restriction analysis, southern, northern, and western blotting, PCR, cell
              culture work, and subcellular fractionation.  Such exposures in several courses
              help students have a richer understanding of life and how it is studied;
              appreciate the interconnections between subdisciplines of biology; more fully
              understand the ethical and social dimensions of modern biology; and make career
              decisions in a more informed manner.  The success of the project can be
              assessed using surveys (including postgraduation surveys of alumni) and course
              evaluations.  Results can be widely disseminated through science education
              journals and forums such as Project Kaleidoscope.  *
