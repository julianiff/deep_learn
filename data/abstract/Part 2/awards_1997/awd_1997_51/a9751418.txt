Abstract    :
              The Biology Department is revising its introductory biology laboratory course.
              This large course enrolls 300 students per year, approximately 10% of whom are
              biology education majors.  This project will allow us to incorporate more data
              analysis and discussion of concepts into the laboratory portion of this course.
               The biology faculty believe that using computers to help with the graphing of
              results is giving more time to present additional data sets to compare with
              those generated in the laboratory.  They are using computer programs with
              integrated wordprocessing and spreadsheet capabilities that enable the students
              to prepare laboratory reports with a more extensive analysis of the data and
              concepts.  Computers, printers, and software are being purchased for the
              revision of biology laboratories.  *
