Abstract    :
              Past research has indicated that the most comprehensive simulation is motion
              picture with sound.  Nondigital video, however, does not allow the viewer any
              selectivity.  Digital video gives the user the greatest freedom to select what
              he or she wishes to see, in both a linear and nonlinear approach.  This project
              provides the computer-based technology tools to introduce and integrate digital
              media into undergraduate architectural education.  With new technologies, the
              project raises the level of instruction from traditional media to electronic
              media to explore new areas in architectural education to provide a more
              comprehensive, enriched learning environment for students.  *
