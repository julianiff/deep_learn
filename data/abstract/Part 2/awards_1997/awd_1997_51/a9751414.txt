Abstract    :
              With the rapid development of wireless networking technology and the wide use of
              portable computers, a new paradigm of computing called mobile computing has
              been predicted to be the dominant form of computing in the near future.  In the
              mobile computing environment, a large number of mobile computers, independent
              of their physical locations, have access to shared services and resources,
              which are situated in the land-based network and the mobile computing units. 
              This new environment extends the range of applications to a new dimension. 
              This avenue is also rich in research and development.  But the requirements to
              mobile computing, ranging from cellular and infrared communication links to
              energy-efficient data access for terminals running on self-contained power
              supplies, make it impractical to use old facilities for teaching and project
              development in the area.    With this project, a new mobile laboratory builds
              on old facilities.  The purpose of this laboratory is fivefold: (1) to be an
              essential part of a newly structured course in mobile computing and information
              systems; (2) to be an equipment infrastructure for the students to develop
              software necessary for teaching the fundamentals of mobile computing and
              information systems; (3) to be a center for training students in the use and
              development of state-of-the-art technologies; (4) to provide an environment for
              undergraduate students to undertake independent projects in mobile topics; and
              (5) to provide an environment for faculty and undergraduate students to
              experience fundamental and applied research in mobile computing and
              interdisciplinary areas.  The laboratory represents a crucial step in the
              initiation of a nationally recognized teaching and undergraduate research
              program in mobile computing and nomadic applications, by providing the much
              needed facilities for the development of a course and projects designed for
              juniors and seniors.    *
