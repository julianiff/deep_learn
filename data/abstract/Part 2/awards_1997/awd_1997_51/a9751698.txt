Abstract    :
              This project is modernizing the institution's instructional capability in the
              area of instrumentation and measurement by introducing both computer controlled
              and virtual instruments into the curriculum. In order to effectively use the
              power of computer controlled and virtual instruments, the student should be
              well grounded in the fundamentals of electronic instrumentation and basic
              computer tools.  The use of computer controlled and virtual instruments is
              being introduced gradually as select experiments in sophomore- and junior-level
              courses.  New courses are being developed at the advanced junior- and senior-
              level, specifically oriented toward the use of computer controlled and virtual
              instruments.  It is important that students become familiar with these powerful
              concepts by first using these systems in essentially turn-key operations, in
              introductory course experiments, and progress to planning experiments and
              writing control software as they gain experience and confidence. Students are
              developing the experience to make rational judgments as to whether to use
              traditional instruments, computer controlled instruments, or virtual
              instruments in a particular industrial application.  This skill is invaluable
              to future employers of graduates and to the graduates themselves during their
              careers.  *
