Abstract    :
                             Southeast Community College (SCC) in Lincoln, Nebraska, in
              partnership with the University of Nebraska, the DuPont Company, 36 community
              colleges across the country, 7 industry representatives, and an advisory board,
              is continuing to spearhead efforts to reform the curriculum and materials for
              community college chemical technology educational programs in the United
              States.  This project, entitled "Assignment: Chemical Technology II", or
              ACT-II, is continuing the work of the current NSF-supported project (DUE
              9553674) awarded to SCC in 1995 ("Assignment: Chemical Technology - I, or
              ACT-I), in which the curriculum and student materials for the first-year
              chemistry course in these technology programs is targeted.  The ACT-II project
              targets four major areas: 1) the laboratory program for the first-year
              chemistry course, 2) the analytical chemistry and organic/biochemistry courses,
              including laboratories, found in the second year of these programs, 3)
              multimedia materials to include world wide web supplements and CD-ROM
              materials, to complete the work already begun for the first-year course and to
              also address the second-year courses, 4) a distance learning component to
              assist in the training of incumbent chemistry technician in these topics.  The
              curriculum and materials developed is being guided in part by the Voluntary
              Industry Skill Standards for the chemical process and bioscience industries,
              Good Laboratory and Management Practices (GLP and GMP), and safety and
              occupational health issues.
