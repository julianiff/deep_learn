Abstract    :
                   The Biology Department of Elon College plans a significant improvement of
              our program to fundamentally alter the experiences of 250 students enrolled
              annually in the human and animal physiology and anatomy laboratories addressed
              in this proposal.  We want to enhance testing of hypotheses and data collection
              and analysis.  This pedagogical approach can be the most dramatic and
              productive through the application of computer technologies.  Through a cogent
              program the Department wants to introduce computer applications early in the
              courses.  As sophomores, biology majors in zoology will be concerned with the
              fundamentals of muscle contraction, nerve conductance and cardiac function.  In
              upper-level courses these phenomena and others will be investigated in more
              highly integrated and independent laboratory activities.  Students in sports
              medicine will be provided a more realistic study of human anatomy and
              physiology in preparation for courses in exercise physiology and kinesiology.  
                  Elon College will purchase 13 Power Macintosh 7200 computers and one Power
              Macintosh 7600 computer to equip two separate computer laboratories to support
              the instruction of human and vertebrate anatomy and physiology.  The anatomy
              group will consist of six student workstations while the physiology group will
              consist of one instructor's station/server and seven student workstations, with
              each workstation serving three students.  These stations, with appropriate
              software and CD-ROM capabilities, will have far reaching pedagogic consequences
              because of their tremendous flexibility and capacity to measure, record and
              immediately analyze physiological and morphological phenomena.
