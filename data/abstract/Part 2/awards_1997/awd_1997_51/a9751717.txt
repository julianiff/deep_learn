Abstract    :
              This project is enhancing the quality of undergraduate instruction through the
              use of a student-grade Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance (FT-NMR)
              spectrometer for the acquisition of proton and carbon-13 spectra.  The 200 MHZ
              instrument provides excellent sensitivity and resolution at a reasonable cost. 
              It is being used in laboratory courses throughout the chemistry curriculum
              including organic, inorganic, analytical, physical, and biochemical courses as
              well as in undergraduate research projects.  Students have hands-on experience
              in preparing samples, obtaining spectra, determining structure, measuring
              coupling constants and relaxation times, and using the instrument for other
              chemical analyses.  Thus students gain a thorough knowledge of the capabilities
              and limitations of NMR for solving a broad range of chemical problems.  This
              experience better prepares them as professional chemists and problem solvers,
              whether they enter the workforce immediately upon graduation or continue their
              formal education in graduate school.  *
