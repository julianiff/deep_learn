Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to integrate a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer
              system, and associated computer and peripherals and data bases, with our
              existing laboratory equipment and educational program.  Students using this
              instrument are gaining experience in data analysis and spectral data base
              searching.  The addition of the GC-MS is affecting many laboratory courses
              beginning with the introductory level and continuing with those courses which
              follow in our curriculum. Experiments are designed in a manner commensurate
              with the educational level and laboratory skills of students in the particular
              course. There is significant impact on all science students but particularly on
              those science majors (Chemistry, Biology, Molecular Biology) who continue with
              courses such as organic and analytical chemistry. Also important though
              affected to a lesser extent are our smaller but significant programs with
              non-science majors, education majors, and high school students. The involvement
              of a high school teacher with adjunct faculty status at our institution is a
              unique feature of this project. Bayer (Elkhart, IN) and Plains Environmental
              Services (Saline, KS) serve as consultants for the environmental component of
              this project.  Results of this project will be presented in journals and
              regional scientific meetings.  *
