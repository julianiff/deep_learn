Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to thoroughly integrate computer technology into the
              teaching of mathematics so that it supplements traditional pencil-and-paper
              calculations.  The technology-based curricular reform began in 1989 with
              experimental sections of calculus using Mathematics.  Today, Mathematics is
              being used in almost all of the departmental offerings, as well as in other
              courses on campus, and has become an indispensable tool for many students.  It
              has helped students to recognize mathematics as a discipline which requires
              thought, experimentation, and creativity. The department has many student
              computer laboratories, a campus-wide network, and a site license to
              Mathematics. However, many college- and student-owned computers cannot run
              Mathematics effectively because of the memory resources it demands.  Therefore,
              this project is  purchasing a network kernel server which can handle the
              computational requirements of Mathematics and leave the client machines to
              simply display the results.  This system is providing the essential next step
              in the curricular reform program by making Mathematics available to almost all
              computers on campus, enhancing its instructional impact.
