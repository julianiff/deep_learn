Abstract    :
              Through this project, the faculty in the Mathematics and Computer Science
              Department of Essex Community College are improving the quality of the
              developmental mathematics program through new teaching methodologies.  In
              particular, faculty developed software is being utilized to provide explanation
              and tutorials in an interactive learning environment.  Materials produced for
              the developmental curriculum will be available to the Essex Community College
              Web Page.  Through this project, the department will be able to offer students
              a true multi-media approach to developmental mathematics and a rich selection
              of teaching alternatives.
