Abstract    :
              Field experiences in hydrogeology and environmental science can be substantially
              strengthened with expansion of the university's capabilities to study surface
              and subsurface water.  This project provides a groundwater well, nested
              piezometers, an automatic sampler, and associated peripherals (pumps, data
              logger, etc.).  The field site where these are installed is used by
              undergraduates in geology and environmental science courses, by visiting
              secondary school students, and by undergraduates from other institutions. 
              Class exercises and student research projects include the delineation of
              three-dimensional flow patterns for local groundwater, development of
              groundwater and surface water hydrographs, study of the chemical evolution of
              subsurface water, and quantification of quickflow and baseflow contributions to
              a local stream.  Use of this field site ensures that students have a solid
              understanding of the physical and chemical behavior of subsurface water in the
              saturated and unsaturated zones and of the interaction between subsurface flow
              and surface water bodies.    *
