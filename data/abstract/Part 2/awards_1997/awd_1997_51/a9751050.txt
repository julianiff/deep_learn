Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to create a Mechatronics Laboratory that
              supports two undergraduate courses.  The courses are (1) an Introduction to
              Mechatronics, a required undergraduate course for mechanical engineers with an
              ultimate enrollment of approximately 400 students per year, and (2) Advanced
              Mechatronics, an elective course for engineers with an expected enrollment of
              80 students per year.  Although most students in both courses are  mechanical
              engineers, approximately 100 students are expected to be electrical engineers
              who have an interest in microcomputer-controlled electrical-mechanical systems.
               All laboratory experiences are scheduled for 3 hours per week per section. 
              The new requirement for mechatronics in the mechanical engineering curriculum
              is a more modern version of the previous electric power conversion and motors
              laboratory.    The new Mechatronics Laboratory is located in the School of
              Mechanical Engineering.  The equipment consists of instrumentation to make
              measurement, program embedded microcomputers, control experiments, and display
              result; microcomputer kits for building embedded control devices for smart
              machines; actuator kits to provide motion; sensor kits to make measurements in
              smart machines; and a two-example mechatronic systems, e.g.  robots.    A
              Mechatronics in Engineering Education workshop is being held to promote the
              adoption of similar mechatronics courses as part of the mechanical engineering
              curriculum.  *
