Abstract    :
              In an effort to better develop student understanding of essential hydrogeologic
              concepts, a hydrogeological field laboratory is being established.  The field
              laboratory contains three shallow monitoring wells, three soil moisture
              samplers, and three tensiometers.  A geotechnical consulting firm is installing
              the monitoring wells, and the project director is installing the remaining
              instrumentation.  A portable field permeameter and a high-precision pump is
              being purchased for use at the field laboratory.    Students enrolled in
              Hydrogeology are gathering data from the field laboratory each week as part of
              the laboratory component of the course.  Among the laboratory activities the
              students are conducting are ground water sampling, soil water sampling, pump
              tests, slug tests, determination of unsaturated zone hydraulic conductivity, in
              situ permeability measurements, and shallow seismic refraction surveys. 
              Hydrogeology laboratory exercises stress methods of collection, analysis, and
              interpretation of field data, as well as identification of sources of
              measurement error.  Other courses that are using the field laboratory are
              Elements of Engineering Geology and Environmental Geology.  Students wishing to
              undertake undergraduate research projects for credit are also conducting
              studies at the field laboratory.  *
