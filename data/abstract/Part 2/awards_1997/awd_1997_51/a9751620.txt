Abstract    :
                  This project is using Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML), a three
              dimensional extelsion to the World Wide Web, to incorporate 3D visualization
              into two courses offered by Indiana University of Pennsylvania's Mathematics
              Department.  In the departments' "Introduction to Linear Algebra" course,
              students are using VRML to explore the relationships between matrices and
              linear transformation.  While traditional introductory linear algebra courses
              emphasize applications to solving systems of linear equations, this project is
              augmenting the traditional materials by incorporating linear transformations
              throughout the course. Students are using VRML visualizations to understand
              basic linear algebra concepts and to apply linear algebra concepts to applied
              problems. In a new liberal studies course entitled "Building 3D Models for the
              Web", students from various majors are learning to use 3D coordinate systems
              and linear transformations to build 3D models related to their disciplines.
              Students collaborate in interdisciplinary teams to create major VRML projects. 
              The teams are publishing results on the Web and are making oral presentations
              to the university community.  The project is affecting large number of
              preservice secondary school mathematics teachers as approximately 75% of the
              mathematics majors plan to teach.    *
