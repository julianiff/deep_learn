Abstract    :
              Students in physics and environmental technology courses previously gained
              little understanding of basic physical concepts from lectures. Furthermore, the
              artificial separation of lecture and laboratory in these courses has prevented
              the laboratory from rectifying the conceptual shortcomings of lecture. The
              department has purchased a single computer and instrumental interfacing
              equipment and has begun to redesign the physics courses by melding lecture and
              laboratory into an activity-based instructional approach. Equipment is being
              purchased to enable the department to set up a number of computerized student
              learning stations. Specifically, it is setting up six learning stations that
              can be used to teach a two-semester, calculus-based physics course and a
              one-semester, technical physics course during the first year of the project. In
              the second year, three more stations can be added and activity-based
              instruction can be introduced into two environmental technology courses
