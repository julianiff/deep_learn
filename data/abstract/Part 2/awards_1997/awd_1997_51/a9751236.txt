Abstract    :
              The Instrumentation Project is introducing Mossbauer spectroscopy into
              upper-division modern physics and nuclear physics laboratories in the
              Department of Physics and Astronomy.  This type of experiment can be very
              useful in directly exposing students to basic concepts in quantum mechanics.  A
              series of experiments is focusing on (1) observation of quantum uncertainty;
              (2) observation of changes in the nuclear charge distribution through
              measurement of the isomer shift; (3) observation of nuclear Zeeman splitting
              and measurement of the internal hyperfine field strength from the level
              splitting; and (4) observation of quantum uncertainty through detection of
              virtual states produced by RF/gamma-ray multiphoton absorption. Entrance and
              exit examinations are being conducted in the laboratories to assess the
              educational outcomes.  Also, Mossbauer experiments are being used in
              cooperation with the Departments of Chemistry and Geology to expose students to
              the use of this spectroscopic technique in characterizing the chemical
              composition of materials.
