Abstract    :
              Miami University Middletown's ChemTEC project continues to build on the solidly
              established Partnership for the Advancement of Chemical Technology (PACT)
              Consortium and the nationally recognized Partners for Terrific Science
              industrial/academic partnership.  Through collaboration among all stakeholders,
              the ChemTEC project has six goals (which parallel the six themes in Gaining the
              Competitive Edge): 1) advancing the professional nature of chemical
              technicians, chemical technology educators, and students of chemical
              technology; 2) strengthening and expanding existing collaborations of
              stakeholders; 3) empowering chemical technology educators with content and
              pedagogical knowledge, time, resources, and professional support; 4)
              collaborating with industry to keep abreast of the latest technological
              developments to better prepare chemical technology students to compete in
              today's economic environment; 5) developing, publishing, and distributing
              content-rich, pedagogically sound curricular materials; and 6) developing
              curricular materials for the secondary school level that engage students in
              laboratory-driven challenges.      To accomplish these goals, ChemTEC project
              programming  focuses on six initiatives; Networking to Build a Community of
              Practice, Research Profile Project, Curricular Materials for Chemical and
              Related Technology Education, Professional Development Opportunities for
              Educators, Student Programming, and Dissemination and Outreach.
