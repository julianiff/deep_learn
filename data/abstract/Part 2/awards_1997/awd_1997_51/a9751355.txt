Abstract    :
              This project provides a Peltier Thermoelectrically-Cooled Silicon Detector (TCD)
              system to support a Scintag 2000 x-ray diffraction (XRD) unit.  The new
              instrumentation fills a recognized need to introduce XRD techniques in
              chemistry and to significantly increase the capabilities in geology.    Courses
              immediately introduce and result in more and better hands-on use of XRD
              experiences and more sophisticated XRD laboratory exercises include Mineralogy,
              X-ray Crystallography, Independent Study, Physical Chemistry, Instrumental
              Analysis, and Inorganic Chemistry.  Beyond this, the upgrade in instrumentation
              opens exciting new avenues for undergraduate research.    The project continues
              to introduce XRD diffractometry in the sophomore (geology majors) and junior
              (chemistry majors) years followed by progressively more advanced real
              problem-solving experiences in the senior-level courses in both geology and
              chemistry.  The impact of the instrumentation upgrade on instruction can be
              assessed by student evaluation and peer observation of assigned laboratory
              activities.
