Abstract    :
              This project enhances Elementary and Secondary Education students' understanding
              of the mathematics they will teach through the use of computer-based modeling
              and explorations.  The institution is purchasing 30 Macintosh computers for a
              mathematics computer laboratory.  The facility is used to support class
              discussions, small-group explorations, and individual efforts to make
              mathematical models of real-world phenomena.  Modeling-based activities can
              support prospective teachers' conceptions of mathematics in ways that cannot be
              accomplished without the use of high-powered technology.  The project supports
              the students' development of a deep conceptual understanding of mathematics. 
              It also fosters an appreciation for technology as a powerful tool for teaching
              and learning.  The university is in an ideal position to achieve this goal for
              several reasons.  First, it has a nationally-recognized mathematics education
              faculty who often work collaboratively.  Second, it offers four core
              mathematics courses for prospective elementary teachers, which allows faculty
              to plan for the integration of several computer-based explorations in a
              systematic way.  *
