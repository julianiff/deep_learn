Abstract    :
              This project addresses the problem of developing within young women scientists
              the confidence in using up-to-date research instrumentation that can foster
              their career goals and encourage them to seek graduate and professional
              education.    The objective is for each of the science majors to become
              competent in using the gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GC-MS),
              understanding its theoretical foundation and practical applications.  This
              project provides a major piece of equipment needed by the chemistry program. 
              This project permits an orderly incorporation of GC-MS throughout the
              undergraduate chemistry curriculum.  GC-MS experiments are presented for
              laboratory courses throughout the 4-year chemistry program.    All of the
              undergraduate students at the college are women.  A significant percentage are
              identified as members of a minority group.  An arrangement made with the
              Chemistry Department at another college involves site visits to this college
              for the instruction of their students on the GC-MS.  Additionally, the
              instrument permits continued development of microscale experiments in the areas
              of organic, inorganic, and environmental chemistry.   *
