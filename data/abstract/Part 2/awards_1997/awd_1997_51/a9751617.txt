Abstract    :
              This project develops a product realization and prototyping workcell, based on
              an inkjet-deposit prototyping desktop station and a rapid three-dimensional
              desktop digitizer, for the purpose of integrating product development training
              experience into the undergraduate mechanical engineering curriculum.    The new
              prototyping workcell enhances the previous courses in engineering design,
              manufacturing engineering, computer-aided design and manufacturing, robotics,
              and computer-integrated manufacturing.  The levels of students to be positively
              affected by this project spans from freshman to senior mechanical engineering
              students.    The project enhances the product development component of the
              mechanical engineering curriculum and enables new discussions and
              demonstrations of product realization and prototyping to be integrated into
              existing design and manufacturing related courses.  It also elevates the level
              of collaboration when undergraduate mechanical engineering students participate
              in cross-university product development projects.    The new prototyping
              workcell complements the previous configuration of the Computer-Aided
              Engineering (CAE) Laboratory and provides a leading technology product
              development environment for mechanical engineering students.  The expanded CAE
              Laboratory is also available for use by students involved with related
              interdisciplinary projects.
