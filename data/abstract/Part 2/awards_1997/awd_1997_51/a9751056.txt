Abstract    :
              Through this project, the Chemistry Department obtains a 300-MHz superconducting
              Nuclear Magnetic Spectrometer (NMR).  The Department of Chemistry has
              redeveloped its curriculum and requires the completion of a laboratory
              component as part of each course of the chemistry curriculum, with the goal of
              progressively expanding the repertoire of techniques and building laboratory
              facility.  The addition of a 300-MHz NMR instrument enhances all levels of
              classes as well as the undergraduate research program.  The project begins with
              the basic operation of the instrument in the general chemistry course and
              integrates NMR throughout the subsequent curriculum.  A progression of
              experiments unified by the theme of modern chemical applications is introduced
              in the curriculum.    *
