Abstract    :
              The lower-division calculus-based Physics course sequence is nearing its
              completion of a major upgrade and modernization.  Following recommendations of
              the Introductory University Project report, the third semester Physics course
              is becoming a Capstone in Optics and Atomic Physics.  The required associated
              laboratory includes a few traditional Optics and Spectroscopy experiments and
              several newly developed experimental projects in Optics, Holography, Atomic
              Physics and computational Molecular Physics.  The experiments are designed to
              carry the student through a gradual transition from Optics to Quantum Physics
              and, above all, make it a very interesting experience.
