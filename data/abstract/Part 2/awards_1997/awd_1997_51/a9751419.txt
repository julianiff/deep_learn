Abstract    :
              This project is a joint effort of faculty from the Departments of
              Mathematics/Computer Science and Middle-Secondary Education/Instructional
              Technology.  The project improves learning in mathematics and computer science
              courses, especially courses taken by preservice teachers, through the
              development of World Wide Web-based course materials, tools, and methods and a
              synthesis of visual and analytic pedagogical strategies.    The work is part of
              a general project to reconceptualize undergraduate mathematics and science
              courses by coordinating pedagogy with methods taught in the College of
              Education.    A combination of INTEL-based Windows NT workstations and Silicon
              Graphics UNIX workstations are used in a dedicated laboratory and an open
              technology center.  The project develops and implements teaching methods using
              materials which are designed for this equipment.  The work is conducted by
              interdisciplinary teams from mathematics, computer science, and education. 
              This structure can continue to direct the production and application of an
              integrated collection of information, dynamic applications, and tools that
              enhance teachers' ability to teach and improve their understanding of how
              students learn.  *
