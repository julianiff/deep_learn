Abstract    :
              An astronomy concentration is being developed for majors within the Physics
              Department, and an astronomy minor is being instituted for other students.  The
              centerpiece of this program is a new observatory being built just south of the
              main campus.  This project involves the purchase a 16" telescope, a CCD camera
              and photometric filters, and a video printer for the new obsertatory. This
              equipment is being used to establish a modest research program to observe
              variable stars.  In addition to providing useful data, this program is serving
              to train students in modern astronomical research techniques and telescope
              operation.  Future plans for the observatory include the expansion of the
              observing program into the infrared for upper-level undergraduate research
              projects, and the addition of an array of small telescopes for the introductory
              astronomy courses and laboratories.
