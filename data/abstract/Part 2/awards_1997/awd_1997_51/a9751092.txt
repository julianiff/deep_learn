Abstract    :
              This project is incorporating the computer algebra software Maple into the
              existing calculus III, IV, and ordinary differential equations sequence. Eight
              student compuers, two faculty computers, a color printer, a laptop and
              projector for the classroom, and Maple software are being installed. The
              lecture structure of the existing courses is also being altered to include
              laboratory components and the standard syllabi of these courses are being
              altered where appropriate to reflect Maple's influence.
