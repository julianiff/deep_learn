Abstract    :
              This department is developing a Science Mentoring Networked Classroom (SMNC)
              that combines state-of-the-art instructional technology with a mentoring
              pedagogy to create what is arguably the most effective science learning
              environment in the Nation. This facility brings real-world phenomena into
              lecture and laboratory settings. This process is implemented by the ability of
              the networked computers to enhance discussion and the sharing of ideas. The
              SMNC, devoted to a specific suite of science courses, is affecting every
              student.  It could potentially revolutionize the way science is learned not
              only here, but at the high schools, colleges, and universities that adopt this
              unique approach to teaching.  *
