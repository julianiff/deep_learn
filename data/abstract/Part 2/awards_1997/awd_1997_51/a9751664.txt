Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is developing a new biochemistry laboratory course
              and obtaining equipment for this laboratory.  The Department has not previously
              offered a biochemistry laboratory course, and no comparable course has been
              offered elsewhere at the university.  Thus, the new course fills a void in the
              department's curricula.  The course consists of 1 hour of lecture and 6 hours
              of laboratory a week for 3 credits.  The concept behind this course is to avoid
              filling the time with a collection of miscellaneous laboratory experiments. 
              Instead, the course focuses on the process of biochemical research.  The
              laboratory deals entirely with cytochrome c, simulating the experience of a
              real-world research project.  The laboratory is being built around team
              learning.  Teams of students isolate cytochrome c, characterize it by a variety
              of biochemical and bioinorganic methods, determine its function, and modify the
              protein to produce a chemical nuclease.  This process introduces them to the
              bio-organic chemistry of nucleic acids.  Students are being well prepared to
              continue their undergraduate education in biochemistry by performing
              undergraduate research and taking additional biochemistry courses. By exposing
              the students to the excitement of research problems, the course is supporting
              their interests in pursuing careers in biochemical research.  *
