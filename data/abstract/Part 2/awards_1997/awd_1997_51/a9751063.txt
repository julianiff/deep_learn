Abstract    :
              A capillary gas chromatograph (GC) is being widely used in a number of courses. 
              The use of this instrument is allowing a number of the laboratories to be more
              educational and informative for the students, and is making it possible to
              introduce a number of new experiments into organic chemistry, instrumental
              analysis, inorganic chemistry, physical science, and several upper-level
              chemistry courses. New experiments are being added to the physical science
              courses in an effort to introduce the non-science major to the gas
              chromatograph, one of the most widely used pieces of scientific equipment.
              Several of the undergraduate research groups also are benefiting from having a
              capillary GC available. The capillary GC also is used by nearby Coastal Georgia
              Community College's students as part of a program in which they make use of the
              instrumentation at Armstrong for analyzing their laboratory samples. An
              additional use of the instrument is in Armstrong's Community Outreach Program
              in which a large number of high school and middle school students visit
              Armstrong and carry out laboratory experiments.  *
