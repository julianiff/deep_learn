Abstract    :
              This project is designed to provide students with experience in three important
              areas:  a sense of three-dimensional structures of molecules; hands-on
              experience with bonding theories in relation to molecular properties; and
              understanding reactions at the molecular level.  The course modifications
              associated with interfacing computers are bringing about a systemic change
              across the chemistry curriculum and allowing students to engage in
              discovery-based experiments fostering curiosity.  The goal is not to train
              students in theoretical organic chemistry, but to use computational methods to
              foster a cooperative and inquiry based learning atmosphere.  Molecular modeling
              is being implemented as a tool for clarifying misconceptions, leading students
              through the inquiry process, providing the opportunity to test hypotheses, and
              finally allowing students to assert ownership of the knowledge.  The major
              impact is in the area of organic chemistry.  A faculty member at the University
              of Missouri-Columbia is serving as an advisor for the project, assisting in
              developing experiments, co-authoring experiments submitted for publication, and
              implementing newly developed experiments into the organic chemistry curriculum
              at the university.  The collaboration between Graceland College, a rural
              liberal arts college, and the University of Missouri-Columbia, a large research
              university, is serving as a model for enhancing the chemistry curriculum and
              expanding the opportunities for undergraduate students.  *
