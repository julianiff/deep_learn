Abstract    :
              This project implements a second computer laboratory to include the latest
              imaging and multimedia related hardware.  It will be used with traditional and
              non-traditional Physics, Astronomy, Chemistry and Computer Science courses. 
              The new laboratory space will meet the following objectives to: 1. improve the
              instructional quality in all of our courses, 2. develop and implement new
              multidisciplinary service courses aimed primarily at improving the
              "quantitative science experience" for non-science students; 3. modernize
              existing courses and develop innovative courses within the newly acquired
              computer science and data processing/programming and systems curricula; 4. 
              include object oriented programming with languages such as Java, imaging,
              applications, digital video and multimedia development tools; 5. expand our
              "computer based laboratory utilization to include multidisciplinary training in
              physical science, computer literacy, imaging and multimedia applications for
              outside practicing professionals such as photographers, fine and graphic
              artists; 6. assist with the training of new elementary education teachers and
              in-service elementary and secondary educators by technology courseware and the
              offering of workshops in conjunction with the local teacher learning centers.
