Abstract    :
              The Advanced Neuroscience Learning Laboratory is providing students with a broad
              and integrative education in neural and brain studies.  The laboratory also
              provides students with background in the four foundation areas of neuroscience:
              behavior, neuroanatomy, neurochemistry, and neurophysiology.      This
              laboratory will serve a broad group of students, including majors, K-12
              teachers seeking re-certification, and students preparing to be teachers who
              will earn subject endorsements in psychology, chemistry, and biology.  It will
              provide a significant enhancement to their research and laboratory experiences.
               This equipment can serve 250 majors as part of a comprehensive education in
              neuroscience, physiology of behavior, development, cognition, learning, and
              psychopathology.  This facility can also be used by health science, biology,
              and chemistry majors.    The laboratory is an integral part of the department's
              curriculum, providing experiences in the classroom and opportunities for
              independent undergraduate research.  The laboratory uses off-the-shelf
              technology and techniques that are easily mastered by undergraduate students. 
              Behavior is studied by examining exploratory behavior, learning and
              conditioning, and neuromotor development.  Neuroanatomy is studied using
              prepared neuroanatomic slides and examples of human pathology.  Neurochemistry
              is studied with neurohistochemical techniques, as well as gel electrophoresis
              and thin layer chromatography, to reveal neurotransmitter function and
              distribution.  Neurophysiology is studied with a student-oriented computer
              interface, which permits studies of EEG, EMG, GSR, and several other
              physiologic and behavioral systems.    *
