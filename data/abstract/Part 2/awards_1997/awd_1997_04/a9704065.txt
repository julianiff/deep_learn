Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to
              discover and prove chemical additives for lithium bromide(LiBr)-water vapor
              absorption chillers that will significantly improve absorption rates compared
              to currently available additives. Current state of the art absorption chiller
              technology uses performance additives to increase rates of vapor absorption in
              order to reduce absorber size and cost. An additive meeting this goal will
              enable absorption chillers to be built with significantly smaller copper tube
              heat exchangers, resulting in reduced first costs. This in turn will allow for
              increased market share for absorption chillers in the air conditioning
              industry, and significantly enhance the competitiveness of this
              non-chlorofluorocarbon(CFC) alternative technology. Candidate additives will be
              selected based on a chemical catalysis mechanism describing their activity.
              Absorption rate enhancement activity will be determined using a falling film
              test absorption machine. Chemical stability will be verified by calorimetry and
              long term thermal exposure tests. In Phase II, field tests of selected
              additives will be performed using production machines.       This technology
              has commercial applications in any new designs of LiBr-based absorption
              chillers, as well as similar chillers currently in service worldwide.
