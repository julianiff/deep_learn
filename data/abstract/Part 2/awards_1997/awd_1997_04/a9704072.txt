Abstract    :
                  Xiao  9704072     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              will develop a surface-sensitive low-energy-X-ray-fluorescence (LEXRF)
              instrument to meet the thin film metrology needs prioritized in the National
              Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors. The continued increase of device
              densities in silicon-based integrated circuits requires more deposition steps
              of thinner films, which in turn demands better metrology for process
              development and quality control. During the Phase II program, a LEXRF
              instrument will be constructed which includes a polycapillary optic designed in
              Phase I to collect a large solid angle of X-rays and focus them onto a sample
              to increase the X-ray intensity by two orders of magnitude. The focused beam
              provides submillimeter spatial resolution in measuring various thin films
              important to the semiconductor industry. The last phase of the program will
              demonstrate the capabilities of the LEXRF system at a major semiconductor tool
              company.   The commercial potential of the proposed LEXRF instrument lies in
              its ability to provide elemental and thickness analysis to identify defective
              thin film deposition processes at the earliest opportunity, thus avoiding the
              considerable financial loss associated with rejections at the end of the
              production line. The proposed LEXRF system will also provide feedback to
              fine-tune the deposition process on a continual basis to increase the
              production yield.  p:/sbir/yhashimi/abstracts/9704072.doc
