Abstract    :
              9704861  Chen    This project lies in the area of Riemannian geometry and
              nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations. The investigator wishes to
              pursue the problem of prescribing scalar curvature on spheres: given a function
              on a sphere, can one find a metric conformal to the standard metric whose
              scalar curvature is the given function? This problem can be stated in terms of
              a quasi-linear elliptic partial differential equation; the current project is
              to study various aspects of this underlying differential equation.    Rimannian
              manifolds are higher dimensional generalizations of curved surfaces. Such
              manifolds have well-known applications in theoretical physics. A Riemannian
              manifold possesses a notion of distance, or a metric. And by taking the
              derivative of the metric one can measure its curvature. The problem of
              prescribing curvature then is to see if one can reverse this process: one
              specifies the curvature property first, and then look for a suitable metric.
