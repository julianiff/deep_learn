Abstract    :
              The postdoctoral associate will work with researchers in Rensselaer's Scientific
              Computation Research Center (SCOREC) on the development of parallel adaptive
              partition of unity methods.  These methods represent a new class of
              discretization techniques for solving partial differential equations, which do
              not require the traditional grids of disjoint, non-overlapping cells, as used
              in typical finite element, finite difference or finite volume methods. However,
              they do require a discretization of the domain from which an appropriate set of
              partition cells interact with themselves and the domain boundary.  Key to the
              construction of the partitions is determining how the partition cells interact
              with themselves and the domain boundary.  The ultimate effectiveness of these
              methods will depend on efficient construction and control of the partitions. 
              Building on expertise on the development of scalable parallel algorithms for
              automated adaptive finite element analysis over general three-dimensional
              domains, the proposed research program will consider alternative methodologies
              for the automatic construction and adaptive solution, in parallel, of partition
              of unity discretizations for geometric domains defined in terms of solid
              models. Specific areas of development include: (i) examination of alternative
              methods to use distributed octree structures on parallel computers to define
              basic partitions over the domain of the octree, (ii) effective techniques to
              perform the required integrations over partition of unity cells, with
              particular concern for integrating those cells that intersect boundaries of the
              domain, and (iii) develop parallel adaptive partition of unity solution
              methodologies
