Abstract    :
              9704755  Pitts    The Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has been held
              semi-annually since 1989. The conference has been jointly sponsored by the
              University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&M University, Rice University and the
              University of Houston. The conference is designed to enhance both the
              educational and the research atmosphere of the community of Texas geometers and
              topologists. The conference has three specific goals: to bring researchers of
              national and international statue to Texas to discuss their research and to
              interact with mathematicians from Texas and surrounding states; to make it
              possible for the community of geometers and topologists from Texas and
              surrounding states to meet and share mathematics on a regular mathematics; to
              contribute to the development of graduate students and young faculty in
              geometry and topology.      4
