Abstract    :
              Optimized codes for multi-dimensional problems such as image processing and
              fluid  dynamics often require the problem space to be traversed in a direction
              not  parallel to any of the basis vectors of the space.  Affine transformations
              of the  iteration indices are needed for these oblique traversals.  This
              project  is  implementing affine transformations for loop retiming in code
              generators, with  consideration of the effect of conditional branches. 
              Architectural support for  anticipating  conditional branches is also being
              investigated.  With extensive  undergraduate participation, research is
              proceeding toward several goals:   identification of new high-level language
              constructs for describing loop  retiming; development of supporting hardware
              features;  new techniques for  accomodating conditional branches;  and
              development of simulators and other tools  for investigating loop
              transformations.
