Abstract    :
                        INT-9704231  Woyczynski    This U.S.-Poland Collaborative Research is
              on "Fractal Models of Hydrodynamic Type."  The principal investigators are Dr.
              Wojbor Woyczynski of Case Western Reserve University and Dr. Piotr Biler of the
              Mathematical Institute of Wroclaw, Poland.  They propose a study of random and
              nonrandom problems for nonlocal nonlinear parabolic and parabolic-elliptic
              models of the hydrodynamic type with fractal anomalous diffusive behavior. 
              While the physics and engineering communities have recently suggested and
              vigorously studied such models, there is no systematic, rigorous mathematical
              study of the subject, such as the principal investigators propose.  The
              research will include an investigation of the asymptotics of solutions with
              random data and/or stochastic perturbations, stochastic stability of
              attractors, the role of the forward self-similar solutions in description of
              global solutions and the backward self-similar equations near the blow-up time.
               In particular, random problems for the fractal Burgers equation and
              Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann systems will be of interest.    This research in
              mathematics fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading
              experts in the U.S. and Poland to combine complementary efforts and
              capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of
              equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.    ***  ??
