Abstract    :
               This grant provides funds for modest travel awards to graduate students in
              logic in support of their participation in the Annual Meeting and the European
              Summer Meeting (Logic Colloquium) of the Association for Symbolic Logic (ASL). 
              The NSF funds supplement ASL funds which are already being used in this way. 
              Any student who is at an advanced stage of a PhD program in logic will be
              eligible for support; efforts will be made to encourage participation by women
              and minorities.  These awards are aimed at two goals: (a) to ensure that
              graduate students in logic have good opportunities to participate actively in
              the profession at an early moment, in order to enrich their educational
              experience; (b) to strengthen the two main annual meetings of the Association
              for Symbolic Logic, which are key professional meetings in the field, by
              increasing the number of graduate students who are able to attend.
