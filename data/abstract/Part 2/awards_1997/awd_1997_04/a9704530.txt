Abstract    :
              This research investigates the origins of knowledge and conceptual structure. An
              interactionist perspective   leads to a computational model in which the
              earliest knowledge structures are influenced by both native   structure in the
              agent and its exposure to the world. `Physical schemas` are learned that form
              stable,   dynamical relationships between the agent and the world based on
              closed-loop `physical primitives.`   A   preimaging technique is used to form
              context-dependent categories spontaneously in order to improve the   quality of
              sensory and motor behavior. Declarative models are lifted from the sensorimotor
              substrate in the   form of `figurative schema.` This representation includes
              explicit predictive models of sensation and   affect, and thus captures some of
              the underlying semantics of behavioral policies.  An integrated robot   system
              is used as the experimental platform. The implications of this work extend to
              developmental   psychology, epistemology, and psycholinguistics, artificial
              intelligence and machine learning.   Computational agents built on these
              principles refer ultimately to the physical world for meaning --- the   same
              physical world that shapes human conceptual structure. We foresee interfaces to
              electronic agents   that appeal to semantics based in the physical world to
              understand the `meaning` of a human request.
