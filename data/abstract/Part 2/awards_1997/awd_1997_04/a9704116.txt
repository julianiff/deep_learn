Abstract    :
              9704116  Gracia-Rill  The overall goal of this program project is to develop and
              evaluate  multiple, new, synergistic strategies for intervention and 
              rehabilitation after spinal cord injury.  The premise of this  application is
              that any approach to successful intervention and  rehabilitation after SCI will
              require the utilization of a variety  of different strategies.  Thus, this
              program project grant will  utilize three different interventions and test
              their effectiveness  in the recovery of motor function in spinalized cats.  The
              strength  of his project is that it integrates careful studies on the 
              functional integration of the neural transplants as well as  pharmacological
              and electrical stimulation on the enhancement of  mobility.
