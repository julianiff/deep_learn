Abstract    :
              The first careful experimental studies of gas-liquid phase separation (capillary
              condensation) in well characterized materials, giving the full gas-liquid phase
              diagram and critical point for a range of confined systems, were recently
              reported by Thommes and Findenegg.  In this project, the PIs will use Grand
              Canonical Monte Carlo simulation to study these phase changes in controlled
              pore glasses (CPGs), with a view to understanding and interpreting the
              confinement effects involved.  The simulations will employ an efficient
              parallelized Monte Carlo program, based on histogram methods, and using the
              SemiGrand Ensemble.  Models of CPG will be prepared by two different methods
              involving the use of Quench Molecular Dynamics to quench supercritical silica.
              These methods will be tested and the best will be used in the future work.  The
              absorption, and phase transitions for sulfur hexafluoride in CPGs of various
              pore diameters will be calculated and compared with the experimental data. 
              This work will be followed by studies of melting and freezing of simple fluids
              in CPGs, and again comparisons with experiment will be an important part of the
              project.
