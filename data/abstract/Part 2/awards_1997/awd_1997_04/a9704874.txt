Abstract    :
              9704874    Birnir      The dynamics of surge, stall, and flutter in jet engines
              will be investigated   using the qualitative theory of nonlinear partial
              differential equations (  PDE's). The Moore-Greitzer equations modelling the
              flow through a compressor  will be used to analyze surge and stall. First it
              will be determined whether   the  dynamics are high or low-dimensional, then
              the bifurcation that causes   stagnation  stall identified and methods
              developed to control stall and surge. The results  will be applied to the study
              of laboratory compressors and the analysis of   laboratory data. A simple model
              for flutter in rotor (and stator) rings   of blades is  developed and used to
              study the possible flutter modes, then control strategies  for these modes will
              be developed. This will first be done numerically and  then analytically.
              Finally these methods will be used to study a realistic  model of rotor rings
              and the real flutter modes and their bifurcations   analyzed and methods
              developed to control them.   The qualitative analysis of nonlinear PDE's will
              be extended to dimensions  two and greater, numerically and analytically, first
              by studying damped   and driven wave equations, and applications of the higher
              dimensional theory   will be implemented.     The purpose of the research is to
              help design jet engines that are lighter and  can be operated more efficiently
              and safely than contemporary jet engines.   These engines will be used in the
              airplanes of the 20th century and will make  air travel faster, cheaper, and
              safer.
