Abstract    :
              9704835  Gong    This project aims to understand structures and invariants of
              real submanifolds in complex spaces. The investigator is to study a class of
              totally real embeddings of real manifolds in the complex Euclidean space which
              satisfy a certain second order differential relation. He is to investigate the
              global topological property of such embeddings and the relationship between the
              complex tangency of real submanifolds and the singularity arising from the
              structure of real submanifolds with respect to the holomorphic volume form on
              the complex Euclidean space.    Submanifolds are higher dimensional analogs of
              surfaces in space; complex spaces are generalizations of real spaces based on
              complex numbers. Real submanifolds in complex spaces are interesting in that
              they exhibit both real and complex number based characteristics. They also
              arise as the boundaries of domains of holomorphy, meaning that they bound
              regions on which a rather special class of complex-valued functions can be
              defined.
