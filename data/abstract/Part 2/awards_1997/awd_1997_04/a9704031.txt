Abstract    :
                  Tang  9704031     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              aims to improve the process uniformity of the chemical mechanical polishing
              (CMP) planarization process. The proposed work centers on real-time process
              optimizations based on real-time in-situ thickness mapping during CMP
              planarization.   The ability to improve the process uniformity is crucial to
              semiconductor manufacturers. CMP is a key semiconductor planarization process,
              and is utilized to address microlithography depth of focus problems and
              multilevel metallization problems. The CMP process is presently utilized by
              most state-of-the-art semiconductor production lines for interlevel dielectric
              (ILD) and shallow trench isolation (STI) planarization. The ability to improve
              CMP process uniformity will directly benefit semiconductor production yields.
