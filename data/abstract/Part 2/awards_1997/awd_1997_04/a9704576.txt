Abstract    :
               9704576 Stringfellow  This project addresses fundamental research issues in the
              growth of III-V materials by metallo-organic chemical vapor deposition(MOCVD),
              in-situ and ex-situ atomic-scale characterization of the MOCVD growth process,
              with the scientific goal to understand the basic chemical and physical
              processes and the fundamental mechanism of ordering during crystal growth by
              MOCVD.  The approach combines surface science spectroscopic and microscopic
              techniques to measure structure, chemistry, and surface processes within a
              state-of-the-art MOCVD reactor.  The project emphasizes relating surface
              features such as reconstruction and steps to ordering.  %%% The project
              addresses forefront research issues in a topical area of materials science
              having high technological relevance to microelectronics and photonics.  The
              research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental
              level to important aspects of electronic/photonic devices and integrated
              circuitry, in general.  Additionally, the fundamental knowledge and
              understanding gained from the research is expected to contribute to improving
              the performance of advanced devices and circuits by providing a fundamental
              understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved materials, and
              materials combinations.  An important feature of the program is the integration
              of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally
              and technologically significant area. ***
