Abstract    :
              9704744  Rosinski    Professor Jan Rosinski intends to investigate
              representations of non-Gaussian infinitely divisible processes under a general
              framework of stationarity with respect to groups of transformations.  To
              accomplish this goal, he proposes to develop new connections between the theory
              of stochastic processes and ergodic theory, group representations, particularly
              those induced in the sense of Mackey, and functional analysis.  These general
              results can be applied in the structural analysis of stationary, self-similar,
              and isotropic infinitely divisible random fields.  He also intends to continue
              research on asymptotic independence of stochastic processes, sample path
              continuity, and multiple stochastic integrals.    Infinitely divisible random
              processes appear naturally in many areas of theoretical and applied
              probability, communications, networking, mathematical finance, and statistics. 
              Roughly speaking, a process is infinitely divisible if its behavior is
              determined by a large number of mutually independent random factors.
              Stationarity is a notion describing statistical symmetries of a random process.
               Stationary infinitely divisible processes, which may exhibit high variability,
              are not well understood at present because the traditional methodology of
              Gaussian processes is not applicable here.  This project is intended to develop
              tools and methods for analysis of infinitely divisible processes which can be
              used in modeling of highly variable phenomena.
