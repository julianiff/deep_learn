Abstract    :
              9704980  Golubitsky    Bifurcations to spiral waves and to cellular patterns in
              partial differential   equations posed on a circular disk will be investigated.
               In unbounded   domains, the bifurcation and meandering of spirals and scroll
              waves and the   Ginzburg-Landau theory of spatially extended systems will be
              considered --  - with application to spatially aperiodic solutions in spatially
              extended   systems.  In addition, part of the effort will be devoted to
              studying the   dynamics present in ordinary differential equations with
              symmetry.  Stable   ergodicity of chaotic attractors in problems with
              continuous symmetry, and   the existence, stability and bifurcations of robust
              heteroclinic cycles will be   studied.  Some of these ideas are relevant to
              intermittent magnetic dynamos   in rotating convection.    Patterns appear in
              physical, chemical, and biological systems and are   characteristically
              striking and reproducible.  Consequently, scientists and   mathematicians have
              developed theories to explain the origins of these   patterns.  There are
              several approaches to the study of pattern; this one is   based on symmetry and
              bifurcation.  It is proposed to investigate the theory   and application of
              symmetric dynamical systems and its relation to pattern   formation.  There are
              fundamental differences in the analyses depending on   whether the patterns
              being studied fit neatly into a bounded domain or   whether boundaries are
              unimportant and the equations are posed on infinite   domains. Aspects of both
              cases will be studied.
