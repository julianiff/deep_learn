Abstract    :
                Dudley  9704603    For differentiating functionals or operators on empirical
              distribution functions, most statisticians had  adopted compact or Hadamard
              differentiability. R. Dudley and co-workers are showing that Frechet  
              differentiability, well known to be superior when it holds, can be obtained by
              use of p-variation norms  for one-dimensional sample spaces, with optimal
              bounds on remainders. The program is next being  pursued in multidimensional
              spaces. Also,  R. Dudley and a co-worker are showing that a posteriori
              probabilities can be well approximated by normal (Gaussian) probabilities even
              with respect to relative error when the probabilities are very small.      In
              the study of differentiable statistical functionals, one is looking at how
              estimators or other statistics  depend on the observed data distribution: is
              the dependence smooth, approximately linear, or not, and  how can smoothness or
              lack thereof be quantified. In Bayes asymptotics, one begins with an assumed
              prior  probability distribution over an assumed surface of possible parameter
              values, and from enough  observations, finds an a posteriori distribution which
              has approximately a Gaussian form. The project is  showing that a simple method
              works very well, giving very accurate Gaussian approximations to the a
              posteriori probabilities.  By way of these approximations, the project includes
              studies of methods for choosing between competing statistical models, or
              theories, based on multiple data sets, as in multiple  experimental studies on
              the same or closely related questions.
