Abstract    :
              The proposed research plan combines automatic differentiation (AD) and parallel
              computing, targeted toward large-scale inverse problems in engineering.  AD is
              concerned with the computation of exact derivatives, up to an arbitrary order. 
              Recent AD software packages are just beginning to bring the practical benefits
              of AD into the mainstream of computational science.  Nevertheless, despite
              significant progress on the efficient computation of sparse Jacobiian and
              Hessian matrices, the reverse mode of AD remains impractical for large-scale
              problems involving dense derivative matrices, primarily due to excessive memory
              demands.  Typically, inverse problems are in this category.  The research plan
              is focused on the efficient automatic generation of gradients for inverse
              problems in engineering in a parallel computing setting.  Reverse mode is in
              principle optimally efficient for computing gradient vectors; however in
              practice the memory requirements (and subsequent swapping, etc.) are
              problematic.  The PI's will develop the AD methodology in the parallel
              computing setting, where the available memory is much greater.  Moreover, they
              will investigate the use of the technique known as recursive checkpointing to
              greatly reduce memory requirements.
