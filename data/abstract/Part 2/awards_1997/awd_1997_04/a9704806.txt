Abstract    :
                    9704806  Ivany    Deciphering the complex relationship between
              evolutionary change and environmental change requires a detailed and
              simultaneous record of both variables so that patterns in each can be compared.
               If the records dovetail, then there is compelling evidence for the role of
              environment in influencing the direction of evolutionary change.  The P.I. will
              explore this issue with a case study in the Eocene Gulf Coastal Plain.  She
              will construct a temperature curve specific to the coastal region by analyzing
              the isotopic composition of biogenic carbonates.  Secular trends in both
              temperature and seasonality associated with mid-Eocene to Oligocene global
              cooling will be examined through geochemical analysis of biogenic carbonates
              and careful microsampling of growth lines in organisms showing accretionary
              growth.
