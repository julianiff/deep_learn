Abstract    :
              In 1986, reported research results indicated that current design provisions that
              govern the anchorage of steel prestressing strands were inadequate.  The
              Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) responded by issuing a moratorium in
              October of 1988 that increased the development length requirements for
              pretensioned strands until additional research was available to restructure or
              verify the current code provisions.  That moratorium remains in effect today. 
              Subsequently, several research projects were undertaken to measure
              experimentally the transfer lengths and development lengths of pretensioned
              prestressing strands.  However, the results from various research projects
              indicate widely disparate results, with measured transfer lengths varying more
              than 100%  between different research projects.  In fact, the defining
              characteristic of transfer length measurements appear to be their wide degree
              of scatter, despite researchers' best efforts to control variables. 
              Collectively, the widely disparate transfer length and development length
              results indicate that all of the relevant variables have not been sufficiently
              identified nor quantified.  This research will investigate the fundamental bond
              mechanisms to develop behavioral and analytical models that can become the
              foundation for design.
