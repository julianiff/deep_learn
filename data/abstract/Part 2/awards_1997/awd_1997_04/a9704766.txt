Abstract    :
              This proposal will undertake the continued operation of the  Magnetometer Array
              for Cusp and Cleft Studies (MACCS) and the data  reduction, archival and
              dissemination, and analysis of data from  the array.  The array is
              cooperatively operated by Boston  University and Augsburg College (Engebretson,
              PI).  The analysis of  data will be undertaken in collaboration with various
              satellite and  other ground based measurements to study processes which couple 
              energy from the solar wind to the magnetosphere and ionosphere.   Particularly,
              investigations will focus on transients and waves at  the magnetospheric
              boundary, magnetospheric convection, and the  substorm process.
