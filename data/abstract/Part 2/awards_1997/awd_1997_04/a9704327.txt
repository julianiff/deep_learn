Abstract    :
                Hartigan  9704327    I explore the role of classification in probability and
              statistics. I use probability models in forming and  validating classes, and in
              identifying modes and other new objects, but I also use classification for 
              prediction and forming probability models. For example, in recognition
              problems, people compare new  objects with classes of known objects, and
              predict behavior of these new objects by assigning the new  objects to the
              classes and expecting the objects to behave similarly to known objects in those
              classes.      I consider how properly formed classes may be used for
              understanding and prediction. For example, in  congressional voting, members
              form a series of semi-permanent alliances or blocs that vote together on 
              certain classes of issues. The size and constitution of these blocs offers a
              way to study the evolution of  Congress.
