Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9704044  Carol Hall/N.C. State    This proposal describes a
              program of theoretical research aimed at understanding the  mechanisms by which
              solutes such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) enhance the refolding of proteins and
              prevent aggregation. The goal is to develop molecular-level models that capture
              the essential features that govern the competition protein refolding and
              aggregation in both the presence and absence of solutes.  By simulating the
              properties of model proteins and solutes on the computer, we will be able to
              explore how protein folding and kinetics are influenced by:  protein type and
              concentration; denaturant type and concentration; solute type; concentration,
              and size; and temperature.  The investigators will work on three parallel
              tracks whose objectives are:  (1) to extend the two dimensional lattice Monte
              Carlo studies of protein folding and aggregation previously performed under NSF
              sponsorship to include the presence of model solutes that mimic the effect of 
              PEG, (2) to develop simple off-lattice models based on the heteronuclear
              square-well chain model and then to use discontinuous molecular dynamic (DMD)
              to simulate protein folding and aggregation in the presence and absence of
              model PEG molecules.    ***
