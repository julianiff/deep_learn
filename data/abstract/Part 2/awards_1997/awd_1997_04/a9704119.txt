Abstract    :
              9704119  Sheaff    This U.S.-Mexico award will partially support the 1997 
              School on Instrumentation in Elementary Particle Physics, to  take place at the
              Instituto de Fisica of the Universidad de  Guanajuato, Mexico. The funds
              requested  are to provide  travel support for students from the U.S. to attend
              this  school/workshop, which will assemble students and  researchers from the
              U.S. and from developing countries in  Latin America.  Co-organizers of the
              meeting are Dr.  Marleigh Sheaff of the University of Wisconsin and Dr. 
              Gerardo Herrera of the Centro de Investigacion y Estudios  Avanzados
              (CINVESTAV) or the Instituto Tecnico Nacional  (IPA) in Mexico City.    The
              School will consist of lecture courses in various state  of-the-art
              instrumentation techniques in current use in  experimental particle physics,
              augmented by laboratory  courses designed to demonstrate the material
              presented.  The  goal is to encourage increased participation by young 
              physicists from developing countries in elementary particle  physics
              experiments and to encourage future collaborations  in experimental elementary
              particle physics.  While the  instrumentation techniques to be presented are
              those  currently in use in particle physics, many have wide-ranging 
              applications to medical imaging or to the non-destructive  evaluation of
              materials.  ***
