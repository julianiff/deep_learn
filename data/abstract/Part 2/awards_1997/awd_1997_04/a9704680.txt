Abstract    :
                  9704680  Fricke    Despite its potential to provide new inroads in the study
              of marine and terrestrial paleoenvironment, the isotopic analysis of phosphates
              has been hampered by the same quality that makes them so attractive; the
              strength of the oxygen-phosphorous bond.  Until recently, the chemical
              separation of the phosphate ion was difficult and time consuming, and its
              analysis required the use of relatively complex flourination techniques.  A new
              analytical technique has been developed which is much simpler, and it is now
              possible to process and analyze large numbers of phosphate samples relatively
              rapidly.  Nevertheless preparing samples for this technique is still relatively
              labor-intensive, and it is not possible at present to run samples smaller than
              -6 mg in size.  The P.I. will develop the excimer laser as a faster and
              microanalytical alternative to the methods described above.  The technique will
              drastically reduce the necessary sample size, allowing for in situ analysis and
              the isotopic investigation of small and rapidly formed skeletal structures.
