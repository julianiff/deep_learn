Abstract    :
              Friedman  9704431    A predictive learning system is a computer program that
              constructs rules for predicting values of some property of a real system
              ("output") given the values of other properties ("inputs") of that system.
              Predictive learning systems attempt to construct or "learn" useful prediction
              rules purely by processing data taken from past successfully solved cases; that
              is, cases for which the values of both the output and input variables have been
              determined.  The role of the learning algorithm is to automatically extract and
              organize the information in this data to obtain accurate rules for predicting
              output values of new cases in which only the values of the input variables are
              known.    This research concentrates on new paradigms for the development of
              predictive learning methodology quite different from past approaches.  The goal
              is to produce faster more powerful learning algorithms. These new algorithms
              can then be applied to solve broader classes of more complex problems, such as
              those that arise in the fields of communications, biotechnology, environmental
              forecasting, and manufacturing process control.  The research will involve
              making advances in the areas of statistical theory, algorithm design, and high
              performance computing.
