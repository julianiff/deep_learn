Abstract    :
                      9704651  Mojzsis2      The P.I. will examine a sample of the aqueous
              alteration lithologies of the ALH 84001 meteorite (McKay et al., 1996) and
              determine the phosphate mineralogy and inclusion compositions contained within
              it.  The other martian meteorite containing obvious aqueous mineral
              assemblages, the EET79001 meteorite (Gooding et al., 1988), was affected by
              chemically active aqueous solutions.  Geological evidence derived from remotely
              sensed data pointing to abundant liquid water in the past on Mars include
              large-scale remnant hydrologic features such as outflow channels, valley
              networks, drainage systems, lake deposits, possible ancient seas, and even
              glaciated terrain.  Carbonates and other salts could have precipitated out of
              water at the surface in equilibrium with an ancient atmosphere on Mars before
              climatic conditions fell below the stability field of liquid water.  Low
              temperature mineral assemblages contain direct information about their medium
              of precipitation, and aqueous mineral formation may have contained at depth or
              in a hydrothermal regime on Mars until heat from volcanism ceased; the pressure
              and temperature conditions would tend in these cases to satisfy the stability
              of liquid water.
