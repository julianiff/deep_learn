Abstract    :
                      9704677  Freed    If we can understand the time-dependent effect of an
              earthquake on the seismic potential of the surrounding region, we will be able
              to look at recetn events and predict regions and specific faults that are at an
              elevated seismic risk.  The goals of this project are (1) Use the Los Angeles
              basin blind-thrust fault system as a case study in earthquake triggering; and
              (2) Determine whether the southern San Andreas fault is in the midst of a
              failure stress build-up resulting from the 1992 Landers quake.  These goals
              will be achieved by expanding the two-dimensional (2-D), time-dependent finite
              element code TECTON to three-dimensions.
