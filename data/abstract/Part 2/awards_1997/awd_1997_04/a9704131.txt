Abstract    :
              ***  9704131  Wu    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is
              to develop a prototype 600MHz wide bore (89mm) high resolution NMR magnet with
              internal tin superconducting wires.  The feasibility of this approach has been
              fully proven in Phase I.   Through replacement of  bronze-processed wire by
              internal tin wire, high field NMR system cost will be reduced significantly. 
              The Phase II research objective is to build, test and evaluate the proposed
              full scale prototype NMR magnet.  To achieve the objectives, Cryomagnetics,
              Inc. proposes a technical approach consisting of testing stability of each NbTi
              and Nb3Sn coil separately under persistent mode operation to insure each coil's
              performance, and then assembling coils and testing the magnet.  At the end of
              Phase II research, a full scale prototype 600 MHz wide bore high resolution NMR
              magnet will be developed and fully tested.  This prototype magnet will be the
              selling point for the Phase III program--the commercialization of 600 MHz wide
              bore high resolution NMR magnets.    The new technologies developed in Phase I
              and II will generate great commercial impact by reducing NMR system cost.  The
              proposed wide bore NMR magnet system will be ideal for micro-imaging and  in
              vivo spectroscopy as well as biological solid state NMR spectroscopy.  The
              successful completion of Phase II of this project will make inexpensive, wide
              bore, high field NMR magnets available in the market.  ***
