Abstract    :
                For the 1997 Industrial Mathematics Modeling Workshop for  Graduate Students
              (IMMW97), an applied scientist or mathematician  leads a team of approximately
              6 graduate students in the solution  of an actual problem from industry. Thus,
              applied mathematics  graduate students are exposed both to the types of
              problems  arising in industry and to the team approach of problem solving.  
              This enriches their graduate educational experience, and can  provide valuable
              training in the event the students choose a  non-academic career. Boeing,
              Kodak, Michelin, and the NSA are  likely to be represented by the industrial
              problem presenters at  IMMW97.  We strongly believe that workshops, such as the
              one  proposed here, are one of the best ways to heighten students  interest in
              industrial mathematics, to improve students vision  about the type of
              mathematics and science that should be learned,  and to accelerate the
              cross-fertilization between the applied  sciences and mathematics.    This
              workshop is modeled after the successful workshops,  ``Industrial Mathematics
              Modeling Workshop for Graduate  Students,'' held the past two summers at North
              Carolina State  University.  Last year's workshop was organized by Professors 
              Tran, Reitich, and Scroggs. In addition, Prof. Reitich, in  cooperation with
              Lord Corporation, was one of the problem  presenters.  This workshop series
              started in the summers of  1993 and 1994 at the Claremont Graduate School. Both
              of these  workshops were organized by Professor Ellis Cumberbatch of the 
              Claremont Graduate School.    This GOALI project is jointly supported by the
              MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of 
              Mathematical Sciences (DMS).
