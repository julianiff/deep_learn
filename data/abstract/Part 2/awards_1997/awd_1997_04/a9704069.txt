Abstract    :
              The Organic Synthesis Program supports Professor Yves F. Rubin of the  
              Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of California,   Los
              Angeles for his studies of novel tetrathiafulvalene-based two- and  
              three-dimensional charge-transfer materials.  Alkyne groups are used to   link
              tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivatives into two- and three-dimensional   arrays
              in which both increased side-by-side contacts between molecules   and
              conjugation through the alkyne pi bonds are expected to alter the  
              charge-transfer properties of the TTF moieties.  The potential   conductivity,
              superconductivity, and ferromagnetism of these materials   will be examined. 
              With support from the Organic Synthesis Program, Professor Yves F. Rubin   of
              the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of   California,
              Los Angeles is exploring the synthesis and properties of   molecules designed
              to display unusual physical properties.  Working from   a basic structural
              motif in which two adjacent molecules undergo the   partial transfer of charge
              from one molecule to the other, Professor   Rubin links the two interacting
              molecules into a variety of two- and   three-dimensional structures.  Use of a
              carbon-carbon triple bond as the   linking group facilitates the interaction
              between the two molecules.  The   resulting materials are expected to display
              unusual electrical   conductivity and/or superconductivity as well as magnetic
              properties,   offering to shed light on these important phenomena.
