Abstract    :
                        9704653  McCollom    The P.I. will conduct a series of laboratory
              experiments to examine the reactivity of organic compounds under hydrothermal
              conditions.  Results of these experiments will be used to develop thermodynamic
              models that link inorganic, organic and biological processes during
              hydrothermal alteration.  Experiments will be conducted on the role of sulfur
              compounds in organic transformations and the reactivities or organosulfur
              compounds under hydrothermal conditions.  These experiments will complement
              current research on the hydrothermal reactivity of other classes of organic
              compounds and hydrothermal alteration of organic-rich sediments.
