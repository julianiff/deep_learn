Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to investigate the use of  adaptive  techniques to
              minimize the power consumed by  peripherals in mobile computing systems. Since
              battery life  is one of the most critical resources in the mobile  computing
              environment, good energy conservation methods can  dramatically increase the
              utility of mobile systems. The  investigators have previously demonstrated that
              new adaptive  techniques from the machine learning community are very 
              effective in solving disk spin-down problem  (deciding  when to shut down the
              disk in order to maximize power  savings) on traces of disk activity.  The
              project will  continue this work in two directions. The first direction is  to
              compare the performance of the new techniques with that  of other adaptive 
              algorithms for the spin-down problem.  The second direction involves applying
              similar machine  learning methods to wireless modems (radios). In addition to 
              the power savings gained by turning off the radio when the  network interface
              is not needed, adaptively choosing the  broadcast power level may also lead to
              significant energy  savings.
