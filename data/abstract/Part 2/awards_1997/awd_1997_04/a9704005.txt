Abstract    :
              9704005  Fisher  This grant titled "Disorder and Correlations in Low 
              Dimensions" is to support the theoretical research of a  young and a well
              honored (Waterman award, among others) PI.  He is proposing work on a host of
              problems, all derived from  the effects one encounters in increasingly smaller
              devices.  More specific, the research includes work on: (1) transport  in quasi
              1d systems, incorporating the novel correlations  known as the Luttinger liquid
              as well as the compounds that  exhibit "high Tc superconductivity, (2) Quantum
              Hall  transport and tunneling in novel geometries, (3) electron  localization
              transitions in 1-d and 2-d using supersymmetry  and numerical methods and
              finally (4) non-equilibrium  transport in vortex lattices, driven through a
              random  pinning environment.  %%%  As the devices become smaller, the physical
              phenomena become  increasingly sensitive to the effect of coulomb interaction 
              and presence of defects (disorder).  This grant is to  support the work of a
              young, distinguished  PI, recipient of  the 1995 Waterman award among other
              honors.  He is proposing  research on phenomena which occur in small dimensions
              (thin  films, wires or dots) and also involve rather complex  mathematics.  The
              selected projects have applications in  cutting edge technology in 
              superconductivity and magnetism.  ***
