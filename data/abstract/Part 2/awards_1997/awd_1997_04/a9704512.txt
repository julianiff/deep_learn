Abstract    :
              Networks of workstations (NOWs) are becoming increasingly  popular for providing
              cost-effective and affordable parallel  computing.  However, the LAN
              environments are gradually  becoming heterogeneous due to the commodity nature
              of  workstations and networking equipment.  Such heterogeneity  gets reflected
              in terms of communication capabilities of  nodes (processor speed, memory
              speed, network interface  support) and network architectures (different
              interconnects  with varying topology and connectivity).  This is  forcing NOW
              environments to be gradually redefined as  `Heterogeneous Networks of
              Workstations' (HNOWs). This  research is targeted towards providing fast and
              scaleable  collective communication support for such emerging HNOWs.  The
              following problems are being addressed by this project:  1) quantitatively
              specifying the heterogeneous  characteristics of a HNOW environment and
              studying their  impact on the performance of current implementations of 
              collective communication operations; 2) designing and  developing optimal
              algorithms for collective communication  operations by considering major
              heterogeneous  characteristics; and 3) studying the performance gains  achieved
              by the optimal algorithms for different suites  and HNOW environments.  An
              experimental HNOW testbed  consisting of a set of workstations with different
              speeds  and different interconnect types (Fast Ethernet, ATM, and  Myrinet) is
              planned to be used together with theoretical,  analytical, and simulation
              approaches to develop and  validate the new research results.
