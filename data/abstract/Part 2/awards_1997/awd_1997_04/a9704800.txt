Abstract    :
              THOMPSON,  ABSTRACT  9704800    The proposer plans to continue the study of
              finite projective planes, especially the Galois-theoretic aspects of incidence
              matrices. Additionally, the proposer will continue the study of realizing
              simple groups as  Galois groups , especially of covers of the complex
              projective plane with 4 branch points. Finally, the proposer will continue his
              interest in the Lyons-Solomon work on providing a detailed, coherent proof of
              the classification of finite simple groups.  The theory of groups is a central
              area of research in mathematics because its methods apply generally to the
              study of many mathematical objects through the properties of symmetry and
              geometric transformation.
