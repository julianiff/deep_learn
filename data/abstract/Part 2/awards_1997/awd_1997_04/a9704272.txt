              travel expenses and organizational costs of the Fifteenth North American
              Meeting of the Catalysis Society, to be held on May 18-23, 1997, in Chicago,
              IL.  The meeting is widely respected and well attended by academic and
              industrial researchers in catalysis of the US, North America and other parts of
              the World.  It serves as a forum of discussion of the upcoming scientific and
              technological advances in the field, and has a strong educational function for
              young faculty and graduate students.
