Abstract    :
                              9704384    Shen  The  focus of this research project on optics
              in  liquid  crystals falls into two general areas:  studies of novel optical
              phenomena in  liquid  crystals, and use of novel optical techniques to  study
              liquid crystals.  Nonlinear optical effects to  be studied include
              laser-induced polarization, dye-  enhanced nonlinearity, and stimulated Raman 
              scattering emphasizing surface and  interfacial  properties, and
              surface-induced bulk alignment  effects.  %%%  These studies are aimed at
              enhancing our knowledge of  the many unique and interesting ways that liquid 
              crystals interact with laser light.  These  discoveries will that help in the
              search for novel  applications of liquid crystals as extraordinary  materials
              for modern optoelectronic applications such  as display,  memory, and sensor
              devices.  ***
