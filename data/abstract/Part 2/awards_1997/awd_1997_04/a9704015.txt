Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to develop protocols for highly  available
              Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) systems.  Such  protocol designs require
              handling multi-site failures and  network partitions.  This project is
              investigating issue  related to highly available DSM from three different 
              perspectives.  First, its goal is to develop a stochastic  model of highly
              available DSM to serve as the basis for  further analytical work in this area.
              Second, a DSM  simulator is planned to be developed to help analyze  coherence
              protocols for high availability. Third,  an  experimental DSM system is being
              extended to support high  availability based on a new protocol called Boundary 
              Restricted Coherence Protocol (BR).  Finally, this project  aims at
              demonstrating the use of highly available DSM  systems for a variety of
              applications such as scientific  computing and database systems.
