Abstract    :
              9704353  Yang    This project deals with research at the interface between
              geometric topology and number theory. More specifically, the investigator is to
              study the functional equations of the classical polylogarithms and to relate
              this to the grassman polylogarithms; and to investigate the close relationship
              between hyperbolic 3-manifolds and the Bloch group in algebraic K-theory. One
              important question to be addressed is the realization of elements in Bloch
              group by hyperbolic manifolds - a solution to this question has a direct
              bearing on the K3 rigidity conjecture.    Hyperbolic 3-manifolds are important
              building blocks of three-dimensional manifolds or curved spaces in general.
              These are negatively curved spaces generalizing the non-Euclidean plane
              geometries. Many hyperbolic 3-manifolds can be given as quotients of the
              standard 'flat' hyperbolic three space by certain discrete symmetry groups, and
              this observation allows researchers to use algebraic techniques to study
              hyperbolic manifolds.
