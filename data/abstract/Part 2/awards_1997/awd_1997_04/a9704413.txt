Abstract    :
              9704413  McLaughlin    This project concerns applications of characteristic
              classes to problems in algebraic geometry, conformal field theory, and the
              geometric Langlands correspondence. An emphasis is to be placed on finding
              explicit formulae for non-commutative symbols which generalize to the
              n-dimensional general linear group a formula of Kubota for the two-dimensional
              case. The idea behind this generalization is that Kubota's formula can be
              derived geometrically from the second Chern class.    Characteristic classes
              are 'invariant' algebraic objects often used to classify spaces and manifolds
              or indicate certain 'topological' obstructions. The idea is to encode essential
              information possessed by a space in algebraic objects that are unchanged under
              reasonable transformations of the space. They then provide a useful
              computational tool since algebraic objects often are discrete and/or finite
              whereas the space under consideration is almost always infinite.
