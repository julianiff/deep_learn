Abstract    :
              9704833  Jaco       This project involves the development and use of efficient 
              triangulations and normal surface theory in the study and  understanding of
              3-manifolds.  The primary objective is to develop an  algorithm to decide if
              two 3-manifolds are homeomorphic, thereby  providing a complete classification
              of 3-manifolds.  Efficient  triangulations lead to combinatorial methods that
              yield results  analogous to those obtained when a 3-manifold is known to have a
              rich  geometry (hyperbolic structure).  All 3-manifolds admit  triangulations,
              those which are least understood are precisely the  class which admit efficient
              triangulations; hence, this project  provides new methods to study the least
              understood cases of  3-manifolds.       Low-dimensional manifolds provide the
              geometric models of most  physical phenomena.  It is natural to ask for a
              description of all  possible such models.  For nearly a century, the
              classification  (precise listing of all possible models) of 2-manifolds has
              been  understood.  Following this work by fifty years, it was learned that it 
              is not possible to classify all 4-dimensional models.  This project  attacks
              the problem in dimension 3, which remains open.  ***
