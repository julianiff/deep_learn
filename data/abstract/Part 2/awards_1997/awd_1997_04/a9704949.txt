Abstract    :
              9704949  Kusner    This project deals with various geometric variational
              problems. One focus of the project is geometric moduli problems, especially for
              complete constant mean curvature surfaces and conformally flat constant scalar
              curvature metrics. Tools from mechanics and symplectic geometry - and in the
              case of surfaces, Teichmuller theoretic methods and representations involving
              spinors and quaternionic forms - is to be used to understand the structure of
              these moduli spaces.    Geometric variational problems include a variety of
              problems where finding extremal or optimal objects amongst families of objects
              all satisfying certain boundary or initial conditions. For example, a minimal
              surface spanning a given boundary minimizes the surface area amongst all
              surfaces spanning the same boundary. Minimal surfaces, and more generally,
              constant mean curvature surfaces, can be used to model certain condensed matter
              - this is based on the observation that when two homogeneous media meet their
              interface forms a constant mean curvature surface.
