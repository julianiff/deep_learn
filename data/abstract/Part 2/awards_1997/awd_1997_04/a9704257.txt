Abstract    :
              9704257  Broholm  This award provides support for the acquisition of a cryo- 
              system consisting of a 12 Tesla superconducting magnet and a  dilution
              refrigerator for use in neutron scattering  experiments.  The instrument will
              be located at the Reactor  Radiation Division of the National Institute of
              Standards and  Technology in Gaithersburg, MD.  It will be shared by 
              investigators at Johns Hopkins University, Princeton  University, and the
              University of Maryland, College Park.  Researchers will use this instrument for
              NSF funded research of  magnetic and superconducting materials of fundamental
              interest  in condensed matter physics.  These include:  low-dimensional 
              antiferromagnets where quantum-induced disorder gives novel  cooperative
              phenomena, orgranic conductors (Bechgard salts)  that display a cascade of
              unusual field-induced phase  transitions between spin-density wave states, and
              heavy fermion  materials where interactions between local magnetic moments and 
              conduction electrons yield novel magnetic states.  Also  featured are
              high-field studies of the vortex lattice in high-  Tc superconductors, and
              exploration of the coexistence of  magnetism and superconductivity in the
              high-Tc materials and a  new class of quaternary intermetallic compounds.  All
              of these  are systems where the application of a large magnetic field can 
              proufoundly alter their behavior, particularly their magnetic  correlations and
              excitations.  By probing these effects  directly with inelastic neutron
              scattering, it will be possible  to greatly extend the understanding of these
              materials.  The  instrument will be made available to other researchers through
               the neutron scattering users programs at NIST.  It will  therefore become an
              important world-class resource for the  entire United States neutron scattering
              community.  %%%  This award provides support for the acquisition of a cryo-
