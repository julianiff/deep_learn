Abstract    :
              9704359  Szabo       The main theme of this project is the study of
              simply-connected  smooth closed 4-manifolds and their Seiberg-Witten
              invariants.  The  project has three parts.  The first part is related to the 
              classification problem for these 4-manifolds.  While the recent  failure of the
              Minimal Conjecture shows that smooth 4-manifolds tend  to defy classification
              schemes, there are other related conjectures  like the 3/2 Conjecture and the
              Simple-type Conjecture, and the  investigator will try to disprove these
              conjectures as well.  In the second part, the investigator will continue his
              joint  work with John Morgan to study how Seiberg-Witten invariants change 
              along an h-cobordism.  This problem is related to the Simple-type  Conjecture
              and also to the third part of the project, in which the  investigator will
              study the relation between the combinatorial  presentations (Kirby calculus
              pictures) and Seiberg-Witten invariants  of simply-connected smooth closed
              4-manifolds.  A long-term goal in  this direction is to find generalizations of
              the Seiberg-Witten  invariants.        The study of smooth structures of
              simply-connected 4-dimensional  manifolds was initiated in 1984 by Simon
              Donaldson.  In his ground  breaking work, Donaldson applied the Yang-Mills
              equation and the  corresponding Yang-Mills moduli spaces over the 4-manifolds. 
              The  corresponding Donaldson invariants were used to settle various  problems
              in 4-dimensional topology.  The Yang-Mills equation is a  partial differential
              equation that has special importance in  theoretical physics, and its use in
              the classification of smooth  4-manifolds revealed a surprising link between
              topology and  theoretical physics.  This link has been underlined by Seiberg
              and  Witten in 1994, when, using ideas coming from theoretical physics,  they
              discovered a pair of new partial differential equations and the  corresponding
              Seiberg-Witten invariants of smooth 4-manifolds.  ***
