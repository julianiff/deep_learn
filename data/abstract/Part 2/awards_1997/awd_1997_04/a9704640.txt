Abstract    :
              9704640  Farb       Farb's project is in the area of geometric group theory.  A
              new  geometric/topological approach to rigidity questions for lattices in 
              semisimple Lie groups, generalizing Mostow rigidity, has been developed  by
              several authors, including Farb.  He plans to continue his work with  L. Mosher
              in bringing these new ideas and themes to bear on  understanding
              quasi-isometries of broader classes of groups arising in  combinatorial group
              theory.  He will also work on characterizing a  broad class of finitely
              generated groups by certain dynamics they  exhibit.  Finally, Farb will study
              the geometry of deformation spaces  of discrete subgroups of rank-one Lie
              groups over local fields.       Geometric group theory is a mixture of
              geometry, topology, algebra,   and algorithms.  Farb's project in this area is
              an attempt to understand   the relationship between the symmetries exhibited by
              a space and its  geometric structure on very large scales.  ***
