Abstract    :
              The proposed research deals with various aspects of interactions between the
              analysis of the Laplace operator on differential forms (including the case of
              functions) and its discrete analogs with the geometry and topology of
              underlying spaces. In particular, the principal investigator will work on the
              following specific topics:  L^2 Betti numbers and related spectral invariants; 
              spectral theory of degenerating hyperbolic manifolds;  L^2 torsion of finite
              volume hyperbolic manifolds;  the principle of not feeling the boundary and
              nonlocal boundary conditions;  spectrum for metrics of modest regularity; 
              upper bounds for the smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian on functions on a
              compact Riemannian manifold.  The differential and difference operators that
              are the subject of the proposed research appear in such diverse areas of
              mathematics as combinatorics, communication networks, differential geometry,
              mathematical physics, numerical analysis, probability, and topology. Intuitions
              and ideas coming from one of these fields can (and do) provide powerful and
              unexpected insight for problems in other seemingly unrelated fields.  Because
              of this, the Laplace operators are a fundamental object of study. One aspect of
              the proposed project is the application of ideas from analysis in a continuous
              setting to a combinatorial problem which ultimately leads to a topological
              result.
