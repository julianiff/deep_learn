Abstract    :
              ZELMANOV, 97-04132    We focus on a number of longstanding open problems in
              algebra and topology  that are related to the Burnside Problem.  A secondary
              topic is the study of narrow groups and Lie algebras, in  particular, we
              consider the classification of the so called superconformal  algebras and of
              pro-unipotent groups of maximal class.    The area of proposed research is
              Combinatorial Algebra. Combinatorial  Group Theory appeared about a hundred
              years ago as a study of certain   infinite groups that arise in Topology.
              Throughout these years it has  more or less focused on the following three
              mainstream problems : (i)  groups presented by generators and relators, (ii)
              growth, (iii) the Burnside  Problem. Starting with 1940s similar problems have
              been considered and  intensively studied for infinite - dimensional associative
              and Lie algebras.  This extension of scope of research was motivated (a) by the
              intrinsic  needs of Algebra and in particular of Combinatorial Group Theory,
              (b) by  applications to Functional Analysis, Representation Theory, Number
              Theory  and (increasingly in recent years) by Mathematical Physics.
