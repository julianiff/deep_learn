Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9704922    An Engineering Foundation Conference is to be held to
              explore the technical opportunities and challenges afforded by organized
              molecular assemblies in solution and on surfaces.  This will be the first
              conference of its kind, as other conferences on colloidal systems have been
              focused on the fundamental issues with scant attention being paid to the
              applications of these structured  fluids and interfaces.  Funds are requested
              to offset partially the registration fees and travel costs of speakers and
              selected academic and graduate student attendees at the Conference, titled
              "Structured Fluids and Interfaces:  Technical Applications and Opportunities
              for Organized Molecular Assemblies", which is to be held in Lucca, Italy,
              during the week of 12-17 January, 1997.   ***
