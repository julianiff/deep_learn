Abstract    :
                This proposal will develop the concept for a GGCM (Global Geospace 
              Circulation Model) control program.  Such a GGCM control program  would serve
              to connect and pass data and control between various  modules that would
              comprise the GGCM system.  The importance of  such a concept study is to help
              determine the best implementation  strategy to undertake in a concerted GGCM
              development effort which  may be mounted in the near future.
