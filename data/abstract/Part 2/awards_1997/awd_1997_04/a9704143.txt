Abstract    :
              9704143  Wudl    This project will develop a new approach to extended-network, 
              very high strength organic polymeric materials.  Some of these  materials will
              be ultrahard, others will be "organic zeolites:.  Three approaches will be
              pursued:  (a) preparation of new  polymers and copolymers where pleiadene (a
              hydrocarbon which  becomes reactive at ca 220 degrees C) is a pendant group,
              (b)  preparation of new polymers in which pleiadene undergoes  cycloaddition
              polymerization to form the backbone, and c  preparation of new extended network
              polymers based on reversible  Diels Alder polymerizations and on the pleiadene
              cycloaddition  dimerization reaction and multiple cycloaddition to C60.    Once
              prepared, the new polymeric materials will have their  mechanical, optical and
              electronic properties determined using  the latest techniques in materials
              science and experimental  condensed matter physics.  %%%  These novel polymeric
              materials should have potential  applications as structural materials of
              strengths approaching  diamond as catalyst supports, etc., and may open the
              door to new  families of rationally designed, three-dimensional extended 
              solids.  ***
