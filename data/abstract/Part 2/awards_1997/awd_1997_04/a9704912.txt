Abstract    :
              9704912  Hager    This proposal concerns the numerical analysis of infinite
              dimensional   variational problems such as variational inequalities involving
              ordinary   differential equations, differential inclusions, and optimal control
              problems.   Using recent stability results, errors estimates will be derived
              for discrete   approximations of state constrained optimal control problems. 
              For   linear/quadratic problems with control and state constraints, efficient  
              algorithms will be developed for computing a solution.  In addition, the  
              stability theory will be applied to generate both a priori and a posteriori  
              estimates for the errors in the computed solutions.  For differential  
              inclusions, discretizations will be developed with sufficient generality to  
              encompass problems with discontinuous right sides and state constraints.    The
              algorithms and theory that will be developed in this proposal are   applicable
              to a variety of problems in industry such as those associated with   the
              optimal performance of robots, flight control in aerospace, the design of  
              thin films with desired properties, or the optimal engineering of chemical  
              processes. When any of these problems is solved on a computer, the   continuous
              process is decomposed into tiny time steps.  This proposal   studies the errors
              that are caused when this continuous process is discretized   in this way.
