Abstract    :
              This research deals with  issues related to the efficient  use of parallel I/O
              systems. These include problems of  data  placement, caching, and prefetching
              and their interaction in  determining system performance. The project involves
              the  development of robust parallel I/O models that incorporate  these
              requirements, and designing new  algorithms to obtain  desired performance
              levels. This includes  identifying the  appropriate policies for resource
              management in the context  of both single and multiple interacting
              computational and  I/O streams, and the development of suitable algorithmic 
              strategies. The focus is on on-line buffer management and  prefetching
              algorithms with bounded lookahead. The use of  randomization in data placement
              and replacement, and issues  arising in their implementation are under
              consideration.  Theoretical analysis of the algorithms is based on a 
              competitive framework to compare different on-line methods,  and identify
              promising candidates. Suitable candidates will  be implemented and their
              performance validated empirically.  The areas of impact include, though  are
              not restricted to,  data-intensive applications like modern database  and 
              multimedia systems.
