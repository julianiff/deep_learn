Abstract    :
              9704774  Givental    This research project lies at the interface of topology,
              geometry, and mathematical physics. The investigator has recently given a proof
              of the mirror symmetry conjecture for a class of algebraic varieties, including
              the classical case of quintics in four dimensional complex projective space.
              The current project is a continuation of that work and pursues several new
              directions in quantum cohomology theory.    Mirror symmetry is a phenomenon
              first uncovered by physicists in connection with the popular 10-dimensional
              string model of the universe. In this model, the six invisible dimensions arise
              as so called Calabi-Yau manifolds; they observed that a model of conformal
              field theory known as the A-model of a Calabi-Yau manifold coincides with
              another conformal field theory model, the B-model, of its 'mirror' manifold. In
              mathematical terms this means that there is a well-defined correspondence
              between the symplectic topology of a Calabi-Yau manifold and the complex
              geometry of its mirror manifold.
