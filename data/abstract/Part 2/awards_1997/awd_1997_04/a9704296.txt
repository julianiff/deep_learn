Abstract    :
              9704296  Dai    This project deals with a variety of problems in the area of
              spectral geometry and geometric invariants. The investigator is to study
              manifolds with conical singularity with a view towards defining and
              understanding certain geometric invariants such as analytic torsion in a more
              general setting; to study the spectral geometry of degenerating metrics under
              various processes including the adiabatic limit, and Riemannian collapsing; to
              study geometric invariants and their behavior under surgery.    Spectral
              geometry is an area where often analytic techniques are used to study geometric
              objects. This project in particular deals with defining certain geometric
              invariants via heat equation techniques - the heat equation is among the more
              well-known partial differential equations, describing the heat flow phenomenon,
               and much is known about the equation.
