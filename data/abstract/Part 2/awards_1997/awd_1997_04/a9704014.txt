Abstract    :
              Whitlow  9704014    This award supports a 24 month Science and Technology Agency
               of Japan (STA) Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Larry Whitlow  at the
              Electrotechnical Laboratory, Tsukuba, Japan.  Dr.  Whitlow will work with Dr.
              Toshitaka Ohta, Director of the  Fundamental Energy Research Section, on a
              research project  entitled, "Transport Theory of Thermoelectric 
              Superlattices."    This theoretical research project is directed toward the 
              design of new high-efficiency thermoelectric materials.  In  particular, the
              researchers will study the use of  superlattice structures to enhance the
              thermoelectric power  factor of semiconductors.  Superlattice structures are 
              expected to influence the charge-carrier energy spectrum  through changes in
              the defined density of states and carrier  interactions.  The proposed research
              will offer substantial  and innovative insight into the connection between
              structure  and function in thermoelectric semiconductors and will give 
              important guidance to ongoing international experiments in  superlattice
              construction.  The main goal of the research is  to increase the over-all
              efficiency of current thermal-  energy sources and develop alternative
              high-energy  thermoelectric systems required for refrigeration and energy 
              conversion devices.  ***
