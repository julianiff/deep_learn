Abstract    :
              9704553  Cava    This award provides partial support for a new float zone 
              crystal growth furnace which will provide suprior samples  for materials
              research.  This furnace employs high intensity  light from halogen lamps,
              focused on a vertically oriented  polycrystalline feed rod, to melt a small
              zone of material  in the rod.  The molten zone is held in place on the rod by 
              surface tension.  The rod is slowly translated with respect  to the position of
              the focused light, moving the hot zone  along the length of the rod.  This
              prevents contamination of  the material from contact with a crucible or
              container,  which is important for studying intrinsic electronic and  magnetic
              properties.  This versatile furnace will grow  crystals for a wide range of
              materials with different  chemistries.  %%%%  This equipment will provide
              superior materials for  fundamental materials properties studies.  This will 
              increase our understanding of complex transition metal  oxides, both magnetic
              and superconducting, and will  contribute to the superconducting and magnetic
              device  technology.  ***
