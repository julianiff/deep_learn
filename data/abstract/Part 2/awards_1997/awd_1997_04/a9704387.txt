Abstract    :
              9704387  Calabi    These conferences are in the general area of differential
              geometry; the topics cover diverse areas including classical differential
              geometry, geometric partial differential equations and complex differential
              geometry. The investigators will continue organizing and holding the annual
              geometry festival to be held at various locations in the east coast on a
              rotating basis. The Festival has become an annual event for the east coast
              differential geometers for the last decade. The Festival will bring together a
              number of established researchers with junior investigators and students; it is
              hoped that students can quickly gain an appreciation of the scope of current
              research and learn of open problems. In 1998, in particular, the Festival will
              be held at Stony Brook with an interdisciplinary theme. The 1998 meeting is to
              be a two week conference dedicated to the theory of connections and its
              applications in mathematics and physics.      3
