Abstract    :
              This project will involve the study of combinatorial methods in geometric
              topology and geometric methods in enumerative combinatorics and algebra.  Most
              of this work will be in the context of quantum groups, quantum topological
              invariants, and finite-type invariants of 3-manifolds.  The conjecture that the
              Jones polynomial distinguishes the unknot is one example of a problem that
              motivates this work.  Another example is the conjecture that no Vassiliev
              invariant distinguishes a knot from its reverse. This research involves the
              investigation of connections between topology, enumeration, and quantum
              mechanics.  Topology is the study of how objects such as knots and surfaces are
              connected to themselves; although it was first established firmly as a field of
              mathematics a century ago, it has seen major advances in the past 30 years due
              to contributions from many areas of mathematics and physics.  Enumeration is
              the art of counting things, such as how many way that there are to tile a
              square tray with dominos; it is related to the thermal properties of materials
              and other questions in physics.  Quantum mechanics is a famous subject, but it
              is less well known that it has had an enormous influence in mathematics; it has
              partly redefined our conception of geometry and mathematical spaces.  These
              three areas saw a confluence in the 1980's, culminating in the Fields medals
              awarded to Vaughan Jones, Vladimir Drinfeld, and Edward Witten.  The hope is to
              extend the work of these and other mathematicians and physicists.
