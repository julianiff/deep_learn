Abstract    :
              9704099  Day  This is a theoretical research grant to Professor Day at 
              Marquette and Professor Thorpe at Michigan State.  The work  involves using a
              spectral function approach to calculate the  effective conductivity of
              composites.  The spectral function  is essentially a density of the
              singularities of the  effective conductivity of a two-component composite and 
              contains all of the information about the geometry of the  composite. 
              Consequently, knowing the spectral function for  a wide range of geometries,
              and seeing how it varies with a  change in geometry, will provide a powerful
              new tool for  understanding the relationship between microstructure and 
              material properties.  %%%  This theoretical research will be done at both
              Marquette  University and Michigan State University.  The work involves  a new
              way of determining the properties of materials  comprised of two components,
              i.e., composite materials.  These materials are used quite commonly and the
              results of  this research should aid in the design of these useful  materials. 
              On a more fundamental basis, this research will  aid in relating microstructure
              of materials to their  macroscopic properties.  ***
