Abstract    :
                Matching support for upgrading of a departmentally shared  facility for
              Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectrometery  to allow time-domain and
              multidimenional Fourier-transform  experimentsis requested.  The selected
              spectrometer system  is the Bruker ESP-380E-FT-300/FT/CW EPR spectrometer and 
              DICE/stochastic-Pulsed-ENDOR accesory. This instrument will  be the first of
              its kind on the Princeton campus and will  stimulate new research applications
              that are currently not  accessible here.  An initial group of 12 investigators 
              distributed across three academic departments and  an industrial laboratory
              will employ the instrument to  extend their research programs in the following 
              primary areas:(1) Structure and function of multi-  nuclear metallo-enzymes,
              (2)molecular robes of  the mechanism of Cytochrome P450, (3) Zinc finger 
              proteins and heme protein folding, (4) Probing  conformational changes in actin
              by EPR, (5) Observing  and exploiting intermolecular multiple-  quantum
              coherences in solution ESR, (6) Selenium-  dependent molybdo-pterin enzymes.
