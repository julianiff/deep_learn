Abstract    :
              9704277  Meyer    This  Americas  Program award will support Dr.  Thomas  J 
              Meyer,  University  of  North  Carolina,  Chapel  Hill,  in  a   research 
              collaboration  with  Dr.  Barbara  Loeb,  Pontificia  Universidad  Catolica  de
               Chile,  to  investigate  the  relationship  between  complex  structure and
              excited-state lifetimes. The major  thrust  of   the   study  will  focus  on 
              the  design,  synthesis,   and  characterization  of  a novel class of chemical
               complexes.   The  researchers plan to conduct detailed excited state studies,
              which  will  include  energy gap law correlations and molecular  orbital 
              calculations   on  acceptor  ligands.  The  role   of   rigidity, 
              delocalization, and redox characteristics will be investigated to  determine 
              the  excited  state behavior  of  a  series  of  these  complexes.   The
              results of this study are expected  to  have  an  important  bearing  upon  the
              rational design  of  compounds  for  application in advanced materials.    The 
              research  will benefit from the combined  expertise  of  the  collaborators.   
               The   distinct   synthesis    expertise    and  computational abilities of the
              Chilean research group complements  the  US  group's  strength in molecular
              design and  photophysical  characterization.  ***
