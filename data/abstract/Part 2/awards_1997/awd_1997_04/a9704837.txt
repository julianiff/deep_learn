Abstract    :
              9704837  Barrett    This project lies in the general area of several complex
              variables. Among the topics to be pursued are: function theory on the basins of
              superattracting fixed points of multivariate complex dynamical systems;
              graph-theoretic methods for analysis of problems on open Riemann surfaces;
              Seiberg-Witten metrics on Riemann surfaces; boundary behavior of biholomorphic
              maps in higher dimensions.    Research in several complex variables deals with
              spaces modeled on complex Euclidean space and mappings between them. Complex
              numbers, originally introduced in the study of polynomial functions, continue
              to be useful in simplifying and unifying various aspects of more general
              functions and maps. Moreover, it has found applications in other parts of
              mathematics and other sciences such as dynamical systems and theoretical
              physics.
