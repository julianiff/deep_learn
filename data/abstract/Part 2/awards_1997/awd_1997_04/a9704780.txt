Abstract    :
               9704780 Collins  This project aims to improve understanding of polycrystalline
              materials, specifically GaAs and CdTe for this study, through microscopic
              investigations of individual grains, grain boundaries, and interfaces, and the
              effects of surface passivation treatments on these features. The key component
              of the approach involves the use of near field scanning optical
              microscopy(NSOM) transmission, along with photocurrent, photoluminescence and
              minority carrier lifetime measurements. %%% The project addresses basic
              research issues in a topical area of materials science having technological
              relevance to electronics and photonics.  The research will contribute basic
              materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to polycrystalline
              materials.  Additionally, the fundamental knowledge and understanding gained
              from the research is expected to contribute to improving the performance of
              these materials in a variety of applications by providing a better
              understanding and a basis for producing improved materials, and materials
              combinations.  An important feature of the program is the integration of
              research and education through the training of students in a research area with
              strong technological relevance. ***
