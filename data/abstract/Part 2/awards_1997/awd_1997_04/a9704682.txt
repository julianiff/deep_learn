Abstract    :
              A scalable parallel algorithm is proposed for carrying out molecular dynamics
              with quantum transitions.  The inclusion of quantum transitions in molecular
              dynamics implies that one must solve the Schrodinger equation for the
              electronic degrees of freedom along the trajectory of the classical nuclei. 
              The calculation of forces on the classical nuclei is complicated by the lack of
              specific analytic expressions for derivatives of the basis state expansion
              coefficients for each adiabatic wavefunction.  The problem can be solved
              through the use of perturbation theory, however the resulting equations must be
              solved iteratively.  This iterative calculation, and subsequent calculation of
              forces and wavefunction derivatives can be done in parallel for each classical
              coordinate.  The application of the algorithm to a specific chemical system and
              electronic structure method is outlined.  Given the large number of chemical
              and physical phenomena that exhibit nonadiabatic effects, the algorithm
              outlined here should be widely applicable.  This proposal represents the first
              instance of the application of parallel computers to nonadiabatic dynamics.
