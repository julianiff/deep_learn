Abstract    :
              9704751  Mordukhovich      This project will support research on variational
              analysis and its   applications. Particular areas of research will include:
              nonconvex   generalized differentiation of nonsmooth and set-valued mappings
              between   Banach spaces; new characterizations and applications of robust  
              Lipschitzian stability in infinite dimensions; sensitivity analysis of solution
                maps for parametric generalized equations and variational inequalities;  
              discrete approximations and optimal control of constrained functional  
              differential inclusions; and robust control design of uncertain evolutionary  
              systems with hard control and state constraints.    Variational analysis has
              been recognized as an active area of modern   applied mathematics that, on one
              hand, deals with solving large-scale   optimization and related problems and,
              on the other hand, applies   optimization and perturbation ideas to the
              analysis of a broad spectrum of   mathematical models arising in real-life
              applications. In particular, one of   the proposal goals is to apply
              variational methods to feedback control   design of evolutionary systems
              motivated by environmental applications.
