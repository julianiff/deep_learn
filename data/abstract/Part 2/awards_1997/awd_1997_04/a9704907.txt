Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-97-4907  S. Kumar/Penn. State U.    While polymer mixtures are
              utilized extensively is practical applications, the prediction of their
              thermodynamic properties from a knowledge of molecular structure and
              interactions is an unsolved problem.  It is our assertion that a quantitative
              understanding of polymer phase behavior is necessary to design macromolecular
              materials with desired properties for specific applications.  With this goal,
              in this work we propose utilize new simulation methods, developed by us and by
              others, to enumerate the free energies  or the chemical potentials  and the
              phase diagrams of the following classes of industrially relevant polymer
              mixtures: (a) The phase equilibria of hydrocarbon based blends where the
              components are of disparate monomer structure; (b) The compatibilization of
              immiscible polymer mixtures by copolymers of different microstructure; and (c)
              The phase behavior of confined polymer mixtures, such as those encountered in
              paints and in lubricants.  This molecular based understanding of the properties
              of industrially relevant polymer mixture will also assist in the development
              and the critical evaluation of molecular models of polymer thermodynamics.
