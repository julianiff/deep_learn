Abstract    :
              9704490  Luo       Luo studies topology and geometry of surfaces and Heegaard 
              splittings of 3-manifolds.  One of the fundamental tools in surface  theory is
              the space of isotopy classes of essential simple loops on  surfaces introduced
              by Dehn and Thurston.  Dehn called the space the  arithmetic field of the
              surface.  The space was used by Thurston in  his work on the compactification
              of the Teichmueller space.  It has  been known by many mathematicians that the
              space of isotopy classes  has an intrinsic modular structure.  Luo has used the
              modular  structure to reconstruct the Teichmueller space and the space of 
              measured laminations.  This has enabled him to derive that the space  of
              measured laminations is semi-real algebraic. He is currently  working on the
              reconstruction of the mapping class group of the  surface.  He is also trying
              to apply the result on the space of  measured laminations to study the Heegaard
              diagrams of irreducible  non-Haken 3-manifolds.       Many problems in
              topology, geometry and mathematical physics  involve the consideration of all
              simple loops on a surface.  An  essential simple loop is a curve without
              self-crossing that cannot be  shrunk to a point on the surface.  The problem is
              to understand all  such loops put together.  The basic relation between loops
              is their  intersection number.  Luo is developing an algebraic calculation to 
              understand the intersection numbers on a space.  This may eventually  lead to a
              better understanding of 3-dimensional spaces through the use  of Heegaard
              surface theory.  ***
