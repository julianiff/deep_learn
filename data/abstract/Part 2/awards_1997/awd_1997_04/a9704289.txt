Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is directed toward
              the development of a solid lubricated bearing suitable for high-speed,
              extreme-environment applications.  The research will extend the Phase I
              analytical developments and experimental results to demonstrate operation of a
              self-contained, solid/powder-lubricated, high-speed journal bearing.  The work
              will be accomplished in collaboration with end users, including Sundstrand, GE,
              and Pratt & Whitney.  Self contained backup bearings are needed for magnetic
              bearing supported rotors in flywheel energy storage systems, auxiliary power
              units/integrated power units (APU/IPUs), and gas turbine engines.  The specific
              objectives of this project are to:  1) identify a lubricant material and
              processing parameters to manufacture stick type lubricants for the powder
              lubricated journal bearing; 2) design test coupons and lubricant geometries; 3)
              conduct pin-on disk tests of the selected lubricant; 4) design a prototype
              powder/solid lubricated multi-pad journal bearing; and, 5) Conduct high-speed
              verification testing of the prototype bearing.  The firm has invested in the
              design and fabrication of two test facilities in support of the proposed Phase
              II bearing development effort.  APU/IPUs represent the most promising near term
              application of this technology and will be the primary focus for this effort. 
              However, the technology is also applicable to gas turbine engines and flywheels
              and the research will explore ways to ensure the generality and applicability
              of results to such applications.
