Abstract    :
                      9704678  Burgoyn2    Methods will be developed for on-line preparation
              of H2 from subnanomole quantities of organic H and for continous monitoring of
              the hydrogen isotope ration (D/H) in the product.   Integration of this system
              with existing isotope-ratio-monitoring technology will allow determination of
              hydrogen isotopic compositions of individual organic compounds separated by gas
              chromatography.
