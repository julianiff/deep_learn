Abstract    :
              9704857  Turner       This award provides partial support for the ninth and
              tenth  annual SUNYA Topology and Group Theory conferences, October 10-12, 
              1997, and October 9-11, 1998, near Albany, New York.  The  conferences
              concentrate on combinatorial group theory and low  dimensional topology.  The
              invited speakers in 1997 are David  Epstein, Steve Gersten, Misha Kapovich,
              Ravi Kulkarni, John Meier,  Alexei Miasnikov, and G. A. Swarup.  It is
              axiomatic that algebraic  topology draws heavily upon group theory, but one
              charm of the  subject of these conferences is that the flow is substantial in 
              the other direction, with topology repaying its debt in shedding  light on the
              properties and structure of groups.  ***
