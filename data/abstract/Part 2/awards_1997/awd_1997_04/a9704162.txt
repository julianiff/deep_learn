Abstract    :
              9704162  Ben-Amotz    A Near-IR-Raman-Imaging Microscope  (NIRIM) instrument for
              2-D  spectro-chemical analysis of micro-composites and bio-materials  will be
              developed and constructed in the Purdue University  Department of Chemistry
              Departmental Laser Facility.  The  proposed instrument builds on recent
              advances in micro-Raman and  "optical tweezer" technologies to produce an
              instrument with  capabilities that significantly surpass current commercial or 
              research instruments.  In particular, the proposed NIRIM  instrument will
              simultaneously collect 3-D data cubes of x, y and  wavelength information from
              micro-composites and particles (with  sub-micron spatial resolution and 4 cm-1
              frequency resolution).  The near-IR Raman excitation laser will be capable of
              functioning  as an "optical tweezer" used to grab, separate and hold micro- 
              and bio-particles for chemical analysis.  This new instrument  will be used in
              a wide variety inter-disciplinary applications  ranging from studies of
              molecular wires, zeolite based sensors,  self-assembled composites,
              semiconductor microstructures and  novel optical data storage schemes, to
              chemical mapping of clay  and ice particles, drug suspensions, model membranes
              and living  cells  ***
