              Sarachik      This new collaboration between a woman physicist at CUNY and  a 
              chemist at UC San Diego will focus on the synthesis and study  of  the magnetic
              properties of crystals composed of a large number of  identical  high-spin
              molecular clusters,  such as  Mn12  acetate.  Their magnetic bistability makes
              such materials strong candidates  as  elements for high-density storage of
              information.  The  spin-  tunneling  in  a  double  well potential that  we 
              have  recently  demonstrated   makes   them  interesting   from   a  
              fundamental  standpoint, and offers the possibility that materials of  this 
              class  could  be used as elements for quantum  computation.  The  aim  of our
              studies is to synthesize new molecular  crystals  that  will  optimize
              properties for applications, and to  gain  a  better understanding of their
              behavior.  %%%  This  new collaboration between a woman physicist at CUNY  and

              for  fundamental  reasons,   and  also   offer   the  possibility  that they
              can be used in "quantum  computers"  which  require  elements that are
              simultaneously in a  "yes"   and  "no"  state.   The  aim of our studies is to
              synthesize  new  molecular  crystals that will optimize properties for
              applications,  and  to  gain a better  understanding of their behavior.  ***
