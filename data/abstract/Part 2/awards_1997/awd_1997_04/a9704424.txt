Abstract    :
              9704424  Lawson       This award is to provide partial support for a week long
              conference  in gauge theory and low dimensional topology at Tulane University
              in the  fall semester of 1997.  The conference will be held in conjunction with
               the annual Clifford Lectures, given this year by Peter Kronheimer.  Gauge 
              theory has been the source of dramatic advances in low dimensional topology  in
              recent years, and the work of Kronheimer and Tomasz Mrowka has been 
              fundamental, particularly their settling of the Thom conjecture.  A dozen 
              other significant contributors to this area will give major talks, and 
              additional shorter talks will round out the program.       Despite the fact
              that we live in a universe of three spatial  dimensions and one time dimension
              and have available all the intuition  that this experience provides us, three
              and four dimensional objects  have remained remarkably resistant to full
              understanding.  In fact,  mathematicians have found that in some respects
              higher dimensional  spaces are more tractable, whereas some of the analytic
              tools available in  higher dimensions cannot be used in dimensions three and
              four.  This  means that other methods that will apply in these so-called low
              dimensions  are at a premium and is what makes so important the gauge theoretic
              methods  first introduced by Simon Donaldson and more recently strikingly
              simplified  by Nathan Seiberg and Edward Witten.  ***
