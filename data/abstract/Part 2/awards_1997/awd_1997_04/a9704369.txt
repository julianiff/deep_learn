Abstract    :
              9704369  Gordon    This project lies in the area of Riemannian geometry. More
              specifically, the investigator is to consider the structure of isopectral sets
              of metrics, the possible existence of metrics in Euclidean space with the same
              scattering behavior, constructions of isopectral metrics whose geometric
              properties differ in certain ways, and the extent to which the spectrum of a
              Schrodinger operator determines the potential. The spectral geometry of
              orbifolds, minimal hypersurfaces and their applications to the geometry of
              Ricci curvature in dimension three, and the Ricci flow on manifolds with
              boundary are also to be pursued.    Riemannian manifolds are higher dimensional
              generalizations of curved surfaces. Such manifolds have well-known applications
              in theoretical physics. A Riemannian manifold possesses a notion of distance,
              or a metric. And by taking the derivative of the metric one can measure its
              curvature. The Laplace operator and its spectrum are a fundamental object
              associated to any Riemannian manifold. Much of this research project is
              concerned with the question "To what extent is the geometry of a Riemannian
              manifold determined by the spectrum of its Laplace operator?"
