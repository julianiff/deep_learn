Abstract    :
              9704434  Ji    This project lies in the general area of harmonic analysis.
              Specifically, the investigator is to determine the Martin compactification of
              symmetric spaces and study their topological properties along with those of
              other types of compactifications including the Satake compactification. The
              tools to be used include asymptotics at infinity of the heat kernel.   
              Symmetric spaces arise from continuous symmetry groups known as Lie groups.
              These spaces are particularly appealing in that they come equipped with many
              natural self-symmetries. In addition, they provide a fertile ground for
              interaction amongst various branches of mathematics including algebra, analysis
              and geometry.
