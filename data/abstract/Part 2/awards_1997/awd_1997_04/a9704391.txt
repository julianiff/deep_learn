Abstract    :
              In this project, the investigator aims to apply methods of symplectic and
              Poisson geometry, and Lie groupoids and Lie algebroids, to the study of 
              various differential structures related to Poisson manifolds and the
              quantization problem.  More specifically, the project involves the study of
              bihamiltonian structures and hyperkahler structures using the theory of Lie
              bialgebroids.  Also, this project will investigate deformation quantization of
              Lagrangian submanifolds, the characteristic class of star products on
              symplectic manifolds, quantization of Poisson manifolds, and their application
              in knot theory. Symplectic geometry is a mathematical tool used to lay a
              theoretical framework encompassing large parts of classical mechanics of
              Newton.  Ideas from symplectic geometry and Poisson geometry can be used to
              explain and predict various mechanical phenomena - e.g., locomotion generation
              and motion control. Knot theory has profound application in biotechnology such
              as the understanding of different DNA structures.
