Abstract    :
                Karatzas    DMS-9704505    We propose to train a Post-Doctoral Research
              Associate, for two  years, in the various mathematical and computational
              aspects of  modern Finance, combining the strength of Morgan-Stanley's fixed 
              income research group with the mathematical ewxpertise of the  Columbia
              University faculty.  The Post-Doctoral Fellow will be  able to benefit from the
              expertise of both groups, and will act  as catalyst for transfer of knowledge
              between them.    The Post-Doctoral Fellow will be expected to help develop a 
              mathematical framework for the valuation of American-style  derivative
              securities on interest-sensitive (fixed-income)  instruments, and to develop
              accurate and fast numerical  techniques.  The problem is of considerable
              practical  importance, and requires advanced mathematical tools, such as 
              stochastic differential equations, martingales and optimal  stopping, partial
              differential equations and Monte-Carlo  simulations.        Department of
