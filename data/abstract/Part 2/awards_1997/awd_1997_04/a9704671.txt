Abstract    :
                      9704671  Benton    Boron and lithium are important tracers of slab
              devolatilization during subduction.  While their isotopes have the potential to
              discriminate between the vartious B and Li reservoirs, the interpretation of
              such data is complicated by the lack of understanding of their isotopic
              behavior during slab metamorphism.  The objective of the proposed research is
              to study the evolution of B and Li in slab-derived fluids and subducted
              sediments and oceanic crust.  This will be achieved through laboratory
              experiments and study of natural examples of slab devolatilization from the
              Otter Point Formation (southern Oregon) and the Catalina Schist Subduction
              Complex (California).
