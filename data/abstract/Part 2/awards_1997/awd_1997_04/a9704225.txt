Abstract    :
              9704225  Meisel         This award provides support to develop a new variable 
              temperature, high-frequency Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)  instrument that
              will be housed in the new physics building that  is being constructed on the
              Gainesville campus at the University  of Florida.  The device will have the
              capability of providing a  wide range of magnetic field (up to 8.5 T with 10-6
              homogeneity)  in a 50 mm clear bore at room temperature.  A broadband high 
              frequency  (5 to 350 MHz) spectrometer will be an integral part  of the
              instrument.  A variety of probes will be developed to  allow NMR to span
              temperatures from 25 mK to 400 K.  %%%       This new instrument will serve as
              a tool to probe the  microscopic electromagnetic interactions that are
              fundamental to  our understanding of new low dimensional magnets (e.g. Haldane 
              gap and spin-ladder materials) and novel magnetic systems (e.g.  Kondo
              insulators and magnetic/nonmagnetic multilayers).  In  particular, the data
              provided by this instrument may not be  obtainable by any other known
              experimental probe.  In addition,  when new extremes of magnetic field,
              temperature, and pressure  seem to be natural extensions of the research, the
              experiments  may be continued at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory 
              (NHMFL).  The system (especially the spectrometer) is being  designed in a
              manner which will make it compatible with the  instrumentation used at the
              NHMFL at higher frequencies and  magnetic fields.       An important component
              of the proposed program is the  education and training of postdoctoral fellows,
              graduate  students, and undergraduate students.  Members of the researcher 
              team are trained in a variety of modern cross-disciplinary  fields, including
              (but not limited to) cryogenics, electronics,  ultra-high vacuum technology,
              NMR, macroscopic and microscopic  surface science techniques, and new chemical
              synthesis protocols.  When the junior researchers leave the group, they are
              prepared to  tackle the heretofore unknown technic al and scientific questions 
              of the future.  ***
