Abstract    :
              9704633  Lott    This project is concerned with relationships between geometric
              analysis and the topology of manifolds. Among the topics to be pursued are:
              L2-invariants of covering spaces and their possible extensions; p-form
              eigenvalues of collapsing Riemannian manifolds and about topological
              obstructions to collapse; analytic torsion forms and the topology of
              diffeomorphism groups.    Manifolds are curved spaces generalizing surfaces in
              space. Thus an important geometric property of a manifold is its curvature,
              which is defined locally. It turns out that there are restrictions on the
              overall shape of the manifold, i.e., its topology, for the manifold to be able
              to carry certain types of curvatures; conversely, knowing the curvature one can
              make certain predictions about its global shape.
