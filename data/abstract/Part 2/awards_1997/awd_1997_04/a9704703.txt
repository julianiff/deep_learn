              Data-flow coverage criteria are heuristics for judging the quality of software 
              test suites and determining when enough testing has been done. The analysis
              required for data-flow testing of programs in languages such as C is currently
              impractical on large programs.  Achieving near 100% satisfaction of the
              coverage requirements constitutes the real expense of data-flow testing.
              However, this is not necessarily related to the real expense of testing, which
              is looking for the difficult-to-find bugs.     With the hypothesis that
              difficult-to-find bugs are correlated with statement hazard level, statement
              hazard is introduced to measure the unexpected effects of executing a program
              statement.  Preliminary experiments indicate that a small proportion of program
              statements are highly hazardous. Hazard of a side-effect is defined as the
              degree to which its side-effects are unexpected by the programmer. Thus,
              experiments to determine the relation between hazardous statements and bug
              detection are described. These experiments build on other successful
              experiments in analyzing data-flow testing effectiveness, but additionally pay
              special attention to those bugs that are difficult to find. Determining the
              correlation between hazardous statements and difficult-to-find bugs will
              improve the effectiveness of data-flow testing and reduce its cost, making 
              data-flow testing feasible in an industrial environment.
