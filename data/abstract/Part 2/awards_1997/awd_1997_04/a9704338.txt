Abstract    :
              9704338  Kapouleas    The proposal consists of two somewhat distinct groups of
              projects. The first group of project deals with various geometric constructions
              by singular pertubation methods. These include constructions using
              desingularization of intersecting minimal surfaces, minimal hypersurfaces and
              constant mean curvature hypersurfaces in higher dimensional Euclidean space,
              and Einstein four-manifolds. The second group of projects lie in the area of
              general relativity. In particular, the PI, in collaboration with Christodoulou,
              will try to settle uniqueness and stability questions for the Kerr and
              Schwarzschild black holes.    Minimal surfaces arise as various physical
              surfaces; they have the remarkable property of minimizing the surface area
              amongst all surfaces bounded by the same spatial contour. Minimal surfaces can
              also used to model condensed matter. Stability questions for black holes, which
              involve examining the interaction of a black hole with weak gravitational
              waves, have important applications in cosmology.
