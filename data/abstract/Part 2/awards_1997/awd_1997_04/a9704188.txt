Abstract    :
              ***  9704188  Iyer    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project
              will develop computer assisted manufacturing (CAM) planning software, based on
              physical mechanistic models and accessed on the world wide web.  The research
              will focus on robust process planning modules oriented to the machine tool
              industry.  A reliable security scheme will offer adequate protection for
              transmission over the Internet and storing of sensitive design data.  An
              innovative feature will be the availability of the proposed CAM system on the
              Internet as well as Intranet suites for large institutional users.  The system
              will enable linkage of floor personnel in small- and medium-sized with design
              and research engineers in large enterprises.  The research will also develop an
              adequate on-line, self-paced training facility with extensive design and
              analysis examples, applications, and utilization notes.    A commercial
              pay-per-use process planning CAM suite service and a modified version for use
              on corporate Intranets is expected for marketing to the machine tool industry.
