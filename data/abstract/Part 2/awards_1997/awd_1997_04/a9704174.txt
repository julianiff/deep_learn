Abstract    :
              9704174  Feehan    The project lies in the interface of geometric topology and
              mathematical physics. Specifically, the investigator is to establish the
              equivalence between Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten invariants for smooth
              four-manifolds. The investigator is to use the approach first suggested by
              Pidstrigach and Tyurin, which is based on non-quantum ideas. The tools to be
              used for implementing the Pidstrigach-Tyurin approach include Taubes's gluing
              maps and nonabelian monopoles.    Smooth four-dimensional spaces have received
              a great deal of attention in recent years due to their applications in
              relativity theory and due to a recent mathematical discovery allowing their
              coarse classification. It is notable that instantons and monopoles, two major
              ingredients in the classification of smooth four-manifolds, both were
              originally introduced by the physicists studying elementary particles.
