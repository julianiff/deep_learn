Abstract    :
              9704488  Han    The project lies in the general area of Riemannian geometry. The
              investigator is to pursue questions related to scalar and Gauss curvatures,
              geometric PDEs (vortex sheet equation), and the geometry of harmonic maps into
              negatively curved surfaces. The project also contains an education component
              involving the undergraduate geometry curriculum.    Geometric partial
              differential equations use techniques from various areas in geometric analysis
              such as harmonic maps and Riemannian geometry to solve differential equations
              arising in a variety of contexts. For example, the vortex sheet equation is
              related to the evolution of vortices in the air and other fluids as well as to
              phase transitions in super-conductivity.
