Abstract    :
              The PI will investigate pick-up ion energization at the quasi-perpendicular
              space shock.  He will study (both analytically and numerically) the shock
              surfing mechanism's viability as a means of injecting ions into the cosmic ray
              acceleration process.  The surfing mechanism favors acceleration of slow
              particles, and is therefore an attractive mechanism for explaining pick-up
              injection at the termination shock.  Two puzzles he will address:  (1) the
              relative ease with which slow pick-up ions are accelerated at the
              quasi-perpendicular shocks, even though the threshold velocity needed to inject
              particle into the process of diffusive acceleration is much higher in that case
              than for quasi-parallel shocks, and (2) the preferential acceleration
              efficiency of heavier particles as inferred from mass fractionization by the
              Voyager spacecraft.
