Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will exploit novel
              photocatalysts for air pollution control using solar energy.  Emissions
              controls are needed which are cost effective, use energy efficiently, are
              suitable for remote locations, and produce no hazardous by-products.  Ideally,
              the technology could be rapidly commercialized to meet an increasingly pressing
              need.  Photocatalysis potentially has these characteristics, employing
              ultraviolet (UV) light to destroy contaminants at ambient temperatures. 
              Photocatalysis would be particularly attractive if an efficient solar
              technology were available, exploiting inexpensive and abundant UV radiation
              from the sun.  KSE, Inc. has developed novel photocatalyst formulations which
              are over 50 times as active as conventional titania photocatalysts.  The
              efficiency of use of solar radiation in the UV spectrum should be greatly
              increased by such photocatalysts.  In the proposed Phase II program, the
              research and development is to be completed by exploiting these unique
              photocatalyst formulations to capture the potential of solar radiation for the
              destruction of environmentally hazardous gaseous emissions in air.  The
              performance of the photocatalysts to be developed will enable effective
              utilization of solar UV radiation and efficient scale-up to capacities of
              relevance to practical applications.  The Phase II  program will address
              selected volatile organic compounds and toxic air pollutants, focused on
              specific market opportunities.  Solar photocatalytic units will be used to
              control air emissions from soil and groundwater remediation, industrial
              emissions control and indoor air quality maintenance.
