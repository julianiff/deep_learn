Abstract    :
              9704268  McClain      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables
              U.S. scientists  and engineers to conduct three to twenty four months of
              research abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
              research, and the  use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twenty-four-month
              postdoctoral research visit  by Dr. Michael E. McClain of the University of
              Miami to work with Dr.  Carlos A. Llerena at the Universidad Nacional Agraria
              La Molina in Lima,  Peru.  Dr. McClain will initiate a regional analysis of
              hydrological and  biogeochemical processes operating at the terrestrial-aquatic
              interface  of rivers in the eastern Andean cordillera of Peru.  This project
              will  link with another NSF sponsored program, the Carbon in the Amazon River 
              Experiment (CAMREX).  This research indicates that riparian zones are 
              particularly active environments of chemical change and transport.  It  is
              critical that a baseline of chemical and dynamic data be collected  now, for
              comparison to physical basin characteristics before extensive  development of
              the often targeted riparian zones. It is an important  idea to calibrate these
              processes chemically and relate them to broad  catchment properties that can be
              remotely sensed on a large scale and  interpreted within the context of a GIS
              model.  This work will also  provide the nucleus of another research
              initiative, the Andean Amazon  Rivers Analysis and Monitoring (AARAM) Project,
              which is being funded  initially by the Inter American Institute for Global
              Change Researah.  It will link scientists from Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador,
              Colombia, Brazil,  France and the U.S.          ***
