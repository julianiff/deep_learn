Abstract    :
              ***  9704314  Jannson    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              project will develop a new mathematical model, based on the Globally Optimized
              Inverse Method (GOIM), to solve inverse scattering problems in diffusion
              tomography (DT).  Current inverse imaging techniques for highly-scattering
              (turbid) media present undeniable performance limitations.  Mathematical
              shortcomings result in poor global inverse problem convergence in numerous
              applications.  Phase I research demonstrated the feasibility of the GOIM
              algorithm, leading, for the first time, to the globally convergent solution of
              time-dependent 3-D inverse scattering problems (ISPS) in turbid media.    The
              GOIM algorithm (software) and supplementary companion DT device (which consists
              of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware) demonstrate one example of
              commercial application of the inverse scattering problem modeling process.  The
              GOIM concept is adaptable to a number of other commercial and national interest
              applications, including underwater search and rescue; early breast cancer
              diagnosis; detection by Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) of mines/plastic
              explosives; airport security explosives detection; microwave-guided secure
              aircraft landing (minimized "bird strike" risk); mail bomb detection; aging
              aircraft nondestructive evaluation (NDE); earthquake prediction and plasma
              diagnostics.  ***
