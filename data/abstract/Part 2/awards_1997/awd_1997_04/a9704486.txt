Abstract    :
              Klapper  9704486       Motivated by a range of problems and, in particular, the 
              observed iterated, stretching and writhing motions of certain  bacterial
              filaments, the investigator and his collaborator  Michael Tabor at the
              University of Arizona develop new techniques  to study the linear and nonlinear
              stability of the time-dependent  equations governing elastic filament dynamics
              (the Kirchhoff  equations) and, in parallel, computational approaches to
              provide  efficient numerical simulations.  Overall, the investigators  develop
              (i) new analytic techniques to study both the linear and  nonlinear stability
              of elastic filaments, (ii) quantitative  models of writhing instabilities and
              buckling phenomena in  mechanical filaments, (iii) mathematical models of 
              self-assembling bacterial fibers, lipid bi-layer roll-up and  various aspects
              of DNA dynamics, (iv) efficient and flexible  algorithms to simulate the
              described physical and biological  processes and to test the validity of the
              (continuum) models, (v)  discrete elastic models for simulating DNA
              conformations, (vi)  theoretical and numerical models of solar magnetic fields
              with  twist.       A host of practical problems in the biological, physical and
               engineering sciences involve filamentary structures on scales  varying from
              the microscopic to the macroscopic.  These include,  in progression of scales:
              molecular structures including DNA and  lipid tubules and helices, bacterial
              fibers, vorticity filaments,  ropes and cables, braided magnetic flux tubes as
              seen in solar  flares, etc.  The motion of these structures has a crucial
              impact  on their structure and function.  The investigators develop  general
              computational methods to model these filaments and their  uses, including the
              structure and function of DNA, and the  self-assembly of advanced biomaterials.
