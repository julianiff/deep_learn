Abstract    :
              9704345  Duan    The investigator plans to undertake a program of research in
              nonlinear   dynamical systems modeled by integral, ordinary and partial
              differential   equations, arising in fluid dynamics and geophysical flows. The
              research   will focus on the development and application of dynamical systems  
              methods for nonlocal, nonautonomous and nondissipative systems. In the   area
              of nonlocal systems, the investigator proposes to study the effects of  
              nonlocal integral terms on the dynamics of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and   other
              partial differential equations. The proposed work in nonautonomous   systems
              will concentrate on the study of geophysical fluid particle motions.   In the
              area of nondissipative systems, the intended research is focused  on  
              dynamical behavior of the quasi-geostrophic equation and the rotating   shallow
              water equations.    The proposed research deals with complex problems in fluid
              systems,   especially geophysical fluid systems in the oceans and the
              atmosphere.   These problems are motivated by the need for better scientific  
              understanding of the environment or global change. The proposed research   is
              in the general area of differential equations and nonlinear phenomena.
