Abstract    :
              This project plans to investigate how to best use multiple  workstations to
              support modern, highly interactive  applications.  The initial focus is on the
              real-time  rendering of 3D computer generated scenes.  These  applications
              present two key new problems in the use of  multi-computers: they stress
              resources in the machines  (e.g., memory bandwidth and outboard video
              processing  capability) other than just processor speed and network  bandwidth,
              and "good performance" means meeting the short  time deadline by which the next
              frame must be produced  rather than minimizing the duration of a fairly long 
              execution.  The focus of this project is on resource  allocation: how to divide
              system-wide resources among the  components of the problem that must be done so
              that  performance objectives can be met.  The current effort is  aimed at
              solving this problem in an environment where  both the work to be performed and
              the total resources that  are available are relatively constant from frame to
              frame.  A longer term goal of the work is to investigate the use of 
              replication to help assure that deadlines will continue to  be met in more
              dynamic environments.
