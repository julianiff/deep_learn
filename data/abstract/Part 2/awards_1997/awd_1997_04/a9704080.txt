Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will conduct the
              research necessary to design and develop a fully functional non-destructive
              evaluation (NDE)  system based on sensors made with giant magnetoresistance
              (GMR) materials. Phase I research demonstrated that an NDE system based on such
              sensors has vastly superior performance to current NDE techniques.  Using a
              simple, low cost sensor and electronics system, and a proprietary analytical
              technique, it was possible to detect creacks with widths in the 20 microns to
              100 microns range in both aluminum and steel sheets, with signal-to-noise (S/N)
              ratios exceeding 100.  Of even greater importance, tests with an aircraft
              section showed it was possible to detect cracks beneath overlying sheets of
              metal, and under rivet heads at high S/N levels.  These results indicate the
              new technology will represent a major advance in NDE capability, with
              considerable implications for safety, efficiency and cost savings.  As both the
              age and complexity of the nation's transportation and civil structures
              increase, the importance of improved NDE technology is amplified.  Due to the
              lack of appropriate technology, many existing in-service inspection (ISI)
              programs are conducted using visual inspection only.  This high-sensitivity,
              deeply penetrating electromagnetic sensor would provide rapid, cost-effective
              inspection for embedded defects in electrically conductive structures including
              commercial and military aircraft, pressure vessels and pipelines.
