Abstract    :
              The Principal Investigator will perform research in the theory of
              low-dimensional dynamical systems, both smooth and continuous. He will
              concentrate mainly on smooth interval maps. Old problems of density of Axiom A
              maps among r times differentiable ones (for both unimodal and polymodal cases)
              and monotone dependence on a parameter for families of unimodal maps are still
              open. Problems encountered in the theory of real maps in dimension one have
              often their counterparts in the theory of complex maps in dimension one and
              real maps in dimension two. These problems will be also studied. The last part
              of the project is to study general rotation theories, which deal with
              properties of the set of all limits of ergodic averages of a given observable
              (a function from the phase space to some linear space), and combinatorial
              dynamics for tree maps.  For almost every phenomenon from Physics, Chemistry,
              Biology, Medicine, Economy and other sciences, one can make a mathematical
              model that can be regarded as a dynamical system. Sometimes the study of this
              system is extremely difficult, but quite often it can be reduced to the study
              of a much simpler, low dimensional one. This project is devoted to the
              investigation of the properties of this type of systems from the mathematical
              point of view. One of its main goals is to show that typical one-dimensional
              systems are not chaotic.
