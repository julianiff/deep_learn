Abstract    :
               This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project  will develop a unique
              adaptive system identification (SI) method that will enable reconfigurable
              modeling of a complex nonlinear dynamic system. This unique SI method will
              apply to a wide range of operating regimes as well as adapt to slow changes in
              the system being modeled. The SI method will be demonstrated in an adaptive
              critic applied to a difficult real-world problem. It will use an Ontogenetic
              (variable-structure learning) neural network to learn to compensate for the
              difference between a linear and nonlinear system model, producing results
              within a given accuracy of the system's actual performance. Hosted on an
              Multiple Instruction Multiple Data (MIMD) neural network processor, it will be
              computationally very fast. The SI method will be used in adaptive critic
              neurocontrol of an experimental aircraft testbed.   Commercial applications of
              the SI technology under development in this Phase II program include process
              control, financial forecasting, and aircraft flight control.
