Abstract    :
              9704853  Hale    The proposed research is concerned with the generation of
              stable patterns   and synchronization in dynamical systems defined by ordinary
              differential   equations on lattices, partial differential equations and delay
              differential   equations.  The primary interest is in the manner in which
              diffusive   coupling, domain shape or boundary layer affect the dynamics and  
              especially the stability of solutions.  The mathematical tools involve  
              singular perturbation theory, invariant manifolds and bifurcation.    It is of
              paramount importance to understand the processor responsible for   self
              organization, pattern formation and synchronization in various fields   such as
              chemical kinetics, physics, biology, biochemistry and ecology.  It   has been
              known for some time that the nature of diffusive interaction of   individual
              particles (or subsystems) plays a fundamental role.  The main   thrust of this
              project is to attempt to understand these phenomena and their   dependence upon
              the coupling, domain shape and boundary conditions.
