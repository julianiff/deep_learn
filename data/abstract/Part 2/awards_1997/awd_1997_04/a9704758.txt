Abstract    :
              Wahba  9704758    This research involves the development and testing of improved
              methods for estimating functions of many variables, given scattered, noisy,
              heterogeneous direct and indirect observations and prior information of various
              kinds.  Theoretical properties of the methods under development are
              established, and properties of the methods are also studied in test beds with
              simulated data where the `truth' is known.  Efficient numerical algorithms are
              developed which simultaneously implement statistical and computational
              objectives.  Finally the methods are tested on real observational data sets.  A
              unifying theme in all of the research is the exploitation of reproducing kernel
              Hilbert space methods, combined with cross validation, unbiased risk and
              likelihood techniques.    The statistical and numerical methods being developed
              have applicability in several broad areas:  (1) to the analysis of complicated
              medical and demographic data sets for the purpose of risk factor estimation (2)
              to the analysis of very large environmental data sets with the goal of
              extracting and presenting the maximal amount of information available in the
              data set; particular emphasis is on application to climate change (3) to the
              improvement and better understanding of methods used in supervised machine
              learning, and (4) to the analysis of data that is obtained from dynamical
              systems such as the evolving atmosphere or ocean, and the analysis of the
              strengths and weaknesses of mathematical models (such as numerical weather
              prediction or ocean models) that are used in the analysis of such data.
