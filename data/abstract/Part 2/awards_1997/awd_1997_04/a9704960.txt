Abstract    :
              9704960  Zhong  The purpose of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research is  to
              conduct a carefully planned experiment over twelve months  to determine the
              feasibility of cavitation-mediated gene  transfer using ultrasound energy as
              the agent to induce the  transfer.  The method proposed is to use shock wave 
              lithotripsy (SWL), similar to that employed to fracture  kidney stones, to
              activate microbubbles and associated  microjet formation to deliver genetic
              material into target  cells.    The cavitation-mediated technique to be
              investigated is  untested and thus the project is exploratory and high risk. 
              However, the ultimate application of a successful new  technology would be as a
              gene therapy for the treatment of a  variety of diseases, including cancer,
              heart disease, and  degenerative neurological disorders.  Other applications
              for  a successful technology would be found in agriculture.    The effect of
              acoustic cavitation on cells is incompletely  understood and the results from
              this proposed research  project should add to the knowledge base in this area
              even  if the goal to provide a significant advance in gene  transfer is not
              reached.  ***
