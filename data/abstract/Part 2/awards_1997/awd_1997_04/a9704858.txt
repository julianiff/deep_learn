Abstract    :
              9704858  Sommers      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty  four months of
              research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a six-month
              postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Eric N. Sommers to work with Professor
              Hamet  Seydi of the Universite Cheikh Anta Diop in Dakar, under the 
              sponsorship of Professor Serigne Aliou Lo, Senegal.  Support  for this award
              comes from the ANESA Program of the Division  of International Programs.   
              This project involves the study of representation theory of  algebraic objects
              with the affine flag manifold.  Specifically, the PI is interested in studying 
              representations of the affine Weyl group and the double  affine Hecke algebra
              which can be constructed using  geometric techniques involving the affine flag
              manifold.  A  problem that has become integral to his work involves 
              determining the structure of the ring of functions on  nilpotent orbit
              closures. As Dr. Sommers works on his  project, he will forge new relationships
              with mathematicians  in newly developing African universities.  Currently,
              there  are few existing ties among mathematicians in the U.S. and  West Africa.
