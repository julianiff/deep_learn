Abstract    :
              Run-time monitoring provides an effective means for aiding  in the difficult
              tasks of developing, testing and  maintaining distributed computations.
              However, monitoring  activities introduce intrusion, which can potentially 
              alter the behavior of the computation being monitored. This  project is
              investigating techniques to  accommodate  the  effects of monitoring intrusion
              such that a computation will  exhibit the same behavior while being monitored
              as it would  have  exhibited in the absence of monitoring. This project 
              focuses on a  variety of approaches, which encompass  processor scheduling,
              communication protocols, time  maintenance and process synchronization. The
              techniques  developed will be incorporated into a system for the  on-  line
              monitoring of distributed computations, for  experimentation  and evaluation.
              This project is conducted  jointly by Madalene Spezialetti of Trinity College,
              CT and  Rajiv Gupta of University of Pittsburgh under grant CCR  9704350.
