Abstract    :
              9704249  Grebogi    This U.S.-Brazil award will support a research 
              collaboration between groups from the U.S. and  Brazil to work on chaos theory
              applied to  communication.  The U.S. group consists of Drs.  Celso Grebogi,
              Edward Ott and James A. Yorke of  the University of Maryland; the Brazilian
              team  consists of Professors Ricardo L. Viana and  Epaminondas Rosa, Jr., of
              the Federal  University of Parana, Brazil.    These two groups propose to use
              fundamental  properties of nonlinear dynamical systems to  effectively reduce
              in-band noise, added to a  message-bearing signal generated by a chaotic 
              oscillator.  The idea for this filtering  procedure is based on a
              contractiveness  property inherent in chaotic systems.  The  researchers also
              want to study methods to pace  in a precise manner communication pulses 
              resulting from a chaotic signal generator.  This allows transmission of a
              signal containing  a message, and then synchronization is used to  recover the
              signal.  The noise component is  reduced as the chaotic signal propagates 
              forward and backwards along stable and unstable  directions respectively.
