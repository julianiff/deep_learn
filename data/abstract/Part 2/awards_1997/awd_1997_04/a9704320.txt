Abstract    :
              9704320  Getzler    In this project the investigator is to clarify the algebraic
              structures underlying certain recent discoveries in theoretical physics
              including the two-dimensional topological sigma model, topological gravity, and
              Gromov-Witten invariants. In particular, a structure theory for Gromov-Witten
              invariants is to be derived, and Gromov-Witten invariants of higher genus are
              to be computed. In mathematical terms, these invariants relate to various
              enumerative questions in algebraic geometry. For example, Gromov-Witten
              invariants of genus zero appear in the so called mirror symmetry phenomenon.   
              Gromov-Witten invariants originally arose in theoretical physics - they
              describe a coupling of topological gravity with a model of conformal field
              theory. They play an important role in the popular 10-dimensional string model
              of the universe. The string theory model contains six hidden dimensions which
              form a tightly curved space known as Calabi-Yau manifold; Gromov-Witten
              invariants can be used to study various mathematical properties of Calabi-Yau
              manifolds.
