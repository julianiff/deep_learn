Abstract    :
                                      ABSTRACT       The proposal seeks funding to sponsor a
              US delegation to the Third Joint Conference of the Indian Society of Heat and
              Mass Transfer and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.  The conference
              will be held in Kanpur, India from December 29 to 31, 1997.  The conference
              will cover many important subjects relevant to a wide spectrum of engineering
              applications.  The delegation will be involved in delivering keynote lectures,
              organizing panel discussions, and other activities designed to promote
              technical exchanges with attendees from other countries.  The delegation will
              also visit laboratories and universities in India.  The US participation will
              not only allow US researchers to gain first hand knowledge of the critical
              technological issues facing Indian, but stimulate future collaboration on
              research problems that are of mutual interest.
