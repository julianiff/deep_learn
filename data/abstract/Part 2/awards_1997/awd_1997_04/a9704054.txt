Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will demonstrate and
              test a compact, low cost and ultra-narrow bandwidth ( 0.3A) prototype
              holographic grating filter system for solar observing at the UV Ca K line
              (3933A).  This technique developed during Phase I addresses a key requirement
              for narrow bandwidth filters in the UV wavelength because of the difficulties
              in fabricating Lyot and similar interference filters with sufficient spectral
              resolution and optical quality.  During Phase II, suitable recording materials
              will be optimized and used to record volume gratings using holography
              techniques developed during Phase I.  The prototype filter system will be
              tested at Big Bear Solar Observatory or other suitable test sites.  This Phase
              II program will enable sub-Angstrom passband filters to be constructed for
              field testing and provide further technical improvement for commercialization
              of this new technology.  Potential commercial applications of this new
              technology include optic receivers for optical remote sensing; pollutant,
              chemical, metal and mineral detection; solar-blind filters for free-space
              optical communications; high density optical disks and holographic data
              storage; and UV optical projection lithography.
