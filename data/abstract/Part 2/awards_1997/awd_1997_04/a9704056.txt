Abstract    :
              ***  9704056  Cappo   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project
              from Learning in Motion, Inc. proposes to combine cognitive research,
              mathematics theory, and technology in a CD-ROM for primary mathematics. 
              Students early success in mathematics depends upon a solid concept of number. 
              To that end, 'Telling Mathematical Stories' proposes to synthesize four
              important elements:  1) students' intuitive sense of number and multiple
              perspectives on number, i.e., transference of conceptual development from
              number (counting) to weight and volume; 2) sound used to transition from
              acoustic counting to estimating number; 3) multiple tools to encourage
              students' own strategies and a move toward formal mathematizing; and 4)
              experimentation with three-dimensional figures.  Four- cycles of developmental
              research are planned to test the uses of technology in ways not currently seen.
               These include the design, programming, and field testing of:  1) contexts and
              mathematical objects, 3-D, and sound; 2) models and their visual representation
              and interface, and 3) 'look ,and feel', character hosts, and features of the
              'worlds' that will encourage own productions.  The fourth cycle is a field test
              of the integrated program.   The commercial potential for a K-2 Math program
              that combines research on cognition and mathematics with new technology is very
              high.  Currently, most products are drill and practice and relegated to
              counting and calculating with symbols.  The proposed product builds students'
              intuitive sense of number.  It offers multiple model tools, incentives for own
              productions and communicating mathematics, and new uses of sound and 3-D
              animation.  ***
