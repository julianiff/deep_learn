Abstract    :
              This work involves AB intitio simulation studies for semiconductor materials
              processing.  The project will provide the most careful test to date of the
              ability of approximate ab intitio tight binding models to predict the
              processing conditions necessary to produce desired materials properties.  In
              particular, the PI's will study promising new dopants like Ga and In (to
              replace boron as a p-dopant) for semiconductor materials like Si and SiGe. This
              will involve a combination of simulation techniques (molecular statics,
              Molecular Dynamics and Kinetic Monte Carlo) to produce dopant diffusion
              profiles.  The tight binding results for energies of formation and mobility of
              dopant species will be used in a continuum code to leverage the atomic-scale
              results to macroscopic scale properties.  They will also investigate the role
              of stress, say at an SiGe/Si interface, to enhance lateral diffusion in a
              semiconductor device.  The studies here, computer simulation of dopant
              diffusion in Si-rich materials, are crucial to the semiconductor industry
              aiming for sub-100nm device features in the 21st century.  Close collaboration
              with local experimentalists and nearby industries will allow planning and
              execution of complementary experimental studies of these simulations.
