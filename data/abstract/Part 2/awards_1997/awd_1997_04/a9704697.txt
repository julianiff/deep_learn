Abstract    :
              This work is a two-year effort to develop and apply techniques based on formal
              methods to the writing of reliable programs for solving scientific problems on
              high-performance parallel computers.  Previous work has demonstrated the
              practical value of an approach to parallel application development based on (1)
              a formally-specified programming model and a development methodology based on
              semantics-preserving transformations, and (2) abstractions ("archetypes") that
              capture the commonality of classes of programs with similar structure and
              encapsulate the details of the parallel code.  An important aspect of this work
              is that, while it provides a sound theoretical framework for developing and
              reasoning about parallel programs, it need not require application developers
              to develop formal proofs; once a transformation rule is stated and proved, its
              application during program development can be carried out informally.  Previous
              work by the PI has provided a simple and flexible theoretical framework for
              addressing questions of modularity and program composition in parallel
              programs.  Building on these two areas of work, a theoretical framework is
              proposed for reasoning about modularity and composition in parallel programs. 
              The PI will use this framework to develop techniques that will assist
              application developers in writing reliable parallel programs, and will validate
              the usefulness of these techniques by applying them to selected real-world
              applications in computational science and engineering.
