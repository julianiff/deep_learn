Abstract    :
                    9704657  Magde    This project will develop several different approaches
              to integrating geodynamical models with seismic data.  This will allow the
              combination of the strengths of both methods, combining both observational
              seismic data and physical constraints derived from first principles, to
              investigate mantle flow and melt generation beneath mid-ocean ridges.  After
              examining the sensitivity of the transformation between geodynamic predictions
              and seismic parameters, integration of the two techniques will begin with the
              application of a self-consistent forward model to one of three actual data
              sets.  Then an approach to solving the inverse problem using hypothesis-testing
              and/or iterative approaches will be developed.
