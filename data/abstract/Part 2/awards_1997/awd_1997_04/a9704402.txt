Abstract    :
              9704402  Lee    The Pacific Northwest Geometry Seminar (PNGS) is to be held at
              quarterly intervals during the three-year period July 1, 1997 to June 30, 2000.
              The universities participating in the PNGS include Oregon State University,
              University of Oregon, Portland State University, University of Utah, and
              University of Washington. The meetings will be held at the participating
              universities and at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute. The basic
              goals of the PNGS are: to provide opportunities for frequent contacts among
              workers; to keep abreast of recent developments; to enable geometers in the
              Northwest to consult and possibly collaborate with the outside speakers; and to
              provide graduate students and young mathematicians with more exposure to active
              mathematical research than would be possible within the structure of a single
              university.          4
