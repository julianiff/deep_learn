Abstract    :
              9704246  Xiao    This award provides support for the acquisition of a
              state-of-the-  art vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) to be shared by a number
               of complementary and interdisciplinary research programs in the  area of novel
              magnetic materials in the Departments of Physics  and Astronomy and Chemistry
              and Biochemistry at the University of  Delaware. The instrument will provide
              sensitivity at the level of  10-6 emu for DC measurements in fields to 90 kOe
              and temperatures  between 4 K and 1000 K, and sensitivity at the level of about
              10-  7 emu for AC measurements in fields to 100 Oe. Current research  programs
              that will immediately benefit from access to such a  facility include:  l)
              studies of spin polarized transport in  trilayer tunneling junctions, 2) 
              studies of magnetostriction in  nanostructured materials, 3) studies of
              permanent magnets and  small magnetic particles, and 4) studies of the magnetic
               properties of novel ferromagnetic aerogels and magnetic aerogel-  based
              nanocomposites.  %%%  These programs address issues of importance from the
              standpoint  of fundamental materials physics and chemistry, as well as 
              potential device applications. In all these studies, a high  sensitivity,
              variable frequency VSM magnetometer with high and  low field measurement
              capabilities at high and low temperatures  is imperative.    The  VSM proposed
              here represents the most cost effective way  to  accomplish the widest possible
              range of research objectives.  The  University  of  Delaware will provide a 
              50%  cost  sharing.  The  moderate  investment  by NSF will have  a  major 
              impact  on  our  research and benefit a large number of students.  ***
