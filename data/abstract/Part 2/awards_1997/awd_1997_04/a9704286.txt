Abstract    :
              9704286  Hass    This project deals with the geometry of surfaces in three
              dimensional Riemannian manifolds. The focus is on isoperimetric problems and
              the theory of piecewise-linear minimal surfaces. A basic isoperimetric problem
              asks for the smallest area surface enclosing a given pair of volumes. The
              Double Bubble Conjecture asserts that the shape assumed by a compound soap
              bubble enclosing two regions answers this question. This conjecture was
              recently solved by the investigator, in collaboration with R. Schlafly, for two
              equal volumes, but the general case remains an open problem. The
              piecewise-linear theory of surfaces considers surfaces which are glued together
              from flat pieces, much like the surfaces constructed in computer graphics.   
              The problems considered in this project relate to processes in nature which
              determine the shape of soap bubbles, the erosion of boulders, the melting of
              ice, crystal growth, flame propagation, image enhancement and the evaporation
              of puddles. The piecewise-linear theory of surfaces can be applied to the
              classification, enumeration and algorithmic recognition of various surfaces .
