Abstract    :
              This project is finding ways to improve I/O performance by  predicting future
              accesses based on those that have occurred  in the past.  The results can be
              applied all the way from  the disk controller cache to the file system to the
              world  wide web.  It has been demonstrated that accesses to files,  for
              example, are not random. There are patterns that can be  detected and
              exploited.  By exploiting these patterns, files  can be prefetched so that the
              files will be present in the  cache when the request occurs.  Preliminary
              results using  file system traces indicate that significant performance  gains
              will occur.  This project will (1) develop a method  for tracking I/O access
              patterns that is efficient in terms  of both space and time, (2) investigate
              the use of  predictive cache prefetching at three levels: disk  controller,
              file system and the world-wide web, and (3)  implement a predictive cache in
              one or more of these areas.  ***
