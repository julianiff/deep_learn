Abstract    :
              Piatetski-Shapiro  9704997    The objective of the research funded under this
              award is to investigate the lifting of generic cuspidal automorphic
              representations of orthogonal and symplectic groups G to automorphic
              representations of GL(n). The method that the PI and his collaborators will use
              is the following.  First, they will construct L-functions for G x GL(m).  After
              that, they will apply the converse theorem for GL(n).  The L-functions should
              have the proper functional equation and good analytic properties.    This
              proposal is in the part of mathematics known as the Langlands program.  The
              Langlands program is part of Number Theory. Number Theory is the study of the 
              properties of the whole numbers and is the oldest branch of mathematics.  From
              the beginning problems in number theory have furnished a driving force in
              creating new mathematics in other diverse parts of the discipline.  The
              Langland's program is a general philosophy that connects number theory with
              calculus; it embodies the modern approach to the study of whole numbers. 
              Modern Number Theory is very technical and deep, but it has had astonishing
              applications in areas like theoretical computer science and coding theory.
