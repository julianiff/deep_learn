Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to extend the Phase
              I results to optimize a unique temperature gradient vacuum sublimation process
              which will significantly reduce the cost of fullerene purification.  Phase I
              demonstrated that high purity C60 (99.8%) can be produced by the solvent-free
              process.  The Phase II program will optimize the purification process by
              investigating a large number of processing variables such as fullerene
              mean-free path, unconverted re-distributed fullerenes, temperature
              distribution, geometric dimension, etc.  Two different temperature gradient
              vacuum sublimation systems, i.e., direct sublimation and sublimation through a
              porous bed, will be designed and utilized in the investigations.  It is
              anticipated that the Phase II program will successfully develop a solvent-free
              purification process to produce pure C60 at 2 to 10 % of the current cost. 
              Fullerenes are materials that have been demonstrated to have near-term
              applications in superconductors, nonlinear optics, polymers, gas storage for
              fuel and batteries, diamond nucleation and synthesis, low porosity pure carbon
              composites and fibers, and three-dimensional organic synthesis.
