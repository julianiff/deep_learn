Abstract    :
              9704482  Escobar    This project lies in the area of Riemannian geometry. More
              specifically, the investigator is to study the total mean curvature plus the
              total scalar curvature functional, the Stekloff problem, isoperimetric
              inequality, and harmonic maps between noncompact manifolds. Also, the
              investigator has been active in developing collaborative research programs
              between the United States and Colombia, organizing various conferences and
              workshops.    Riemannian manifolds are higher dimensional generalizations of
              curved surfaces. Such manifolds have well-known applications in theoretical
              physics. A Riemannian manifold possesses a notion of distance, or a metric. And
              by taking the derivative of the metric one can measure its curvature. Harmonic
              maps and harmonic functions constitute an important class of mappings between
              Riemannian manifolds. Harmonic maps have a variety of applications, e.g., they
              can be used to describe the temperature distribution on a homogeneous lamina.
