Abstract    :
              9704208  Ehrman      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty  four months of
              research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Sheryl H. Ehrman to work with Dr. Urs 
              Baltensperger at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen,  Switzerland. The
              Institute has strong programs in glacier  and ice core research.    This
              project will study snow crystals using a scanning  electron microscope coupled
              with energy dispersive  spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) and secondary ion mass
              spectrometry  (SIMS) to gather information on how concentrations of  chemical
              species in ice relate to concentrations of chemical  species in the atmosphere.
               By studying ice cores, they can  find evidence of past volcanic eruptions,
              nuclear weapons  tests, and past global heating/cooling cycles.    The selected
              site is ideal for this research, not only  because of its geography, but
              because the Monte Rosa glacier  which will be studied, is a cold glacier, the
              temperature of  which never rises above zero, thus avoiding melting which  can
              blur the time resolution in the ice core samples.  ***
