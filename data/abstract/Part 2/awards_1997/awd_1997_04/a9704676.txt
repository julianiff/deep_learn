Abstract    :
                      9704676  Farquhar    The P.I. will study oxygen isotopes in carbonate
              minerals present in the SNC (Shergotite, Nakhlite, Chassigny) meteorites.  This
              research will use the proportions of the three stable isotopes of oxygen to
              study the nature of atmosphere-regolith interactions on Mars.  It will address
              current questions about the amount of oxygen isotope exchange that these
              meteorites have had with the terrestrial reservoir.  It will be used to provide
              evidence that will support one of two models for the formation of the Martian
              atmosphere.  It will be used to provide indirect evidence for the timing and
              duration of hydrothermal events that contributed to the growth of SNC
              carbonates.  Finally, this research will refine three isotope measurements of
              carbonate oxygen so that sample size can be reduced and this tool can be
              extended to other questions.
