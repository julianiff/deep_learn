Abstract    :
              9704579  Garg    Factors affecting the electric field induced modulated phase in
               a nematic liquid crystal will be systematically probed by: (I)  studying the
              modulated phase at different applied electric  field frequencies; (2)
              determining electric and magnetic field  values of stability for the different
              wave vectors; (3)  detecting flow directions in the system; (4) measuring 
              electrical conductivities of the samples as a function of  frequencies; (5)
              exploring cell geometries to understand the  influence of boundary conditions
              at the electrodes and the  electric field configuration on the homogenious
              Freedericksz  and periodic transitions.  A more accurate theoretical model 
              will be developed to describe the modulated phase.  %%%  The study of
              reorientational phenomena under applied electric  fields in a confined geometry
              and the dependence of modulation  between phases as a function of field
              frequency are important  physical phenomena that determine the overall
              properties of new  liquid crystal systems that are playing an increasingly
              important  role in applications areas that include, for example, new  materials
              for infrared and microwave liquid crystal modulators,  and fast-switching
              liquid crystal displays.  ***
