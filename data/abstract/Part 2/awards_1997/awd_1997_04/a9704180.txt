Mucus elimination is a major problem faced by patients with
              lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis.   Development of effective therapies and
              assist devices for enhancing mucus removal is greatly hindered by the lack of a
              reliable non-invasive method of measuring mucus clearance in the airways. 
              Currently, drug doses, assist devices, and physical therapy strategies cannot
              be optimized for a particular patient due to the lack of this capability.  The
              situation is analogous to trying to treat hypertension without periodic blood
              pressure measurements.  A non-invasive transcutaneous (through the skin) laser
              doppler method is proposed where a low power laser beam is directed into the
              airway in the neck region to measure the velocity of the moving mucus layer. 
              Signal processing techniques will be developed to discriminate mucus layer
              reflections from those from skin and tissue. Initial evaluation will be made
              using a mechanical model of mucus flow and tissue perfusion.
