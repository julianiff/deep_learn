Abstract    :
              9704415  King  The Pi will establish a new research program in the area of
              large-area electronics, to further the understanding and advance the technology
              of thin films transistor (TFT) devices.  During this study, a new, dedicated
              test capability for characterization and reliability testing of TFTs will be
              established.  Particularly, the effects of hydrogen and deuterium plasma
              treatments on the performance and reliability of poly-Si TFTs will be directly
              compared to assess the benefits of the latter plasma treatment for defect
              passivation.  ***
