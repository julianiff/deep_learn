Abstract    :
              ***  9704039  Sobenin    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              project is for the construction/testing of an accelerating-focusing Rectangular
              Cavity Biperiodic Structure (RCBS) to be used in an electron Race Track
              Microtron (RTM).  Circular cross section cavities produce weak radial focusing
              of relativistic electrons.  In rectangular cross section cavities, the balance
              between transverse electric and magnetic forces acting on these electrons is
              changed so that there is substantially increased focusing in one transverse
              direction and weak defocusing in the other.  In Phase I the rectangular cavity
              focusing strengths were further increased by replacing circular beam holes with
              rectangular beam slots.  Methods were also developed to optimize these
              rectangular accelerating-focusing structures by varying both the cavity and
              beam aperture dimensions, thus allowing a beam to be tailored to a specific
              application.  Introducing a RCBS into an RTM allowed the so-called 1st orbit
              problem to be elegantly solved and assisted in obtaining appropriate beam
              optics, while the impact of space charge effects were few and negligible. 
              Thus, in Phase II the RCBS design parameters will be optimized for a compact 70
              MeV prototype RTM.  This structure will be manufactured, tuned, and its
              electrodynamic characteristics measured and then it will be subjected it to a
              full range of field tests.      Commercial applications of RCBS in addition to
              those in  RTMS, include high-power Continuous Wave Electron Linacs (CWEL), high
              charge-per-bunch Free Electron Laser (FEL) drivers, and electron-positron
              linear colliders.
