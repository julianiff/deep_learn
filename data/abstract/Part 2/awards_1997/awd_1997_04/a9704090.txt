Abstract    :
                ***  Lee  9704090     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              will develop neuro-dynamic programming (NDP) methods to address a commercially
              important complex stochastic control problem--that of supply-chain management.
              The Phase I research successfully established that NDP algorithms could lead to
              significant savings over well-accepted heuristics on a class of supply chains
              that was used as a testbed. This Phase II program will further develop and
              streamline the NDP methodology. Furthermore, algorithms will be generalized so
              that they apply to a very broad class of realistic supply chains, including
              manufacturing and distribution networks. Performance on these new problems will
              be assessed through extensive experimentation and comparison with current
              state-of-the-art heuristics. Once the NDP methodology is fully developed,
              licensing arrangements will be sought to integrate NDP-based optimization
              modules into the many supply-chain management products currently in widespread
              use.   An improved approach for addressing the logistics of supply-chain
              management will be of great commercial interest to companies across all
              industries. Integration of the technology into existing commercial supply-chain
              management softuare products widely used in manufacturing can enhance the
              efficiency of numerous U.S. corporations. Furthermore, the general NDP methods
              developed in this research have a much broader potential scope, in that they
              can be used to address other complex stochastic control problems that arise in
              many areas of national importance, including process control, queuing and
              scheduling, and data network optimization.  ***
