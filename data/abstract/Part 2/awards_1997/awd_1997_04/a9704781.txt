Abstract    :
              9704781  Von Damm         This grant provides funds for a RIDGE/Nordic
              Volcanological  Institute (Iceland) Summer school to be held during the summer
              of  1997 in Iceland. The focus of the school will be active processes.  The
              school will follow the format of the summer schools run during  the past two
              summers for graduate students and post-docs from  Scandinavia and Europe. It
              will be organized around a combination  of formal lectures, poster sessions,
              informal discussions and field  trips. Iceland provides a unique venue as a
              subaerial portion of  the mid-ocean ridge system, and the school will
              specialfically  address how the Iceland experience can be integrated into
              seafloor  monitoring efforts.
