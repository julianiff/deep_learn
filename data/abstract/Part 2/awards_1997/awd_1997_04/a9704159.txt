Abstract    :
              9704159  Kavanagh    This award provides partial support for a Triple Axis X-ray
               Diffractometer in the Department of Electrical and Computer  Engineering (ECE)
              at the University of California San Diego  (UCSD).  The proposed equipment will
              replace and strengthen  an existing facility at UCSD consisting of a Double
              Axis X  ray Diffractometer.  The new facility, like the old, will be  operated
              jointly by faculty members in the ECE department  supporting material and
              device research programs from  departments campus wide.  ***
