Abstract    :
              9704613  Novikov    This project lies in the interface of analysis,
              topology/geometry, and applied mathematics. Hamiltonian theory of
              hydrodynamical systems, and exactly solvable Schrodinger operators are to be
              investigated. The techniques to be used include solitons, asymptotic methods in
              nonlinear wave theory, Kac-Moody type Lie algebras, topological quantum field
              theories, and nonstandard symmetry for the spectral theory of low-dimensional
              Schrodinger operators.    Hamiltonian systems are systems composed of many
              particles moving without friction and are governed by a complicated system of
              differential equations. Hamiltonian theory simplifies these differential
              equations by first looking at the total energy of the system and often reveals
              hidden symmetries in the system. Dynamical systems model various phenomena in
              nature such as water waves and weather systems.
