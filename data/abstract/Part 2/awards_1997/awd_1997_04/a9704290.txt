Abstract    :
              9704290  Vallance      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty -  four months of
              research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions.    This award will support a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. James W. Vallance to work with Dr. Stuart
              B.  Savage at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.    Dr. Vallance will be
              studying the behavior of pyroclastic  flows focusing on simulation and
              modelling.  Pyroclastic  flows are hot, dry flows of particles and gas with a
              high  concentration of particles. This project will encompass all  parts of a
              flow, including a hot, non- to partly fluidized,  dense, basal avalanche having
              a concentration of particles  similar to that of the original deposit, an
              overriding  turbulent ash cloud surge with a very low particle  concentration,
              and a convecting ash cloud.  The study  focuses, however, on the granular basal
              avalanche.  These flows destroy property and kill hundreds of people  yearly. 
              This project will combine the talents of a field  oriented geologist,
              experienced in volcanic hazard  assessment and mechanics, with a professor of
              civil  engineering, internationally respected in grain-flow  mechanics and
              modelling, at McGill.  ***
