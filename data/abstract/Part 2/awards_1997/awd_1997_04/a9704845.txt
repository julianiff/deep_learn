Abstract    :
              Some counting problems admit extra symmetries, such as invariance under actions
              of a semisimple Lie group. These problems can sometimes be solved by techniques
              involving ergodic theory. We are working on examples from number theory,
              geometry and dynamics.  The phenomenon of symmetry is central to certain
              counting problems. Typically these problems cannot be solved unless all of the
              hidden symmetry is exploited.  The proposed methods consist of studying the
              interplay between the symmetric patterns and the chaotic phemomena of ergodic
              theory.
