Abstract    :
              9704237  Lesher    This award provides support to acquire equipment for the 
              fabrication of large volume parts of materials with  nanocrystalline
              microstructure for mechanical testing and  thermodynamic studies.  The backbone
              of this new fabrication  system will be the cubic-anvil apparatus.  The
              multianvil payload  isdriven by a 1000-ton uniaxial hydraulic press equipped
              with  automated pressure and temperature control for tailored  processing. 
              This equipment is unique in combining ultrahigh  pressure (up to 5 Gpa) and
              large sample capacity (5-10 cc) of the  payload with resistance and pulsing
              direct current heating  adapted from current plasma activated sintering
              systems.  The  recovery of large nanocrystalline samples using this apparatus 
              offers new research opportunities to examine sintering behavior,  to determine
              mechanical properties, and to characterize  thermodynamic properties of a wide
              range of nanocrystalline  ceramic and metallic materials.  %%%  This project
              reflects a multidisciplinary collaboration on the UC  Davis campus involving
              faculty, researchers and students in  materials science, chemistry, and
              geology.  This new facility  will greatly enhance research programs currently
              supported by NSF  to characterize nanocrystalline ceramics (Al2O3, AlN, Si3N4,
              SiC)  and metals (W, Fe, Ni), and various nanocomposites (Al2O3-Sic, 
              Al2O3-ZrO2, Al2O3-diamond, Si3N4-SiC, Ni-Al2O3).  New  investigations requiring
              the large sample volume capabilities of  the cubic-anvil apparatus will include
              tensile strength and  fracture toughness measurements, and enthalpy
              determinations by  solution and high temperature calorimetry.  We anticipate
              the  results of these studies will contribute fundamentally to our 
              understanding of nanocrystalline structures, mechanical and  thermodynamic
              properties, as well as processing parameters  essential to the eventual
              development of large-scale fabrication  of durable ceramic composites and
              monoliths for technological  applications  ***
