Abstract    :
              Baker/Abstract  9704156         The PI plans to use a single crystal evolution
              model developed  in collaboration with Dr. J. Nelson to investigate the vapor
              growth  and sublimation of individual ice crystals in realistic  atmospheres. 
              This model produces steady state growth shapes and  predicts the conditions
              under which the crystals are hollow.  The  model will be run with SO2 as well
              as water vapor in the particle  environment to study the simultaneous takeup of
              the two gases.  The  chemical composition of the ensuing particles will be
              examined as  a function of assumed ice nucleus content as well as environmental
               gas concentrations, temperature and pressure.         After the single study
              is completed, the results will be used  in a Lagrangian parcel study of the
              evolving characteristics (size  and chemical composition distributions) of ice
              particle populations  in realistic atmospheres          This work will be
              carried out in informal collaboration with  Dr. Nelson (U. Arizona), with Dr.
              T. Peter and his colleagues at  the MPI fur Chemie in Mainz, who are studying
              takeup of SO2 on  single crystals in the laboratory, and with Dr. Noone and his
               collaborators rom Stockholm University, who will be collecting in  situ data
              on microphysical evolution in cirrus clouds.         These studies will be
              useful in providing a self-consistent  picture of cirrus particles, and will
              add physical realism to the  models now used, which are based largely on
              spherical particle  analogues and do not incorporate modern ideas on the
              crystal/vapor  interface.  The final stage of the study will be the comparison
              of  the new models with the parameterizations used in GCM's to assess  the
              usefulness of the parameterizations.
