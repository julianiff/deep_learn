Abstract    :
              This project has three research topics from the field of iterative solution
              methods for nonsymmetric linear systems of equations arising in the
              discretization  of second-order PDEs.  Of these, two focus on time-harmonic
              wave propagation and one on convection-diffusion problems.  The first topic
              consists in extending algorithms for the solution of time-harmonic scattering
              problems for the Helmholtz equation, from 2D to 3D.  Based on  a discretization
              which uses an exact radiation condition - and hence permits small computational
              domains relative to the scatterer - these algorithms use an imbedding technique
              combined with a fast Helmhotz solver, resulting in fast and well-parallelizable
              algorithms for an application which is becoming increasingly important.  The
              second topic is an investigation of recent algebraic multilevel techniques
              applied to exterior Helmholtz problems.  These techniques could lead to an
              algorithm of optimal complexity for solving this type of problem.  Finally, the
              third topic involves investigating effects of stabilization techniques for
              discretization of convection-diffusion problems on iterative solution of
              discrete problems.
