Abstract    :
              9704236  Dickinson  The PI proposes to develop an integrated research and 
              educational plan in bioengineering.  The research component  involves a study
              of the mechanism of bacterial adhesion to  surfaces, a key early step in the
              development of infections  on implant devices.  Non-specific (colloidal-type)
              and  receptor-mediated interactions of Staphylococcus aureus to  surfaces will
              be measured using total internal reflection  microscopy and three dimensional
              laser optical trapping.  The forces and attachment kinetics will be used to
              develop a  mechanistic mathematical model for bacterial attachment.  The
              ambitimus educational plan involves participation in the  development of a
              graduate, multi-disciplinary degree program  in biomedical engineering and an
              undergraduate degree  program in biochemical engineering.  The PI will
              participate  by developing new class and laboratory courses in both  areas.
