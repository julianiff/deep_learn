Abstract    :
                      1            9704964  Kaner  Highly exothermic chemical exchange
              (metathesis) reactions in the  solid-state can be designed to lead rapidly to
              materials that are  otherwise  difficult  to  form.  This project  will 
              explore  the  application  of pressure to open a new parameter  space  for  the
               synthesis  of  high  pressure  phases  which  inaccessible  under  ambient 
              conditions.   This approach to  solid  state  metathesis  reactions  will
              provide a new synthetic method for  forming  high  quality  solid  solutions,
              and for controlling crystallite  size,  and  the important questions explored
              in this research will  have  advance considerably the area of chemical
              processing.  %%%  The  classes  of materials to be investigated are of
              considerable  potential technological importance and include crystal  size  and
               photoluminescence  studies on gallium nitride,  and  cubic  boron  nitride, 
              the  second  hardest  materials  known  after  diamond.  Methods for forming
              diamond and substituted carbon materials will  also be tested.  ***
