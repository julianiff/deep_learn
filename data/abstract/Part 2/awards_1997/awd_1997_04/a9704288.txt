Abstract    :
              9704288  Switzer    This project to purchase a field-emission scanning electron 
              microscope with energy dispersive light-element x-ray  analysis (EDX) and
              electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD)  capabilities will enable important
              materials research work  to be carried out.  The SEM will be housed in the
              Graduate  Center for Materials Research at the University of Missouri-  Rolla. 
              The Center is designated as a campus resource for  major equipment. The
              proposed instrument will be used to  probe the nanostructure, composition,
              crystallographic  orientation, and phase composition of electrodeposited 
              compositional and defect-chemistry superlattices of  conducting metal oxides,
              metal/semiconductor nanocomposites,  nanophase relaxor ferroelectrics and
              piezoelectric ceramics,  nanostructured shape memory alloys, environmentally 
              compliant polymer coatings, glass fiber reinforced  composites, nucleation and
              crystallation of glass, and  magnetic films deposited by plasma-enhanced
              chemical vapor  deposition.  The new instrument is optimized to operate at  low
              beam voltages and currents, and is therefore ideal for  studying materials like
              polymers which are damaged in  conventional filament-based scanning electron
              microscopes.  %%%  The instrumentation is essential for work on nanoscale 
              epitaxial architectures, work on electroceramic materials,  work on glass
              sphere's for the treatment of liver cancer and  encapsulation of nuclear waste
              in glass, and  work on a  corrosion protection material to be a replacement for
              chrome  on aluminum and in work on nanomaterials in metallurgy.  ***
