Abstract    :
              9704373  Sutherland  Following the recent discovery of several exact solutions
              of  important low dimensional models, for example models with  long range
              interactions in a lattice, calculations of ground  state correlations including
              time-dependent behavior and the  use of conformal symmetry to calculate the
              correlations, the  PI is planning to  study the application of these ideas to 
              real systems and develop formalism for the calculation of  experimental
              observables and compare them to the  experiments.  The specific experiments to
              be considered in  light of specific theoretical models are: (1) the optical 
              properties of conducting polymers and the sinh-cosh model  (2) The
              Hubbard-Peierls model of dimerized chains and  hyperbolic exchange models and
              finally (3) the Coulomb gap,  its effect on the transport properties of
              electrons and its  possible origins in the calculation of ground state 
              correlations.  %%%  The PI is well known for several exact solutions to model 
              problems in low dimensional systems.  Here he is planning to  apply the insight
              he has gained form these exact solutions  by calculating experimental
              observables in some charge  transfer compounds and conducting polymers.  He is
              planning  to do this by a careful reconsideration of the missing  details in
              the models which he has already solved.  He is  hoping for a close
              collaboration with several  experimentalists and also theorists to indicate the
              possible  opportunities and areas of improvement.  ***
