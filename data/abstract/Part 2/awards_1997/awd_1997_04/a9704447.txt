Abstract    :
              Clusters of workstations are increasingly being used as a  platform for parallel
              computing. Parallel applications  executing on workstation clusters must be
              fault-tolerant in  order to survive network and workstation failures, and must 
              have the ability to withdraw from a workstation on detecting  owner activity. 
              Malleable parallel applications also have  the ability to dynamically shrink or
              expand their degree of  parallelism. Preliminary research indicates that this 
              property leads to significant performance advantages in  cluster environments
              because of the transient nature of the  underlying resources. The proposed
              research involves the  design and implementation of an execution environment
              that  supports malleable parallel applications on clusters of  workstations.
              Domain-specific reconfiguration mechanisms  that enable changes in the degree
              of parallelism of a  program will be designed and implemented for three 
              important classes of parallel applications, specifically  loosely synchronous
              structured grid-oriented applications,  loosely synchronous unstructured
              grid-oriented applications,  and a class of asynchronous irregular applications
              from the  domain of operations research.  These mechanisms will be  integrated
              into specialized run-time libraries that support  these applications. Finally,
              algorithms and techniques for  minimizing the overhead of dynamic
              reconfiguration will be  developed.
