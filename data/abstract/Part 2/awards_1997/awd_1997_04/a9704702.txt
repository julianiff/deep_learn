              Planning for Hybrid Systems (This award supports CES associate Milos Zefran)   
              Systems that are governed by discrete and continuous processes are known as
              "hybrid" systems.  Such systems are described by continuous dynamical equations
              whose structure and/or inputs change in accordance with the state transitions
              of a finite automaton.  Due to the widespread  use of computers   to control
              physical devices, hybrid systems abound.  Successful hybrid systems must
              robustly combine high-level planning (planning of the finite automaton
              transitions) with low-level control (evolution of the dynamic equations).   
              While the planning and control problems have been addressed separately by
              computer scientists and control theorists, the interaction of the discrete and
              continuous worlds is largely left to the ingenuity of engineers.  As the
              complexity of the computer controlled physical systems grows, such methods
              break down and there is a need for rigorous theory to design, build, and
              evaluate hybrid systems.  The proposed research will investigate how to unify
              discrete and continuous models to help build a foundation for hybrid system
              engineering.  Prior work on planning for  a subclass of hybrid systems will be
              extended in two directions.  First,  an optimal control framework will be
              extended to a game-theoretic framework so as to take uncertainty into account.
              Second, the hybrid control problem will be explored for systems whose dynamics
              exhibit  some simplifying properties, such as Lie group symmetries.
