Abstract    :
              9704618  Zeng      The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables 
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty  four months of
              research abroad. The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a three-month
              postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Yanni Zeng to work with Dr. Heinrich 
              Freistuhler at the Institut fur Mathematik in Aachen,  Germany.  An additional
              three months will be supported by  the University of Alabama at Birmingham.   
              Dr. Zeng will study shock wave stability.  She will  investigate a system which
              is a typical example of a broad  class of nonlinear partial differential
              equations that  together with the equation of state, determine the plane  waves
              of a conducting fluid in the presence of a magnetic  field. She will study the
              large time behavior of the  solution.  Dr. Freistuhler has expertise in the
              field of non-  strictly hyperbolic systems and Dr. Zeng's expertise is on 
              hyperbolic-parabolic systems.  Together they hope to solve  the shock wave
              stability for magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)  equations and similar systems from
              physics, and achieve  their goal of qualitative analysis for such systems. ***
