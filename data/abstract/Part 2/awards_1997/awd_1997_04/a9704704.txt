Abstract    :
                97-04704  Gibson, Garth A  Carnegie Mellon University    Postdoc:  Exposing
              Input/Output Parallelism by Relaxing Request Ordering     (CES Associateship
              for Tara Madhyastha)  Input/output is a critical performance limitation for
              many parallel scientific applications. One important lesson learned from
              application performance analysis is that it is important to expose and utilize
              all available input/output concurrency.  A traditional sequential file model
              does not allow applications to express the parallel nature of their resource
              demands, or to exploit the full parallel file system bandwidth.   This research
              proposes new application-level input/output interfaces to express parallelism
              that cannot be automatically detected.  Interfaces to access parallel files
              with partially ordered or unordered records will be created and evaluated on a
              variety of parallel platforms, quantifying the performance improvements
              achieved at various levels within the file system. The demonstrated benefits of
              application supplies access pattern information; while file system policy
              control drive attempts to standardize system and application-level programming
              interfaces.   However, the division between system and application-level file
              system functionality is poorly understood.  This research helps to define this
              boundary for a large and important class of parallel scientific applications.
