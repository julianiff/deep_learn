Abstract    :
              9704489  Kleinbock    This project deals with algebraic dynamical systems and
              their applications to number theory. Many problems concerning diophantine
              approximations can be cast in terms of the behavior of the orbits of a suitable
              homogeneous flow. Non-generic orbits such as those avoiding a given finite set
              or ones that remain bounded are of particular interest. The investigator is to
              continue his work on escapable sets and metric properties of matrices arising
              in diophantine approximations.    Dynamical systems in the present context deal
              with how points in a system move  over time, given a set of differential
              equations (or laws of nature) governing the system. It turns out that various
              numerical approximations used in the theory of integer equations can be better
              calculated once they are phrased in dynamical systems language.
