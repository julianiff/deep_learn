Abstract    :
              ***  9704036  Downing   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              from 3D Technology Laboratories will produce the final detailed system design
              and materials optimization that are necessary to construct a laser diode
              driven, solid-state, three-dimensional display.  A fully functional device will
              be integrated, tested, evaluated, and optimized within the duration of this
              proposal and, when complete, will be capable of displaying true 3D data sets
              from a variety of input sources.  The device will offer real time capabilities,
               and it will be able to display both static and dynamic images.  Objects drawn
              in the display will be accessible to viewers through all sides of the display,
              with no restricted or obstructed regions and with no need for special glasses
              or head gear.   Potential commercial applications for this technology include
              medical imaging, computer-aided design and manufacturing, scientific
              visualization, air traffic control, geological and oceanic exploration,
              molecular modeling and computational chemistry, as well as education,
              entertainment, and general consumer electronics.  ***
