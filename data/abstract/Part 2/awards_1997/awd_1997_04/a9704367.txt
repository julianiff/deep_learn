Abstract    :
              9704367  Hardt    This project lies in the general area of geometric variational
              calculus, dealing with the behavior of singularities and various energy
              critical objects. Some specific investigations focus on n-harmonic maps and
              biharmonic maps, regularity theory for minimal surfaces with boundary, and
              isoperimetric and sobolev inequalities in varieties.    Geoemtric variational
              calculus involves questions about various extremal and/or optimal objects
              amongst families of objects satisfying a common set of constraints. Area and
              energy minimizing surfaces are among the objects studied in this theory. These
              surfaces have applications in materials science as they can be used to model
              condensed matter.
