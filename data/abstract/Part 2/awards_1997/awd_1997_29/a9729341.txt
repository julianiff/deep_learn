Abstract    :
                       An automated DNA sequencer will be purchased for  studies in
              systematics, evolutionary biology and  environmental studies at Louisiana State
              University. Among  the projects to be explored are: characterization the algal-
               invertebrate mats on off-shore platforms; the elucidation of  the
              relationships of primary clades of green algae to land  plans; cospeciation in
              a host-parasite assemblage; modes of  reproduction in marine invertebrates; and
              the interpretation  of historical patterns in ecology, behavior, and geographic
               distribution through construction of bird and mammal  phylogenies via
              comparative molecular methods.
