Abstract    :
                   This research project aims to shed some light on the basic  architecture
              and processes responsible for producing sentences.  More specifically, it is
              concerned with the processes involved in  the construction of a syntactic frame
              for a to-be-uttered sentence.  The three issues the project deals with are: (i)
              the input that the  language production system receives from the conceptual
              system;  (ii) the mechanisms responsible for building a syntactic structure 
              for a sentence; and (iii) the possibility to find feedback from the  processes
              responsible to build a phonological frame for the  sentence to the processes
              responsible for its syntactic encoding.  In a series of 19 experiments,
              speakers of Italian, French and  Spanish are required to produce completions
              for sentential  preambles or to rephrase sentences. The dependent variables in 
              these experiments are the proportions of agreement errors, between  the subject
              and the verb, the object and the verb (e.g., "The time  for fun and games are
              over"), in Italian, French and Spanish; or  the proportions of
              subject-predicate gender agreement errors in  Italian and French. The rationale
              for using agreement to address  the issues presented above is the fact that
              agreement can be  considered as a tool of the language system for expressing 
              conceptual relations through syntactic relations, that are then  translated
              into morpho-phonological regularities in the language.       The pursuit of
              these three interrelated research lines in a  period of three years will allow
              us to foster our understanding  of the processes involved in transforming a
              message into a  syntactically well-formed sentence, in real time. The Romance 
              languages targeted in the project provide not only a way to test  a number of
              hypotheses, but they also provide us with a tool to  explore phenomena that
              until now have not been addressed in the  psycholinguistic literature, such as
              the computation of gender  agreement, and object-participle agreement during
              production.
