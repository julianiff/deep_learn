Abstract    :
              9729129  NISENBAUM     A fundamental question in developmental neurobiology is
              how axons from specific neurons in one region of the brain form precise
              connections with target neurons in another region of the brain.  Experiments
              examining the development of target specificity have revealed two types of
              mechanisms that contribute to the wiring of neural connections.  The first type
              of mechanism, which occurs during the embryonic and early postnatal period,
              relies on guidance molecules to direct axonal projections along a path to their
              correct target region.  The second type of mechanism, which takes place later
              in development, involves activity-dependent events to refine the precise
              pattern of neuronal connections.  Although a great deal is known regarding the
              development of neuronal circuits within the brain, the development of the
              connections between the cerebral cortex and the basal ganglia have been largely
              ignored.  The basal ganglia play a critical role in the control of movement and
              cognitive behaviors.  Thus, the formation of precisely patterned connections
              from the cortex to the primary input structure of the basal ganglia, the
              striatum, is necessary for the proper functioning of the motor system.  The
              goal of Dr. Nisenbaum's research is to determine when crucial target selection
              and pattern formation decisions are made during the course of corticostriatal
              development.  The results from these studies will provide a better
              understanding of the types of mechanisms that are responsible for the precision
              of corticostriatal connectivity, and also provide insight into how motor
              systems become organized during development.
