Abstract    :
              A laser scanning confocal imaging microscope will be  purchased for fixed and
              live fluorescent analysis and for  high resolution three dimensional imaging.
              Among the  problems to be explored are: cytokinesis, synaptogenesis and 
              synaptic remodeling in the nematode C. elegans, epithelial  morphogenesis in C.
              elegans epidermis, and chromatin  remodeling factors and the molecular
              mechanisms of cell fate  in Drosophila development.
