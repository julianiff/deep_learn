Abstract    :
              
This research project addresses fundamental processes associated with the
              deformation and failure of granular materials; specifically strain
              localization, and the role that it plays in earthquake-induced ground failures.
              Experimental observations suggest that strain localization is an integral part
              of the ground failure mechanism, even in soil that has liquefied as result of
              strong ground shaking. The goal is to quantify this, based on existing
              experimental data, in order to develop a micromechanically-based unified
              computational constitutive model to analyze and quantify experimental
              observations. The model has broad application to many problems in granular
              materials, in particular to ground failure in earthquakes.

The program
              involves the creation of a science-based computational model through the
              following steps:

1. Starting with the micro-scale and grain-to-grain
              interaction, to
explicitly relate fabric and its evolution to macroscopic
              backstress and its evolution.

2. Based on grain-to-grain contact forces and
              the distribution density function of the contact normals (which characterizes
              the fabric), obtain explicit expressions for the resistance to the dilatant
              shearing observed and quantitatively documented in photoelasic
              experiments.

3. Based on the dilatant sliding model at the meso-scale,
              develop explicit constitutive relations involving just a few well-defined
              constitutive parameters.

4. Using an existing extensive experimental
              database, relate the constitutive parameters to test data.

5. Develop
              computational algorithms based on the plastic predictor-elastic corrector
              concept.

6. Using the constitutive algorithm in DYNA3D, quantify
              experimental results on shearbanding. This also will verify the effectiveness
              of the model for application to other problems.
