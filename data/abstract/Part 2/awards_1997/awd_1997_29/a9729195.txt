Abstract    :
              IBN-9729195  PI:  Klimley  There is controversy over how animals might sense
              features of the earth's magnetic field for information useful in homing and
              migration behavior.  Most work has focused on a magnetic compass sense, with as
              yet unproven sensory mechanisms.  It has been known for decades that sharks and
              rays and many bony fish have specialized sensory organs for detecting weakly
              electric fields in the environment, and similarly noted that this sensitivity
              could be used for magnetoreception by detecting the small electrical signal
              induced by magnetic fields as the animal swims through them.  This project
              builds on some prior behavioral work with sharks in the open ocean, and
              proposes an alternative to the usual hypothesis of detecting the
              compass-oriented vector of earth's magnetic field.  Instead, it may be that
              sharks and rays detect the small changes in local magnetic topography of the
              bottom over which they swim and use it as a guiding map.  This Small Grant for
              Exploratory Research tests this novel hypothesis by a behavioral experiment
              under controlled laboratory conditions, using a simple Y-maze and artificial
              magnetic fields to see whether bat rays can be trained to show detection of
              local magnetic topography.  There is a risk is that the results will not show
              the required sensitivity, and that the challenge to the present dogma fails. 
              However, the impact of this work on both sensory neuroscience and neuroethology
              is likely to be high in this controversial area, because the results will
              demonstrate whether or not a topographic magnetosensory capability can be
              distinguished from demonstrations of compass-oriented sensing of magnetic
              fields, or responses to local electrosensory stimuli.  There also is a payoff
              in the potential for development of electronic navigation aids.
