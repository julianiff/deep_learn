Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's
              Connections to the Internet announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides partial
              support for the connection of four  universities: the University of Florida,
              Florida State University, the University of Central Florida, and the University
              of Miami to the NSF very high performance Backbone Network Service (vBNS).
              Under this award, each institution will implement a DS-3 (45 Mbps) ATM
              connection to a Florida gigaPop which, in turn, will be connected to the vBNS
              through a shared OC-3 (155Mbps) connection to the Southern Crossroads
              connection point at GCATT, from which  there is access to the vBNS.    This
              proposal will support a number of advanced network-based research projects, in
              areas such as:  brain research, image processing, quantum physics, nuclear
              magnetic resonance  spectroscopy, global weather forecasting, real-time
              multicasting, virtual reality 3D diagnostic anatomy, global satellite remote
              sensing, ocean modeling, medical informatics and many others.    These new vBNS
              connections will facilitate research collaboration not only among the four
              institutions but also with federal laboratories such as Sandia and Nasa Jet
              Propulsion laboratory,  other research institutions, and agencies such as NASA
              Langley. This award provides partial support for establishing and operating the
              four institutional vBNS connections for a period of  two years.    Within the
              next several months, additional research universities will connect to the
              Florida gigaPoP, and the bandwidth of individual institutional connections will
              be increased from DS-3  to OC-3.
