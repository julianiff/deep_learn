Abstract    :
              This award provides support for a systematic study of the minimum enstrophy
              principle and maximum entropy principle as they apply to problems of potential
              vorticity mixing in hurricanes and larger-scale tropical circulations. Within
              the context of a barotropic, nondivergent model, theoretical predictions will
              be extended from the symmetric to the asymmetric case. Of particular interest
              will be the determination of the bifurcations between the symmetric and
              asymmetric structures predicted by the maximum entropy vortex arguments. The
              results of such an asymmetric theory should reveal what kind of steady state
              asymmetric features are possible in hurricanes. Outside the context of the
              non-divergent model, both direct numerical integrations and theoretical
              predictions will be generalized to the shallow water equations (on the plane
              and on the sphere). This generalization will allow a distinction between
              vorticity and potential vorticity and a distinction between enstrophy and
              potential enstrophy, and will allow the energy constraint to include both
              kinetic and potential energy. The generalization to the quasi-static primitive
              equations in isentropic coordinates should then follow from the shallow water
              case. Each step in this investigation will help to improve understanding (and,
              ultimately, prediction) of the nonlinear evolution of large-scale atmospheric
              flows.
