Abstract    :
                The University of La Verne will use this grant to connect three  of it's
              remote campus sites to the Internet. These include: the  Inland Empire Center,
              the San Fernando Valley Site and the  Ventura Center.  The campus sites will be
              served with a 128KB  frame relay connection.  The students and faculty of the 
              University of La Verne need the Internet connections to be able  to access
              information resources throughout the state, the nation  and the world.  The
              connection will benefit the faculty, staff  students of this institution as
              well as the community in general.  The award provides partial support of the
              project for two years.
