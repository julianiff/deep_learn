Abstract    :
                Alaska Pacific University, located in Anchorage, Alaska is  Alaska's only
              private, independent university.  It serves a wide  variety of undergraduate
              and graduate programs.  This grant will  help fund Internet access for the
              institution by supporting the  acquisition of a T1 line to a local Internet
              Service Provider,  along with connection equipment and service provider fees. 
              The  students and faculty of the Alaska Pacific University need the  Internet
              connections to be able to access information resources  throughout the state,
              the nation and the world.  The connection  will benefit the faculty, staff
              students of this institution as  well as the community in general.  The award
              provides partial  support of the project for two years.
