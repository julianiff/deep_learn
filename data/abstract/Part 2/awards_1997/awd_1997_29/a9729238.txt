Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion  of NCRI's
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides partial
              support for an OC-3 connection to the enhance  and acomodate research needs for
              the University of  Wisconsin-Milwaukee by establishing a connection to the Very
              High  Performance Backbone Network Service (vBNS) via MREN community 
              connection at the Ameritech NAP.  Projects in this proposal  include:  the
              Advanced Light Source Synchrotron Radiation  Facility, high speed arithmetic
              using the Chinese Remainder  Representation, experiments on electron
              holography, mesoscale  modeling in making qualitative precipitation forecasts,
              two-phase  thermal control system for the space station, and scanning 
              tunneling microscopes.  With this high performance network  capability the
              University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee will expand  current research and
              collaboration with both academic  institutions and federal laboratories.  On
              this project,  collaborating institutions include:  Lawrence Berkeley 
              Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National  Laboratory,
              NASA-Goddard, Caltech and the University of Michigan
