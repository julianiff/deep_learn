Abstract    :
              This is a workshop to bring together researchers and designers from academia and
               industry to discuss possible directions in the development of
              high-performance,  parallel, distributed, and multimedia processors and
              systems.  The topics center  around systems on a chip and their utilization in
              building larger systems.  The  participants include designers of processors,
              compilers and operating systems,  together with application experts.  The wide
              representation will allow rich  interaction concerning ideas and emphasis in
              the field.
