              Instrumentation: Accurate Control of Underwater Manipulators Using Inertial
              Sensors    This research instrumentation grant contributes to the purchase of
              two MotionPak inertial sensors, two digital gyro compasses, and one water speed
              sensor, which will enable the following projects:- Coordination of an
              Underwater Vehicle and an Onboard Manipulator, and - Traction Control of an
              Autonomous Ground Vehicle on Rough Terrains.    The objective of the proposed
              research projects is to investigate control and coordination of an underwater
              vehicle-manipulator system. An inertial sensor, water speed sensor, and digital
              compass are integrated to provide accurate estimates of vehicle motions.  A
              novel nonlinear feedback control algorithm is developed to compensate for
              vehicle-manipulator dynamic interactions.  Because of the uncertain nature of
              undersea environments and lack of hydrodynamic modeling data, it is crucial to
              validate theoretical algorithms by physical experiments.  The proposed
              instrumentation makes it possible to conduct physical experiments using the
              proposed half-dry half-wet approach.  The experiments not only validate the
              control algorithm proposed in this research, but also establish an entirely
              new, cost-effective underwater experimentation procedure.  The integrated
              sensor system (replacing the water speed sensor by wheel encoders) is also
              applied to an all-terrain land vehicle for wheel slip estimation and for
              improved traction control.
