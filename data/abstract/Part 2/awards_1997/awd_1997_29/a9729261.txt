              Abstract  ATM-9729261  Clark, Peter  Oregon State University  Title: Support of
              a Chapman Conference on Mechanisms of Millennial-        Scale Global Climate
              Change; June 1998    This award will support a Chapman Conference on
              "Mechanisms of  Millennial-Scale Global Climate Change," in June 1998.  This  
              conference will provide an international forum for discussion of  mechanisms
              that may account for millennial-scale climate change.   Unlike orbital-scale
              climate change. which has a well-defined  forcing mechanism in changes in solar
              insolation, the cause(s) of  millennial-scale climate variation remain(s)
              unknown.  The growing  paleoclimate database relevant to this issue is now of
              significant  breadth to provide critical information required to address these 
              issues.  The central themes of this conference will address two key  questions:
              (1) what is the sensitivity of various components of the  Earth's climate
              system to millennial-scale climate change?  (2)  What are the mechanisms,
              linkages, and feedbacks which produce  millennial-scale climate change?
