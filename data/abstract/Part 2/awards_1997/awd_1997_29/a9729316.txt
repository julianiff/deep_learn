Abstract    :
                  9729316  Sulkin    Western Washington University's Shannon Point Marine 
              Center  (SPMC) in Anacortes, Washington will serve as the site of an  REU 
              program  during the summers of 1998-2000.  Each  summer  eight  students
              recruited from around the nation will  spend  nine  weeks  at SPMC engaging in
              independent research  under  the  supervision of a faculty member.  Students 
              will  plan,  execute, and develop oral and written reports for individual 
              projects  relating  to  the marine  environment  and  living  resources  of 
              the  Puget Sound region,  including  nutrient  dynamics,   water   quality 
              determinations,   predator-prey  interactions,   and   the   developmental  
              characteristics,  physiology,  and  behavior  of marine  animals  and  plants. 
              Students  will  receive  a  $275 per  week  stipend,  travel  allowance,   and 
              housing  at  SPMC.    Students   will   be  encouraged  and supported in
              developing their  projects  for  presentation in regional and national
              scientific meetings.
