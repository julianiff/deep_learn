Abstract    :
                  The award for "High-Performance Network Connectivity for the University of
              Nebraska-Lincoln" is made under the high performance connections category of
              DNCRI's "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides
              support for interconnecting UNL's ATM-based campus network infrastructure to 
              the Very High-speed Backbone Network Service (vBNS) via the Great Plains
              network, a high-performance regional network dedicated to supporting the
              research needs of Great Plains universities.  In addition to supporting
              meritorious research at the University of Nebraska, the high performance
              connection to the vBNS will permit the University to contribute more
              effectively to the Internet2 project as well as participate with NCSA in PACI. 
              The award will partially fund the installation and operation of a DS-3 circuit
              from the Great Plains network gigapop in Kansas City to a vBNS connection point
              in Chicago over a two-year period. Research projects in the areas of earth
              systems science, inverse electrocardiography, image understanding (image
              analysis), mobile IP and cryptography expect to make use of the
              high-performance network partially supported by this award.  Collaborating
              institutions on these projects include the USGS/EROS Data Center, the National
              Center for Atmospheric Research, the USDA/Natural  Resources Conservation
              Service, the USDA/Forest Service, NASA, the University of South Carolina,
              Creighton University, South Dakota State University, Western Michigan
              University, Kansas  State University, Ben-Gurion University (Israel), the Salk
              Research Institute, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Argonne National
              Laboratory and various U.S.  Air Force Laboratories.  This award will allow the
              University of Nebraska-Lincoln to expand its collaborative efforts.
