Abstract    :
              This CAREER program has a scientific focus on the study of the control of
              atom-radiation interactions via coherence and interference.  Specific physical
              phenomena such as cancellation of spontaneous emission, dressed-state
              manipulation of two-photon excitation, and active control of optical
              bistability and refractive index will be explored in the experiments.  The
              educational component of the program is centered on an outreach program to high
              school students from underrepresented minority groups in the Miami area.
