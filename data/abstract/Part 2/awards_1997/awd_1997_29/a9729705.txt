Abstract    :
              While it is widely recognized that breastfeeding is best for   infants, many
              women stop breastfeeding their infants earlier than   recommended because they
              believe they are producing insufficient   milk.  There is a debate about
              whether women who report   insufficient milk actually produce less breastmilk,
              or whether   the perception of milk insufficiency results from factors such as 
               lack of knowledge about how to breastfeed and inadequate social   support. 
              This study will investigate insufficient milk in women   in Esmeraldas City,
              Ecuador.  A combination of data on   breastfeeding behavior and beliefs, infant
              growth, maternal   nutritional status, and milk quantity and quality will be  
              collected from a sample of 72 breastfeeding women over a period   of 10 months.
              The project aims to understand breastmilk   insufficiency by 1) a thorough
              investigation of women's cultural   understanding of breastfeeding practices,
              2) a longitudinal   investigation of biological factors such as maternal and
              infant   nutritional status, fat concentration of breastmilk, and volume   of
              milk intake by infants, and 3) a careful weighing of both   cultural and
              biological variables in relation to milk   insufficiency.  This will be the
              first study of milk   insufficiency to combine measures of infant milk intake,
              milk fat   content, and structured observations of breastfeeding to be  
              carried out in a developing country.
