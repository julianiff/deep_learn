Abstract    :
              An auto-analyzer capable of analyzing freshwater samples for  nitrate and
              nitrate-nitrogen will be purchased. It will be  used to study how man-made and
              natural disturbances and  climate changes affect selected ecosystem processes
              at  watershed, landscape and regional scales.
