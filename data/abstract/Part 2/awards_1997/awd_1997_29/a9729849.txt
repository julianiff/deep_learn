This grant is awarded through the Separations and Purification
              Program sub-element of the Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of
              the Chemical and Transport Systems Division. The principal investigator is Dr.
              Anthony Skelland at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The research is
              directed towards the development of liquid membranes that exhibit a high level
              of stability without  compromising permeability characteristics. The
              incorporation of polymeric additives 
to convert the membrane to non-Newtonian
              form is the central 
hypothesis of the research.

Liquid membranes have a
              significant potential  for continuous separations relating to the selective
              extraction of chemical species. Unfortunately, the system is flawed by problems
              associated with the stability of the membrane phase. The current research
              directly addresses the problem of stability with retention of transport rates.
              The project has relevance to the extraction of toxic contaminants in wastewater
              and to the selective extraction of compounds of interest to the fine chemicals
              and pharmaceutical industries.
