Abstract    :
              This is a grant co-funded by the NSF-EPA Partnership for Environmental Research.
               It will generate fundamental knowledge necessary to provide the petroleum
              industries with alternative catalysts for the HF-catalyzed alkylation
              processes.  Transition to solid-acid catalysis is currently considered the
              correct alternative from pollution prevention standpoints but these catalysts
              have poor selectivity and fast deactivation rate.  Better understanding of
              mechanisms and catalytic materials is needed in order to develop further these
              catalysts. Prof. J.F. Haw in collaboration with Dr. J.B. Nicholas (Pacific
              Northwest National Laboratory) will investigate the catalyzed alkylation of
              hydrocarbons on acidic solids, namely sulfonated zirconia, BF3/alumina, and
              zeolite Beta. They will apply complementary techniques, reaction kinetics in
              flow microreactor, solid state NMR, and density-functional theory, to
              investigate fundamental catalysis issues in alkylation over selected solid
              acids: sulfonated zirconia, BF3/alumina, and zeolite Beta.  The overall goal of
              the research will be the determination of acid site structure and reactivity,
              mechanism of alkylation of trans-2-butene with isobutane, and mechanism of
              catalyst deactivation.  The nature of active intermediates, transition states,
              deactivation pathways, etc., will be investigated spectroscopically,
              theoretically, and by kinetics measurements.
