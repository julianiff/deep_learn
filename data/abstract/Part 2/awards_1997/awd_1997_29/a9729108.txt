Abstract    :
                This project will investigate the interactions between the syntax and
              phonology of languages of the Makassar group from South Sulawesi, Indonesia.
              The Makassar languages, which with the increasing influence of Bahasa Indonesia
              are in serious danger of becoming extinct within the next few generations, have
              a rich inventory of affixes and clitics that signal, among other things,
              subject and object agreement, definiteness, possession, and plurality, and
              various aspects of derivational morphology. They are a fertile ground for
              testing hypotheses concerning the relationships between syntactic and prosodic
              structure. The aims of the project are (i) to provide a detailed description of
              the affixal system of these languages; (ii) to ground this description in
              careful analysis of both the syntax and the phonology of the languages; (iii)
              to investigate the general principles governing the mapping between the
              syntactic, morphological, and prosodic structure of the languages; and (iv) to
              place these results in the wider context of a comparative approach to
              grammatical theory; and (iv) to prepare and make widely available a database
              which will serve as a resource for researchers interested in Indonesian
              languages and/or in any of the grammatical areas covered in the project. The
              project has the potential to contribute to the further development of our
              understanding of the structure of human language by providing a thorough
              documentation of parts of the syntax, morphology, and phonology of a little
              known group of uncommonly studied languages, and extensive investigation of the
              implications of the data for the theory of grammar.
