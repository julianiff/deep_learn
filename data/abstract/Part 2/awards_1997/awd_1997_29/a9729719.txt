              Instrumentation: Ultra-High-Speed Optical Networks    This research
              instrumentation grant enables the utilization of the requested BER test set in
              studies which include:- optical packet switching,- fiber nonlinearities, and-
              high-speed communication integrated circuits.    The objective of proposed
              research is to explore the multi-TeraHertz bandwidth potential of optical
              fibers to support ultra-high-speed, wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM)
              optical links and networks.  That objective will be achieved via construction
              and experimental investigation of novel ultra-high-speed experimental links and
              networks operating in the 10 - 100 Gb/s range.    The requested instrument, a
              12 Gb/s bit error rate (BER) test set, is vitally important for the proposed
              research as it provides a means to (a) generate data at extremely high data
              rates and(b) test BER performance of experimental links and networks at such
              high data rates.    The BER test set will be used in our experiments in
              conjunction with external time-division and wavelength-division multiplexing to
              measure the performance of our experimental systems in the 10 - 100 Gb/s range.
                 Thus, the proposed instrument will have a strong positive impact on our
              research as it will allow us to move toward much higher bit rates previously
              inaccessible with older equipment.  Specifically, the new BER test set will be
              used in our 84 km WDM experimental ring network interconnecting Stanford
              University with Sprint ATL.  The network currently operates at 2.5 Gb/s per
              wavelength.  The proposed BER test set will help to increase the bit rate to 40
              Gb/s per wavelength by allowing us to time-division-multiplex four 10 Gb/s bit
              streams into a 40 Gb/s data stream. Several additional research projects in the
              laboratory and elsewhere at Stanford will utilize the requested BER test set.
