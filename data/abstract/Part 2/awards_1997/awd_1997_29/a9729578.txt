Abstract    :
              Abstract - Miller  CTS - 9729578        A numerical model for a flickering, or
              time-varying, flame is developed; this model is intended to accurately and
              efficiently predict emission levels for nitrogen oxides.  The model consists of
              three sections:  (1) prediction of flame structure through solution of
              conservation equations in mass, momentum, energy, and mixture fraction; (2)
              application of a flamelet library approach to predict concentrations of carbon,
              hydrogen, and oxygen species; and (3) post-processing nitrogen chemistry to
              predict local levels and emissions of nitrogen oxide species.  The unsteady
              flame structure is predicted using an adaptive spectral element discretization
              of the conservation equations on both serial and parallel machines.  The
              existing incompressible spectral element code is revised to permit variable
              density.  At each step in the process, model predictions are compared with
              measurements of concentration from tunable-diode laser absorption spectroscopy
              (TDLAS) on a methane-fueled flame, including in situ measurements of carbon
              monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methane and conditional sampling of the flame
              using a pulsed quartz microprobe to determine concentrations of trace nitrogen
              species including nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, ammonia, and hydrogen
              cyanide.    This effort introduces a new computational approach for the
              modelling of pollutant formation and flame behavior.
