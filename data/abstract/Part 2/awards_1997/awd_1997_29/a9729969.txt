Abstract    :
                Bayamon Central University is a Catholic liberal arts institution  in the
              Commonwealth of Puerto Rico outside the city of San Juan.  As a territory of
              the US it is eligible for NSF grants.  The  institution currently serves
              approximately 2,800 students.  The  funds provided by the grant will be used to
              support the  acquisition of hardware and services required to provide Internet 
              access to the institution.  The University of Puerto Rico will  provide the
              Internet services over a leased T1 line.  The  students and faculty of the
              Bayamon Central University need the  Internet connections to be able to access
              information resources  throughout the state, the nation and the world.  The
              connection  will benefit the faculty, staff students of this institution as 
              well as the community in general.  The award provides partial  support of the
              project for two years.
