Abstract    :
              Public anatomy, the ceremonial dissection and examination of animals that was
              performed annually at most European medical schools, was an important part of
              public culture in the early modern period.  Such events not only taught the
              public what the body looked like, they also entertained, enlightened,
              bedazzled, and offered moral education to the general public.  In a word,
              anatomical demonstration formed a `moral theatre.`  This study will examine how
              such events used animals to reflect ideas about the human body.  More
              generally, public anatomy will be used as a strategic research site for
              studying European culture in the transition between religious and secular modes
              of thought.  In such respects the study of public anatomy sheds light on
              changing modes of thought, explores the relationship between science and the
              general public, and reveals early antecedents to contemporary concerns about
              animal experimentation.  The study will be based largely on archival research
              in Britain, France, Italy and the Netherlands, and will produce scholarly
              articles and a book.
