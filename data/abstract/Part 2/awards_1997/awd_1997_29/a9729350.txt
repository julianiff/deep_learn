Abstract    :
                The console of a multi-user 500 MHz nmr spectrometer will be  upgraded. Among
              the problems to be investigated using the  improved, up-to-date spectrometer
              are: structure-function  relationships of Rhodobacter capsulatus cytochrome c2,
              nmr  spectroscopy of heme proteins, ligand-receptor interactions, 
              conformational studies of complex polysaccharides, bioactive  agents from
              dryland plants of Latin America, and glycopeptide  conformation and
              cell-surface glycoproteins.
