              Diweker  Affiliation:              Carnegie Mellon University          This
              grant is awarded through the chemical and Transport Systems Division of the
              Directorate for Engineering.  The principal investigator is Dr. Urmila Diwekar
              at Carnegie-Mellon University.  The principal objective of the research is the
              synthesis of optimal batch distillation column configurations.  Batch
              distillation optimization is considerably more complex than continuous
              distillation optimization, since the process is inherently dynamic.  At the
              same time the dynamics of the process provides flexibility to operate and
              configure columns in numerous ways.  This research will set up a systematic
              framework for synthesizing optical  column configurations rapidly and
              economically.    The proposed project is of considerable fundamental and
              practical significance.  The studies will lead to a systematic method to define
              a parameter window which will not only facilitate the optimization, but will
              also be useful for plant operations.  Batch distillation is a ubiquitous
              process in the manufacture of specialty chemicals and pharmaceuticals.  The
              outcome of the study will enable batch processing industries involved in the
              manufacture of these chemicals to better design and synthesize their batch
              distillation sequences to produce cost effective and purer separations.
