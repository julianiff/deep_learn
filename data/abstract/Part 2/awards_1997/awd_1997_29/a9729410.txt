Abstract    :
              The existing prototype Biodiversity Insight System, which  developed at the San
              Diego Supercomputer Center to integrate  geographical and informational
              database with a "generic  modeling engine" to permit predictions of species 
              distributions, will be tested on museum and multi-national  databases.  In
              addition, a description of the  characteristics of the BIS system will be
              widely provided to  museums and other biodiversity database holders.
