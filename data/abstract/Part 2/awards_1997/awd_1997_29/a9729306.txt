Abstract    :
                  CMS 9729306  Olson    This project focuses on the relationship between
              disasters,  societal stability and barriers to policy innovation.  A 
              multivariate model linking disasters and their possible  consequences will be
              developed.  The data analysis technique  is pooled time-series.  The principal
              databases include a  worldwide disaster database for the years 1964-1995, the 
              Taylor and Jodice database from the World Handbook of  Political and Social
              Indicators (1983), and the Jaggers and  Gurr Polity III (1996) database. 
              Setting a criterion of all  1964-1995 disasters worldwide which affected more
              than 1,000  people, the project encompasses 1,760 disaster events, which 
              yields 54,560 data points.  Other researchers should be able  to later
              replicate this project and extend its findings and  policy insights.
