Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the preparation of chiral oxazolidinone  
              auxiliaries suitable for attachment to polymer supports.  These systems   will
              then be used to induce chiral induction in aldol and Diels-Alder   reactions. 
              The ease of recycling the auxiliaries will offer advantages   over current
              methodology and the potential for synthesizing small   molecule libraries will
              be exploited.  The research will be carried out   with the help of
              undergraduate participants. With this Research in   Undergraduate Institutions
              award, the Organic and Macromolecular   Chemistry Program is supporting the
              research and educational activities   of Dr. Brian J. McNelis of the Department
              of Chemistry at Santa Clara   University.  Professor McNelis, with the help of
              undergraduate coworkers,    will focus his work on developing new methods for
              solid-phase synthesis.    The methodology has the potential for application in
              the pharmaceutical   industry for the preparation of compounds with important
              biological   properties.
