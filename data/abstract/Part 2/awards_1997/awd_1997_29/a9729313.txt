Abstract    :
               This project involves the dissertation research of a student from the
              University of California-Davis.  The student will focus on disputes about the
              use of federal lands in Nye County, Nevada.  Ranchers dominate the rhetoric
              about federal land use and local politics in this area although they are not
              the dominant industry. The student hypothesizes that the ranchers' dominance is
              based on their use of `anti-colonialist` rhetoric and use of powerful cultural
              symbols against the federal government, tracing their cause back to the
              colonial exploitation of the West by Eastern interests.  The student will study
              local lifestyles through participant observation in government meetings and
              local social and political events, will collect genealogies and federal land
              surveys, and will interview participants in Forest Service and BLM disputes. 
              This research will shed light on a subject of great current interest, the
              anti-government rhetoric and activities of local people concerned about `White
              identity` which has given rise to militias and other anti-government movements.
               The in-depth social science knowledge will correct biases and advance public
              understanding beyond sensationalist media accounts.
