Abstract    :
              The American Mathematical Society (AMS) proposes that it enter  into a
              cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation  for the purpose of
              administering the evaluation process of  candidates for the Postdoctoral
              Research Fellowships in the  Mathematical Sciences.  The agreement would be for
              program years  1997-98, 1998-99, and 1999-2000 with estimated costs of $45,962,
               $44,557, and $45,853 respectively.    The AMS, in cooperation with the NSF,
              has administered this  program in past years, quickly, inexpensively, and
              successfully.   Applications are received and processed at the AMS in
              Providence.   A panel of mathematicians is selected by three societies - the 
              AMS, SIAM (Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics) and  IMS (Institute
              for Mathematical Statistics).  Applications are  evaluated by the panel and a
              day-long panel meeting results in  recommendations  for awards.
