Abstract    :
              This project examines the interrelationships among technology, art and business
              through a study of the development of sound motion picture technology in the
              1920s and early 1930s.  The successful application of amplified sound to motion
              pictures circa 1926 did not simply give voice to previously silent films:  the
              new technology fundamentally and dramatically changed how movies were made, who
              made them, what they were about, what they looked like, and how audiences
              received them.  The project will not only produce a much-needed history of the
              technological transformation of motion pictures during the `sound revolution,`
              it will also elaborate upon other topics of more general interest to historians
              and other scholars of technology.  Among these are the relationship between
              corporate structure and technological development, the nature of engineering
              work and the collaboration of engineers with others, and the permeability of
              the boundary between `technical` work and `aesthetic` work.  Corporate and
              studio archives, technical papers, personal memoirs, the films themselves and
              the machines that made them will provide the investigator with a rich variety
              of resources for this work.  The resulting book will be fully accessible to a
              non-scholarly readership as well as to a diverse array of scholars.
