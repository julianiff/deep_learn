Abstract    :
              This award is made to plan and conduct a workshop on `Planning, Design,
              Management, and Control of Transportation Systems.`  Changing requirements for
              transportation in a climate of constrained resources, environmental sensitivity
              and growing demand; increasing capabilities in new technology,
              telecommunications and control, and computer simulation; and evolving future
              requirements of the transportation professional workforce indicate the
              importance of holding this workshop in the near future.  The workshop will
              convene some of the current and future leaders in transportation research,
              practice and education to identify areas where the generic science base
              necessary for the planning, design, management and control of multimodal
              transportation systems is inadequate (or not sufficiently related to
              applications); articulate a set of research and education topics that NSF can
              consider as recommendations consistent with its mission of advancing the
              progress of science and engineering; identify, develop, and relate knowledge
              bases to practical transportation applications; and stimulate collaboration of
              research professionals across the modern and traditional disciplinary lines. 
              The workshop will focus on three major topics:  5) intelligent planning and
              design of transportation systems; 2) real-time management, learning, and
              control for transportation systems; and 3) interdisciplinary education in
              transportation systems.  Approximately 40 representatives of industry, academia
              and government will participate.  Attendees will include a diversity of
              individuals who can provide the interdisciplinary expertise necessary to define
              the generic science base and research and education topics that will define
              planning, design, management and control of multimodal transportation systems
              in the coming decade.  The workshop will include keynote speakers from
              government, industry, academia, and one invited from Europe.  The outcome of
              the workshop will be a report that will be widely distributed.
