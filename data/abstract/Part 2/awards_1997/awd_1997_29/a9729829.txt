              Research Instrumentation:  Advanced Visualization Facility    This research
              instrumentation grant contributes to the purchase of a   state-of-the-art
              graphics computer to augment the computational and display   resources
              currently available to the researchers of the College of Natural   Sciences and
              Mathematics of the University of Houston enabling the   following projects:   
              - Collaborative Visualization, Computational Steering, and Volume  
              Visualization, and  - Physics-based Modeling Methods for 3D Human Motion
              Capture.    The College is home to a number of research groups that make
              extensive use   of both local and remote computational resources for scientific
                visualization. Over the years these groups have made significant  
              contributions to advancing the state-of-the-art in visualizing molecular  
              structures, fluid flows, and volumetric data.  These interdisciplinary  
              research groups will expand their use of three-dimensional, immersive and  
              non-immersive displays, multi-sensory displays, and direct interaction  
              techniques for data visualization. The significance and impact of this  
              project is manifested along three directions:  (1) ongoing and future  
              research programs will be enhanced and made more productive through access   to
              high performance computing resources for data visualization, (2) the  
              college's educational programs will be able to attract, serve, and better  
              equip students of science, and (3) new researchers can be recruited and new  
              research projects can be sustained through the acquisition of this new  
              resource.
