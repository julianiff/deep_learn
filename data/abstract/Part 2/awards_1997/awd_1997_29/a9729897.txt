Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematical Sciences of George Mason University, Fairfax,
              Virginia, will host the Spring Topology and Dynamics Conference on March 12-14,
              1998.  The Spring Topology Conference, as it was originally called, is in its
              32nd year and has established itself as one of the largest and most successful
              annual topology conferences in the country.  Over the years, this conference
              has managed to maintain its traditional identity and at the same time expand
              its breadth, giving it now an interdisciplinary appeal.  In particular, the
              area of dynamical systems was integrated into the conference in 1987, and its
              evolving link to the more traditional areas of topology has become a central
              emphasis of the conference.  There will be a mix of one-hour and half-hour
              invited talks and contributed talks in areas ranging from general/set theoretic
              topology through continuum theory and dynamical systems to geometric topology.
