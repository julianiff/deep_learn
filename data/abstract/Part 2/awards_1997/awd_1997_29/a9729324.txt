Abstract    :
              The foci of this research are twofold. First, the development of new  
              independently folded polypeptide motifs will be carried out.  The two   design
              targets are an all beta-structure (BBB) motif and a mixed alpha-   and beta-
              structure patterned after charybotoxin which includes a number   of disulfides
              in the native state.  Second, the structure of the BBA   motif will be
              manipulated to effect the formation of a discrete dimeric   structure by
              `domain swapping.`  A key feature of the dimerization   studies will be the
              development of fluorescent amino acids with   solvatochromic properties for
              studying protein association phenomena.    With this renewal award, the Organic
              and Macromolecular Chemistry Program   is supporting the research of Dr.
              Barbara Imperiali of the Division of   Chemistry at the California Institute of
              Technology.  Professor Imperiali   will focus her work on designing and
              developing methods for the de novo   synthesis of functional polypeptides.  The
              detailed analysis of the   cooperative forces involved in folding small
              oligopeptides into compact   structures will contribute to the understanding of
              the architecture of   the protein biopolymer.
