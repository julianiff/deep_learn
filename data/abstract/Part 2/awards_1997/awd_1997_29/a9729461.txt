Abstract    :
                  The console of the 600 MHz NMR spectrometer at the NMR Shared  Facility of
              the University of Alabama at Birmingham will be  upgraded to provide
              state-of-the-art capabilities to the  participating investigators. This upgrade
              will overcome the  many limitations of the existing system and significantly 
              enhance the programs of participating investigators in their  research on
              protein and nucleic acid structures and  interactions.
