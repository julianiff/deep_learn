Abstract    :
              A confocal laser scanning microscope will be purchased for  studies in a number
              of areas of developmental biology. These  areas will include neuronal
              differentiation, growth cone  guidance, signal transduction in development,
              telomere  function and organogenesis.  The organisms used in these studies will
              include Drosophila,  zebrafish, Arabidopsis, c.elegans and mice as well as cell
               cultures from humans and chickens. Typical studies will  involve the three
              dimensional reconstruction of the  morphology of a sample or the visualization
              of the interior  of a living cell undergoing developmental processes.
