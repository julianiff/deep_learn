              ABSTRACT    Proposal Number:  CTS 9729189    Principal Investigator:  Moser   
              This is a grant to explore a particularly  promising technique for controlling
              turbulence by exploiting  its chaotic nature.  In particular, the details of
              the evolution of the turbulence are highly sensitive to small perturbations. 
              Thus, judiciously chosen small control inputs can in principle produce large
              changes in the evolution of the flow.  In most situations it is important that
              the control input require very little energy so that the benefits of modifying
              the flow are not out-weighed by the cost of the control.  Several schemes have
              been developed to control low dimensional chaotic systems using very small
              control inputs.  In the research proposed here, these schemes will be applied
              to a simple turbulent fluid flow (the minimal turbulent channel), in which drag
              reduction will be the objective.  In these control techniques, one selects as
              the goal dynamics for the system, one of the presumably infinite number of
              unstable periodic trajectories that are expected to be embedded in the chaotic
              attractor of the system.  Since this is a natural, although unstable, system
              trajectory, controlling to this goal dynamic just requires stabilizing it,
              which can be done with very small control inputs.
