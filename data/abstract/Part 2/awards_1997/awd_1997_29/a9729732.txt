Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides partial
              support for an OC-3 connection to enhance and accommodate research needs for
              Drexel University by establishing a connection to the Very High Performance
              Backbone Network Service (vBNS). The award, coupled with existing vBNS
              initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania, will leverage resources and
              facilitate research in the greater-Philadelphia region.  Projects in this
              proposal include: GRAPE-6  (research into areas of star cluster dynamics and
              stellar dynamical simulations), Sources of Gravitational Radiation, Numerical
              Modeling, Computational Astrophysics, DMS chemistry in the marine atmosphere,
              Aerosol Characterization Experiment, Pacific Exploratory Mission,  Advanced
              Cluster Computing, and the Hospital University Business School (HUBS)
              initiative.  With this high performance network capability Drexel University
              will expand current research and collaboration with both academic institutions
              and federal laboratories. Collaborating institutions on this project, include:
              Princeton University, University of Tokyo, University of Maryland, NCSA,
              JPL/Caltech, University of Texas at Austin, Syracuse University, LSU, SDSC,
              NASA/Goddard, University of Chicago, Argonne National Laboratory, Rensselear
              Polytechnic Institute, University of Arizona, and the Office of Naval Research.
