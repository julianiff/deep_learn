Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of  NCRI's
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It  provides partial
              support for a connection to enhance and accommodate  research needs for the
              University of Alabama and the University of  Alabama at Birmingham by
              establishing a connection to the Very High  Performance Backbone Network
              Service (vBNS) in coordination with the  Alabama Research and Education
              Network.  Projects in this proposal  include:  collaboration on thin film and
              particulate materials for ultra  high-density information storage, simulation
              of virus capsid assembly  from individual coat proteins, remote interactive
              design of inhibitors  using molecular modeling techniques, multisite
              three-dimensional brain  visualization, digital transmission of pediatric
              cardiology, remote use  of astronomy observatories, medical videoscope
              computer-assisted  neurosurgery, ATM network stress testing based on telepath
              paradigm,  mobile network applications test-bed, distributed parallel
              processing in  "tuple-space", simulations of action potential propagation in
              models of  cardiac tissue, large scale simulations of materials, and distance 
              learning.  With this high performance network capability the University  of
              Alabama and the University of Alabama at Birmingham will expand  current
              research and collaboration with both academic institutions and  federal
              laboratories.  On this project, collaborating institutions  include: 
              Washington University, Carnegie Mellon University, University  of Minnesota,
              Harvard University, University of Nebraska, George  Washington University,
              University of California at San Diego, Oak Ridge  National Laboratory,
              University of Kentucky, MIT, Yale University,  Columbia University, Auburn
              University, University of Arizona, Georgia  Institute of Technology, National
              Optical Astronomy Observatories,  Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Ohio State
              University, University of  North Carolina, and Henry Ford Hospital.
