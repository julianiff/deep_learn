              Hendrickson      This  new collaboration between a woman physicist at CUNY  and
               a  chemist at UC San Diego will focus on the synthesis and study  of  the
              magnetic properties of crystals composed of a large number of  identical 
              high-spin molecular clusters, such  as  Mn12  acetate.  Their magnetic
              bistability  makes  such  materials strong candidates as  elements  for  high- 
              density  storage of information.  The spin-tunneling in a  double  well 
              potential  that  we have recently demonstrated  makes  them  interesting  from 
              a  fundamental  standpoint,  and  offers   the  possibility  that  materials of
              this  class   could  be  used  as  elements for quantum computation.  The aim
              of our studies  is  to  synthesize  new molecular crystals that will optimize 
              properties  for  applications,  and to gain a better understanding  of  their 
              behavior.  %%%  This  new collaboration between a woman physicist at CUNY  and

              for  fundamental  reasons,   and  also   offer   the  possibility  that they
              can be used in "quantum  computers"  which  require  elements that are
              simultaneously in a  "yes"   and  "no"  state.   The  aim of our studies is to
              synthesize  new  molecular  crystals that will optimize properties for
