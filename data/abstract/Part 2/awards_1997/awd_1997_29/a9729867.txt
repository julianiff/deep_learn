Abstract    :
              97-29867  Sheppard  Stanford University      ABSTRACT        Stanford University
              proposes to offer a series of five one-week Engineering Education Scholars
              Workshops - "New Century Scholars: Teaching, Learning, and Your Academic
              Career" ( one each summer, beginning in 1998.  These workshops are designed to
              help new engineering faculty from around the country understand learning and
              teaching practices which support effective learning among all students.  The
              workshops are also designed to help faculty integrate this knowledge with other
              forms of scholarship, recognizing the multiple demands for faculty
              productivity, so that they will be able to practice effective teaching.
