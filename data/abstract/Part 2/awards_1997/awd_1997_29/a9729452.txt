Abstract    :
                  9729452  Williams   Knowledge of earth's biological resources, the species
              and the communities they constitute on land and in the sea, has grown with
              human use and management of those resources. With use and development has come
              a growing appreciation of the sustainability, and at times vulnerability, of
              natural biological systems and of individual species of organisms. Uninformed
              or misguided uses have resulted in disruption and destruction of natural
              ecological processes, with direct or indirect consequences on the size and
              health of populations of plants, animals, and microbes. At the same time,
              exploration on earth has revealed novel organisms and communities, often
              existing at environmental extremes heretofore unimagined. The sense of wonder
              that accompanies this new knowledge of novel species and communities clashes
              with the sense of urgency about effective stewardship of biological resources
              around the globe. Many of these issues have come to be subsumed under the term
              "biodiversity" which at its core is concerned with the study of earth's living
              organisms, their interactions in natural or human-managed communities, and
              their sustainability in the face of global environmental processes and human
              uses.   Following 11 years upon a national Forum on Biodiversity that brought
              widespread scientific and public attention to these issues, the National
              Academy of Sciences is hosting a second forum to assess progress and define
              challenges in the continuing study of earth's biological heritage. Leading
              scientists and resource managers will convene under the aegis of the Academy
              and of supporting organizations such as the Smithsonian Institution, Library of
              Congress, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The
              meetings and workshops, and the print publications resulting from these
              discussions, will be extended through Web-based dissemination and continuing
              discussion via the Internet.
