Abstract    :
                ECS-9729242  Karl Yngvesson    Superconducting hot electron mixers for the Thz
              range will be explored, promising DSB receiver noise temperatures of 10x hf/k
              or less.  These receivers will employ : 1. thin film NbN; and 2. new S-Sm-S
              devices, which have never been used for this purpose before.  The mixers will
              be integrated with thin film antennas, and coupled through silicon lenses.  The
              potential for focal plane arrays of such receivers will be demonstrated.
