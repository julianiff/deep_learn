Abstract    :
              The Institute of Ecosystem Studies, located in Millbrook, NY is an independent
              not-for-profit research and education institute dedicated to the creation,
              dissemination and application of  knowledge about ecological systems.  This
              grant will help fund Internet access for the institution by supporting the
              acquisition of a leased line, connection equipment, installation services and 
              service provider fees.  The students and faculty of the Institute of Ecosystem
              Studies need the Internet connections to be able to access information
              resources throughout the state, the nation and the world.  The connection will
              benefit the faculty, staff students of this institution as well as the
              community in general. The award provides partial support of the project for two
              years.
