Abstract    :
                Winglee, Robert  AST  97-29096      While jets from young stellar objects are
              common in regions of star formation, and recent theoretical and observational
              work implies that jets are an integral and perhaps necessary component of the
              early evolution of low-mass stars, the mechanisms that launch them are not
              fully understood.  Drs. Winglee and Bohm investigate the hypothesis that the
              jets are the result of a time dependent interaction between the magnetic field
              and the accretion disk around a typical young star.  Their work builds on early
              simulations that have corroborated the basic features of this launching
              mechanism for jets, and produced a two-component outflow of jets and winds
              which is in agreement with observations.  Their work extends this model to a
              more complete parameter space, and tests the model against a variety of
              existing imaging and spectroscopic observations.  The model makes predictions
              on the velocity spectrum of the outflow, the time variability of the outflow
              observables, and the correlation of these observed parameters with X-ray
              flares, as well as  ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) excesses associated with
              accretion streams and disks, which can be tested against existing observations.
