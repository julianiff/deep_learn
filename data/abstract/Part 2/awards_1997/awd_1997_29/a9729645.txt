Abstract    :
                  Abstract  Threadgill  9729645            The ERB proteins are a family
              consisting of four different cell surface receptors with enzymatic kinase
              activity that are activated by extracellular peptide growth factors.  Upon
              activation these receptors homodimerize with an identical family member or
              heterodimerize with a different family member transactivating their respective
              dimerization partner by phosphorylation.  These phosphorylated dimers form
              active signaling complexes that transmit the extracellular signal into the
              cell.  A considerable amount of signaling specificity potentially exists in the
              type of receptor dimer that is formed. In this grant molecular and genetic
              analyses will be used to investigate the importance of receptor homo vs
              heterodimerization in determining signaling specificity  and to determine to
              what extent receptor kinase activity is required for signal transmission. First
              the mode of receptor phosphorylation will be established in an in vitro cell
              culture system.  The importance of the kinase activity of ERB2 and ERB4 will be
              studied in an in vivo animal system by engineering specific kinase-inactivating
              mutations in mice.  The experiments will indicate how tyrosine kinase
              activation influences receptor dimerization and signaling specificity.         
                    This research is looking at some cell surface receptors, and studying
              their early reaction to substances which bind to them, and the means by which
              they pass this information on to other pathways in the cell which bring about 
              a final response.  ***
