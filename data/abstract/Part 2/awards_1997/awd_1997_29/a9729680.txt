Abstract    :
              9729680  Bahadur  An SGER award will support the study of the effect of nano- 
              scale particulate fillers from a number of materials  families on the
              tribological performance of a high  temperature polymer.  Friction and wear
              will be measured for  a range of conditions and mixtures and the composition
              and  properties of the transfer film formed on steel counterfaces  will be
              determined.  It is expected that the high reactivity  of the nano-scale
              particles with the counterface will result  in formation of especially wear
              resistant transfer films.  The study will also provide data on the tribological
               properties of filled polymers for potential use in MEMS  micromachines.  ***
