              Abstract   ATM-9729571  Woodhouse, Connie A.  University of Colorado  Title:
              Expanded Dendroclimate Reconstruction of Great Plains and  Central Rocky
              Mountains Drought    This award supports research to: 1) reconstruct spatial
              and  temporal patterns of drought in the central Rocky Mountains and  central
              High Plains through dendroclimatic reconstructions of  Plains drought back at
              least 700-1000 years and South Platte and  Arkansas River basin snowpack back
              at least 300 years, and 2)  characterize and examine relationships between
              atmospheric  circulation patterns that have accompanied droughts related to
              both  low snowpack and lack of growing season moisture over the past 
              centuries.  This work will provide an expanded temporal context  from which to
              evaluate the variability of seasonal precipitation,  and thus water supply, as
              well as provide information about the  influence of atmospheric circulation
              features on drought  variability in the region.
