Abstract    :
              Gordon  9729322  The observational data set (hydrographic survey, shipboard
              current profiles,  satellite altimetry, surface drifters, and subsurface
              floats) from the World Ocean  Circulation Experiment s (WOCE)  Indian Ocean
              Expedition will be used to explore the  Indian  Ocean thermohaline
              stratification, circulation and heat/freshwater fluxes. The specific 
              objectives are (1) to track the meridional spreading of low salinity tropical
              water  within the western Indian Ocean, including the contribution of
              Indonesian throughflow  water  and to ascertain its role in interocean
              circulation; (2) to study the exchange of Bay  of Bengal water masses with
              those of the equatorial belt and Arabian Sea and to  investigate the origin and
              significance of the unique benthic boundary layer observed  within the Bay of
              Bengal; and (3) to calculate the horizontal sub-basin scale fluxes of  heat and
              freshwater across hydrographic sections. Results of these studies will be 
              compared with model output in order to evaluate the circulation model and to
              extend the  observations to larger temporal and spatial scales.
