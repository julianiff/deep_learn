Abstract    :
              9729328  Sconiers    The Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications (COMAP)
              is establishing  four implementation centers - one National Center and three
              Curriculum Centers - to provide resources for implementing the elementary
              school instructional materials in mathematics developed with support from NSF
              (Everyday Mathematics, Investigations in Number, Data, and Space, and Math
              Trailblazers).  The four centers  will combine the experience of the developers
              of these instructional materials and focus their efforts on the issues that
              schools and teachers confront as they adopt and implement reform mathematics
              curricula.  The National Center will be housed at COMAP and will cooperate with
               similar centers for secondary and middle school implementation at Ithaca
              College and the University of Missouri, respectively, with the center for K-12
              implementation at the Education Development Center, and with the Curriculum
              Centers to assist schools and districts with issues related to the successful
              adoption and implementation of the three curricula.  Each of the three
              Curriculum Centers is associated with one of the instructional materials
              development projects at the elementary school level and will work with schools
              and districts on issues specific to the instructional materials associated with
              that Center.
