Abstract    :
                                                A confocal microscope system will be purchased
              for studies on  such problems as the functional organization of neurons  within
              a sensory system, the developmental mechanisms  involved in neuronal and glial
              differentiation, the nature of  the neural code, i.e., the algorithms through
              which  information is encoded in neuronal spike trains, the  functional
              organization of the anterior pituitary, the  migration of cells on and through
              basement membranes in  multicellular organisms, interactions between the cell 
              surface of fungi and host tissues and the structural,  elemental and molecular
              preservation of dinosaur tissues.
