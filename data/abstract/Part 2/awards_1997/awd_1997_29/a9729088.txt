Abstract    :
              9729088  Purdy    The Triangle Coalition manages the Albert Einstein
              Distinguished Educator Fellowships Program to give highly qualified K-12
              mathematics and science teachers an opportunity to spend a school year in the
              Washington, DC metropolitan area to serve as a "teacher voice" with various
              federal agencies and Congress.  Currently, federal agencies such as NASA, the
              US Department of Education, the US Department of Energy, and the National
              Institutes of Health host Einstein Fellows.   In these settings, the teachers
              have worked on several initiatives of national importance.  For example, the
              Fellows in the Department of Education have participated in the follow-up to
              the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).  Another
              currently serves in Senator Jim Jeffords Office.    To become an Einstein
              Fellow, teachers submit a written application and then undergo an interview
              process in Washington.  The interview panel is composed of current fellows and
              representatives of federal agencies.  Those selected as finalists are then
              placed.  In 1997, 12 finalists were selected out of 65 applicants.    Many of
              the Einstein Fellows are former winners of the Presidential Award for
              Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching.  This program is now
              administered directly by NSF, and having a K-12 classroom teacher (particularly
              one who is a former awardee) in the Division will be extremely helpful to us.
