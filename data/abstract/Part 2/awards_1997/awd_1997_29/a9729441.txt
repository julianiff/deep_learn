Abstract    :
              This research is on hierarchical and symbolic test  generation and design for
              testability techniques for core-  based systems. The system can be a
              combination of soft, firm  and hard cores. In the case of untestable soft
              cores,  hierarchical testability techniques are being applied to  make them
              testable. Also techniques of adding hardware so  the cores are functionally
              transparent and can propagate  test data without information loss are being
              developed. The  approach is to integrate testable and transparent cores to 
              ensure justification of precomputed test sequences. This  test generation
              approach is independent of the bit-width of  the cores. The case of firm and
              hard cores which have  testability features built into them by core providers
              is  also being explored. Approaches here include: using  information supplied
              by the core vendor; use of in-built  testability features; and providing
              transparency through  glue logic outside the core.
