Abstract    :
              This research is to develop a high level, semi-automated  process for validating
              models. The approach is based on the  principle of modeling the environment
              surrounding the system  that the model represents. There are four objectives:
              1)  developing initial sensor models with high-level graphics-  based tools
              that allow one to concentrate on the system  mathematics to insure sensor model
              correctness, 2) refining  sensor models over time into a library structure, 3) 
              exploring automated mechanisms for requirements capture and  processing and
              linking the model validation system to  specification requirements, and 4)
              creating a goal tree  based test planning system to guide the selection of and 
              development of model tests. Validation of VHDL models of DSP  algorithms is
              being done under this research.
