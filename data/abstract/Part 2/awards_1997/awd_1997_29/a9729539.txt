Abstract    :
              9729539  Mayo  Characterizing partially-folded and particularly unfolded states
              of proteins and peptides has been problematic given their transient nature. 
              13C/15N NMR relaxation is particularly well suited for investigating these
              states.  This project will study backbone and side-chain motions of amino acid
              residues in unfolded, partially-folded and well-structured peptides by using
              13C and 15N NMR relaxation and motional model analyses.  The peptides for study
              are three partially-folded peptides which show conformational preferences in
              water: (-hairpin (12mer), (-sheet (20mer) and helix (18mer), and a zinc finger
              peptide (31 residues)  Sp1f2  which can be examined in a well-structured native
              state (1:1 complex with zinc) having both (-sheet and helical structure and in
              an "unfolded" state (apopeptide without zinc).  The relatively small size of
              these peptides makes them ideal in terms of synthesis, selective 13C/15N
              isotopic enrichment, and experimental investigation.  This project stands apart
              from previous NMR dynamics studies in that it will use both auto- and
              cross-correlation parameters from all available motional vectors (backbone and
              side-chain) and various rotational models and model free approaches to provide
              a detailed description of motional dynamics in terms of bond rotational
              restrictions and  correlations and motional geometry.  The significance of this
              research lies in characterizing the internal motions in unfolded,
              partially-folded and well-structured peptides.  This information will provide a
              better understanding of changes which occur on transition from the unfolded to
              the folded state of a protein and is crucial to solving the protein folding
              problem.  In addition, this research will increase general knowledge of protein
              dynamics and contribute to the development of better motional models for
              analysis of NMR relaxation and structural data.  ***
