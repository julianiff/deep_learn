Abstract    :
              Abstract- Davis - 9729812    Prof. Robert J. Davis of the University of Virginia
              will investigate the mechanism of promotion of supported Ru metal catalysts for
              the ammonia synthesis reaction, by alkaline-earth elements and rare-earth
              oxides. This proposal is of relevance to the science of catalysis and of wider
              relevance to the chemical industry, in particular that concerned with
              agrochemical and commodity chemical production. Ammonia synthesis over
              base-promoted Ru catalysts may lead to reduced consumption of process energy
              and consequently less environmental impact. Basic promoters for Ru metal will
              include alkali and alkaline-earth as well as rare-earth oxides: K, Ba, Ca, and
              oxides of Ce and Pr, for example. Supports will include zeolites, other oxides,
              and carbon. The proposal objectives are to determine the atomic structure of Ru
              clusters by EXAFS and their electronic structure by XANES and IR spectroscopy
              of adsorbed N2. The promoter distribution in the vicinity of, and on Ru
              clusters over non-zeolitic supports, will be examined by analytical HRTEM, and
              correlated with ethane hydrogenolysis activity. The density of active sites
              will be determined with TPD of N2 and H2 chemisorption, and their intrinsic
              activity by N2 activation and by NH3 synthesis at atmospheric and at 20-bar
              pressure. The surface coverage by various reactive intermediates will be
              investigated by means of steady state isotopic transient kinetics.
