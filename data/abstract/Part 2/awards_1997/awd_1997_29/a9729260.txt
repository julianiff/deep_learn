Abstract    :
              Spanier  DMS 9729260      Monte Carlo & Quasi-Monte Carlo methods are very
              active and pervasively influential areas of applied mathematics in which highly
              sophisticated uses of mathematical modeling, simulation and probability theory
              are used to solve a wide variety of real-world problems not amenable to other
              solution methods. Conventional Monte Carlo methods provide tools for studying
              such problems on a computer, making use of probability theory and statistical
              error estimation. Quasi-Monte Carlo methods are essentially deterministic
              versions of Monte Carlo methods, based not on randomly chosen samples but
              carefully chosen deterministic nodal sets. Their analysis utilizes number
              theory, combinatorics, abstract algebra and even algebraic geometry. And in the
              past several years, exciting new hybrid methods, combining the best features of
              both stochastic and deterministic models, have been developed for application
              to many of the most difficult of today's problems.     The Third International
              Conference on Monte Carlo and Quasi-Monte Carlo Methods in Scientific
              Computing, to be held in Claremont, California June 22-26, 1998, will assess
              recent progress in Monte Carlo and Quasi-Monte Carlo theory and address the
              application of these methods to a range of problems challenging scientists,
              engineers and economists today, problems arising in nuclear physics and
              engineering, semiconductor and computer modeling, cryptanalysis, oil
              exploration, and financial engineering - to name just a few important
              applications.
