Abstract    :
              9729831  Cochran    The proposal is not well written. The goals as stated in the
               abstract and introduction suggest circular reasoning and  tests that cannot be
              done. On page 6, however, there is a  clear statement that they will be testing
              the assumption  that axial depth &/or MBS can be used as a proxy for crustal 
              thickness.  We have been concerned with the use of gravity  data as a proxy for
              crustal thickness, and this work will  test that proxy. It will not be a
              definitive test since  there is still the possibility of temporal changes in 
              crustal thickness, but it will be a systematic study of the  problem. We agree
              with the panel and recommend a one-year  award.
