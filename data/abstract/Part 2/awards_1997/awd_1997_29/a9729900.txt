              Instrumentation:  Research Instrumentation for the Design and Prototyping of
              Emerging Low-Power RF VLSI Technologies    This research instrumentation grant
              enables four distinct research projects:  - Semiconductor Technology CAD
              (STCAD) Tool Integration and Calibration,- Investigation of a Novel Physical
              Phenomena in Deep Submicron Low-Power RF    CMOS Devides and Interconnects,-
              Circuit Simulation Modeling of Low-Power RF CMOS Devices and Interconnects,
              and- Design Optimization and Prototyping of Low-Power Mixed Signal RF CMOS
              VLSI.    To support the aforementioned projects, the Department of Electrical
              Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago will
              purchase state-of-the-art computing equipment dedicated to supporting
              multidisciplinary research in computer and information science and engineering.
              The equipment will be used for several research projects cited above.    The
              primary objective of this proposal is to acquire a high-performance
              multiprocessor and two workstations which will enable performing highly
              cpu-intensive finite-element simulations with reasonable turn-around time. The
              server will provide the performance necessary for simulations of a complexity
              and accuracy not permitted with conventional desktop workstations.  This
              equipment will support over 20 graduate students and one faculty member in
              their research.
