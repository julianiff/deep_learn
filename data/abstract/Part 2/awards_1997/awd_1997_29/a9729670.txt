Altwicker
This dissertation-enhancement award supports Mr. Shawn Ryan,
               a graduate student, in Dr. Elmar Altwicker's group at Rensselaer Polytechnic
              Institute to spend three-and-a-half months in the laboratory of Dr. Ludwig
              Stieglitz of the Institute for Technical Chemistry at the National Research
              Center in Karlsruhe.  While there, Mr. Ryan will make quantitative
              determinations of carbon-chlorine (C-Cl) bonds in various carbons.  The
              formation of C-Cl bonds in residual carbons at certain concentrations and rates
              plays an important role in the formation of dioxins, which are undesirable by
              products of many thermal processes, including waste incineration.  The work
              done in the German lab could aid in the development of techniques to minimize
              Dioxin formation in thermal processes.
