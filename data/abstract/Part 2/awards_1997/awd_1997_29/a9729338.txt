Abstract    :
               This is a study of young workers in changing labor markets, conducting
              quantitative analysis of existing data to develop a new research instrument for
              qualitative interviews.  The objective of the broader research is to examine
              the recent period of widespread economic change to improve scientific
              understanding of how labor markets -- as systems of reciprocal relations
              between human capital and occupational structure -- allocate people to
              positions and create positions for people.  The analysis also relies on a
              cross-national comparison between the United States and Germany, building on a
              renewed interest in comparative work as a means to introduce variation at the
              level of institutional structures.  The quantitative analysis will draw on two
              major longitudinal data sets: High School  and Beyond and the German
              Socio-Economic Panel.     The immediate work combines quantitative and
              qualitative methods in a unique manner, following an innovative approach to
              directly integrate the quantitative findings in open-ended qualitative
              interviews.  Although quantitative data can begin to answer questions of how
              institutional mechanisms link people and positions, a fuller understanding can
              come through in-depth interviews with key institutional actors in labor force
              integration processes, including: administrators and counselors at secondary
              and postsecondary educational institutions, personnel managers, human resource
              managers from large firms, managers and owners of small firms, and staff at job
              search and placement agencies.  This work will develop the instruments and
              methodology required to carry out such research.
