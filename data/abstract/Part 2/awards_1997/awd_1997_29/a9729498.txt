Abstract    :
              This award supports a three year project to address the problems of scale  and
              manageability of multicast on the Internet.  Multicast shows great  promise for
              such applications as real-time multiparty conferencing, but is  hampered by the
              fact that it uses unicast routing technology which is not  designed for such
              applications, and deployment of the MBone isn't  widespread and stable enough
              for reliable communication.   The PI proposes  to develop tools for measurement
              and monitoring the MBone to assist in a  better understanding of its operation
              and as a base for improving its  performance, and then to implement solutions.
