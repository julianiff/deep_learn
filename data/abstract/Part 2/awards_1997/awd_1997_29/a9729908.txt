Abstract    :
              DMI-9729908  Suh  The one-week workshop is for teaching and facilitating the
              discussion of axiomatic design and its applications to manufacturing processes,
              equipment and systems.  The goals of the workshop are: to review the basic
              principles and methodologies of axiomatic design, to share the knowledge,
              results and course materials developed in the field of axiomatic design, and to
              provide a means of networking and exchange of ideas between professors and
              university instructors involved in design education.  The workshop is to be
              arranged with seven instructional sessions, and one breakout session for each
              afternoon to provide ample opportunity for review of materials and follow-up
              discussions.  The workshop proposal was sent out for mail review by three
              reviewers.  It was rated excellent by all three reviewers.  The reviewers feel
              that since axiomatic design is one of major design paradigms used in
              engineering colleges, such a workshop could have a great impact if it could
              have the right attendance.  Axiomatic design is one of major design paradigms
              used in engineering colleges, and it has important applications to design of
              manufacturing processes, equipment and systems.  Such a workshop could have a
              great impact if it could have the right attendance and lively discussions.
