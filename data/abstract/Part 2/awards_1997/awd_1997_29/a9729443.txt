Abstract    :
              Abstract  9729443    J. Kornfield, California Institute of Technology  The
              micro-rheology and flow-induced microstructure of AB diblock and ABC-type
              copolymers will be investigated using a rheo-optic method developed by the
              principal investigator, as well as X-ray spectroscopy and transmission electron
              microscopy.  The emphasis of this study is on the relationship between the flow
              alignment characteristics of block copolymers in simple shear and their
              properties.  A second objective is identification of new microstructural
              phenomena by changing the group of tested copolymers and including newly
              synthesized diblock and triblock copolymers for testing.  Synthesis of the
              copolymers will be performed in collaboration with The Procter & Gamble
              Company.  Discovery of the range of flow behavior of block copolymers and
              establishment of predictive capabilities to guide design of materials for
              processability and function will provide the scientific basis for rational
              design of molecular architecture that optimize the materials properties of
              nanostructured polymers.  ***
