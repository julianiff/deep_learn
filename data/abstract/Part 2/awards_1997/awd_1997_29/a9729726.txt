Abstract    :
                Causal induction, the process of identifying causes for events, plays a
              central role in everyday life as well as in science.  The goal of this project
              is to find out how people discover that one thing causes another, in daily life
              and in the laboratory.  Because relations between causes and effects are
              neither deducible nor directly observable, they must be induced from observable
              events.  Inferring causes is far from trivial; whereas effects regularly follow
              their causes, not all events that regularly follow one another are causally
              related.  Cheng recently proposed a theory of causal induction in which the
              reasoner explains regularity of succession (a function defined in terms of
              observable events) by a general notion of causal power (an unobservable
              theoretical entity), just as scientists explain data with theories.  Cheng's
              theory explains (1) the boundary conditions under which regularity implies
              causality and (2) a diverse set of robust psychological phenomena concerning
              judgments of what causes, or prevents, an effect.  In addition the theory makes
              many novel predictions.  The goal of the proposed research is to test these
              predictions against alternative accounts.  The experiments involve asking human
              subjects to make causal judgments when given information about the occurrence
              of candidate causes for an effect.  The project directly aims at gaining a
              deeper understanding of the process of causal induction; it indirectly aims at
              providing a basis for the development of an effective program for teaching
              scientific methodology.
