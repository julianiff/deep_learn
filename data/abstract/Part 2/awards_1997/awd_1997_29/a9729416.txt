Abstract    :
              "Women in the Sciences & Engineering, 1998: Changes, Choices, Successes" is a 1 
               day conference which will provide a forum for scientists and engineers (both
              early career and experienced) and their teachers, professors and  employers to
              meet, review and analyze together what is known about best practices in
              industrial, government and academic workplaces that increase the participation,
              success and satisfaction of women in science and engineering career pathways. 
              The conference, organized by the NY Academy of Science (NYAS), in collaboration
              with Avon Products, The Radcliffe Public Policy Institute, and Catalyst, Inc.
              is a follow up to the 1972 NYAS conference, "Successful Women in the Sciences:
              Analysis of Determinants," and will be held in New York City in the spring of
              1998.   Conference Proceedings will be published, and made available thought
              the Academy.
