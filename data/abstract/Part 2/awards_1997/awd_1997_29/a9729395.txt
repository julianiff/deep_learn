Abstract    :
              9729395  JOHNSON  This project will provide funds to the University of 
              Minnesota in partial support of the conversion of the  research vessel BLUE
              HERON.  The University purchased the 86  foot ship to support scientific
              research on the Great Lakes  for its newly established Large Lakes Observatory
              located on  the University's Duluth campus.    The project is under the
              direction of Dr. Thomas C. Johnson  who has had extensive experience in
              overseeing ship  operations.    The conversion will include construction of two
               laboratories, installation of an A-frame, an articulating  crane, anchor
              windless, power capstan, a new generator and a  sewage/gray water holding tank.
               The vessel will also be dry  docked, sandblasted and repainted.  ***
