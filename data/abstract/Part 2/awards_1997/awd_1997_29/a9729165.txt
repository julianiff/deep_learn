Abstract    :
              Balsley/Abstract         The purpose of this activity is to obtain vertical 
              distributions of both temperature and moisture near the coast of  Peru (at 4
              degrees South) using radiosondes equipped with Vaisala  sensors.  The larger
              meteorological purpose is to caputrue the  thermodynamic structure of the
              atmosphere during the initial stages  of an El Nino especially in a region
              where such measurements have  never been made.
