Abstract    :
                The investigators will undertake a critical reassessment of
              acceptability/truth-value judgment tasks in second language acquisition
              research, considering the impact of the problems historically associated with
              this methodology on the investigation of interpretive knowledge.  The initial
              hypothesis will be that the truth-value judgment task is the most suitable one
              available for the investigation of most interpretive properties, but the
              investigators will also consider complementing this task with other task types.
               The results of the methodological investigation will provide the basis for
              developing stimuli for a series of experimental studies of second language
              acquisition, extending the domain of second language acquisition research to
              the syntax-semantics interface.  The experimental studies will be designed to
              test the extent to which English-speaking classroom learners exhibit knowledge
              of a particular syntax-linked interpretive asymmetry of the target language
              that is neither directly instantiated in English nor explicitly taught in
              language proficiency courses.  The target languages will include French,
              German, and Swahili.
