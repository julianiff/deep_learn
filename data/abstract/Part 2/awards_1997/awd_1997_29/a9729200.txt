Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds to provide travel grants for  underrepresented
              undergraduate students from REU sites to  present a poster contribution or an
              oral paper at ER97  (ERF97 is the Estuarine Research Federation meeting in 
              Providence, RI in October, 1997).  The PI plans to support  15 students in this
              program, with the overall objective of  engaging these underrepresented
              students in the estuarine  research community.
