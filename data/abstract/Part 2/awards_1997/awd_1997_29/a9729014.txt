Abstract    :
                This project involves the extraction, amplification, and sequencing of
              mitochondrial DNA from a diverse assemblage of extinct primates from
              Madagascar.  These giant lemurs began to disappear approximately 2000 years
              ago, a process that was completed with their final extinction within the past
              several hundred years.  The evolutionary origins of these animals are as
              mysterious as their disappearance.  The proposed research will employ ancient
              DNA techniques to investigate both their origins and their demise.  The initial
              focus of the project will be on reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships
              among and between the extinct and living lemuriforms.  The results will be
              significant for understanding morphological and ecological evolution in a
              remarkably diverse group of mammals as well as for understanding the
              biogeographic history of Madagascar and Africa.  Patterns of genetic diversity
              within extinct lemur populations will also be examined to the extent possible. 
              As dwindling diversity is almost certainly characteristic of living lemuriform
              populations, it seems expedient to explore the genetic patterns of a known
              extinction event with an eye towards avoiding such crises in the future.  The
              results of the project will add to a growing body of information relevant to
              the study of DNA change over time.  This increasingly valuable field has
              applications for disciplines as diverse as the analysis and control of organic
              pathogens (e.g., the AIDS virus), biogeography, phylogenetics, physiology, and
              conservation biology, just to name a few.
