Abstract    :
              Cooper  97-29965  This is an award to support research on a disinfection process
               for water by use of ionizing radiation produced by a beam of  energized
              electrons.  The research will focus on use of the beam  for inactivation of
              Cryptosporidum sp and Giardia sp.  It will  consider the potential use of the
              beam for treatment of raw water  prior to its treatment using conventional
              coagulation,  sedimentation and filtration processes.  The research will also 
              consider the possibility of using the beam to treat filter  backwash water
              prior to its return to the raw water supply line.  Since it is likely that a
              residual disinfectant will be needed  before placement of water into a potable
              water distribution  system, this research will also address the potential the 
              electron beam has for destruction of precursors of disinfection  byproducts
              produced by chemical disinfectants such as chlorine.  Since many of the common
              contaminants of surface and ground water  supplies are organic chemicals
              originating from both point and  non-point sources, the research will also
              examine the potential  use of the beam for destruction of organic pesticides,
              herbicides  and organic compounds that adversely affect the taste and odor of 
              water destined for potable consumption.    The results of this project are
              expected to provide information  potentially useful in considering electron
              beam radiation as an  approach to disinfection of water contaminated with the
              target  organisms.  Co-investigators include Dr. Joan Rose, Professor in  the
