Abstract    :
              9729863  Goodman, David J.  WINLAB (Wireless Information Network
              Laboratory),Rutgers University    CISE Research Instrumentation: Parallel
              Computing For Wireless Networking Research    This research instrumentation
              grant enables the following research projects:        - Scalable Simulations of
              Telecommunication Systems- Interference and Coexistence  of U-NII Band Wireless
              Systems - Routing and Power Control in Multihop Packet Radio Networks -
              Interference Cancellation. WINLAB, an NSF/Industry Cooperative Research Center,
              will purchase a high performance 14-processor SMP computer (SUN UltraSparc HPC
              4000) to support computation-intensive research projects in wireless data
              networking which exhibit considerable degree of untapped parallelism. The new
              and ongoing projects that critically depend on such a computing platform
              include:- Development of a Virtual Wireless Testbed for parallel simulations of
              radio propagation, mobility, network traffic and protocols. The Testbed evolves
              to become a standard research and education tool.- Investigations of
              interference and robust protocols for the wireless systems in the recently
              allocated 5 GHz bands for the Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure
              (U-NII).- Investigations of power control and feasible routing schemes in
              multihop radio networks.- Design of a testbed implementing sophisticated
              multiuser detectors for new CDMA systems.    The purchase of the multiprocessor
              SUN UltraSparc will greatly accelerate research in these areas, as well as in
              other projects involving DIMACS (an NSF S&T Center) and ECE and CS Departments
              at Rutgers, which currently do not have a comparable high performance
              multiprocessor with parallel thread support.
