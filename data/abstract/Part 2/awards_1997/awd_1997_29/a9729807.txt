Abstract    :
              9729807  Zhang, Hantao  University of Iowa    CISE Research Instrumentation: 
              Instrumentation for Research in Search Technology     This research
              instrumentation grant contributes to the purchase of several   CPUs, switch,
              disk and tape which will enable the following projects:    - Asynchronous
              Parallel Search Pruning with Applications,   - Fast Interior Point Optimization
              Algorithms,  - Optimized Motion Estimation Algorithms for Video Compression,  
              - High Performance Satisfiability Testing, and  - Distributed Automated
              Reasoning,    supporting efforts exploring aspects of high-performance search
              technology.     The projects will address:    - Development of nagging, an
              asynchronous, fault-tolerant, parallel search     pruning technique with
              applications to combinatorial optimization,        computational biology, and
              theorem proving;  - Development of fast interior-point optimization algorithms
              and their   application to resource allocation and similar problems;  -
              Optimization-based motion estimation techniques for high-quality video   
              compression;  - Development of efficient satisfiability testing algorithms and
              their   application to constraint satisfaction and problems in discrete
              mathematics;  - Development of distributed automated-reasoning systems based on
              the clause-    diffusion principle of parallel search with applications to
              verification, constraint solving, and logic programming.    In addition to an
              environment for the development and testing of   coarse-grained distributed
              search techniques, this new NSF-supported   distributed computing facility's
              high-speed large-memory CPUs constitute   the only available dedicated
              computational resource for empirical   evaluations of algorithmic performance,
              which may sometimes require weeks   of CPU time.
