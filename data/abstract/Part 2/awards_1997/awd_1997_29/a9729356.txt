Abstract    :
              A variable pressure scanning electron microscope with  cryogenic capabilities
              for research in many aspects of  biology will be purchased.  The proposed
              instrument has  three functional modes.  In addition to conventional high 
              vacuum scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the machine is a  state-of-the-art
              low vacuum scanning electron microscope  that allow almost any biological
              sample to be imaged.    Detailed analysis of morphology is central to many
              aspects  of biology, especially those concerned with the development  of plants
              and animals.  SEM provides a convenient and  sometimes irreplaceable technique
              for these analyses.
