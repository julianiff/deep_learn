Abstract    :
                  9729937   Wu    Males and females from different species have different
              means of communications in the form of sound, odor or visual display.  Such
              differences usually preclude members of one species from recognizing members of
              another species as potential mates.  As a result, a barrier to gene flow,
              commonly referred to as reproductive isolation, is established between
              diverging species.  Without this reproductive barrier, nascent species will
              exchange genes freely and different forms of life will merge into intermediate
              types.  Thus, the biological mechanisms of reproductive isolation are essential
              for maintaining biodiversity.  Understanding the genetics of reproductive
              isolation also has many practical implications in conservation biology and in
              pest control.    However, the genetic basis of male-female communications has
              never been rigorously explored.  This may be due to a lack of species that i)
              are amenable to  genetic analysis; ii) show strong reproductive isolation; and
              iii) are at an incipient stage of speciation.  We have discovered a new system
              in the model organism for genetic research, Drosophila melanogaster , that
              would alleviate all these problems.  Females of this species from Zimbabwe
              (Z-type) and males from the cosmopolitan collections (M-type) fail to
              communicate properly.  All the modern tools of molecular genetics can be
              applied to the study of the genetic control of male-female communication in
              this system.
