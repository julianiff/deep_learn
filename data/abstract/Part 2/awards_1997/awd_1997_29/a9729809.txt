              Acquisition of a Multiprocessor for Multidisciplinary Research in Computing   
              This research instrumentation award serves to acquire a multiprocessor system
              which will enable the following research projects:- Instruction-Level Parallel
              Processors,- Automatic Generation of Benchmarks for Shared Memory Computers,  
              - Finite Element Computations in Structural Acoustics,- Performance Validation
              of Nonlinear Controllers for Magnetic Bearings, and - Nonlinear Vibrations of
              Coupled Fluid-Structure Systems.    Each of these projects involves the
              development of large simulators and the use of compute-intensive simulations
              that require powerful dedicated processors, large RAM capacity, and large I/O
              capacity. Research in ILP processing involves developing decentralized
              execution models and studying them by detailed, parallel simulators. Research
              in automatic benchmark generation involves developing techniques to
              automatically generate multiprocessor benchmark programs from concise algorithm
              specifications, which aids in identifying the top-performing algorithm on an
              individual system basis. Research on finite element computations deals with
              predicting wave propagation from large structures by developing and
              implementing high-order space-time finite element methods and appropriate data
              structures for simulating them on multiprocessors.   Research on nonlinear
              controllers involves the development of improved nonlinear dynamic models for
              active magnetic bearing, and their validation via dynamic simulation on
              multiprocessors. Research on nonlinear vibrations focuses on using
              multiprocessors to develop models and computationally intensive techniques to
              solve the equilibrium and linearized vibration of complex, nonlinear,
              fluid-structure systems used in textiles and high performance underwater cable
              structures applications.
