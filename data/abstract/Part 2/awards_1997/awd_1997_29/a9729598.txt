Abstract    :
                 One of the remarkable properties of the eyes of some animals is  the ability
              to detect the special physical property of  polarization of light.  Polarized
              light is particularly important  underwater, and there is circumstantial
              evidence that some marine  animals use polarized light to detect environmental
              cues.  Many  cephalopod molluscs (cuttlefish, squid, and allies) have highly 
              developed visual systems.  Cuttlefish not only may use polarized  light cues
              for wide-field environmental cues, but may use it also  for displays of
              patterns on the body, as they do with color  patterns for camouflage and social
              displays.  This project  combines photometery (using a new underwater imaging
              polarimeter),  electrophysiology, microscopy, and ethological studies of 
              cuttlefish as an excellent model system for exploring how  polarized light
              might be an important environmental and behavioral  visual stimulus.    
              Results will be important beyond visual neuroscience, for a  better
              understanding of important marine organisms, and for  potential applications in
              aquaculture and in the design of optical  sensors and machine vision.
