Abstract    :
                   This project has two aims. First and foremost is the aim of  collecting
              data on four previously undocumented or poorly  documented languages of Nepal.
              There are at least 130 languages  spoken in Nepal and, of these languages, only
              about 25 have  grammatical descriptions of any sort and many of these are 
              rudimentary. Since no more than about three dozen of Nepal's  language are
              spoken by more than 5000 people, since bilingualism in  the national language,
              Nepali, is now almost universal for adults,  and since economic factors typical
              of many undeveloped countries  are operative in Nepal resulting in increasing
              migration to the  cities, it seems unlikely that the majority of Nepalese
              languages  can survive for more than a generation or two. It is imperative 
              that linguistic fieldwork be conducted now while the majority of  Nepal's
              languages are still spoken by whole communities. The second  aim of the project
              is to provide training in fieldwork and  TibetoBurman linguistics for four
              graduate students.
