Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9729258  SCOTT    The oil and gas industries have a significant
              impact on almost all aspects of life in the U.S.  The Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center for Corrosion in Multiphase Systems at Ohio
              University (EEC-9220961) studies the flow of gas and oil in pipelines. 
              Louisiana State University is attempting to become a research site associated
              with the Center.    This proposal funds a planning meeting to determine the
              feasibility and viability of Louisiana State University becoming a research
              site of the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Corrosion in
              Multiphase Systems.    The research agenda envisioned for the added research
              site would address multi-phase drag reduction.  The specific projects being
              considered are "Field-Scale Testing of Multiphase Drag Reduction in Wells."
