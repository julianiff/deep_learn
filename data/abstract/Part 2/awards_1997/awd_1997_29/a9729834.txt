Abstract    :
              9729834  Pachavis    Polymers in confined spaces are of increasing relevance in
              a  variety of contexts, ranging from coatings applications (paints, 
              lubricants, adhesives) to nanocomposite materials.  This  symposium will focus
              on |addressing recent advances in this  field, especially fundamental research
              that directly impacts  practical applications.  Excellent examples include the
              recent  interest in clay-based polymer composite materials, thin-film  display
              devices, the role of interfacial bonding on defects in  extruded polymer parts,
              and on optical devices constructed from  polymer-inorganic composite materials.
               The fundamental basis of  these applications, including wetting, surface
              segregation and  phase transitions in thin polymer films are also of interest. 
              Both static and dynamic aspects will be stressed.  A focused  session on smart
              materials is also planned.    Contributed papers will be presented in the
              following areas:         Phase transitions and pattern formation in thin films 
                   Nanocomposite materials (including thin-film devices)       Dynamics in
              confined spaces (including dynamics/tribology)       Adhesion and
              compatibilization       Wetting and surface segregation       Brushes and block
              copolymers       Self-assembled systems  ***
