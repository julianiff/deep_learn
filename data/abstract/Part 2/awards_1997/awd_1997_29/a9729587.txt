This one-year award provides support for US-UK cooperative
              research on the causes and consequences of family migration.  The collaboration
              involves Thomas J. Cooke of the University of Connecticut, Paul Boyle of the
              University of Leeds, and Keith Halfacree of the University of Wales-Swansea. 
              The motivation for this research is the conflicting empirical evidence
              regarding the effect of family migration on the labor market, in particular,
              the achievements of married women in labor markets.  While most research
              demonstrates that residential decision-making processes within the family often
              serve to reinforce the marginal socioeconomic position of women, more recent
              research indicates that in particular contexts migration may be a socially and
              economically liberating experience for married women.  The investigators will
              use individual-level data from the Samples of Anonymised Records (SARs) of the
              1991 British Census and the Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) of the 1990 US
              Census to investigate family migration on married, and cohabiting, women and
              men.

The US and British investigators have complementary expertise in
              migration research and extensive knowledge of the PUMS and SARs data
              respectively.  The project will advance understanding of the linkages between
              geographic mobility and socioeconomic mobility in general, and of the
              socioeconomic position of women.
