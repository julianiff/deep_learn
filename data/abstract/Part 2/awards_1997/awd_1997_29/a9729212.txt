Abstract    :
              Recent  measurements at UC Davis and Lawrence Livermore  National  Laboratory
              have shown that very low power, low cost radars can be  used to measure human
              speech articulator positions and motions as  speech  is  articulated.   This
              additional  information  provides  separate streams of data on the motions of
              the vocal folds (i.e.,  providing voiced excitation information) and on the
              soft  palate,  jaw,  tongue,  and  lips.  This project is  designed  to 
              provide  examples  of these data from a representative sample of  speakers  to 
              the  speech community for their analysis.  These include  the  use  of  two  or
               more speech optimized radars with  simultaneous  speech,  optained  in 
              several noise environments.  In  addition,  studies  of  pitch  synchronous
              processing using  the  excitation  information and ARMA methods will be
              provided for selected voiced  speech segments.
