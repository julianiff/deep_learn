Abstract    :
                Recent meteorological predictions indicate that a severe El Nino/Southern
              Oscillation will develop during that latter part of 1997 and extend through
              1998. This ENSO event is predicted to be comparable or more intense than the
              1982/83 event   the strongest ENSO recorded in this century. This SGER study
              will gather baseline data for investigating the effects of this ENSO on
              recruitment and population dynamics of  reef  fish populations in the Galapagos
              Islands. Of particular interest is the effects of hybridization and
              introgression observed between invading mainland species and island endemics
              that resulted from the 1982/83 ENSO. Recent work has found evidence to indicate
              that extensive recruitment of the mainland damselfish species, Stegastes
              acapulcoensis in Galapagos occurred during 1982 83. Currently extant
              populations of S. acapulcoensis coexist in Galapagos alongside the island
              endemic, Stegastes arcilrons. Otolith analyses of adult fish indicate that the
              first cohort of these adults arrived in 1983. The population has subsequently
              grown, presumably from local recruitment. In addition, a significant proportion
              of hybrids have been detected by electrophoretic protein analyses. Dr.
              Wellington predicts that another invasion will occur in early to mid 1998. He
              add associates will document the distribution and intensity of recruitment of
              S. acapulcoensis in the Galapagos Archipelago. These data will provide
              invaluable information needed to predict potential effects of climate change on
              insular marine organisms.
