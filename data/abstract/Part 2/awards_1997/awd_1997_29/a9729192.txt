Abstract    :
              9729192  CRADDOCK    Fruit flies (family Drosophilidae) have been used for more
              than a century as model systems to explore major issues in biological and
              environmental sciences.  The Hawaiian Drosophilidae, an assemblage of about a
              thousand species, represent the premier example of founder-effect speciation
              and adaptive radiation on oceanic islands, but except for the picture-winged
              cluster of about 100 species, their taxonomy and systematics are poorly known. 
                In this collaborative project, the systematic biology of the Hawaiian
              drosophilids will be reviewed, and a robust phylogeny reconstructed.  The work
              will include field collections, descriptions of species, establishment of
              cultures, and collections of morphological, molecular and behavioral characters
              for phylogenetic analysis.  The resulting analysis is expected to be
              definitive, and to support future analyses of developmental and behavioral
              pathways in these flies.
