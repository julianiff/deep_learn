Abstract    :
              J. F. Drake State Technical College, located in Huntsville, AL has served the
              area for 36 years.  It provides technology degrees as well as diploma and
              certificate programs in various technical  areas.  This grant will help fund
              Internet access for the institution by supporting the acquisition of a leased
              line, connection equipment, installation services and service provider fees. 
              The students and faculty of the J. F. Drake State Technical College need the
              Internet connections to be able to  access information resources throughout the
              state, the nation and the world.  The connection will benefit the faculty,
              staff students of this institution as well as the community in general. The
              award provides partial support of the project for two years.
