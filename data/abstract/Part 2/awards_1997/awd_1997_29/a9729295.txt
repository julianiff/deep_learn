Abstract    :
              The 1996 Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) makes fundamental changes in
              national goals with respect to pesticide regulation and use.  This project will
              analyze the normative and conceptual issues underlying the shift, particularly
              with respect to `consumer right-to-know` provisions.  The multi-disciplinary
              team of investigators will identify the nature and kinds of values to which the
              legislation responds, examining values ranging from trespass and wrongful harm
              to efficiency and wealth production, in relationship to right-to-know
              provisions in the law.  They will review federal and state programs and
              policies, as well as the food information and consumer right-to-know
              literatures, with particular attention to measures of effectiveness and
              perceptions of fairness, and to ways to adapt lessons from published experience
              to the FQPA requirements.  This comprehensive catalogue of consumer
              right-to-know strategies and federal and state programs and policies will be
              classified according to which values and interests they serve.  The
              investigation will discuss the civil, social, economic, industrial, and moral
              implications of the analysis and propose guidelines for consideration by
              legislators, regulators, and others.  It will identify a series of qualitative
              and quantitative research projects whose results could help to support, refute,
              or augment the recommendations.  The project will result in papers,
              presentations, and a book.
