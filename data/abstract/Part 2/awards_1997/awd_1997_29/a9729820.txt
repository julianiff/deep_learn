              Abstract - Swaney - 9729820  Formulating and solving process simulation models
              is divided between setting up the models and then obtaining solutions
              numerically.  The status of modelling and user interfaces has undergone
              advances in recent years.  The performance of available numerical algorithms is
              less adequate relative to the task required.  Complex process models may be
              difficult to solve, yet these can lead to the best technology.    This research
              will develop a new method for the numerical solution of large scale steady
              state process simulation models.  The need is for a robust method to solve the
              significantly nonlinear process models that arise.  The modeller should not be
              required to supply initial guesses, but should be provided with an unambiguous
              mechanism to diagnose model misformulations.  This approach is to express each
              process subsystem model as a variational problem.  Domain constraints such as
              variable nonnegativity are directly enforced.  Solving the coupled subsystems
              then becomes a problem in noncooperative equilibria, and may be solved as an
              equilibrium programming problem.  In this form, rigorous existence theorems may
              be invoked.  A new pseudo-physical homotopy-based solution procedure will be
              tested.  By navigating nonsmooth points and bifurcations along the path,
              solution attainment is provable.
