Abstract    :
              The award supports a seminar with a special focus on Multimedia Technologies for
              Collaborative Design and Manufacturing.  The workshop will focus on the
              multimedia-based information technologies and collaborative tools in design,
              manufacturing processes, service/maintenance, and infrastructure.   The
              objectives of this special seminar are to:  (1) understand the impact of
              information technologies and collaborative tools for product development; and
              (2) develop new system concepts on integrated design, manufacturing, and
              maintenance/service system framework for improved research direction and
              intellectually integrated research activities.  The outcomes of the workshop
              could provide the research community with very valuable information about
              opportunities and directions of integrated design, manufacturing,
              maintenance/service engineering.
