Abstract    :
              9729405  Whitesides  The research undertaken is composed of two parts: new
              materials and methods of fabrication will broaden the range of capabilities in
              MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) design, providing new capabilities and
              offering systems which are easier to manufacture and are more cost-effective,
              in comparison with traditional Si-based micromachining. This portion of the
              project focuses upon the demonstration of the value of new classes of materials
              (especially organic polymers) and on new methods of fabrication (especially
              microprinting, micromolding and related techniques).  The second part of the
              effort will focus on the development of pumps, valves and fluidic couplers in
              polymeric materials to exploit their lack of mechanical rigidity, on the
              development of surface modification techniques to avoid clogging and surface
              contamination, and on techniques for rapid prototyping of microfluidic systems
              in plastics, glasses and silicon/silicon dioxide.  ***
