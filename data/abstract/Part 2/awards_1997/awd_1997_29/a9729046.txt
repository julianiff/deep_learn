              EPA-NSF Joint Initiative, 1997     Principal Investigator:    Daniel T.
              Schwartz  Affiliation:                       University of Washington      This
              grant is awarded through the Separations and Purification Program sub-element
              of the Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of the Chemical and
              Transport Systems Division. The principal investigator is Daniel T. Schwartz at
              the University of Washington. The research is directed towards the development
              of a new class of environmentally benign ion exchangers using metal
              hexacyanoferrate (HCF) derivatized electrodes.  In these materials, the
              oxidation state of iron is potential modulated between the ferric and ferrous
              state. By thus modulating the charge density, the electrode behaves as an ion
              exchange material allowing other cations to load into the electrode or elute
              out into solution. The PI seeks to study this behavior for a variety of ions to
              determine exchange efficiency and loading capacities. Fundamental studies
              include using in-situ imaging Raman spectroscopy and photoelectrochemistry to 
              characterize the ion-exchange process.    The research  will have technological
              implications in the development of environmentally benign ion exchange
              processes. The materials used are innocuous, and easily regenerable through
              potential modulation rather than the chemical methods used to regenerate
              conventional ion-exchange resins. Since ion exchange processes are ubiquitous
              in the food, pharmaceutical, nuclear and chemical industries, the development
              of environmentally benign ion exchange processes will have a major impact on
              process operation in these industries.
