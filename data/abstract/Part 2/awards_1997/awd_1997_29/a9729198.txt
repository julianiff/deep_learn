Abstract    :
              The project continues partial support for an instrumentation repair and
              maintenance service for small colleges in Appalachia and surrounding regions in
              Kentucky, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. These small
              academic institutions must buy and use modern scientific instruments so their
              mostly rural students are not at a disadvantage compared to those at major
              universities. Factory service for these instruments is, however, prohibitively
              expensive, and they are often idle when in need of repair due to this high
              cost. This program addresses this need by utilizing the service infrastructure
              at the University of Kentucky College of Engineering as a support base of
              technical expertise to keep these instruments operational at affordable costs
              to the small colleges.  Partial funding is being provided by the grant, and
              through user fees the colleges are contributing an increasing share of the
              costs as the program becomes self-supporting.
