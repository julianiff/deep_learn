Abstract    :
                An atomic absorption spectrometer, a UV-VIS  spectrophotometer, a Laboratory
              Information Management System  and a dedicated laboratory network server will
              be purchased.  These will be used in studies of the biogeochemistry of small 
              forested watersheds, atmosphere - forest interactions,  aquatic-atmosphere
              interactions and aquatic nutrient cycling  and foodweb dynamics.
