Abstract    :
              This dissertation project is an investigation of the interplay of the Monticello
              radiation-standards debate with the specialty of health physics.  It focuses on
              an understanding of the history of health physics and of the mechanisms by
              which politics interacted with science in the context of the civilian nuclear
              power debate.  Through the examination of the unexplored impact the Monticello
              controversy had on health physic's concepts and profession, the study offers a
              promising basis on which to elaborate some of the most prominent arguments of
              the social construction of science.  The funds will be used to research
              documents used by each of the protagonist parties in the Monticello debate, on
              documents pertaining to the history of health physics, and on oral interviews
              with scientists who participated in the debate and/or were members of the
              Health Physics Society.
