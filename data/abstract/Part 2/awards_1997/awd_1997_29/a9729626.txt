Abstract    :
                          Leech Lake Tribal College is located on an Anishinabe reservation
              and provides college courses to approximately 240 students.  The College will
              use this grant to connect it's campus to the Internet.  The students and
              faculty of the Leech Lake Tribal College need the Internet connections to be
              able to access information resources throughout the state, the nation and the
              world.  The connection will benefit the faculty, staff students  of this
              institution as well as the community in general.  The award provides partial
              support of the project for two years.
