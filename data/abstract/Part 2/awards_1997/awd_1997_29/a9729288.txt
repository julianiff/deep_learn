Abstract    :
              Gregg  9729288  A field experiment will be conducted to measure ocean mixing  in
              the Indonesian  throughflow. An acoustic Doppler current profiler and a high 
              frequency acoustic  backscatter system will be used in conjunction with a 
              microstructure profiler to  link the microstructure to the processes generating
              the  mixing and to provide a  means for parameterizing the results in terms of
              the forcing  conditions. The  study will focus on the Banda Sea as a site of
              very intense  conversion of  barotropic tidal energy to baroclinic energy that
              can lead  to strong mixing of the  water masses.
