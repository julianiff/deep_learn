Abstract    :
              9729526  Lawton    This U.S.-Brazil award will support research collaboration 
              between Dr. Michael A. Lawton of Rutgers University and Drs.  Marcio Lamais and
              Helaine Carrer of Universidade de Sao  Paulo in Brazil.      Most plants
              undergo a symbiotic interaction with arbuscular  mycorrhizal (AM) fungi.  This
              interaction is important for  nutrient assimilation and for plant growth and
              health, yet  there is scant information regarding the molecular and  genetic
              basis for AM colonization of plants.  The  investigators plan to use gene
              tagging techniques to  characterize plant genes whose expression is associated
              with  specific stages of AM infection.      The three investigators each bring
              a unique expertise to  this project.  Dr. Lambais is an expert in plant:AM 
              interactions, Dr. Carrer is expert in plant transformation  and molecular
              genetics, and Dr. Lawton in molecular biology  of plant:pathogen interactions.
              The final result of this  work will be a collection of tagged plants that will
              be of  general use, made freely available to the research  community.
