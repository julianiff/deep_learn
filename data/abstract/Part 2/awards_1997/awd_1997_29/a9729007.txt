Abstract    :
                The research will examine the nature of the human sentence comprehension
              system by examining two aspects of syntactic processing which have previously
              received little direct attention: whether the comprehension system can maintain
              multiple competing phrase structure representations in parallel or is instead
              limited to considering only one possibility at a time; and how the
              comprehension system handles subject verb agreement, which requires the
              tracking of syntactic features across intervening material. Both of these
              issues have implications for a variety of theories of sentence processing and
              ambiguity resolution. Examining subject verb agreement also provides an
              opportunity to investigate very general feature processing mechanisms required
              for a variety of syntactic and non syntactic computations in human language
              comprehension, and permits consideration of a series of novel predictions made
              by recent constraint based lexicalist theories. These issues will be
              investigated with a variety of techniques, including on line reading for
              comprehension, off line sentence and sentence fragment ratings, sentence
              completion tasks, and analyses of published text corpora. The experiments
              examining the possibility of parallelism will determine ambiguity resolution
              preferences for an ambiguity not previously investigated, and then use the
              ambiguity to consider the parallelism issue, as well as how it interacts with
              working memory available to the comprehender, which may be a factor in limiting
              parallelism. The experiments examining subject verb agreement will investigate
              the mechanism underlying syntactic feature tracking and the degree to which
              that mechanism is independent of non syntactic (lexical, semantic/conceptual,
              and discourse) mechanisms. The results of the experiments should lead to more
              finely specified linguistic, computational, and psycholinguistic models of
              comprehension, and a better understanding of human sentence comprehension in
              particular.
