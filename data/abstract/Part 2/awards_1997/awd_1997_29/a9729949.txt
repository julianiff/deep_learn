              Through Time-Accessing Science through Technology:  A K-12 Project     
              abstract:  This project develops modules to simulate a series of visits or
              tours to a paleontology museum.  Within the modules, each basic tour, including
              narrative and images, emphasizes the major science concepts needed to
              understand "a big idea."  The tours are produced in three levels: K-4, 5-8,
              9-12, each in English and Spanish.  Within any given classroom, student levels
              vary, so teacher can assign students to a tour at an appropriate level. 
              Included are embedded activities, side trips for more depth, and a visit to a
              research lab where students learn the processes of science first-hand and
              develop research skills.  Each module includes an on-line Teacher's Guide that
              contains: teaching strategies, instructional activities, connections to
              Standards, assessment, and resources for further teacher understanding.  All
              materials are available through Web access or on CD-ROM.  The project models
              state-of-the-are research and technology and employs instructional strategies
              that are encouraged in K-12 classrooms where science is taught in a connected,
              conceptual, and constructive approach.  Open-ended inquiry allows students to
              be actively engaged in their own construction of the concepts and story.   Cost
              sharing is 17%.
