Abstract    :
              9710003  Stixrude    The PIs will address two major geological questions using a
               combination of high-pressure experiments (both multi-anvil  devices and
              laser-heated diamond cells) and first-principles  quantum-mechanical
              calculations:  1) How does the redox state  affect the relative stability of
              the major constituents of the  mantle and core? and 2) How does the redox state
              effect the  partitioning of geophysically and geochemically important  elements
              among major mantle  and core phases?  Their objective is to develop new avenues
              of  research regarding the Earth's redox state, ranging from the  practical to
              the fundamental: for example, from developing means  of characterizing and
              controlling redox state in experiments at  ultrahigh pressures (P) and 
              temperatures (T), to understanding the meaning of a component's  fugacity at
              P-T conditions far above the critical point.  Multi-  institutional
              collaboration will be an important aspect of this  research both because of the
              diversity of state-of-the-art  experimental and theoretical methods to be
              employed (no one or  two groups have sufficient expertise), and because this
              will  allow significant cross-checks of the results between different 
              laboratories, between different experimental methods, and between  theory and
              experiment.  ***
