Abstract    :
              Abstract  DBI-9729600    An isotope-ratio mass spectrometer for research in the 
              fields of Ecology and Environmental Biology at Northern  Arizona University
              will be purchased.  This instrument will  be used by 15 faculty members in 5
              different departments to  address questions such as tracing energy flow through
              food  webs, determing the fate of environmental contaminants  (e.g., runoff of
              fertilizer from agriculture into aquatic  ecosystems), measuring the efficiency
              with which plants use  water, identifying the sources of water to riparian 
              vegetation, and measuring turnover of nitrogen and carbon in  terrestrial
              ecosystems, particularly changes in these  processes in response to
              environmental perturbation.  Use  will also include applications in
              Archaeology, determining,  for example, when human societies have relied on
              certain  plant species such as corn, which has a distinctive carbon  isotope
              "signature" that is reflected in the bones of  consumers.
