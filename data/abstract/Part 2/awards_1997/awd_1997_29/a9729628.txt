Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of  ANIR's 
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides partial 
              support for two years for a DS-3 connection to the vBNS.  Meritorious research 
              to be supported through access to the vBNS includes work in high-energy 
              physics, astronomy, geological sciences, and the computational sciences. 
              Collaborations are expected, through the network, with colleagues at SLAC, 
              Yale, MIT, Washington, Columbia, Florida, Stanford, and others. Work is also 
              expected to involve access to federal laboratories (e.g., Fermilab, Rutherford 
              Lab) and researchers on interconnected NGI networks, including ESnet and DARPA 
              networks.
