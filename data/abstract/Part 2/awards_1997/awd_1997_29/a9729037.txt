Abstract    :
                The goal of this  research is to investigate the relationship between the
              human sentence processing mechanism and the available computational resources.
              A promising new theory of this relationship is proposed whose main notion is
              locality: the Syntactic Prediction Locality Theory (SPLT). There are two
              components to the theory: an integration component and a memory cost component:
               ª Integration resources are required to link new words into current syntactic
              and discourse structures. This includes thematic role assignment and matching
              syntactic category predictions. It is proposed that longer distance
              integrations are more costly and hence more time consuming than shorter
              distance integrations.  ª According to the memory resource component of the
              theory, memory resources are required to maintain the prediction of each
              syntactic category that is needed to complete the input string as a grammatical
              sentence. It is proposed that the memory resources required to retain a
              predicted category increase over distance.  The research consists of three sets
              of self paced reading experiments that address a number of predictions of the
              SPLT and other theories of language comprehension. The first two sets of
              experiments test predictions of the SPLT in English, and the third set of
              experiments explores the cross linguistic generality of the SPLT by testing the
              theory in a language with very different syntactic structure from English:
              Japanese.
