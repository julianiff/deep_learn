The Bilinear Matrix Inequality (BMI) provides a
              powerful formulation of a large class of problems appearing in robust control,
              such as: fixed order H-infinity, mu / km synthesis, decentralization,
              simultaneous stabilization, etc. The BMI can be reformulated as a nonconvex
              programming problem and has also very deep interconnections with the Linear
              Complementarity Problem and the Semidefinite Programming Problem. In recent
              publications several aspects of the BMI pertaining to these problems have been
              studied. The basic aim of the proposed research is to examine further the
              theoretical structures of the BMI as well as to develop efficient algorithms
              for solving it.  The development of efficient algorithms for solving BMI's will
              constitute a major part of the present effort. The theoretical insights that
              will also be pursued will be primarily utilized for gaining insights to be used
              in the development of such algorithms. The method to be employed will rely on
              the areas of Linear Complementarity, Semidefinite Programming and Parallel
              Algorithms for nonconvex programming. Several practical applications of Control
              Theory pertaining to robust control stand to benefit from such a study. Besides
              robust control, there are also other areas of applications such as signal and
              image processing, economics, graphs and combinatorial theory, etc., where such
              study will be of use.
