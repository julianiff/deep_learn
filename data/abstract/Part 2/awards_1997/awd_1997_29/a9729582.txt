Abstract    :
              9729582  Jiang and Lin    This award supports collaboration between H.X. Jiang
              and  J.Y. Lin, Department of Physics, Kansas State University,  and Bei Zhang, 
              Department of Physics, Peking University, on  fabrication and optical studies
              of gallium-nitride  microcavities. Gallium nitride and its allied alloys have 
              attracted considerable interest recently due to their  applications for optical
              devices which are active in the  blue and ultraviolet wavelengths, and
              electronic devices  capable of operation at high temperature, high power
              levels,  and harsh environments.    During the period of the proposed
              cooperative research,  microcavities and laser cavities will be prepared by the
               Peking University group and picosecond time-resolved  photoluminescence
              studies will be carried out by the group  at Kansas. The major goals of the
              research are to identify  possible lasing mechanisms in nitride lasers and to 
              investigate and understand the basic physical properties  related to future
              nitride optoelectronic devices such as  microcavity lasers and vertical-cavity
              surface-emitting  lasers.
