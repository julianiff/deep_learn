Abstract    :
              9729256  Thier    A book titled, "From Sputnik to Standards-The Process of
              Science Education Development" is being prepared by the Science Education for
              Public Understanding Program at the Lawrence Hall of Science.  The focus is on
              the processes and techniques of successful materials-centered instructional
              development and effective dissemination and implementation.  The book is
              suitable for professional development seminars for instructional materials
              developers and associated professionals as well as school, university, and
              private sector groups and governmental and private agencies that provide
              financial support for materials development.  Highly successful instructional
              materials development projects can be found in settings as diverse as small
              colleges, independent research and development organizations, professional
              societies, and school systems and are led by scientists, engineers, and others
              with widely different educational backgrounds.  The investigation looks at
              examples of all such efforts and isolates the important characteristics of
              successful projects.
