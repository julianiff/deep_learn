Abstract    :
              The Foundation for Independent Higher Education requests support  from NSF to
              connect seven of their member institutions of higher  education to the
              Internet.  These include:    Harcum College, Bryan Mawr, PA    Lancaster Bible
              College, Lancaster, PA    Our Lady of the Holy Cross College, New Orleans, LA  
               St. Gregory's College, Shawnee, OK    Warner Southern College, Lake Wales, FL 
              Each of the institutions included will connect to the Internet  using service
              providers in within their respective areas.    These institutions of higher
              education need the Internet  connections to be able to access information
              resources throughout  the state, the nation and the world.  The connection will
              benefit  the faculty, staff students of these institutions as well as the 
              community in general.  The award provides partial support of the  project for
              two years.
