Abstract    :
              Barufaldi    9729963    This proposal, sponsored by the University of Texas at
              Austin, seeks funds to carry out a five-year project to enhance teachers of
              grades 6-8 in the content and pedagogy of Middle School physical science. The
              project first works with the instructional teams (science professors, science
              education professors, master teachers and science specialists), known as the
              Professional Development Academy (PDA), and then with science teachers.
              Altogether, each year, 96 PDA professionals will be involved in training and
              400 teachers. The state-wide delivery system will be through the 20 Texas
              Regional Collaboratives. The enhancement program will include content
              acquisition, pedagogy enhancement, alternative assessment strategies,
              technology and equity. Training workshops will involve the best of currently
              available instructional materials and teachers will be helped to integrate the
              new curriculum in their classroom by PDA staff.     The cost share is 67% of
              the NSF award.
