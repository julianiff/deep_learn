Abstract    :
              9729691  Huband    The American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) is
              conducting a one year exploratory study in the dissemination of developments in
              engineering education, both teaching techniques and course content, by a novel
              means namely arranging visits by highly respected engineering educators to
              locations either at or near schools of engineering to encourage participation
              by being readily accessible to engineering educators.  It is hoped that this
              method will take recent developments in engineering education to educators who
              might not otherwise be contacted.  This project is an experiment to determine
              if this method of dissemination offers advantages of lower cost and greater
              effectiveness over other methods.
