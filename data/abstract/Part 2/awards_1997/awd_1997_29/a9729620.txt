Abstract    :
              This proposal responded to the innovative technology connections for K12 
              portion of NCRI's "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It
              requested $117,000 to connect seven schools in four rural counties to  the
              Internet using wireless technology.    This award is made under the innovative
              technology connections portion of  NCRI's "Connections to the Internet"
              announcement, NSF 96-64, which covers  K-12 education institutions (including
              vocational technical schools),  public libraries and museums.  It provides
              partial support for 24 months to  connect seven schools in four rural counties
              to the Internet using wireless  technology. The Center for Education
              Integrating Science, Mathematics and  Computing (CEISMC) of the Georgia
              Institute of Technology will assist in  performance of the project.
