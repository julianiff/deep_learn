Abstract    :
              9729034  Kelts         This award provides fifty percent partial funding support
              for  the Limnological Research Center's lake core acquisition, storage  and
              analysis facility located on the University of Minnesota-  Minneapolis campus. 
              The remaining support necessary to operate the  facility is to be provided by
              the University of Minnesota.  The  core laboratory is a multi-user facility
              that provides the  limnological research community equipment and infrastructure
              for  collecting and analyzing lake sediment cores from a variety of lake 
              environments.  The study of lake sediment cores contributes  directly to the
              analysis of past climate variations, and by making  available coring equipment,
              core storage, and instrumentation for  analysis, the core laboratory of the
              Limnological Research Center  is contributing to the U.S. research effort in
              Global Change.  ***
