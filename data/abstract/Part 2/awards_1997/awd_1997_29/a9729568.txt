Abstract    :
                In this project, the PI formulates game theoretic models to study the
              formation and stability of networks, with applications to merger policy and the
              internet. The research is inspired by possible applications of the theory that
              is being build, rather than taking the theory itself as a point of departure.
              Insights gained from the study of network structures in economic and social
              situations, are used to identify specific types of networks and specific
              circumstances in which networks play an important role. Additional structure
              imposed by incorporating the institutional details of these situations are
              likely to produce tractable models and policy-relevant results. The existing
              models of (the formation of) cooperation structures are extended to encompass
              costs on links in networks and to study situations in which there are
              externalities between groups of agents.  With the rapid evolution of the
              internet recent years and globalization of the economy, it is apparent that
              networks have a major influence on our daily lives. Recent research tackles the
              problem of modeling cooperation structures from several different perspectives.
              However, interesting problems remain that cannot be answered using the models
              and the techniques that are currently known. These problems include mergers by
              Cournot firms and the extension of the internet and the problems associated
              with this extension.
