Abstract    :
              9729246   JACKSON   The nigrostriatal dopamine pathway is an  anatomically and
              chemically distinct and important component of  the motor control system in
              mammals.  The prenatal development and  physiological function dopaminergic
              neurons in this pathway is  known to be accelerated in female rats as compared
              to males, and  this sex difference does not appear to be dependent on steroid 
              hormones.  Little is currently known about the underlying  mechanism of the
              more rapid maturation of this pathway in females,  whether other types of cells
              in this system show similar sexual  differences, or whether these early
              differences persist during  postnatal development and adulthood.  This study
              seeks to  determine if dopamine and other neurotransmitters have regulatory 
              effects on neuronal growth and synapse formation in this system,  and to
              characterize the range of the affected neuronal types at  both pre- and
              postnatal times.  The results of this research will  enhance our understanding
              of how hormone-independent gender  differences arise in this system, and
              whether these differences  persist during postnatal development.
