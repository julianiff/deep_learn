Abstract    :
                   This project will acquire and analysis data from a  pilot seismic study in
              the Oman ophiolite.  The primary  objectives of the experiment are to
              investigate the  feasibility of using seismic methods to image subsurface  Moho
              structure in this well-mapped ophiolite and to compare  measurement of seismic
              anisotropy with those calculated from  petrofacric data.
