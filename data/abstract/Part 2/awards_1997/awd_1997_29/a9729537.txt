Abstract    :
              9729537  Mehdy  Plant disease resistance mechanisms include the rapid production
              of active oxygen species in response to pathogen attack.  Active oxygen species
              such as hydrogen peroxide serve as secondary messengers to mobilize changes in
              the expression of some defense-related genes.  Dr. Mehdy and her associate's
              prior studies of cultured dwarf French bean cells treated with fungal elicitor
              provided evidence that hydrogen peroxide from the oxidative burst results in
              the rapid degradation of a normally stable cell wall proline-rich protein mRNA,
              PvPRP1.  The ensuing reduced synthesis of the PvPRP1 protein is likely to
              contribute to remodeling of the cell wall to make it more resistant to pathogen
              attack.      To understand the mechanism of PvPRP1 mRNA downregulation, Dr.
              Mehdy and her associates will focus on the biochemical characterization and
              cloning of a 50-kD RNA binding protein that specifically binds to the PvPRP1
              MRNA.  Since the purified protein requires reduced sulfhydryl group(s) for RNA
              binding activity, specific cellular reductants that may play a regulatory role
              will be investigated in in vitro assays.  Thirdly, Dr. Mehdy and her associates
              will begin to use the genetically amenable legume species, Medicago truncatula,
              to screen for mutations in components that lie between pathogen-induced
              hydrogen peroxide and regulation of PvPRP1 mRNA expression.  This study will
              contribute to understanding signalling pathways involving active oxygen species
              and suggest strategies for improving disease resistance in crops.
