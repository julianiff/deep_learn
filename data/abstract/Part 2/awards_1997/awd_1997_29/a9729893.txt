Abstract    :
              9729893  Jones, Mark T.  Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University
              (Virginia Tech)     CISE Research Instrumentation: A Research Laboratory for
              High-Performance Computing,Configurable Computing, and Computer Networking   
              This research instrumentation grant enables five distinct research projects:  -
              Computational Physics- CAD for Digital Systems- Effective Parallel Numerical
              Software for Networks of Workstations-Network Protocols and Performance 
              -Configurable Computing Machines.    To support the aforementioned projects,
              the PIs are building a research laboratory comprising sixteen Pentium II-based
              personal computers, configurable computing boards, and a high-speed network
              switch. In addition to supporting the needs of the individual projects, the
              laboratory serves as a focal point for collaboration between the various
              projects.  The choice of Pentium II-based computers and configurable computing
              boards for the basic architecture of the laboratory not only intersects with
              the interests of the PIs, but also yields an excellent price/performance ratio
              for the applications of interest.
