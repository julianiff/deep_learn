Abstract    :
                This proposal will provide funds for an integrated rapid  mixing system that
              will allow stopped flow, continuous flow,  freeze quench and chemical quench
              experiments to be carried  out.  In the stopped or continuous flow modes
              reactions can  be studied by absorption, fluorescence or Raman scattering  and
              circular dichroism.  In the chemical and freeze quench  modes reactive
              intermediates can be trapped and then  characterized by electron paramagnetic
              resonance, nuclear  magnetic resonance, or other spectroscopies.  Projects will
               be conducted by six major users from the Departments of  Biochemistry and
              Physiology and Biophysics.  The  instrumentation will also be available to
              several additional  users and will be part of a NIH supported Training Program 
              in Molecular Biophysics.  In general, the instrumentation  will be applied to
              the study of protein and ribozyme  folding, several enzyme substrate
              interactions, ligand  binding in hemoglobins, protein-DNA interactions and
              protein  translocation.
