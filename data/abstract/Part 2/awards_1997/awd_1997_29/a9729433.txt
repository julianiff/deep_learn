Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   of
              the Chemistry Division, Magid will use light scattering and   small-angle
              neutron scattering (SANS) to investigate polyelectrolytes and   the formation
              of giant micelles that are self-assembled in aqueous   solutions from
              surfactants.  In selected cases the micellar solutions   will be studied in
              flow fields similar to those found in some of the   applications for which
              these solutions are used.  Both self-organizing   and covalent polyelectrolytes
              are to be studied, providing a valuable   bridge between what are often
              considered two different fields of study.    The SANS experiments proposed here
              will provide data on chain   conformations as a function of intrinsic stiffness
              of the polyelectrolyte   chains.  Of special interest are the changes in
              micellar length and in   spatial organization (conformation) that occur with
              changes in surfactant   concentration.  This work will produce the first
              quantitative numbers   concerning the concentration dependence of micellar
              growth parameters in   dilute solutions.  Micelles and polyelectrolytes are
              broadly found in biological systems,   where they have a variety of structural
              and functional roles.  They are   also ubiquitous in consumer and industrial
              applications such as   personal-care products, drug-delivery systems, viscosity
              modifiers in   foods and in processing of polymers, drag reduction and
              shear-thinning in   heat-exchanger fluids, paints, and surface modification of
              materials.    Several recent theoretical advances have pointed to the need for
              new   experimental data such as Magid will gather in her studies of thread-like
                micelles and the influence of polyelectrolytes on them.
