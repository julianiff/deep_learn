Abstract    :
              Ebert      As part of a study of the possible influence of large-scale  current
              patterns on the recruitment of sea urchins, we have  been monitoring the weekly
              settlement of sea urchins at  sites in northern and southern California since
              1990.  Past  El Nino events appear to have significantly affected the 
              settlement of several species.  In northern California, an  unusually high sea
              urchin settlement in 1992 and 1993 was  associated with the breakdown in
              upwelling and changes in  surface currents, as indicated by satellite imagery. 
              In  southern California, however, there was evidence of  decreased settlement. 
              Currently a new El Nino event is  occurring in the southern hemisphere.  We
              propose a  collaborative study that will expand the spatial scale of  our
              observations to include central California and to  increase the taxonomic scope
              of our investigations by  including brachyuran crabs and bivalves.  This
              investigation  will provide a unique opportunity to test predictions based  on
              our earlier work in different oceanographic regions.
