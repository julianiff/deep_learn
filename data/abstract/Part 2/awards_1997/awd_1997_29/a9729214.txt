Abstract    :
              This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to Cornell University  
              supports the research of Professor Geoffrey W. Coates.  The themes of the  
              research are synthesis and application of enantiomerically pure   helicates. 
              Work is directed to the synthesis of two classes of optically   active ligands
              that are specifically designed to form enantiomerically   pure helicates in the
              presence of metal ions that prefer tetrahedral   coordination geometries. 
              Investigations include the mechanism of helix   wrapping and unwinding and the
              application of helicates as catalysts for   asymetric synthesis.  The project,
              with components of organic synthesis,   inorganic stereochemistry, and
              catalysis, facilitates the comprehensive   training of graduate students.  The
              research leads to the synthesis of a new class of optically active   compounds
              whose helical structures resemble those of proteins and nucleic   acids. 
              Applications provide new opportunities in the fields of   enantioselective
              catalysis, biochemistry, and molecular topology.
