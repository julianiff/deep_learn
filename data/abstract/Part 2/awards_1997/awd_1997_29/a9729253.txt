Abstract    :
                   The authors are developing techniques for use of a  geometric relationship
              between hotspots and the seamounts  producted by them that allows the authors
              to decouple the  age-progression from the geometry and accurately determine 
              hotspot locations on the basis of seamount locations alone.  They propose to
              compile a seamount location database and  fully develop the technique to
              address a number of  questions.  How many hotspots are there? Are hotspots 
              stationary?  Which seamounts were created by hotspots? Where  are extinct
              hotspots?  What is the temporal and spatial  record of intraplate volcanism?
              Are hotspot fluxes steady?  How accurately can absolute plate motions be
              resolved?
