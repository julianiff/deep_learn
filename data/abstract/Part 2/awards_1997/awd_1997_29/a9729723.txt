Abstract    :
                  The Upper Bucks Technical School, located in Perkasie, PA is  provides both
              degree and certificate programs to a student body  of about 800.  This grant
              will help fund Internet access for the  institution by supporting the
              acquisition of a leased line,  connection equipment, installation services and
              service provider  fees.  The students and faculty of the Upper Bucks Technical 
              School need the Internet connections to be able to access  information
              resources throughout the state, the nation and the  world.  The connection will
              benefit the faculty, staff students  of this institution as well as the
              community in general.  The  award provides partial support of the project for
              two years.
