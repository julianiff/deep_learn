Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    OPP-9729575  WALSH, JOHN  UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS     The project
              will utilize ice thickness measurements taken from submarines from 1977 - 1992
              in the vicinity of the North Pole to analyze whether variations in ice dynamics
              or thermodynamics account for the observed changes in ice thickness that have
              occurred.  The investigator will tune the dynamic and thermodynamic models to
              reduce the difference produced by the models from the observed thickness
              changes in the submarine data.  The analysis of the actual vs. predicted ice
              thickness will allow examination of whether dynamic or thermodynamic parameters
              in the models have a greater influence on the changes from observed thickness. 
              The results are critical to understanding the driving force behind changes in
              ice thickness.  If the mechanism most responsible is thermodynamics, then the
              potential for global climate change to have an effect on ice thickness may be
              predicted with the thermodynamic models using temperature changes for the
              Arctic predicted from increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
