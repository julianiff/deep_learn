Abstract    :
              9729413  Bryers    We hypothesize that the bioavailability of adsorbed organic
              contaminants is determined by their conformation upon adsorption and that this
              conformation is affected by the chemical properties of the surface and the
              contaminant.  Research will quantify the surface chemistry effects on
              adsorption conformation and the subsequent availability of adsorbed
              contaminants for bacterial degradation.    We will determine the degradation
              kinetics for model compounds separately and as mixtures in suspended pure and
              mixed bacterial cultures.  Biofilm formation kinetics for pure and defined
              mixed cultures, cultivated on a benign substrate will be determined.  Silicon
              crystals of known texture will serve as control surfaces.    Next we will use
              self assembled monolayers (SAMs) to bind desired functional groups to silicon
              substrata; thus controlling local surface chemistry at constant topography. 
              Variation in surface chemistry of each substratum will be determined by a
              regimen of  surface analyses.    Single organic contaminants, then mixtures of
              those contaminants will be exposed to the various substrata.  Contaminant
              configuration will vary due to the pre-treatment chemistry or the spatial
              variation in that treatment.  Contaminant conformations will be quantified
              using the techniques above.    Rates of bacterial cell adhesion and biofilm
              formation will be measured non-invasively using fluorescent confocal
              microscopic image analysis.   Degradation of adsorbed contaminants will be
              monitored using fluorescent reporter genes.  Rates of contaminant degradation,
              alone or within a mixture, will be correlated to the molecular configuration
              adsorbed to the surface.
