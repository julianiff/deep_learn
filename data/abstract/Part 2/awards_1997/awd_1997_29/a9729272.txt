Abstract    :
               This project will study fundamental theoretical problems which arise in the
              design of a reconfigurable intelligent manufacturing workcell.  The goal of
              this project is to model, develop, and experimentally test a new integrated
              sensing, planning and control methodology for the automation of cooperating
              machine modules acting in reconfigurable workcell environments. The research
              will focus on the following specific subproblems:  (1) create sensing based
              perceptive frame for coordinating tasks in the workcell; (2) develop
              event-based planning and control for machine module coordination in the
              workcell; (3) study the self calibration algorithms for workcells; and (4)
              perform experiments to test and evaluate the research results.     The research
              objectives are:  (1) reduce down time of machine operations in workcells; (2)
              create a perceptive frame that adapts the planning and execution  of
              cooperating machine module workcell tasks to the geometric and dynamic
              uncertainties automatically, and reduce the need for precision fixtures; and
              (3) reduce the ramp-up time when reconfiguring a manufacturing workcell.
