Abstract    :
                    This project will examine changes in gender differences in victimization
              of men and women by lethal violence, including suicide, homicide, and
              accidents. The theory motivating the research leads to several predictions: (1)
              Regarding time trends, gender differences in lethal violence first narrow and
              then widen with continued change toward gender equality; (2) regarding age, the
              reversal in the direction of the trend in gender differences occurs more
              quickly and with a smaller narrowing among younger groups; (3) regarding
              national differences, the adjustment occurs more quickly and with a smaller
              narrowing among nations with collectivist political institutions. The project
              will gather data on: mortality from suicide, homicide, and accidents for men
              and women of all ages in 18 nations between 1953-1992; over-time female labor
              force participation, national product, unemployment, marriage, divorce,
              fertility rates, public spending for children, social protection, and maternity
              care; national indicators of institutional structures promoting collective
              social protection, social equality, and women's participation in the economy
              and polity. With these data we can describe trends, patterns, and variation in
              gender differences in lethal violence using measures of mortality from suicide,
              homicide, and accidents for each age group, year, and nation, and study the
              effects of dynamic and institutional variables. Although focused primarily on
              macro-level processes, the findings should provide a more detailed
              understanding of the consequences of changes in gender inequality, and shed
              light on the experiences of gender equality in the United States compared to
              the experiences of similar high income democracies with different policies and
              structures of collective social protection.
