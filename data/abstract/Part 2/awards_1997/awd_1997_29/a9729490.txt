Abstract    :
                    Eight investigators from five departments of Duke  University will
              purchase an isothermal titration calorimeter.  This instrument will provide the
              investigators with access to  a state-of-the-art isothermal calorimetry
              instrument which  will allow elucidation of the fundamental thermodynamics of 
              molecular recognition processes in research currently  underway in the
              laboratories of the investigators. Among the  systems to be studied are: (1)
              protein - ligands and their  interactions; (2) signal peptides in lipid
              bilayers; (3)  carbonic anhydrase and metal affinity; (4) extracellular  matrix
              proteins and cell receptors; (5) membranes and  macromolecular binding; (6)
              interactions of ATP and other  agents with DNA topoisomerase; and (7)
              neurotrophins in  cortical neurons. The new instrument, in conjunction with 
              ongoing structural and biochemical studies will permit a  molecular level
              dissection of structure-function  relationships in these important systems.
