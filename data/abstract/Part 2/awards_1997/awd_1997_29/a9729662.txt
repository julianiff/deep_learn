Abstract    :
              9729662  Peralta    This award provides funds to support two three-month
              research  visits by Dr. Rene C. Peralta, Center for Cryptography, Computer  and
              Network Security (CCCNS), University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee,  for 
              collaboration with Dr. Eiji Okamoto, School of Information  Science, Japan
              Advanced Institute of Science and Technology  (JAIST), Ishikawa, Japan.  Their
              research is concerned with the  design and implementation of algorithms which
              solve, for as large  a size as possible, those number-theoretic problems which
              are the  pillars of modern cryptography.  Determining what "small-size" is  too
              small to be secure is the main focus of this research  project.    The project
              will consider a host of problems such as primality  testing, fast arithmetic
              with large numbers, diophantine  approximation, rapid factorization of small
              numbers,  factorization of random numbers, and other problems that may  arise
              as the research progresses. The project will benefit from  access to the
              massive computational resources, five  supercomputers,  available at the host
              institution.  Collaboration with JAIST also will provide access to untranslated
               Japanese literature and access to symposia where Japanese  research results
              can be received without the usual delay in  availability to the West.  The
              project is mutually beneficial as  it will provide ready access by the Japanese
              collaborators to  research results at CCCNS.  This project is supported under
              the  Science Fellowship Program between the National Science  Foundation and
              the Japan Foundation Center for Global  Partnership.  ***
