Abstract    :
              9729257  Geist  Funds were requested to help subsidize the costs of young
              scientists (graduate students and early-career professional) to attend the
              Geological Society of America Penrose Conference on the Evolution of Ocean
              Island Volcanoes that will take place in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador, form
              June 4 to 12, 1998.  This meeting is being  co-sponsored by the Geological
              Society of America, the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry
              of the Earth's Interior (IAVCEI) and the Charles Darwin Foundation.  Funds will
              be distributed by the three co-convenors of the conference and is their
              intention to recruit as diverse a group as possible, especially in terms of
              experience level (the main purpose of this request), areas of interest and
              specialty, and nationality; this strategy will hold for students as well as
              academics.  Students and professionals will apply for funds by submitting a CV,
              a short statement of financial need, topical interest in the meeting,
              qualifications, and title of proposed poster session.
