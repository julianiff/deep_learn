Abstract    :
              This collaborative project will bring to light an overlooked astronomical
              controversy of previously unsuspected importance for the interpretation of the
              Copernican revolution.  Johannes Regiomontanus was the leading mathematical
              astronomer of the fifteenth century;  his critical analysis of Ptolemy's
              `Almagest` provided an important stimulus for Copernicus's development of his
              sun-centered model of the solar system.  Regiomontanus's `Defense of Theon
              against George of Trebizond` is a very rich but completely unstudied 573-page
              attack on Trebizond's presentation of the `Almagest,` the work that Copernicus
              would eclipse.  This work of Regiomontanus's illuminates the most important
              known clue about the emergence of Copernicus's cosmology, for it fleshes out
              Regiomontanus's reasoning in proposing the alternative models that Copernicus
              would later use.  In this collaborative project the PIs will transcribe and
              analyze Regiomontanus's lengthy text, present their most important results in
              four preliminary articles, and begin the monograph they will write about this
              astronomical controversy and its significance in the history of cosmology.  The
              project will be done in collaboration with Richard Kremer at  Dartmouth
              College, who is funded separately for this work through grant SBR9720672.
