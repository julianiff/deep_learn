Abstract    :
              Abstract  9729041  G. Klinzing, University of Pittsburgh  This is a GOALI
              project between University of Pittsburgh and The Dow Chemical Company.  The
              objective of this proposal is to provide basic understanding of highly
              concentrated gas-solid flows through pipes based on data from a large-scale
              system.  It is well known that small-scale laboratory facilities cannot fully
              reproduce gas-solids transport phenomena in large industrial scale.  The flow
              patterns in horizontal and vertical dense phase pneumatic transport will be
              investigated as a function of the materials properties and operating conditions
              using 3 and 4 inch pipes and specific experimental tools for dense phase flow. 
              Collaborations include other industrial units (Dow, MAC, DuPont, Eastman,
              Babcock, and others) and leading research groups in U.K. and Japan. The
              experimental tools include particle plug and shear testers, pressure
              fluctuation transducers, fast video, electrical tomography, as well as
              statistical and Fuzzy logic analysis methods.  The tested materials will be
              determined by an industrial advisory board in order to be representative for
              industrial applications.    The proposed project, if successful, will provide a
              predictive method for calculating the performance of large scale industrial
              dense phase conveying systems based on the fundamental materials properties,
              and principles of powder and fluid mechanics.  Graduate students will perform
              their research in both the academic and industrial facilities.  ***
