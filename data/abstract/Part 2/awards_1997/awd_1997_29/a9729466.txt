Abstract    :
                This proposal requests funds to purchase equipment to  support research in
              molecular and cell biology at Washington  State University.  The items of
              equipment requested are a  tabletop ultracentrifuge and a phosphoimager.  This 
              equipment will support the research programs of five  scientists representing
              four departments (Biochemistry,  Genetics and Cell Biology, Botany, and
              Microbiology).  The  research interests of the user group are diverse,
              including  membrane biochemistry, the biochemical and molecular basis  for
              carbon and nitrogen allocation in plants, protein-DNA  interactions regulating
              transcriptional expression of  mammalian genes, mRNA degradation in eukaryotic
              cells, and  genetic regulation of binding of the bacterium C. jejuni, a  common
              cause of diarrheal disease, to the intestinal tract.
