              Research Instrumentation: Applying Software Engineering Methodologies to
              Robotics Tasks: A Cross Disciplinary Approach    This research instrumentation
              enables research projects in:- Rapid Prototyping and Synthesis of Software for
              Embedded Systems, - Studies of Different Issues in Vision-Based Robotic
              Grasping,- Sensor Fusion in Vehicle Applications, and  - Behaviors of Multiple
              Self-Interested Robots.    To support the aforementioned projects, the
              Department of Computer Science at the University of Minnesota will purchase a
              VXI-bus embedded real-time software development environment, several mobile
              platforms, and robot simulation software which will be dedicated to research in
              software engineering, robotics, and artificial intelligence. The equipment will
              be used for several research projects, including in particular:
              requirements-based prototyping and synthesis of control software for embedded
              systems, closed-loop vision-based robotic grasping, sensor fusion for vehicle
              applications, and behaviors of multiple self-interested robots.      In
              addition to the contributions of the individual projects, the collaboration
              between the PIs will help evaluate cutting edge software engineering techniques
              on realistic projects (for example, evaluation of scalability, evaluation of
              ease of use, and applicability to the domain) as well as evaluate the use of 
              rigorous software engineering techniques in robotics and AI applications (for
              example, the effect on reuse of control algorithms, and the effect on system
              performance, robustness, and safety).    The equipment purchase includes (1) a
              complete VXI-bus embedded software development environment, (2) one VXI-bus
              embedded computer with interfaces for sensing and control applications, (3)
              low-cost mobile platforms serving as testbeds for the proposed projects, and
              (4) robotics simulations software to be used in task planning and software
              prototyping.
