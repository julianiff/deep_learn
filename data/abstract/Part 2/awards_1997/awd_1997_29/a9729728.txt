Abstract    :
              Abstract    SGER Award- Paul Quay / UW    The PI proposes a novel method to
              reconstruct the time history of the 14C and 13C/12C record of the dissolved
              inorganic carbon (DIC) in the surface waters of the subpolar North Pacific
              since 1900.  The reconstruction is based upon C isotopic analysis of archived
              salmon scales.  The overall goal of this work is to compare this reconstructed
              record to changes predicted by ocean general circulation models (GCM's) in
              order to better constrain the GCM fluxes and predicted rates of oceanic CO2
              uptake.  The proposal fits the category of high-risk interdisciplinary science,
              and as such is appropriate for SGER award.  The most important first step is
              for the PI to demonstrate the reliability of this technique and thus recreate
              at least a partial historical C isotopic record.  With such data in hand the PI
              will extend considerably our understanding of circulation and C inputs to the
              N. Pacific.  In addition, the PI will be in a position to demonstrate the
              potential for applying this novel approach to future studies in ocean sciences.
