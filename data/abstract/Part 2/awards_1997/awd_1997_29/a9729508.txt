Abstract    :
              The National Academy of Sciences - National Research Council will convene a
              workshop and undertake related activities that will review existing and
              proposed intellectual property rights (IPR) regimes for databases and other
              collections of information with special emphasis on science and technology as
              both users and generators of such databases.  The workshop will identify policy
              and legal aspects of such regimes and asess their importance for science and
              technology; identify and analyze benefits that might accrue to science and
              technology from these regimes and issues that might impact science and
              technology negatively as a result of such regimes; and develop conclusions and
              recommendations that might assist in addressing these issues.  The workshop is
              expected to include presentations on the key issues; panel and general
              discussions; and development of conclusions and recommendations.  The workshop
              is expected to result in a report to sponsors and to the research community.
