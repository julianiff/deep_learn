              Instrumentation: Application Oriented Parallel Computing and Scientific
              Computing Research on a Commodity Parallel System    This research
              instrumentation serves primarily as an experimental testbed   for the following
              research projects:- Scalable Parallelization of Spatial Data Structures and
              Applications, - Parallel Methods for Protein Accessible Surface Area
              Calculations,- Development of Parallel Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)
              Methods for  Simulating Transient Electromagnetic Problems,- Direct Solution of
              Large Sparse Irregular Systems of Equations on Massively Parallel Computers,
              and- Performance Measurement in Distributed Systems.    The instrumentation
              grant funds the purchase of a 32-processor workstation cluster built from
              commodity microprocessors and networking components. The equipment is to be
              used to set up a Parallel Computing Laboratory in the Department of Computer
              Science at New Mexico State University. The workstation cluster will be used as
              a distributed memory parallel computer dedicated to support application-driven
              parallel computing and high-performance scientific computing research on
              low-cost commodity-based systems.    Results from this research are to be made
              available in the form of libraries, tools and applications software for
              researchers interested in low-cost commodity-based parallel computing. The
              equipment also supports an interdisciplinary educational program in
              computational science.
