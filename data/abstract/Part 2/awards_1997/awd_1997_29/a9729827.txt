              CISE Research Instrumenation:  Infrastructure for an Information-Based
              Manufacturing Testbed:  A Joint Initiative of Carnegie Mellon and Drexel
              University    This proposal initiates an education and research effort on  
              information-based manufacturing.  This collaborative effort between   Carnegie
              Mellon and Drexel Universities, along with numerous industrial   partners, will
              create a multi-university Information-based Manufacturing   Testbed consisting
              of pilot projects in the areas of    - Assembly Process Planning,  -
              Subcontractor Selection; and  - Engineering Design Repositories.    The
              CMU-Drexel Testbed will be used by researchers, students, and industry  
              participants to conduct exploratory research toward the reduction and  
              elimination of information bottlenecks in the manufacturing enterprise. The  
              fundamental research thrusts of the Testbed will include (1) to define and  
              test computing and network architectures to support information-based design  
              and manufacturing services; (2) to deploy prototype services for assembly,  
              process selection, design-for-manufacture, and artifact fabrication; and (3)  
              to create novel methods for search, retrieval and tracking of engineering  
              data as it is acted upon by teams of people and software agents. The final  
              results will be open to the public---creating an online forum for providing  
              many with a means to become familiar with the latest information technology  
              for engineering.
