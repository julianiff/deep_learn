Abstract    :
                Chimpanzees behave aggressively in a variety of contexts, but the underlying
              causes are often unclear.  This project will be the first to study hormonal
              aspects of aggression and dominance in wild male chimpanzees.  The study will
              collect and analyze hormonal data in order to investigate both the proximate
              and ultimate causes of chimpanzee aggression.  In addition to chimpanzees, this
              study should provide a broader comparative framework for understanding human
              aggression, due to our own very close genetic affinity to chimpanzees.    The
              research will be carried by examining testosterone levels, collected using a
              completely non-invasive method, in individual chimpanzees living in Kibale
              National Park, Uganda. Comparative data will be collected from a second
              community of chimpanzees living in Gombe National Park, Tanzania.  Intersite
              differences in patterns of chimpanzee social behavior are not well understood,
              and this study is designed to help resolve these differences.
