Abstract    :
                9729669  RHODES    The pituitary gland is a small organ located at the base of
              the brain in mammals.  In response to signals from the brain and the
              bloodstream, the pituitary secretes hormones that regulate growth, reproductive
              development and status, milk production, the response to stress and control of
              functions such as body temperature and metabolism.  During development, genes
              are turned on and off in a regulated program that allows the specialized
              hormone-releasing cells to be derived from simple, common precursor cells. 
              Molecules known as transcription factors act as switches to coordinate this
              program of gene activation.  Using state-of-the-art molecular technology, Dr.
              Rhodes will determine the specific mechanism of a pituitary transcription
              factor called P-Lim.  P-Lim is essential for pituitary development since
              individuals with mutated P-Lim do not develop pituitary glands and thus, die
              shortly after birth.  The results from these fundamental studies will
              significantly further our understanding of pituitary development and function. 
              Moreover, the knowledge gained from work on the pituitary can impact on related
              processes, such as the development of the nervous system, the blood and the
              limbs.
