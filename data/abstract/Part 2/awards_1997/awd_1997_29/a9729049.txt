Abstract    :
                The Tulane University Fish Collection, a "National Center"  category
              collection with 6.8 million fluid-preserved  specimens in over 183,000 lots, is
              one of the largest  collections of post-larvel fishes in North America.  The 
              type collection contains 42 holotypes, and 150 paratypes  (44,395 type
              specimens total).  The collection also contains 1352 skeletons, 2010 
              radiographs, and 2428 scale and otolith samples.  The Tulane  Fish Collection
              is unique among North American fish  collections in having a large average
              number of specimens  per lot, high numbers of large specimens from many taxa, 
              comprehensive regional coverage, an extraordinarily high  quality of
              preservation, and high repetition of material,  mostly from long-term
              environmental-monitoring surveys of  major rivers in the Gulf-South region. 
              The long-term survey  samples provide a wealth of material for population and 
              community studies, and studies of feeding, reproductive  biology, and
              toxicology, in addition to more traditional  uses in fish systematics.  Our
              Goals for the tenure of  this project are:) recurate 53% ) (61,290) of the 
              approximately 116,000 lots that remain in isopropanol, plus  963 large jugs; 2)
              consolidate 26% (30,645) of the jarred  lots into smaller jars; 3) continue
              moving Long-Term Survey  materials to the Large Speciment/Long-Term Survey
              facility;  and 4) spread lots remaining in the fish range onto new and 
              existing shelves and arrange the lots by drainage/ocean  basin.
