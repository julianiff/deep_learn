Abstract    :
               The work supported by this NSF grant will concentrate on maximizing the 
              knowledge which can be gained from a new and highly important collection of  
              early hominid fossils from the Afar region of Ethiopia (Aramis). These human  
              ancestors are the most ancient ever recovered (4.4 million years old) and are  
              so unlike any other known human ancestors that they have been assigned to the  
              new genus and species Ardipithecus ramidus.  In addition to having extremely  
              primitive teeth and jaws, this new species is also ecologically unusual,  
              because it represents the first human ancestors which lived in environments  
              dominated by closed woodland and forest species.  Their cranial and dental  
              anatomy make them the most similar to living apes of any human ancestral  
              species, and their study promises to shed important new light on the age and  
              causes of the separation of human and ape ancestors, an event which  
              essentially initiated the rise of humans. Our research has two primary goals:  
              1) A definitive descriptive analysis of the limb bones of these new hominid  
              fossils; 2) Functional and comparative analysis of these remains to ourselves  
              and to other living and fossil primates.
