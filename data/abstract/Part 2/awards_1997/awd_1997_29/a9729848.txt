Abstract    :
              9729848  Gupta, Gopal  New Mexico State University    CISE Instrumentation:
              Parallel and Distributed Constraint Programming Systems on Multiprocessor PCs:
              Implementations and Applications    This research instrumentation serves to
              support the purchase of four-processor Pentium-based multiprocessors and a fast
              Ethernet hub to enable the following projects in parallel and distributed
              computing at the NMSU Computer Science:  - Parallel and Distributed Constraint
              Logic Programming Systems,- A Concurrent Constraint-based Unified Framework for
              Internet Programming, - Parallel Constraint-based Natural Language Processing,
              and- Parallel Specification and Verification of Real-time Systems,all sharing
              the common theme of constraint-based technology. For the projects cited, the
              purchased equipment facilitates: first, the design and implementation of
              systems that exploit parallelism implicit in logic and constraint programs;
              second, the distributed network is enabling the prototyping of a unified
              framework for Internet programming, encompassing symbolic constraints and
              concurrency; third, parallel constraint software technology will significantly
              speed up the execution of large natural language processing applications; and
              fourth, the development of parallel tools for verifying large, complex
              real-time systems.    Parallelism and distributivity are key to accomplishing
              the goals of these projects. The chosen platform is cost-effective, flexible,
              and provides a balance between shared memory multiprocessors, which are
              efficient but not scalable, and distributed networks of processors, which are
              less efficient but scalable.
