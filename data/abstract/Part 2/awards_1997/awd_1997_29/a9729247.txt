Abstract    :
              9729247  Burrill    The Gateways VI Conference, titled Implementing and
              Articulating Issues Across Grade Levels, brings together leaders from all the
              National Science Foundation funded elementary, middle, and high school
              comprehensive mathematics curriculum projects in order to share information and
              experiences and address questions that have surfaced as materials have been
              developed, tested, and implemented.  This edition of Gateways is hosted by the
              National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and the major foci of the
              conference are articulation across grade levels and implementation.
