Abstract    :
                Recent advances in social choice theory point to the importance of
              institutions in leading to consistent and coherent collective outcomes. 
              However, not all instances of social choice can be characterized as taking
              place under strong political institutions.  There is a particular lacuna in the
              area of internal politics, where topics such as what to do about CFC emissions,
              what tariff and trade policies should be formed, or how to collectively
              eliminate weapons stockpiles, are all questions of social choice.  Rather than
              relying on institutional explanations, this research explores a different
              source of structure:  the role of knowledge systems.  The complexity of most
              decision contexts forces participants to rely on knowledge structures such as
              mental models or cognitive schemas.  This research combines
              cognitively-realistic assumptions about individual preference formation with
              abstract social choice theory.  The resulting research illustrates the
              importance of shared knowledge structures for collective choices.
