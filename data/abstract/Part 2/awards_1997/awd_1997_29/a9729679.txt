Abstract    :
              9729679  Saadatmanesh  This project will conduct a preliminary analytical and 
              experimental study to investigate the feasibility of  strengthening buildings
              by plastic materials.  The  analytical study will focus on the optimization of
              the  relative ratio of the carbon and glass fibers for the best  absorption and
              dissipation of the energy due to a blast  loading.  The theory will be
              developed in general format  that could be applicable for the design of this 
              strengthening system for a typical building.    The experimental part of the
              study will focus on the  evaluation of this concept under simulated blast
              loading  delivered by means of a high impact load.    Concrete as well as brick
              speciments will be constructed and  retrofitted with the hybrid composite sheet
              and then tested  under impact loading.  Control, unretrofitted specimens will 
              also be tested. The test results will verify the  effectiveness of this
              strengthening system.  ***
