Abstract    :
                 This primate paleontological research project spans three field seasons of
              excavation in the Fayum Basin of Egypt, with subsequent study and analysis of
              recovered fossils carried out at Duke University and cooperating research
              laboratories.  The objective of the project is to learn more about the earliest
              forerunners of monkeys, apes, and humans.  Previous discoveries have made this
              one of the world's most important locations for research in primate origins and
              evolution.  The current project will yield skulls, jaws and post-cranial
              skeletal elements from a broad range of early primates of both Eocene and
              Oligocene age represented in the Fayum.  These date to between about 36 and 26
              million years ago.  Primate fossils, to be excavated from nearly a dozen
              quarries in the Fayum, are seldom found as associated skeletal parts.  As a
              consequence, sustained research and excavation over long time periods is
              required to augment our knowledge of the more than two dozen extinct primate
              species known from the region by the systematic accumulation of additional,
              frequently unknown, limb bones and cranial elements.  Most of the described
              species are known only from jaws and teeth, so much remains to be discovered. 
              Africa appears to be the continent where higher primates arose, and the Fayum
              holds the only continuous sequence of deposits in Africa during the time period
              of interest.
