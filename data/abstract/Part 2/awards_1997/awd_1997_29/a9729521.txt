Abstract    :
                This award supports the travel and living expenses of 12 US participants to a
              US-France   workshop on population and evolutionary biology, scheduled for
              January 6-10, 1998 in   Paris, France.  The co-organizers are Susan Mopper of
              the University of Southwestern   Louisiana and Yannis Michalakis of Marie and
              Pierre Curie University.  The topic of this   workshop is local adaptation in
              parasite-host associations.  The goals are to broaden the   participants
              exposure to diverse study systems and empirical and theoretical strategies for 
               investigating parasite-host interactions and to develop a long-range strategy
              for renewing,   creating and sustaining productive international collaborations
              in population and   evolutionary biology.  The workshop will lead to new
              collaborations between American and French participants   and advance
              understanding of common biological principles and general theories of  
              population and evolutionary biology of parasite-host interactions.
