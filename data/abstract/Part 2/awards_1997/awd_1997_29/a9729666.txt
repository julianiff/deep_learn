Abstract    :
              9729666  Greenfield    This award is for support of a planning visit to Fiji by
              Dr.  David Greenfield of the University of Colorado, Denver, to  plan a study
              of coral reef cryptic fish assemblages.  Ultimately, the principal investigator
              would like to compare  mechanisms controlling community organization in the
              Pacific  with previous results from the Atlantic.  To this end, he  has
              collected preliminary data that suggest that different  mechanisms may be
              operating in the Pacific compared with  those in the Atlantic.
