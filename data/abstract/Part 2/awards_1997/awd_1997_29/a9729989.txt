Abstract    :
                The primary objective of this Doctoral Dissertation is to generate hypotheses
              indicating why levels of democracy vary within democratizing countries. 
              Scholars have largely ignored this empirical puzzle.  Secondary objectives of
              this project include preliminary testing of the hypotheses generated and an
              illumination of broader questions regarding a) different determinants of
              democracy at national and subnational levels, b) the relationship between
              democratic development at national and subnational levels, c) weaknesses in
              current conceptualizations of democracy, and d) the importance of subnational
              democracy.  To meet the objectives, the student collects data through
              interviews and printed material from four oblasts (provinces) in Russia and
              Kyrgyzstan. To explain subnational variation in democracy, the project compares
              two `more` democratic oblasts and contrasts them with two less `democratic`
              oblasts.  Based on an expert survey and background data, a more democratic and
              a less democratic oblast have been chosen from each country.  This dissertation
              research promises to contribute to the theoretical literature on
              democratization and to understand the factors which promote democracy in
              provinces or states where it is weak.
