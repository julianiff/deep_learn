              ABSTRACT  "Enabling and Extending the Arizona Infrastructure for Advanced 
              Networking and Applications Research via the vBNS"   Arizona State University 
              PI: William Lewis  ANI-9729709        This award is made under the high
              performance connections portion of  ANIR's "Connections to the Internet"
              announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides partial support for two years for a DS-3
              connection to the vBNS.  Applications include projects in geometric modeling
              and visualization, scanning probe microscopy, solid freeform fabrication,
              interactive nano-visualization, solid state electronics research, distance
              learning research, metacomputing over asynchronous networks, materials research
              and environmental studies.  Collaborating institutions include the San Diego
              Supercomputer Center, NIST, New York University, University of Arizona, and
              NraD San Diego.
