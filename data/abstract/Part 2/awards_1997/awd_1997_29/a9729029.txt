Abstract    :
                The fungi from the Kansas State University (KSU) herbarium  were donated to
              the New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) in  March, 1999.  This herbarium consists
              of approximately  32,000 specimens of which about half belong to published  and
              widely distributed, uniform sets of duplicate  specimens.  The remaining
              approximately 16,000 are unicate  specimens. NYBG will incorporate the unicates
              into its  fungal herbarium, and to offer the duplicates to other  institutions.
                 Incorporation of the Kansas State University fungus  herbarium will involve
              segregation of unicate from  duplicate specimens, repair, databasing,
              nomenclatural  updating and filing of specimens to be retained. Based on 
              previous experience, this work will require approximately  3200 person-hours,
              or two F.T.E. Curatorial Assistants for  one year.    Currently the KSU
              specimens are stored at NYBG in sealed  shipping boxes, because of a lack of
              herbarium case space  for unassimilated specimens.  Fungal specimens stored 
              outside of standard herbarium cases are at risk of damage  from  mold and
              insect infestation.  Therefore it is  imperative to incorporate the KSU
              specimens into the NYBG  fungal herbarium cases as soon as possible.  In the
              fall  of 1997, the NYBG will begin construction of a new Plant  Sciences
              Building, which will house the entire herbarium  and library, and the
              collections will be moved to the new  building in 1999.  Planning for the
              arrangement of the  fungal herbarium in the new building will be greatly 
              facilitated if the KSU specimens have been incorporated  before the herbarium
              is moved.
