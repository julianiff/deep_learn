Abstract    :
              Abstract - Doyle - 9729782    The pulp and paper industry (PPI), a very capital
              intensive component of the U.S. manufacturing sector, is a major source of the
              total U.S. industrial output of hazardous wastes.  In order to maintain and
              enhance the global competitiveness of the U.S. PPI while ensuring a safe,
              clean, and sustainable environment, waste minimization and processing measures
              need to be integrated within the overall operation of existing (and proposed)
              paper mills.  The goal of this research is to develop and demonstrate computing
              based modeling and optimization methodologies which will facilitate such
              integrated operations.    The technical work involves development of efficient
              methods for solving highly structured mixed integer linear programming
              algorithms (MILP's), development of hierarchical representations for describing
              noisy process trends, the development of mathematical programming based
              approaches to large scale model predictive control, and the investigation of
              formulations for incorporating discrete choices of process models for transient
              operating conditions.  The developed operational methodology for
              environmentally conscious paper mill operation will be benchmarked against an
              industrial case study in cooperation with an industrial collaborator from the
              pulp and paper industry (Weyerhaeuser).
