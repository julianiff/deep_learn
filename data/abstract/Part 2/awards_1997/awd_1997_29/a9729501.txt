Abstract    :
                    This two-year award to Wayne State University is made under the  high
              performance connections portion of ANIR's "Connections to  the Internet"
              announcement, NSF 96-64.  Wayne State will connect  its campus-wide ATM
              backbone network to the National Science  Foundation's very high speed Backbone
              Network Service (vBNS) by  establishing an OC-3c connection to MichNet, the
              statewide  computer network operated by Merit Network, Inc.  The connection  at
              Wayne State University will complement the high performance  connections that
              Merit is establishing with the help of NSF  (NCR-9616938) at the University of
              Michigan and Michigan State  University.  Collectively these OC-3c connections
              will support  special research requirements at Merit, Michigan State 
              University, the University of Michigan, and Wayne State  University.  This NSF
              award provides partial support for the  Wayne State component of Merit's OC-3
              infrastructure, which is  connected to the vBNS in Chicago.    With this high
              performance connection, Wayne State will expand  current research and
              collaboration with both academic  institutions and federal laboratories.  Wayne
              State's OC-3  connection will support research related to automatic 
              parallelization environments for distributed high performance  computing, a
              collaborative digital library, quantum chemical  reaction dynamics, quantum
              molecular dynamics, and high energy  physics.  Each of these projects will
              benefit considerably from  the increase in network bandwidth and performance,
              bringing  substantial advances to research in these fields.  In addition, a 
              high performance connection at Wayne State will encourage other  faculty to
              pursue research opportunities that require access to  resources at other vBNS
              connected sites.
