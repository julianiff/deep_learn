Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of  ANIR's 
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides partial 
              support for two years for a DS-3 connection to the vBNS. Through this new 
              connection, Northeastern intends to facilitate a significant increase in 
              science and engineering research with specialized computing and communication 
              requirements. Representative projects include applications in high-energy 
              physics, biophysics, computer science, materials science, and engineering. 
              Related work will involve international collaborations, access to very large 
              datasets, interactive real-time experiments, and large-scale testing and 
              comparison of algorithms. Northeastern is collaborating with Boston University 
              in establishing its connection. At a later time, should Boston University 
              upgrade to OC-3 connectivity to the vBNS, Northeastern expects to do likewise.
