Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9729091  RINGO      Direct conversion receivers for wireless
              communication require less components and eliminate the need for bulky image
              rejection IF filters.  This is joint "TIE" project linking the research
              capabilities of two Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers (I/UCRC)
              to study techniques for on-line adaptive digital compensation of the
              imperfections of analog components of mixed-mode transceiver circuits.    The
              research site will be conducted at Oregon State University, the research site
              of the I/UCRC for Design of Analog Digital Integrated Circuits, and the
              University of California,  San Diego I/UCRC for Ultra-High Speed Integrated
              Circuits and Systems.
