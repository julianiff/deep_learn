Abstract    :
              Abstract  9729121  Lange  The angular intensity distribution on the sky of the
              cosmic microwave background radiation carries a wealth of information about the
              early Universe since this radiation started on its journey to us just a few
              hundred thousand years after the Big Bang.  The details of the distribution on
              angular scales from a few degrees to a few minutes can cleanly discriminate
              between competing models of the dark matter which makes up most of the
              gravitationally attracting mass of the Universe.  This balloon borne microwave
              telescope - called BOOMERANG - will measure variations on a scale from
              12minutes to 3.6 degrees.   BOOMERANG has already been flown for a short flight
              in the US and will be flown on a long-duration balloon from McMurdo Antarctica
              in December of 1998 with an expectation of getting up to two weeks of
              continuous data.  The funds necessary to build the balloon payload have been
              provided by NASA, NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences and Italy.  This
              award will provide some funds for the Antarctic flight and some of the data
              analysis.  The balloon will be provided and launched by NASA while logistical
              support an payload recovery will be supplied by NSF.  ***
