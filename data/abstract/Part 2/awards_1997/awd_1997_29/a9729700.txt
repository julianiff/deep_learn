Abstract    :
              Abstract  Lange/Kalton/Gesztesy    This award is to partially support a to be
              held at the University of Missouri, May 20-23, 1998.  Its focus is the central
              role of continued fractions as a common interdisciplinary bridge between
              mathematics, mathematical physics, and approximation theory.
