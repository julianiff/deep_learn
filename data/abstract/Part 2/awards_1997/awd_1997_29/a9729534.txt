Abstract    :
                The Imaging Core Facility at the University of Texas  Southwestern
              MedicalCenter at Dallas will be upgraded and  expanded. This will allow for
              increased and more efficient  use of the facility and also for the acquisition
              of powerful  new technologies such as micro-FRAP and micro-CALl. Among  the
              many systems and problems that will be studied using  this facility are: the
              regulation and function of kinase  pathways; the assembly of peroxisome
              organelles; the  regulation of contractile and motile function in smooth and 
              non-muscle cells; and the role of and constraints on  diffussion of cellular
              components in cellular reactions.
