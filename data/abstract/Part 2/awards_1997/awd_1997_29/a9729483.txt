Abstract    :
                An electrophysiology laboratory consisting of a patch-clamp  set-up and a
              Xenopus oocyte recording set-up will be  purchased. These instruments will be
              used studying the flux  of ions through channels on the cell surface. Among the
               systems to be explored are: signaling of the cannabinoid  receptor ion
              channels, regulation of enterotoxin in the  intestinal chloride channel,
              angiotensin II action on the  paraventriculo-spinal system and the potassium
              channels and  insulin secretion in transgenic mice.
