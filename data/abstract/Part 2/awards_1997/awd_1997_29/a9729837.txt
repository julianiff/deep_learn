This project will support the participation of
              researchers from the United States at the International Conference on
              Variational Methods, Optimal Control, and Related Topics to be held at the
              Technion in Haifa, Israel from March 25 - 31, 1998.  The conference will focus
              on two main areas of research: (a) critical point theory (with applications to
              differential equations) and (b) optimal control (existence, relaxation,
              optimality conditions, structure of optimal trajectories and optimal
              synthesis).  In both areas there has been much recent progress both in the
              development of new mathematical theories and in numerous applications to
              physics, mechanics, engineering, and economics.  The conference will bring
              together researchers from the U.S., Israel, a number of European research
              centers, and the former Soviet Union.
