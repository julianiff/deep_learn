Abstract    :
              Abstract: 9729817    Robert Finn    The focus of this research is the study of
              capillarity phenomena of liquid surfaces.  Capillarity effects are commonly
              observed in the shape of the surface of water or other liquid in a glass. For
              narrower containers, such as a test tube or drinking straw, the capillary
              forces make the surface of the liquid  more curved and lift the liquid up the
              sides of the container.  Interest is growing in this topic which has
              applications in areas as diverse as fluid management in low gravity,
              semiconductor manufacturing, behavior of liquids in porous rocks, and many
              other situations in which surface forces predominate over gravity.  A
              significant parameter in capillarity phenomena is the angle that the liquid
              makes with a solid surface, this angle is called the contact angle.  The angle
              depends on the liquid and the properties of the solid surface.  The principle
              investigator has shown that in the presence of a corner, the height of the
              capillary surface in the corner depends, in a discontinuous way, on the
              relation between the angle of the corner and the contact angle. One aspect of
              this research will be applicable to finding new ways of determining the contact
              angle.  The mathematical questions to be investigated will require new and as
              yet untested ideas for their resolution.  The problems are exciting, relating
              formal mathematics directly to physics and leading to experimental
              verification.  It is expected that the new results will display and clarify
              further exotic behavior of the surfaces.
