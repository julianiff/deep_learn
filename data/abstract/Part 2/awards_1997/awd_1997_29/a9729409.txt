Abstract    :
                This award to the Department of Education extends a partnership between the
              two   agencies in cooperation with the European Commission.  The US partnership
              will support   two US consortia that will work with two corresponding European
              consortia to foster   student exchanges.  Support of this proposal will allow
              30 students from six US   institutions to work at eight participating European
              universities supported by the   European Commission. One consortium, the
              International Operations Consortium, is   headed by Mark McKnew, Clemson
              University, and Joao Lisboa, at the University of   Coimbra in Portugal.  It is
              designed to integrate traditional business and industrial   engineering
              disciplines through new educational programs and multi-lingual materials for  
              global distribution on the World-Wide Web.  The second consortium, for
              Distributed   Geographic Information Education, is headed by John Wilson,
              University of Southern   California, and Josef Strobl at the University of
              Salzburg in Austria.  The participating   institutions will cooperate in
              developing a multi-disciplinary geographic information   science curriculum,
              teaching units, and laboratory exercises as part of an on-line media  
              resource.
