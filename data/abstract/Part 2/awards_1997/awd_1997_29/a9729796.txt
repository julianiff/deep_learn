Abstract    :
              Casts of the interiors of skulls (endocasts) of our early ancestors indicate the
              volume and shape of their brains, and reproduce features of the cerebral cortex
              that were imprinted on the walls of their braincases during life.  These
              features include convolutions, sulcal patterns, and blood vessels, which are
              sometimes correlated with known functions such as speech and right-handedness
              in living people.  Endocasts are therefore useful for addressing questions
              about the origins of certain behaviors. Skulls of important Pleistocene fossil
              hominids are currently being CAT-scanned by an international team, and the
              resulting three dimensional (3D) CT data are available for generating and
              measuring images of endocranial surfaces from a computer screen.  In order to
              validate use of 3D-CT to investigate brain surface morphology, a set of
              measurements will be obtained and compared from 3D-CT images and the
              corresponding traditional endocasts of several key hominid skulls. 
              Additionally, the application of 3D geometrical methods for analyzing endocasts
              will be explored in an ape and human skull series.  Once validated, these
              methods can be applied to new specimens, leading to further insights about
              brain evolution.
