Abstract    :
              This project will produce the first complete, book-length study of
              eighteeenth-century Dutch science, filling an important gap in knowledge about
              science during the Enlightenment.  Since the Netherlands was a republic, not a
              monarchy with its court and aristocratic cultures, the study will help us
              refine generalizations about scientific culture in early modern Europe. 
              Current views of Dutch science are influenced by a longstanding emphasis on the
              seventeenth century as the Netherlands' `Golden Age,` followed by what is
              usually characterized as a period of decline.  By embedding a cultural history
              of science within the context of eighteenth-century Dutch life, this study will
              develop an appreciation of Dutch scientific activities and achievements that is
              not predetermined by such value judgments.  The study will be organized around
              the concepts of `utility` and `virtue` both because they were constantly
              invoked as the guiding ideals of science during the Enlightenment and because
              their meanings changed constantly.  The method to be employed in this project
              begins with a survey of available primary and secondary literature, followed by
              archival research.  What distinguishes this study from others is its commitment
              to respect the integrity of science while demonstrating its dynamic
              relationship to the cultural environment in which it is practiced.
