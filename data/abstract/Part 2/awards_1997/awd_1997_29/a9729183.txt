Abstract    :
              The proposal is to investigate the DMSP satellite database of particle
              precipitation during a series of magnetospheric state transitions.  State
              transitions will include the magnetospheric response to changes in IMF By and
              Bz components, precursors and responses to substorm onset, and states of flux
              tube refilling.  These state changes will be investigated using state variables
              determines from DMSP particle data.  Such state variables include the ion
              isotropy boundary and polar cap boundary - from which can be estimated the
              polar cap area.  The database includes over 356,000 nightside crossings which
              will be investigated statistically, sorted according to substorm phase.
