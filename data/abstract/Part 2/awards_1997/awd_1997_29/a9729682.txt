Abstract    :
              Columbia College requested support from NSF to connect three remote campus sites
              to the Internet.  These campus sites are located in Lake County, IL, Kansas
              City, MO and Aurora, CO.  The sites will be connected through the Missouri
              Research and Education Network (MOREnet).  Combined, these campuses have an
              enrollment of over 1000 students.  The campuses needs the Internet connection
              to be able to access information resources throughout the faculty, staff
              students of these institutions as well as the community in general.  The award
              provides partial support of the project for two years.
