Abstract    :
              This project studies various schemes that provide affordable and  interactive
              Video-on-Demand (VOD) services for popular videos.   These videos include
              ``hot'' news coverage, popular sport events,   tapped lectures, or recently
              released movies. The first goal of   the study is to understand the tradeoff
              among various resources   such as server I/O bandwidth, client buffer size, and
              client   I/O bandwidth. All these tradeoff issues are important in   designing
              a video server since, in future multimedia   applications, service providers
              might subsidize the cost of the   set-top box at a user's side if it is cost
              effective. The second   goal of the study is to provide interactive services to
              users.   The interactive services, which include VCR like functions such   as
              pause, resume, rewind and forward, make any content available   under the touch
              of a fingertip. The study includes resource   allocation schemes for providing
              timely interactive services.   For a full description of the project, please
              refer to the   web page   <A HREF =
              "http://cs.smith.edu/~gao/research/ivod.html">Providing   interactive VOD
              services for popular videos</A>.  As a new researcher in the area of multimedia
              networks, the PI   will focus on the first goal and set a stage for the second 
               goal during the planning period. The PI plans to submit a full   proposal by
              the end of the planning period.
