Abstract    :
                    This award is made under the high performance connections portion of
              ANIR's  "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides
              partial  support for two years for DS-3 connections for three institutions to a
               California statewide network and then to the vBNS.   The three institutions 
              are California State University, San Bernardino; California State  Polytechnic
              University, Pomona; and San Diego State University.  Applications include
              biomedical and bioinformatics use of fractals, remote  data acquisition and
              control research, distributed computing, and seismic  research.  Collaborating
              institutions include the National Center for  Supercomputing Applications,
              University of Pennsylvania, University of  Texas, University of Wisconsin and
              Rice University.
