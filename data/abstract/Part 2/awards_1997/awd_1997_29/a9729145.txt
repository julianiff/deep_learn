              Abstract  ATM-9729145  Markgraf, Vera  University of Colorado  Title: Support
              for the Scientific Meeting PEP 1: Paleoclimate of  the Americas; March 16-20,
              1998 in Merida, Venezuela    This award supports the first scientific meeting
              of the Pole-  Equator-Pole Paleoclimate of the Americas (PEP 1) Project.  It
              will  be held in Merida, Venezuela, March 16 to 20, 1998, under the  auspices
              of the Universidad de Los Andes (Centro de Investigaciones  Ecologicas de Los
              Andes Tropicales, CIELAT, and Centro  InterAmericano De Desarollo e
              Investigacion Ambiental y  Territorial, CIDIAT).  The objective of this meeting
              is to review  the progress achieved since the 1993 initiation of the PEP 1 
              Project.  The PEP 1 Project is designed to further our  understanding of
              inter-hemispheric climate linkages, past and  present.  The Merida meeting will
              address inter-hemispheric aspects  of character, timing, and forcing of climate
              variability and  climate change in the Americas and present information from
              the  atmospheric, marine terrestrial and polar ice caps realms.  The  topics
              are: Modern Climate Modes and Variability, Last 2000 Years  of Climate
              Variability, El Nino/Southern Oscillation Climate  Variability and
              Teleconnections, Mid-Holocene Climates, Late  Glacial Climate Variability,
              Climate of the Last Glacial Maximum,  and Human Dimensions of Climate Change.
