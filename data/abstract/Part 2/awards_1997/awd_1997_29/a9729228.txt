Abstract    :
              9729228  Senk    Researchers at Michigan State University and the University of
              South Florida are investigating what is known about student performance
              outcomes related to the comprehensive mathematics instructional materials for
              K-12 schools that were developed with NSF support.  This funding began in the
              early 1990s and the materials have now been developed, field tested, and are
              now available from commercial publishers.   Student performance data were
              collected by the development projects during the pilot and field testing and a
              number of reports have been published in the research literature concerning
              these results.  The Michigan State and South Florida researchers are studying
              this data and are reporting on the results in a form that is readily digested
              by the potential users of the instructional materials: parents, teachers,
              school administrators, and others interested in mathematics education.
