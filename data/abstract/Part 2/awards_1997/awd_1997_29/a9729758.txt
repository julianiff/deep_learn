Abstract    :
                                      ABSTRACT       This proposal is to fund innovative
              exploratory research on producing polymer optical fibers with specified optical
              index profiles.  By controlling the optical index profile, modal dispersion of
              the signal can be minimized and the speed of transmission can be increased from
              several Mbit/sec to the Gbit/sec range.  The goal of the project is to develop
              a continuous drawing method that can be used to fabricate graded-index fibers
              efficiently.  The Principal Investigator proposes to use photobleaching to
              control the optical index.  As fibers are draw, oxygen or air is allowed to
              diffuse into them.  The fibers is then irradiated by UV light.  Because the
              concentration of oxygen at the outer region of the fiber is higher,
              photobleaching occurs at a higher rate, resulting in a spatially varying
              optical index.  Experiments will be conducted to explore this concept of
              fabrication.
