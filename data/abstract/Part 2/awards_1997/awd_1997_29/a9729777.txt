Abstract    :
                     This project examines the extent to which social and ecological stressors
              influence mother and infant health among the Eastern Panare of Venezuela.  The
              people of this community are swidden horticulturists who have no access to
              institutional healthcare, few social or economic ties with outsiders, and whose
              daily activities reflect traditional patterns of subsistence and social
              organization.  This socio-ecological environment provides an excellent
              opportunity for a longitudinal investigation of the effects of social tension
              and residential movement on mother-infant health.       The central hypothesis
              of this study is that social stressors have a negative effect on health,
              independent of nutrition.  Data on salivary immune factors, milk energy,
              health, anthropometrics, maternal stress, and family mobility will be collected
              from a series of  mother-infant pairs to test whether infants of more highly
              stressed mothers exhibit evidence of poorer health and growth disruptions.     
               While the influence of nutrition on early childhood well-being has been
              extensively studied, this will be the first study to combine ethnographic,
              psychoneuroimmunological, and energetic methods to longitudinally track mother
              and infant health.  Consequently, this work will provide us with a much richer
              understanding of how both social and ecological factors influence maternal
              well-being and thus shape infant health status.
