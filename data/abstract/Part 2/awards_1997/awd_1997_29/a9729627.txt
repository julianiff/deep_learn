Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64. It provides partial
              support for an OC-3 connection to the enhance and accommodate research needs
              for the University of Alabama in Huntsville by establishing a connection to the
              Very High Performance Backbone Network Service (vBNS) via the co-located
              National Center for Supercomputing Applications existing connection to the
              vBNS.  Some of the projects in this proposal include:  Lightning Studies, Ozone
              and the environment, National  distribution of global climate data, Radar data
              for tornado research, Satellite Remote Sensing Efforts, Tropical Energy Balance
              Assessment, Solar Plasma Physics, High Performance Communication for Space and
              Astrophysical Plasma Physics Research, Ultraviolet Imager, SSME Flow Process
              Modeling, Remote Polarization Sensing Data Analysis, Optical Phased Array
              Systems, Virtual Laboratories in Probability and Statistics, Alabama
              Supercomputing Program to Inspire Computation Research in  Education, Remote
              High Performance Visualization and Virtual Reality for Surgical Planning and
              Rehearsal and Related Investigations in Telemedicine, and Collaborative
              Multi-Archive Data Mining.    With this high performance network capability the
              University of Alabama in Huntsville will expand current research and
              collaboration with both academic institutions and federal  laboratories.  On
              this project, collaborating institutions include:  Pennsylvania State
              University, National Center for Atmospheric Research, MIT's Lincoln Laboratory,
              Texas A&M, University of Arizona, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Georgia
              Institute of Technology, University of Virginia, university of Washington,
              University of Maryland, University of Colorado, University of California-San
              Diego, NOAA/NESDIS, NOAA/NCDC, EDC, NASA/LaRC, NASA/MSFC, NASA/GISS, NASA/GSFC,
              NASA/JPL,  Environmental Protection Agency, and the National Environmental
              Assessment Laboratory in Research Triangle Park.
