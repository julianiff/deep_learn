Abstract    :
              Pell  9729930    The 12th Annual Penn State Symposium in Plant Physiology,
              titled  "Phosphorus in plant biology: regulatory roles in molecular,  cellular,
              organismic, and ecosystem processes" will be held May 28-  30, 1998 in State
              College, Pennsylvania. The theme of this  symposium addresses issues
              surrounding phosphorus limitation, a  moor concern in agricultural and natural
              ecosystems worldwide. In  this symposium international group of scientists will
              convene to  provide critical overviews of issue, challenges, and opportunities 
              in a range of topics in cell, and molecular biology, physiology,  and ecology,
              with emphasis on the roles of phosphorus in  regulating plant process.  There
              will be 23 invited speakers;  their presentations will be published as a
              proceedings by the  American Society of Plant Physiologist. There will also be 
              approximately 50 contributed posters which summarize current  research by
              scientist, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate  students.  Several focused
              discussion sessions have been organized  to allow for integration in the
              thinking amongst scientist  conducting research at molecular, whole plant, and
              ecological  levels.
