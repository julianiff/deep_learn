              Instrumentation : Development of a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Compilation
              Testbed    This research instrumentation grant enables the following projects:
              - Digital Signal Processing Applications in Telecommunications and Magnetic  
              Recording Systems, - Improved Program Layout for High Performance Signal
              Processors, and   - Dynamic Compilations for Networked Signal Processors.   
              Digital Signal Processors are commonly used to execute a range of
              performance-critical signal processing applications.  High-level language
              compilers have only recently been targeted for DSPs.  The optimization
              technology provided in these compilers lacks the level of sophistication
              commonly found in most microprocessor compilers, and has discouraged the use of
              high-level languages for performance-critical DSP applications.  As a result,
              assembly-language programming still dominates DSP development, and there can be
              very high costs associated with maintaining legacy assembly code.    New code
              generation technologies must be developed which capitalize both on the
              characteristics of signal processing algorithms and on the resources available
              in modern DSPs.  Compiler technologies that exploit the evolving architectural
              features present in state-of-the-art signal processors must also be used to
              develop highly performance-tuned signal processing applications.  The equipment
              requested by this grant will be used as a DSP testbed by the principal
              investigators to develop new signal processing and telecommunications
              applications, as well as to investigate new compilation techniques which
              address the issues of producing maintainable, high performance signal
              processing software.
