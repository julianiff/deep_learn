Abstract    :
              This research seeks an understanding of the origin of magnetospheric plasma
              waves and their influence on the dynamical behavior of trapped particles.  This
              will be accomplished through theoretical analysis and numerical computation. 
              The path integrated growth rate and ultimate damping mechanisms for plasma
              waves will be studied in realistic model environments using the HOT RAY tracing
              code.  This will establish the conditions for significant wave gain and the
              effectiveness of energy transfer, via the waves, to other components of the
              plasma.  The stochastic acceleration of particles to high energy and
              precipitation loss to the atmosphere during resonant interaction with
              magnetospheric plasma waves will be studied by evaluating the rate of diffusion
              along the characteristic resonant diffusion surfaces.  Several of the proposed
              topics are relevant to the ongoing GEM inner magnetosphere campaign,
              particularly as they address processes in the inner magnetosphere and
              geomagnetic storm conditions.
