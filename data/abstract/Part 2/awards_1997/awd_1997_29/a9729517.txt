Abstract    :
              This dissertation project focuses on an understanding of the historical
              development of the infrastructure of modern aviation through detailed
              investigation into one component of the infrastructure: blind landing systems. 
              In particular this project will analyze the process of negotiation that took
              place between representatives of labor unions, Federal agencies, the
              International  Civil Aviation Organization, airlines, and radio and electronic
              companies which resulted in the construction of a standardized system.  This
              involved the rejection of some possible systems, and hence this project will
              investigate both successful and failed technologies.  Because modern aviation
              is a highly complex system that has evolved both in terms of its technologies
              and the organizations that use and mange them, understanding its development as
              an historical process will help scholars better understand the development of
              large-scale, public-sector technologies.  The finished project will take the
              form of an historical narrative, based upon extensive examination of published
              primary documents, and through the examination of unpublished material
              contained  in the archives of government agencies, relevant labor unions, and
              commercial organizations, and the International Civil Aviation Organization.
