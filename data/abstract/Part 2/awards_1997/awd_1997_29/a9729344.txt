Abstract    :
                IBN 97-29344  Neural Regulation of Adrenocortical Cell Functions    Recent
              studies indicate that the autonomic (sympathetic  and  parasympathetic)  
              nervous   system   contributes   to   the  regulation of the cells of endocrine
              glands.  In particular,  the   PI   has  discovered  that  autonomic  nerves 
              control  proliferation and secretion of corticosteroids by the  cells  of  the
              adrenal cortex.  These autonomic nerves include both  sympathetic  nerves and
              the chromaffin cells of the  adrenal  medulla.   In  these studies, the PI's
              propose to  determine  the   mechanisms   used  by  nerves   to   stimulate  
              these  adrenocortical cell activities.  Four general questions  are  addressed:
               (1)  Is  the  cell  proliferation  regulated  by  sympathetic  nerve  activity
              and by which  neurotransmitter?  (2)  Does the growth factor, bFGF, play a
              role? (3)  Do  the  chromaffin  cells of the adrenal medulla contribute  to 
              the  regulation of adrenocortical cell secretion? (4) What signal  transduction
               pathway is turned on by  the  chromaffin  cell  activity?    In   order   to 
              study   the   direct   neural-  adrenocortical  cell interactions, the PIs 
              will  use  their  recently established co-cultures of nerve and adrenocortical 
              cells for these studies.  Taken together, these studies will  contribute  to 
              the overall understanding of  how  endocrine  gland function is controlled and
              the mechanisms by which the  central nervous system exerts this regulatory
              function.
