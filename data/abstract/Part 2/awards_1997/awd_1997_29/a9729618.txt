              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64. It provides partial
              support for a DS-3 connection to the enhance and accommodate research needs for
              Washington University by establishing a connection to the Very High Performance
              Backbone Network Service (vBNS) via the MCI POP in Downers Grove, IL. Projects
              in this proposal include:  neuroscience, electronic radiology, planetary
              databases, computational projects in physics, genome sequence analysis, and
              studio quality video for scientific collaboration.  With this high performance
              network capability the Washington University will expand current research and
              collaboration with both academic institutions and federal laboratories.  On
              this project, collaborating institutions include:  San Diego Supercomputer
              Center, University of California at San Diego, University of California at Los
