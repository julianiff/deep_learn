Abstract    :
              9729590  Chappell  Plant isoprenoids comprise a structurally diverse group of
              compounds; some are essential for plant growth and development and others are
              important mediators of plant-environment interactions.  For example, when
              attenuated pathogens are added to solanaceous plant cell cultures, the cultures
              cease sterol production (essential metabolite), and instead synthesize and
              secrete antibiotic sesquiterpenes.  The decline in sterol biosynthesis has been
              correlated with the suppression of one key enzyme (squalene synthase), and the
              induction of sesquiterpene biosynthesis with the induction of another key
              enzyme (sesquiterpene cyclase).  The PI's long range goal is to understand how
              this control is imposed onto these two key enzymes.  The current objectives are
              to evaluate how two particular signal molecules might orchestrate this
              regulation, and to examine how several molecular mechanisms might contribute to
              the regulation of squalene synthase and sterol metabolism.  These studies
              should provide important insights into how this pathway can be manipulated for
              enhanced value using genetic engineering technology.
