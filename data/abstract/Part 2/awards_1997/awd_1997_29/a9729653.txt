This three-year award supports US-Ireland cooperative research
              on the origin and distribution of sulfide mineralization in the Irish Midlands,
              epigenetic open-space-filling dolomite and calcite cements, and dolomites as
              replacements for limestone.  The collaboration involves Jay Gregg and Kevin
              Shelton and their graduate students at the University of Missouri and Ian
              Somerville's research group at University College Dublin.  The project's focus
              on fluid sources and flow paths, and regional physical and chemical changes in
              sedimentary rocks is important to understanding the distribution of base metals
              and petroleum in basins.

The project brings together the complementary
              expertise of American and Irish scientists and takes advantage of sharing of
              available facilities and equipment in Ireland and the US.
