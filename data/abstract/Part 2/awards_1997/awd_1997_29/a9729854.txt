              :Instrumentation Support for Graphics and Visualization Research at Princeton  
               This research instrumentation enables research projects in:- Virtual
              Environments,- Scientific Visualization, and- Digital Media.    The Departments
              of Computer Science and Astrophysics at Princeton University will purchase
              equipment for high performance graphics and for outputting of high resolution
              graphics in various formats (video, hardcopy and slides). The equipment will be
              used for several research projects, including in particular:  (1) work in
              walkthroughs of buildings and cities, (2) visualization of scientific data and
              (3) digital techniques in multimedia.  The equipment requested will be used by
              faculty, graduate students and undergraduates in both computer science and
              astrophysics to support individual  and cross-disciplinary research projects.
              An important consequence of the proposed projects is that they not only enhance
              the current faculty and student research and education but they also act as a
              catalyst for new collaborations between these two departments and other related
              science and engineering departments at Princeton.  The synergy created will
              thus make the whole significantly greater than the sum of the parts.
