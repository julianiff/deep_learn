Abstract    :
              Warren  9729696  The deep hydrographic observations conducted on a  Transindian
              ocean section  from Singapore to Mombasa, along 8 degree South as part of  the
              World Ocean  Circulation Experiment will be analyzed. The first objective  of
              the study is to  describe and estimate volume transports of the three systems 
              of deep western  boundary currents in these latitudes. The second objective  is
              delineate the deep  inflows to the Central Indian Basin  across saddles on the 
              Ninetyeast Ridge and  a possible outflow through a gap in the Chagos-Laccadive 
              Ridge by analyzing  the data collected in three small, dense surveys.
