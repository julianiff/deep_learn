Abstract    :
              9729444  Alexander    This award provides partial funding for U.S. ocean
              scientists,   particularly those in the academic research community, to  
              participate in the activities of the North Pacific Marine Science  
              Organization (PICES).  This organization was established in 1992   to promote
              and coordinate marine scientific research in order to   advance knowledge of
              living marine resources, land-ocean and   atmosphere-ocean interactions,
              ecosystem components and   processes, resource usage, ocean response to global
              weather and   climate change, and human impacts in the North Pacific. Members  
              presently include Canada, China, Japan, Korea, Russia, and the   United States.
              Participation by U.S. scientists in Annual   Meetings, scientific committee
              working groups and workshops, will   also be funded through this award.
