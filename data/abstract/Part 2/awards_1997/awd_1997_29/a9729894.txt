Title:  Haaiian plume structure and
              magmatic processes revealed by submarine landslides on Mauna Loa Volcano,
              Hawaii

The anatomy of mantle plumes, and melting processes within them,
              remain enigmatic and controversial issues despite numerous attempts to
              investigate them.  The main obstacle to understanding plumes has been our past
              two-dimensional approach in exmining them.  The discovery of giant landslides
              on the flanks of Mauna Loa provides an opportunity to sample the products of
              plume processes in the third dimension.  This study will extend our knowledge
              the magmatic history Mauna Loa's, the world's largest volcano, by -200,000
              years, should provide fundamental insights into the development of
              hotspot-generated volcanoes and clarify longstanding controversies concerning
              the structure and dynamics of the Hawaiian plume.  We will also examine the
              following hypotheses:  Hawaiian volcanoes were derived from some of the hottest
              magmas erupted in the 100 million years and oceanic island volcanoes are
              dominantly comprised of fragmental lava rather than pillow lava (which has
              implications for the geologic hazards on all oceanic islands).
