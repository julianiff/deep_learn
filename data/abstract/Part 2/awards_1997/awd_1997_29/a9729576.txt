              Research Instrumentation:  Computational Techniques for 3-D Modeling and
              Analysis of Infrared and MRI Image Sequences     This research instrumentation
              award serves to acquire a high-speed   supercomputer which will enable the
              following research projects:    - New Techniques in Automatic Target Detection,
              Recognition, and Tracking from     Optical and Infrared Video Sequences,  -
              Segmentation, Modeling, and Statistical Characterization of the Geometry   of
              the Human Brain Cortex from Three-Dimensional Magnetic Resonance Images, and 
              -Spline Algorithms for the Reconstruction of MR Material Markers  from Tagged  
               Magnetic Resonance Images.    The proposed equipment will be dedicated to
              research in novel computational   techniques for modeling and analysis of
              infrared and magnetic resonance   imaging (MRI) data. The requested equipment
              will:    (a) Allow development and implementation of real-time and
              near-real-time   algorithms using 3-D morphological image processing and
              analysis techniques   (Project 1).  (b) Allow fast implementation of continuous
              image modeling and active   geometry algorithms to fit a topologically correct
              surface to the central   layer of the cortex, and development of efficient
              methods to statistically   characterize the shapes of the major sulci
              (fissures) of the cortex   (Project 2).  (c) Allow development and
              implementation of 3-D optical flow algorithms for   motion estimation, and
              enable solution of large matrix equations to   determine higher order spline
              coefficients for tag surface fitting and   analysis (Project 3).
