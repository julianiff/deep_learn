Abstract    :
                   This award will help fund the 1998 National Conference    of Black Physics
              Students (NCBPS) meeting which will be held    March 5-7, 1998 as part of a
              joint meeting with the National    Society of Black Physicists (NSBP), in
              Lexington, Kentucky.    The host institution for NCBPS 1998 will be the
              University    of Kentucky.    The 1998 conference will be the twelfth   
              consecutive meeting of NCBPS.  The objective of the annual    NCBPS meeting is
              to assist and encourage Black students who    have shown interest and ability
              in physics to enter and    complete Ph.D. programs, and to initiate research,
              teaching,    or technical careers commensurate with their educational   
              achievement in physics.  This joint meeting with NSBP will    enable the
              undergraduate and graduate students of the NCBPS    to interact with a large
              number of successful minority    physicists in both a formal and informal
              environment.  The    benefits of this communication should be great, in terms
              of    the objectives of the NCBPS.  The University of Kentucky    will bring in
              public school minority students and their    teachers during one day of this
              joint conference in order to    enhance the awareness of young minorities in
              the state of    the opportunities for and accomplishments of African-   
              Americans in physics in particular and science in general.
