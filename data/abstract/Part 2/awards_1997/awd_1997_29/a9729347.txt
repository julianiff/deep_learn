Abstract    :
              A confocal imaging system will be purchased and coupled with  a fluorescence
              microscope. These instruments will be  utilized by five investigators studying
              (1) chemical  signaling in developing and adult marine snails and worms;  (2)
              the dynamics associated with the process of colonization  of a host squid by
              its luminescent bacterial symbionts; (3)  the structure and function of sensory
              antennae of marine  copepods; (4) the temporal and spatial gene expression 
              patterns of symbiotic luminous marine bacteria in their  host' s tissues; and
              (5) the molecular basis of interaction  between spores of marine green algae
              and microbial films on  marine surfaces.
