Abstract    :
                A group of seven investigators will purchase a  microdensitometer which will
              be incorporated in the Electron  Microscopy and Image Processing Core
              Laboratory in the  Cummings Life Science Center of the University of Chicago. 
              The densitometer will be used in studies of the structure of  sickle cell
              hemoglobin fibers, the structure of  Dictoyostelium discoideum membrane, DNA
              protein complexes,  the structure and mechanism of action of heat shock 
              proteins, the structure of lipoproteins and the structure of  secretory
              granules in Tetrahymena.
