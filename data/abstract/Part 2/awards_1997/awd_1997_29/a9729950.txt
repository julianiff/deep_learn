Abstract    :
              9729950  Channing  Numerous biotechnological applications rely on the function
              of proteins in the vicinity of or confined to interfaces.  Examples include
              biocompatible materials, protein chromatography, solid phase immunoassays, and
              biosensors.  While protein-protein interactions at interfaces have been
              exploited in these technologies, and are prevalent throughout nature, little is
              known concerning the mechanism by which such interactions lead to protein
              self-organization.  A better understanding of the factors involved in
              two-dimensional biomolecular ordering would aid the development of these
              technologies.  This project is to investigate the influence of intermolecular
              forces on two-dimensional protein crystallization, and to calculate the
              energetics of two dimensional crystals.  ***
