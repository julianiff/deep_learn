Abstract    :
              This researach is concerned with the development of 'collective' models of
              household behavior, where household is represented as a group of several
              individuals, each of whom is characterized by a specific utility function, and
              who make Pareto efficient agreements.  Such representations aim at
              understanding, in particular, how the members respective 'power' or bargaining
              positions affect intrahousehold allocation of consumption and welfare, as well
              as household behavior as a whole.  This has important implications for the
              design of optimal policies; for instance, should benefits be given to specific
              members, under a specific form (say, education to women), and others.  A first
              goal is to deepen the theoretical foundations of these models, and to solve
              some of the questions that are still open.  A second part of the research will
              be devoted to empirical applications, especially in the case of labor supply. 
              Finally, the model will be extended to include uncertainty and dynamics.
