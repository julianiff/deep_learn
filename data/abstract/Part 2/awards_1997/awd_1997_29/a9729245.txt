Abstract    :
              9729245  Kobe  Numerous studies in vegetation ecology have focused on the
              delineation and description of forest communities, often in relation to soil
              attributed. However, relatively few studies have explained variation in species
              composition from the more mechanistic perspective of how tree species vary in
              performance in response to resource availability, as supplied by different
              forest community types. Furthermore, among-site variation in species
              interactions and subsequent influence on community composition remain little
              explored. The objectives of the research established with this Postdoctoral
              Fellowship Starter Grant are to (1) characterize the resource-dependent growth
              of juveniles of five dominant tree species in different ecological land types
              in a landscape of northern hardwoods forest, and (2) evaluate if variation in
              sapling growth predicts the dominant canopy tree species under specified
              resource conditions. The study's emphasis is on saplings because of their
              importance in influencing forest community dynamics. The chosen species
              (Quercus alba, Q. rubra, Acer rubrum, A. saccharum, Pinus strobus) span a range
              of shade tolerances and mature-tree associations with soil properties, and
              thus, provide the variation necessary to address the objectives of this
              research. Ultimately, this type of information can provide a more mechanistic
              understanding of species-habitat relationships which can provide better
              predictions of the response of forested landscapes to human intervention.
