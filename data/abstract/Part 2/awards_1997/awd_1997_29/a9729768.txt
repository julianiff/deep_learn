Abstract    :
              9729768  Rocke, David M.  University of California - Davis    CISE Research
              Instrumentation : Applications of Parallel Computing in Computer Science,
              Computer Engineering, and Analysis and Visualization of Massive Date Sets   
              This research instrumentation enables research projects in: - Applications of
              Parallel Computation,- Compiler Optimization Using Integer Programming,   -
              Synthesis of Pipelined Hardware/Software Systems,- Analysis and Visualization
              of Massive Data Sets, and - Languages, Compilers and Systems.    To support the
              aforementioned projects, the University of California, Davis will purchase a
              symmetric multiprocessor parallel computer. All of these projects either
              involve development of software for parallel computers or require the
              high-performance of such a system.  The methods and software developed under
              this project will be available to researchers in computer science and
              engineering and in applications areas such as genetics and environmental
              science.
