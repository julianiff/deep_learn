Abstract    :
                      9729439  Sunal      The planning grant proposal is to provide support to
              build a collaborative among stakeholders in West Alabama for the enhancement of
              science literacy among individuals and groups who have been underrepresented in
              science education activities.  The major stakeholders represent a complicated
              system of school districts spread over several rural counties and include a
              small city.  The collaborative will develop a long-term plan for local systemic
              change aimed at developing a vision for science instruction of children and the
              professional enhancement of K-8 teachers.  The activity of the planning will
              include the development of strategies for bring outside resources and expertise
              to the planning process.
