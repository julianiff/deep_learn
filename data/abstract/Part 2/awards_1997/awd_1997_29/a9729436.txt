Abstract    :
              ***  9727332  Spence  The Joint Planning Office for the Global Climate Observing
               System  (JPO/GCOS) will advance and promote coordination of  planning  for and
              development of the three major observing systems  which  support global change
              research -- the GCOS and the Global  Ocean and  Terrestrial Observing Systems
              (GOOS and GTOS) -- but  especially the GTOS.  The JPO/GCOS will base this 
              coordination on its  comprehensive approach to identifying (a) the scientific 
              requirements for observations of the atmosphere, ocean, land  surface, and
              cryosphere, using both in situ and space-based  observing systems, and (b) the
              needs for and development of  plans for a comprehensive data management system
              in support  of the  three observing systems.  The JPO/GCOS will develop 
              protocols to  integrate data obtained from both networks; identify  ecological 
              sites for joint observations; identify river observing sites  as an  initial
              hydrological cycle observing system; develop  demonstration/  pilot projects
              (possibly on soil carbon) to test the ability  of  the observing systems to
              make observations and deliver  collected  data  rapidly and effectively; and
              promote further  development of  an integrated data management system for
              terrestrial  observations.  ***
