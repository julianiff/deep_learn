Abstract    :
                    9729087  Bierly    Several research studies by governmental and private
              groups have addressed the changing research climate in the U.S. and also the
              changing education environment at all levels,   K-12 through post-graduate. 
              These documents all describe an academic environment in rapid transition with
              an emerging common theme, the need for a closer integration of research and
              education.  Opportunities exist for restructuring or redirecting these programs
              in Earth and Space Sciences.    The American Geophysical Union proposes to
              convene a meeting of the Heads and Chairs of Earth and Space Science
              Departments on "Support for Education and Research in the Earth and Space
              Sciences" on November 7-9, 1997 at the AGU building, 2000 Florida Ave., N.W.,
              Washington, D. C.  This meeting will provide a forum for exchange of
              information and recommendations for the future of these sciences.  It will be
              the first such meeting of Heads and Chairs.  AGU anticipates convening these
              meetings on a biennial basis.    Heads and Chairs of academic programs offering
              undergraduate degrees in the Earth and space sciences will be invited to
              participate.  Earth and space science is broadly defined to include atmospheric
              sciences, geochemistry, geology, geophysics, earth sciences, hydrology,
              oceanography, aeronomy and space physics, and closely allied disciplines.   
              Goals include:  1) addressing the "integration of research and undergraduate
              education" in the context of the Earth and Space Sciences, especially as
              reflected in two recent reports of the Directorate of Geosciences, National
              Science Foundation;  2) responding to observations and recommendations
              regarding undergraduate education as detailed in the recent AGU May 1997 report
              on the NSF funded workshop at AGU, November, 1996; and 3) recommending
              priorities in undergraduate education to the AGU and other scientific and
              science education societies in the Earth and Space Sciences and to federal,
              state and local funding agencies.
