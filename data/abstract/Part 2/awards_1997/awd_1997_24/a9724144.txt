Abstract    :
              Demski    97-24144    The evolution of the brain is marked by an increase in the
               size and complexity of the front-most portion of the brain,  the
              telencephalon, as well as the expansion and increased  integration of sensory
              systems. This pattern is apparent in  several lines of organisms. Investigating
              and comparing how  different organisms accomplish this provides insight into 
              the evolution of the human brain as well as information  about the different
              ways systems can process high volumes of  complex information. This project
              examines the evolution of  visual and auditory systems. Neuroanatomical studies
               describe the connections of visual and auditory systems and  how these systems
              converge and are integrated in the  forebrain. Physiological studies indicate
              how this  convergence results in complex patterns of neural activity  related
              to ongoing behavior. Results of this research add to  the understanding of the
              evolution of the brain and to the  understanding of how the brain compares
              information from  multiple sources to arrive at an integrated representation 
              of the external world.
