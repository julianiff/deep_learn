Abstract    :
                The requested XL-L analytical ultracentrifuge will be  utilized for five
              distinct but interrelated activities  encompassing both research and education.
               (1) The Center  will provide a significantly enhanced resource to be used by 
              both Department of Biochemistry and other institutional  faculty to conduct
              NSF/NIH supported research.  (2) The  Center will work closely with
              institutional faculty to  generate preliminary data for continuing or new grant
               proposals. (3)   The Center will develop collaborations with  researchers
              outside the University of Texas Health Science  Center at San Antonio to allow
              them to perform key  analytical ultracentrifugation experiments that otherwise 
              would not be possible due to the lack of available  instrumentation. (4)  The
              Center will develop public domain  software for the XL-I based on the method of
              van Holde and  Weischet that permits determination of diffusioncorrected 
              sedimentation coefficient distributions.  This analysis  method allows one to
              rigorously characterize supramolecular  assemblies whose solution-state
              behavior is too vomplex to  allow characterization by standard methods such as
              gel;  filtration, gel electrophoresis or density gradient  ultracentrifugation.
              (5) The Center will vigorously promote  analytical ultracentrifugation
              education at both the  institutional and national levels.
