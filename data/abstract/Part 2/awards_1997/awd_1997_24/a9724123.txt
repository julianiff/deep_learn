Abstract    :
              IBN-9724123  PI:  Peterson  The inner ear of vertebrates contains mechanosensory
              receptors called hair cells.  Each cell has extending from its surface a tuft
              of hairlike microscopic processes called a ciliary bundle.  This ciliary bundle
              is extremely sensitive to deflection, and the amount and direction of
              mechanical deflection leads to a nerve signal from the ear about head position
              or about sound.  There are differences in bundle morphology in different parts
              of the ear, but a possible functional importance for these differences has
              remained largely speculative.  This project is a collaborative bioengineering
              effort involving modern imaging and computational technology to clarify
              possible functions for this diversity.  LIght and electron microscopy are used
              for detailed measurements of the bundles, which are incorporated into a
              computational finite-element model to quantify the contribution of different
              structural elements to bundle micromechanics.  A new fiber-optic system is used
              for direct tests of the bundle stiffness in isolated living hair cells, to
              compare with model predictions for different morphological categories of hair
              cell bundles. Results will have impact not only on auditory and vestibular
              sensory biology, but more broadly on understanding echanoreception, and with a
              likely impact on artificial biosensors and biotechnology at the nanoscale.
