Abstract    :
              The proposed objective is to develop a new instrument which will be  able to
              image the structure of human biological molecules  nondestructively, in situ,
              in three dimensions, with Angstrom-scale  resolution.    The technical means by
              which it is proposed to achieve this goal is  called magnetic resonance force
              microscopy (MRFM). This new  instrumentation technology was first described in
              1991 by the proposers   13, 14, 17 . It combines the Angstrom-scale spatial
              resolution of  scanning probe force microscopy with the three-dimensional
              imaging  capability of medical magnetic resonance imaging.
