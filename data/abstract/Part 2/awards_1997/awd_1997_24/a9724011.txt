Davenport
In this RUI proposal Prof. Davenport requests support
              for participation in the FOCUS Collaboration. This is a fixed target experiment
              at Fermilab which has made major contributions to the understanding of charmed
              quarks. Prof. Davenport has been an important contributor to this experiment,
              and has been successful in involving undergraduates in his research
              program.
