Abstract    :
              CDA-9724422  Sarkar, Sudeep    University of South Florida    Acquisition of a
              Cyberware 3D Scanner to Facilitate State of Art Research in Computer Vision and
              Graphics    The University of South Florida is acquiring range scanner and
              graphics workstations to support research in computer vision and computer
              graphics.  Specific research projects include performance characterization for
              range segmentation algorithms, color-texture analysis for range and color
              images, non-rigid motion estimates from range images, and algorithms for
              processing digitized data using non-uniform rational B-splines.    A number of
              graduate and undergraduate students will be using the proposed equipment in
              research projects.  The University is also considering using the equipment in
              courses such as Computer Vision, Image Processing, Pattern Recognition, and
              Computer Graphics.
