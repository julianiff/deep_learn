Abstract    :
                  We require funds to purchase state of the art Olympus AX70TRF  research
              microscope platform which supports superior optical  elements, differential
              interference contrast (Nomarski DIC) prisms  and an epifluorescence system. In
              addition we request an  accompanying image analysis system consisting of two
              cooled,  charge - coupled device (CCD) cameras, computer, monitor and image 
              analysis software. This platform will allow optimization of image  information
              and interpretation which would greatly enhance the  research capabilities of
              BBSR. The purchase of this  instrumentation would immediately benefit a variety
              of research  activities including studies of the microbial community's size, 
              and trophic structure of the Northwestern Sargasso Sea,  investigations of
              inherent optical properties in the Sargasso Sea,  and studies of biodiversity
              morphological and phylogenetic studies  of invertebrates
