Abstract    :
                This three-year award supports US-France cooperative research among Joseph
              Kearney   and James Kremer at the University of Iowa and Stephane Donikian at
              the Institute for   Research in Informatics and Random Systems (IRISA) in
              Rennes, France.  IRISA is   affiliated with INRIA, which is the French National
              Institute for Research in Informatics   and Applied Mathematics.  The objective
              of the research is to investigate scene and   scenario modeling for simulating
              large-scale virtual driving environments.  These   computer simulations are
              useful for studying driving behavior and conducting experiments   on the
              influence of drugs and disease, the effectiveness of computer-assisted driving
              aids,   and the impact of new in-vehicle technology.  The University of Iowa
              and IRISA groups   have developed independently driving simulators for rural
              and urban environments.  Their   work is supported by US and French governments
              respectively and Ford (in US) and   Renault (in France).  They have extensive
              and complementary expertise in system building,   dynamic simulation and
              control programming.  The project will advance knowledge of   virtual
              prototyping and the development of computer tools for understanding crashes and
                 crash prevention.
