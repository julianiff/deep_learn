Abstract    :
                                        Abstract                                              
                                      We propose to acquire state-of-the-art confocal 
              microscopy & imaging equipment to upgrade a well-established  confocal laser
              scanning microscopy institutional core  facility.  This facility is available
              to all Mount Sinai  School of Medicine investigators and serves diverse
              research  programs at Mount Sinai School of Medicine.  This equipment  would
              replace existing outdated existing equipment.  In  particular, there is a need
              for multi-channel (> 3 channels)  confocal detection, UV confocal capability,
              and the ability  to maintain living cells over long periods of time for 
              confocal observations.  The proposed equipment includes:  1)  a Leica TCS-NT
              (UV) confocal laser scanning microscope (with  5 channels for multi-channel
              labeling) and UV capability; 2)  an Apple PowerMacintosh computer for off-line
              image analysis  and figure preparation; 3) Bioptics and 4) a Codonics dye 
              sublimation printer to print photographic quality color  images obtained from
              the confocal microscope.
