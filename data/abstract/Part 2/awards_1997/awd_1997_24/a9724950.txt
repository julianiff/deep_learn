Abstract    :
                   9724950  Black    This eighteen month project would develop a tool to help
              K-8 teachers use the Internet as a resource tool in their classrooms.  The
              overwhelming and disorganized nature of the sites found on the WWW makes it
              unusable for many younger students.  KidSearch! is specifically designed to
              help eliminate superfluous links, and those that might be inappropriate.  It
              provides both the searching and the filtering capabilities of existing software
              while adding some significant features.  It supports teacher-built indexes of
              links that have been previewed by teachers; the interface is designed for
              children; it is available to anyone for free; it has no advertising.  Cost
              sharing is  7% of the total cost.
