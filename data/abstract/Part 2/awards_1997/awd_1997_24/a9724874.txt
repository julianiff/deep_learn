Abstract    :
              Dr. Richmond received her Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry from the  University of
              California-Berkeley in 1980.  Beginning her career as  the only female tenure
              track chemist in the physical sciences, Dr.  Richmond began and has sustained
              over 15 years of mentoring  undergraduate women and minorities into Ph.D. or MD
              careers.  This  most competitive nominee for the presidential mentoring award
              has  managed to balance a "cutting edge" research program and an active  family
              life with two young children, in addition to the following  achievements:      
                Director of the University of Oregon's Chemical Physics       Institute.     
                 Recipient of the 1996 Garvan Medal from the American Chemical       Society.
                      Developer and director of summer research programs for       students
              from non-research institutions.         Numerous awards for teaching
              excellence.                High visibility as a role model.                No
              graduate student has left her lab without an MS or Ph.D.               
              Impressive letters from students who have become peers in       "high power"
              laboratories or industries across the country.
