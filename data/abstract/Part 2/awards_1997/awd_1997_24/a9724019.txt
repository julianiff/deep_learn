Abstract    :
              In this GOALI program the PI's will explore novel techniques  for the joint
              spatial and temporal characterization of fast-  pulsed electric fields.  These
              new techniques are based on  interferometric, as opposed to spectrographic,
              methods.  A  major long-term objective of the program is to develop 
              measurement tools that are simple to implement and flexible  enough to be used
              for a wide range of pulse energies,  wavelengths and time duration.  Such tools
              would have  potential application in a broad range of scientific  disciplines,
              including physics, material science, chemistry,  and biology.  The research is
              conducted in collaboration  between the group at the University of Rochester
              and the co-  PI from Clark-MXR.  Experimental efforts will be divided  between
              the two locations, with students working partially  at Rochester and partially
              at the laboratories of Clark-MXR.  Partial funding is provided by the Office of
               Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA).
