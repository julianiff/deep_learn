Abstract    :
              9724804  Wong    This U.S.-Brazil award will support a research collaboration 
              between Dr. Peter N. Wong of Bates College to work with  Professor Daciberg
              Lima Goncalves at the Institute of  Mathematics and Statistics of the
              University of Sao Paulo.  Their research is on Nielsen coincidence theory on 
              homogeneous spaces.    This collaboration will unite five Nielsen theorists. 
              In  addition to Drs. Wong and Goncalves, the project will  include Drs. Lucila
              Borsari, Pedro Fagundes and Fernanda  Cardona of the University of Sao Paolo. 
              The goal of this  research is to explore different computable algebraic means 
              for computing the Nielsen coincidence number.  They propose  to find algebraic
              conditions under which the Nielsen  coincidence number and the Reidemeister
              coincidence number  agree.      ***
