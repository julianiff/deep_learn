Abstract    :
              9724238  April    This grant, made through the Major Research Instrumentation 
              (MRI) Program, provides $101,287 as one-half support of the  costs of acquiring
              an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF)  for the Geology Department at Colgate
              University for both  major and trace element analyses of geologic samples.  The
               new XRF will replace an antiquated (vintage 1977) XRF and  will provide
              state-of-the-art analytical service for both  departmental faculty and
              undergraduate students involved in  collaborative research projects including
              studies of the  biogeochemistry of forest soils, sedimentary and metamorphic 
              petrology and fluid/rock interactions.  ***
