Abstract    :
              This Major Research Instrumentation award to develop a Doppler wind capability
              for an existing Rayleigh lidar system at the Haystack Observatory in
              Massachusetts.  The upgrade will allow measurement of neutral winds in the
              altitude range between 30 and 100 km.  The scientific problems that will be
              addressed with this Doppler and Rayleigh lidar system are focused on the
              understanding of the variability of tidal wave structure and dynamics in the
              Earth's mesosphere and lower thermosphere.  Measurements of neutral winds at
              higher altitudes have shown that the observed tidal motions are not correlated
              with solar flux variations, geomagnetic perturbations, or stratospheric
              warmings.  Thus, it is possible that the cause of the variability is in the
              tidal source region or in the propagating medium below 80 km altitude.  The
              Doppler wind capability for the Haystack lidar system will enable these
              processes to be studied.  The upgrade requires a sensitive Fabry-Perot
              interferometer with a primary detector based on the Circle-to-Line technique.
