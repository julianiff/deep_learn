Abstract    :
              In this GOALI program the PI's are pursuing systematic  studies of the key
              physical processes underlying the  efficient hyperpolarization of He-3 and
              Xe-129 by spin-  exchange optical pumping.  Measurements focus on the 
              determination of spin-exchange and spin-relaxation cross  sections, optical
              pumping at high buffer gas pressures, the  role of van der Waals molecules in
              high-pressure Xe cells,  light transport in optically thick vapors, and
              relaxation  processes which depolarize the species.  This research is 
              conducted by collaborators from the University of Wisconsin  and Magnetic
              Imaging Technologies Incorporated (MITI), a  newly-established company
              specializing in the  commercialization of hyper-polarized noble-gas sources for
               use in medical diagnostics.  The experiments are conducted  by students
              working partly at the university and partly at  the company laboratories.
