Abstract    :
              Asuru  9724040    Technical Abstract:  This minority research planning grant is
              aimed at laying the groundwork for a full proposal that would focus on the role
              of eIF-2B in the regulation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. 
              Specifically, a mammalian expression system will be developed to study the role
              of phosphorylation of the largest subunit of eIF-2B in controlling protein
              synthesis.  The cDNA for this subunit will be cloned and transfected into COS-7
              cells. The cDNA currently in hand is incomplete, and the full length cDNA will
              be constructed using restriction enzymes.  A 2-D gel electrophoresis system
              will be developed that will allow the characterization of the phosphorylation
              states of eIF-2B. Preliminary data will be  developed for a competitive grant
              proposal.     Non-Technical Abstract:  Protein synthesis in higher animals and
              plants is regulated by a group of proteins called initiation factors.  This
              project focuses on characterizing one initiation factor, eIF-2 alpha.  EIF-2
              alpha mediates the inhibition of protein synthesis in response to environmental
              stresses such as viral infection, heavy metal exposure, nutrient deprivation
              and heat shock.  This research could lead to a better understanding of 
              regulation of protein synthesis during stress.
