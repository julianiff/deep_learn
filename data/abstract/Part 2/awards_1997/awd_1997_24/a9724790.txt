Abstract    :
              9724790  Etges    This U.S.-Mexico award will support Dr. William Etges of the 
              University of Arkansas in a research collaboration with Dr.  Miguel Armella
              Villalpando of the Universidad Autonoma  Metropolitana (Iztapalapa campus) in
              Mexico.  The  researchers plan to study patterns of host use among insect 
              species to analyze resource associations and degree of host  plant switching
              among ancestral and derived groups.  In  particular, they plan to study the
              host relationships of the  D. repleta group species, a cactophilic large group
              within  the genus Drosophila thought to have originated in New World  deserts,
              including the cactus-rich arid lands of central  Mexico.    This collaboration
              will allow the location and  identification of cactus hosts of D.repleta in the
              deserts  of central Mexico and will increase our understanding of the 
              evolution of this particular group species, which, despite  concentrated
              research efforts over the last 50 years,  remains poorly understood.  Using
              phylogenetic relationships  among these species, currently derived using
              molecular  approaches, the researchers propose to use patterns of host  use to
              gain insight into the processes of biological  diversification that have given
              rise to this large species  group.  ***
