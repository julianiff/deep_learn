Abstract    :
              9724508  Brantley    This grant, made through the Major Research Instrumentation
              (MRI)  Program, provides $175,120 as partial support of the costs of  acquiring
              a inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS)  and limited salary
              support for an associated ICP-MS technician.  Acquisition of the instrument
              will provide a large number of PI's  at the Pennsylvania State University with
              the analytical  capabilities to conduct high sensitivity and high precision 
              major, trace and isotopic analyses for many elements of interest  in
              geochemical and environmental research.  Specific examples  include,
              investigations of the stoichiometry and kinetics of  strontium release from
              carbonates during weathering, studies of  bacterial remineralization of trace
              elements bound in silicates,  paleooceanographic investigations of the trace
              element  geochemistry of carbonate microfossils and organic carbon during 
              early diagenesis, trace metal release during the combustion of  fossils fuels,
              and studies of adsorption/desorption processes and  precipitation/dissolution
              kinetics of trace metals in soils and  waste materials.  ***
