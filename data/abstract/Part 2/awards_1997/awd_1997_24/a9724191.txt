Abstract    :
                                                The goal of this proposal from the Fred
              Hutchinson         Cancer Research Center is to request partial funding        
              for the acquisition of an x-ray area detector, along         with a
              computational workstation and cryo-cooling         system, for crystallographic
              data collection by a         group of four principal investigators and their   
                   laboratories. The requested equipment would greatly         facilitate
              ongoing collaborative efforts both within         the center and with a large
              number of molecular         biology and biochemistry laboratories throughout
              the         country.
