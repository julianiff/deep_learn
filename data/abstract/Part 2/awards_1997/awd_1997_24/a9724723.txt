Abstract    :
              9724723  Lodge    This is a planning visit award for Dr. David M. Lodge, of  the
              Department of Biological Sciences at the University of  Notre Dame, to travel
              to Kenya to meet with Dr. Kenneth M.  Mavuti, of the Department of Zoology at
              the University of  Nairobi, and Dr. Gerald M. Mkoji, of the Biomedical Sciences
               Research Centre at the Kenya Medical Research Institute.  The purpose of the
              visit is to develop a cooperative  research activity to evaluate the impact of
              the North  American crayfish Procambarus  clarkii on the biota of  Kenya's
              freshwater lakes and wetlands.  This species of  crayfish was introduced for
              aquaculture, but is now being  considered as a biological control agent for
              freshwater  snails that are vectors for schistosomiasis (a major cause  of
              disease in Africa).  This study should add significant  new knowledge about the
              impact an exotic species of crayfish  has had on the local ecosystems in the
              lakes and wetlands of  Kenya.    Funding for this project is being provided
              jointly by the  Division of International Programs and the Division of 
              Environmental Biology.  ***
