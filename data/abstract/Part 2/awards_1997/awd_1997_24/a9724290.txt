Abstract    :
              9724290  Lau    The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the
              University of Massachusetts/Amherst will purchase a commercial organometallic
              chemical vapor deposition (OMCVD) system which will be dedicated to support
              research in compound semiconductor materials and devices.  The OMCVD system
              will be used for many research projects, including in particular:    (1)
              Resonant tunneling injection lasers,    (2) Selective-Area Growth of Compound
              Semiconductors by OMCVD,    (3) Application of the Two-Dimensional Electron Gas
              Medium to THz Detectors and Heterodyne Receivers,    (4) Optically-Pumped THz
              Sources/lasers,    (5) Quantum Well Solar Cells,    (6) Alternate sources for
              OMVPE of Ill-V semiconductors.    Acquisition of the OMCVD system will allow
              the PI to continue his pursuit of  advanced device concepts such as resonant
              tunneling injection lasers, 2-DEG detector and mixer arrays, THz sources, etc. 
              In addition, it will also allow us to work more closely with industrial
              companies who are interested in further development of more mature devices such
              as PHEMTs (pseudomorphic high-electron mobility transistors) and HBTs
              (Heterojuction Bipolar Transistors).  In the development of new device
              structures, testing of material concepts, and compatibility of different
              technologies, device wafers (full 3" or 4") with various structural designs
              grown in this system can be placed in the process lines by the companies for
              comparison.  This system will also greatly increase his capacity of training
              students in semiconductors in general and with familiarity of OMCVD
              specifically.    In summary, this piece of equipment is essential to some of
              our major projects and will provide new opportunities for us to collaborate
              with industrial researchers, as well as training students who are in high
              demand by the semiconductor, microwave, and photonic industries nafionwide.
