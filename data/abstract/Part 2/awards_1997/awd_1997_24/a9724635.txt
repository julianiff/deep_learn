Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Major  Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will   assist the
              Department of Chemistry at University of Florida to acquire a   400 MHz nuclear
              magnetic resonance  (NMR) spectrometer with solids and   imaging accessories.
              This equipment will enhance research in a number of   areas including the
              following: (1) synthesis of photoactive transition   metal-containing polymers,
              (2) dynamics and ordering of confined   molecular systems, (3) synthesis of
              solid acids and characterization by   NMR and `Cal-ad`, (4)  the interaction of
              fluorinated molecules with   metal oxides, (5) microporous solids: clathrates
              and zeolites, and (6)   molecular motion in biomolecular solids.  Nuclear
              Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool   available to
              chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.   It is used to
              identify unknown substances, characterize specific   arrangements of atoms
              within molecules, and to study the dynamics of   interactions between molecules
              in solution. Access to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to
              chemists who are carrying out frontier   research. The results from these NMR
              studies are useful in the areas such   as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
