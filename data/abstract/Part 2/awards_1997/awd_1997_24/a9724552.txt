Abstract    :
              9724552  Grimshaw, Andrew  University of Virginia    Development of a 25
              Gigaflop Machine for Computational and Computer Science Research    The
              University of Virginia is proposing to construct a 25 gigaflop multicomputer
              using off-the-shelf Pentium Pro multiprocessors connected in a 2D Torus using
              Myrinet switches.  This machine, named Centurion, will act as a large-scale
              test-bed for computationally challenging sciences and engineering problems and
              for systems-oriented computer science research.    Centurion will support the
              mission of the University's Institute for Parallel Computation to foster
              interaction between domain scientists and computer scientists working in the
              area of high-performance computing.  Applications will be drawn from
              biochemistry, chemical engineering, computer science, electrical engineering,
              engineering physics, environmental science, materials science, and radio
              astronomy.    Centurion will be constructed primarily by undergraduate students
              and will be used by undergraduate researchers under the supervision of faculty
              in computer science, electrical engineering, and other disciplines.  Centurion
              will also be used by graduate students and post-doctorate personnel in computer
              science, electrical engineering, environmental science, materials science, and
              biochemistry.
