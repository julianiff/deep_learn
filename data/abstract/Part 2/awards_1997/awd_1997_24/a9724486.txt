Abstract    :
              9724486  Klein    The University of Pennsylvania will acquire a confocal
              microscope  workstation for three-dimensional imaging and micromanipulation  of
              soft materials.  The instrument will support research in the  areas of colloid
              engineering, including colloidal crystals and  particle epitaxy, vesicles and
              membranes, emulsions, molecular  elasticity,  and flow in porous media.  The
              instrument will be  part of a Center for Advanced Imaging and Micromanipulation
               housed in the University's Laboratory for Research on the  Structure of Matter
              (LRSM).  %%%  Acquisition of this instrumentation will impact the research and 
              research training of over 40 students and postdoctoral fellows  associated with
              the soft materials group at the LRSM.  The  instrument will also be utilized by
              the 25 undergraduates, half  of them from other colleges and universities,
              participating in  the LRSM summer Research Experience for Undergraduates
              program.  ***
