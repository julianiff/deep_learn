Abstract    :
              9724317  Cody    This grant, made through the Major Research  Instrumentation
              (MRI) Program, provides $225,828 as  partial support of the costs of acquiring
              a solid  state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer to  characterize
              chemical structures in studies of organic  geochemistry, experimental petrology
              and mineral  physics. The use of this NMR spectrometer will be  strongly
              multidisciplinary including organic  geochemical characterization of the
              macromolecular  products of diagenetic reactions in sediments, studies  of
              major element speciation in volcanic glasses and  studies of the distribution
              of hydrogen in hydrous  magnesium silicates.  Many of the proposed studies 
              require the use of solid state NMR as many samples  require bulk spectral
              analysis given that laboratory  chemical separation techniques for many organic
              and  organic-inorganic compounds are often very difficult  and time consuming
              or can bias the in situ structural  conditions of the compound. Additionally,
              the  collaboration of organic geochemists with petrologists  and mineral
              physicists with widely ranging backgrounds  and ages using a state-of-the-art
              solid state NMR  spectrometer brings great potential for new insights  into the
              complex structural geochemistry of organic, inorganic  and organic-inorganic
              compounds that have direct  relevance to fundamental Earth processes.  ***
