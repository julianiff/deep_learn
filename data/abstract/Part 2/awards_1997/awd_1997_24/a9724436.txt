Abstract    :
              9724436  Sherwin    A tunable, far-infrared, picosecond source will be developed
               based on the free electron laser (FEL)  facility at the  University of
              California-Santa Barbara (UCSB).  The pulsed, far-  infrared source will
              support research in several areas of  condensed matter physics, mostly
              nonlinear dynamics of  semiconductor heterostructures and of superconductors at
               terahertz frequencies.  %%%  The light source to be developed will fulfill a
              current need for  a short-pulse, far-infrared user facility in the country. 
              The  new FEL capability has potential applications in other areas  besides
              condensed matter physics, such as molecular spectroscopy,  molecular chemistry,
              and biophysics.  ***
