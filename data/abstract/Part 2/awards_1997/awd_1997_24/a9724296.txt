Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Major  Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will   assist the
              Department of Chemistry at Hope College to acquire a 300 MHz   nuclear magnetic
              resonance (NMR) spectrometer. This equipment will   enhance research in a
              number of areas that include the preparation and   characterization of reduced
              mono-Cp zirconium compounds for use in C-C   bond forming reactions, the use of
              chiral tin(II) complexes for   asymmetric syntheses, the synthesis of
              derivatives of poly(m-xylylene) to   investigate the thermal processing of
              coal, the preparation of novel   polymeric material, and the use of enzymes for
              the synthesis of   asymmetric lactones.  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy is the most powerful tool   available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules.   It is used to identify unknown
              substances, characterize specific   arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
              to study the dynamics of   interactions between molecules in solution. Access
              to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are
              carrying out frontier   research. The results from these NMR studies are useful
              in the areas such   as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
