Abstract    :
              9724277  Dravid    A scanning focused ion beam (FIB) system for fabrication, 
              lithography and site-specific micromachining of a diverse set of  materials
              systems will be acquired by Northwestern University.  Material systems to be
              studied using the FIB capabilities include  structural ceramics, metal alloys,
              electronic, polymeric and  biological materials.  %%%  The instrument will
              assist a large number of research programs at  Northwestern and local
              institutions. It will also impact the  undergraduate curriculum at Northwestern
              as well as the  University's education outreach activities.  ***
