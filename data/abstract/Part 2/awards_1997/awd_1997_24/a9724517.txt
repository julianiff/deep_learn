Abstract    :
              9724517  Dunham, Margaret  Barr, Richard  Southern Methodist University    MRI: 
              A Laboratory for Telecommunications Management Network Research    Southern
              Methodist University will be acquiring four ATM switches and associated network
              hardware to establish a telecommunications laboratory which will support
              research in the areas of database, optimization and network planning, fault
              tolerant and distributed processing, and visualization.    Southern Methodist
              University plans to use the telecommunications laboratory to support graduate
              student research as well as an experimental testing facility for graduate level
              courses such as Operating Systems, Parallel and Distributed Processing,
              Database Management, Software Engineering, Telecommunication Network
              Management, and Systems in Telecommunications.
