Abstract    :
              IBN:  9724083  PI: PHILLIPS  There are many animals believed to use geomagnetic
              information for orientation and navigation behavior, but the identity of the
              sensory mechanisms that might be responsible for magnetic detection remain
              largely unknown.  Behavioral and neurophysiological evidence suggest that there
              may be more than one magnetoreceptive mechanism.  This project utilizes
              salamanders as a model system for studying magnetic homing behavior, to
              characterize and localize putative magnetosensory mechanisms.  Behavioral
              experiments involving altered magnetic fields and different particular
              environmental light will be used to determine whether a magnetic effect might
              act on photoreceptors or instead directly on some magnetically sensitive
              particles in the body.  Results will be important in providing some answers for
              this very controversial topic in sensory neurobiology.
