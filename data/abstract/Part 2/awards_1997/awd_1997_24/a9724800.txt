Abstract    :
              Johnson  9724800  Biological nitrogen fixation is a key segment of the nitrogen
              cycle.  The ability to carry out this reaction is limited to a very small
              number of prokaryotes.  A sub-set of these have the capacity to form symbiotic
              relationships with higher plants to facilitate the process.  Bacteria in the
              genus Rhizobia, gram-negative rods, are the most prominent member of this group
              of organisms.  The genetics and biochemistry of nodulation and nitrogen
              fixation have been intensively investigated in Rhizobia.  This is largely
              because of the plethora of genetic tools applicable to this group of organisms
              as well as their relationships with many important crop plants.  Frankia are
              the other major bacterial contributor to symbiotic nitrogen fixation.  These
              organisms are gram positive, filamentous bacteria that nodulate a wide variety
              of woody plants and shrubs.  Superficially, the two types of bacteria have
              similar modes of operation.  However, there are numerous fundamental
              differences which have been identified between the two systems.  Because the
              Frankia are very slow growing and do not form symbioses with commercially
              important plants, our knowledge of their genetics and biochemistry is extremely
              meager.  The lack of a vector-transformation system for these bacteria has
              seriously hampered attempts to understand their molecular biology.  Now, the
              availability of Frankia promoters and the development of electroporation
              technology as well as highly sensitive, fluorescent DNA and protein probes
              makes feasible a systematic analysis of the many individual steps in both
              vector development and transformation that need to be done in order to allow
              genetic analysis of this important group of ntirogen-fixing bacteria.
