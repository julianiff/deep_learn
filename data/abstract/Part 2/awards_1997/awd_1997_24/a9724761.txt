Abstract    :
              9724761  Knox    This award supports a 9 month National Science Foundation 
              Dissertation Enhancement award for Dr. James Knox in the  Department of
              Geology, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.  Dr. Knox's student, Mr. Michael
              Grossman, will work with Dr.  Nobuyuki Yonekura, Professor of Geology, on a
              research  project entitled, "Extreme Floods, Typhoon Occurrences, and  Climate
              Change in the Ara River Basin, Japan."    The proposed research will examine
              the history of extreme  floods in the Ara River basin in Japan and, through
              data  analysis, the probability of their future recurrence.  Current theories
              suggest that extreme floods in the region  (and elsewhere) may be a direct
              result of human-induced  global climate change and not a continuation of
              patterns  occurring in previous eras.  The proposed research will test  global
              change theories by comparing past and present fluvial  system data from the Ara
              River basin, with a specific  emphasis on the hypothesized relationship between
              climate  change-induced typhoon activity and regional flooding.  Results of the
              research will offer insight into whether  global climate change is indeed the
              primary determinant  involved in apparent changes in fluvial regimes, and will 
              provide empirical rationale for similar research in other  regions throughout
              the world.  ***
