Abstract    :
              9724786  Saini-Eidukat    This Americas Program award will fund a short term
              visit to  Argentina for Dr. Saini-Eidukat, North Dakota State  University, to
              plan a collaborative research project  on the  silisic volcanism of eastern
              Patagonia.   He will be  collaborating with Dr. Ernesto Bjerg, of the
              Universidad  Nacional del Sur, Bahia Blanca.  The researchers have a  working
              hypothesis that has to be tested with additional  geochemical and temporal
              constraints. The visit  is  necessary in order to select the best possible
              samples to  test the  geological hypothesis.   The proposed research  will
              include petrologic and geochemical analysis to  determine comagmatic
              associations, with the goal of  constructing a conceptual model for the
              evolution of the  area.    ***
