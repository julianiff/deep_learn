Abstract    :
              9724571  McDaniel    A scanning nuclear microprobe users facility will be
              developed at  the University of North Texas.  The users facility will be 
              available to universities, government laboratories and industry.  Potential
              users have applications in a variety of topics,  including surface analysis,
              electronics, art and archeology,  biology, environment and geology.  A workshop
              to be held in  conjunction with the yearly International Accelerator Conference
               in Denton, TX, will train scientists and students on the uses of  this
              facility.  %%%  The microprobe being built is the finest instrument available
              at  the time and the center of a relatively unique facility in the  country.
