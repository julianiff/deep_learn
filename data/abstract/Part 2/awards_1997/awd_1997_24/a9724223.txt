Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will   assist the
              Department of Chemistry at the University of Arizona to   acquire x-ray
              photoelectron spectrometer (XPS). This equipment will   enhance research in a
              number of areas including the following: (1) thin   film materials, (2) spatial
              characterization of chemistry at   electrochemically-important interfaces and
              at nanostructured   inorganic-organic layered materials , (3) stabilized
              discotic mesophases,   supramolecular fibers, and related molecular assemblies,
              (4) structure   and function in protein film assemlies, (5) new integrated
              optic   waveguide materials, and (6) reactivity relationships in transition
              metal   chemistry.    The X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectrometer is used for
              chemical analysis.   It irradiates a sample with a beam of monochromatic X-rays
              and the   energies of the resulting photoelectrons are measured and are related
              to   specific elements.
