Abstract    :
              9724809  Ting  Chu    This proposal supports collaborative research between Drs.
               C. S. Ting and Paul C. W. Chu of the University of Houston  and Dr. Alvaro
              Ferraz at the University of Brasilia and Dr.  A. J. Aguiar at the Universidade
              Federal de Pernambuco.    Their research will involve the theoretical and
              experimental  aspects of high temperature superconducting materials(HTS).  Dr.
              Ting will be responsible for the theoretical portion,  with the experimental
              aspect primarily handled by the  Brazilians, with the aid and direction of Dr.
              Chu.    This collaboration will link three strong centers for 
              superconductivity - the Texas Center at the University of  Houston, the
              International Center of Condensed Matter  Physics at the Universidade de
              Brasilia and the Physics  Department of the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco.
               This  project may lead to better understanding of high temperature 
              superconductivity, particularly of superconductivity at  temperatures above the
              current record.  *  *  *
