Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will   assist the
              Department of Chemistry at Miami University to acquire an   electron
              paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer. This equipment will   enhance
              research in a number of areas including the following: (1) the   study of the
              chemical reactivity of and the conditions necessary to   generate radicals from
              a series of carcinogens, (2) the characterization   of metal binding sites in
              proteins, (3) the characterization of sol-gel   processes for gas phase
              sensors, and (4) the study of metal binding sites   in proteins  involved in
              meiosis.  An electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer is an
              instrument   used to obtain information about the molecular and electronic
              structure   of molecules. It may also be used to obtain information about the  
              lifetimes of free radicals which are often essential for the initiation   of
              tumor growth and/or a variety of chemical reactions.
