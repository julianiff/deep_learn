Abstract    :
              9724289    Rahman, Talat    Kansas State University      Acquisition of Upgraded
              High Performance Multiprocessors for Computational Research in Science and
              Engineering        Kansas State University is acquiring a multi-processor
              computing facility with shared memory, together with a visualization
              workstation to support large computation needs in biochemistry, chemistry,
              physics and engineering.  All the research projects have the common theme of
              high performance computing applied to the simulation of physical, chemical, or
              biological systems.  Specific research topics include modeling of novel
              materials and macromolecules, computational atomic and molecular structure and
              collisions, computational fluid dynamics, and engineering software for parallel
              scientific applications.    The computational and visualization facilities will
              be available for training graduate students in computational modeling and
              visualization.  Kansas State envisages that the new facility will play an
              important role in their existing recruitment programs designed to attract
              minorities and women to graduate programs in the physical, biological and
              engineering sciences.
