Abstract    :
              9724949  Little  The Federal Facilities Council is a cooperative association  of
              federal agencies having interests and responsibilities  related to building
              science and construction.  Established  in 1953 on the recommendation of a
              committee of the National  Research Council, the Federal Facilities Council
              (FFC)  serves as a unique forum in which the sponsoring agencies  meet
              regularly among themselves and with other organizations  in the design and
              construction, maintenance, management,  operation, and evaluation of federal
              facilities.    Tangible products of the FFC include symposia, which usually 
              are held at the National Academy of Sciences, and reports.  Through the years,
              the FFC has conducted or sponsored more  than 150 formal studies and
              investigations dealing with  virtually every aspect of the design,
              construction, and  operation of facilities.  By helping the agencies solve 
              problems and improve the design of federal facilities, the  FFC has saved
              taxpayers untold millions of dollars.  ***
