Abstract    :
              9724719  Loiselle    This Americas Program dissertation enhancement grant will 
              fund Grace Servat,  under the direction of Dr. Bette  Loiselle, University of 
              Missouri, St. Louis,  on a study to  elucidate the patterns and underlying
              mechanisms that shape  the foraging ecology of birds associated with a unique 
              woodland habitat of  the High Andes in South America.  This  community is well
              suited for the present study because it is  a distinctive biological system
              characterized by high levels  of endemism, its scattered distribution in the
              Andes  provides discrete replicates for study,  and the plant and  bird species
              composition are relatively simple, when  compared to more species-rich forests
              at lower elevation,  thus facilitating detailed ecological studies at a
              community  level.  The major objectives of the study are to document  and
              compare, across replicate sites, the foraging ecology of  individual bird
              species feeding on arboreal arthropods; to  determine the extent to which
              patterns observed in the  foraging ecology of bird species and the assemblage
              as a  whole are repeated across regions; and to determine which  scale and
              factors best explain variation in the foraging  ecology of individual species. 
              The research will integrate  natural history observations with detailed
              ecological  studies on availability of arthropod resources, vegetation 
              structures and the abundance of potential competitors and  predators.    The
              proposed study will contribute new information about a  distinctive and highly
              threatened Andean system, as well as  provide a model to examine the importance
              of  local and  regional processes in shaping individual foraging ecology  and
              community patterns.  ***
