Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Utah State  University will
              purchase an eight processor Silicon Graphics  worhstation which will be
              dedicated to the support of research in  the mathematical sciences.  The
              equipment will be used for many  research projects, including:  *   Enhanced
              methods for  predicting high-dimensional multivariate time series.  *   
              Computational modeling of groundwater flow in fractured  material and fault
              zones. *   Computational modeling of  temporal-spatial population dynamics of
              insect infestation, with  applications to forest management. *    New
              statistical methods  for the understanding and control of dynamical systems,
              with  applications to combustion and fluid flow. * Numerical methods  for
              large-scale nonlinear systems, with applications to fluid  dynamics and
              reactive flows.
