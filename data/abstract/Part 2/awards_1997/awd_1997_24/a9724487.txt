Abstract    :
              9724487  LEDERER, WILLIAM    The goal of this project is to establish a
              two-photon  microscopy facility to complement and extend existing multi-  user
              bioimaging resources at the University of Maryland at  Baltimore (UMAB). 
              Two-photon excitation avoids many of the  disadvantages inherent in
              conventional and confocal  microscopies.  For example, the approach affords
              better  spatial discrimination for photolytic techniques and better 
              penetration into thick samples.  Furthermore, two-photon  excitation entirely
              eliminates photobleaching, photodamage  and background fluorescence in planes
              away from the focus.  These properties make two-photon microscopy an excellent 
              method for the study of living cells, and will permit  important new
              experiments to be completed by UMAB  researchers.  A two-photon microscopy will
              also provide the  basis for state-of-the-art training for students and 
              postdoctoral fellows.
