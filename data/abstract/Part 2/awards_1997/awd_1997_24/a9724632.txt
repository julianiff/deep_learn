Abstract    :
              9724632  Bonner  This is an award to provide support for instrumentation to 
              conduct collaborative research on decontamination of soil that  has been
              contaminated by crude oil, products resulting from the  refining of oil and
              residues from production of explosives.  The  research to be conducted in this
              project involves identification  of transformation pathways by which microbial
              degradation of  these contaminants occurs especially concentrating on the 
              identification of intermediates.  The proposal leading to this  award was
              submitted in accord with the NSF Instrument Development  and Acquisition
              Solicitation, NSF 97-24, Major Research  Instrumentation (MRI) Program.    The
              availability of the equipment provided through this award is  expected to
              enhance the ability of environmental engineers and  others to detect and
              monitor intermediate products of microbial  action on petroleum and petroleum
              products.  This knowledge is  expected to have applications in the engineering
              design of  systems for decontamination of soil contaminated by the category  of
              pollutants being studied in this project.  ***
