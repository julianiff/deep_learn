Abstract    :
                The American Mathematical Society will administer a program of  travel grants
              for U.S. mathematicians to attend the 1998  International Congress of
              Mathematicians, Berlin, Germany, August  18-27, 1998.   This will be similar to
              travel support programs  conducted in 1990 and 1994.  Approximately $200,000
              will  be awarded.    This program is open to U.S. mathematicians (those who are
               currently affiliated with a U.S. institution).  Applications will  be
              evaluated by a panel of mathematical scientists, who will use  their judgment
              in evaluating professional qualifications.  Travel  awards are intended to
              provide partial support and may be used  for travel or subsistence costs. 
              Junior mathematicians will  receive a slightly higher award amount.
              Mathematicians who accept  the support offered under this program may not
              supplement it with  any other NSF funds.
