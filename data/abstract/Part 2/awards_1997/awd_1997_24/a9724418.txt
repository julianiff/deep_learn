Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Major  Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will   assist the
              Department of Chemistry at Pomona College acquire a 400 MHz   NMR Spectrometer.
              This equipment will enhance research in a number of   areas including the
              following: (1) studies of the conformational behavior   of the antibiotic
              erythromycin and its derivatives, (2) studies of the   interactions of ligands
              and receptors at the molecular level, and  (3)   studies  the experimental and
              theoretical aspects of NMR isotope effects   and the synthesis and
              conformational analysis of structurally modified   natural products.  Nuclear
              Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool   available to
              chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.   It is used to
              identify unknown substances, characterize specific   arrangements of atoms
              within molecules, and to study the dynamics of   interactions between molecules
              in solution. Access to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to
              chemists who are carrying out frontier   research. The results from these NMR
              studies are useful in the areas such   as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
