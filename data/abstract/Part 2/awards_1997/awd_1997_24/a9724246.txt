Abstract    :
              ***  9724246  Strait  This award is for the purchase of core instrumentation to 
              enhance the quality and scope of research training in the  new Williams College
              Laser Facility.  The shared equipment  will be used by those faculty and
              advanced undergraduates in  the physics and chemistry departments who use
              lasers and  optical techniques in research.  The research impacted  covers a
              broad spectrum of atomic, molecular, optical, and  chemical physics subfields,
              including modelocked laser  dynamics, precision atomic and molecular
              spectroscopy, and  molecular energy transfer.  This action is partly supported 
              by the NSF Major Research Instrumentation Program and partly  by the MPS Office
              of Multidisciplinary Activities.  ***
