Abstract    :
              MCB-9724910  Green    Lay Abstract    Our knowledge of plant cell Biology has
              grown tremendously over the past several years, particularly in the areas of
              protein trafficking, cell signalling, and cell division.  In protein
              trafficking, several components of the molecular machinery that targets
              proteins to specific sites in the cell have been identified and cloned.  The
              study of plant signalling has revealed steps, signals and intermediates that
              are novel to plant cells or of broad significance to both plants and animals. 
              Perhaps the most exciting advances are from studies of plant cell development
              because these studies have brought together several previously independent
              directions of research.  This Keystone Symposium entitled Plant Cell Biology
              will highlight the most recent progress on signalling and trafficking pathways
              in plant cells.  Emphasis will be placed on integrating these studies with
              those on cell division, cell death, morphogenesis and other aspects of plant
              development to elucidate the intricate relationships among them.
