Abstract    :
              9724819  Clements    This U.S.-Brazil award provides support for Dr. Kevin A. 
              Clements of Worcester Polytechnic Institute to work with  Professor Antonio
              Simoes Costa at the Universidade Federal  de Santa Catarina in Florianopolis,
              Brazil on the study of  optimal power flow methods in competitive electricity 
              markets.    Optimal power flow is a tool which can be used to look at  the
              problem of figuring the marginal costs of electricity.  In computing these
              costs, several constraints must be taken  into account such as physical lower
              and upper limits for  individual generators, security-related transmission
              loading  limits of transmission lines, and the required amount of  reactive
              support.  By developing this tool, they can model  consumer demand elasticity
              as well as consumer energy use.  They will develop models in parallel in Brazil
              and the  United States.  Both sides have been working on this problem  and by
              joining research teams and facilities, they can  advance their research more
              quickly and efficiently.        ***
