Abstract    :
               The rapid growth in the applications of advanced materials necessitates an
              integrated effort to acquire and develop new electrohydraulic machines for
              mechanical property evaluation to better understanding the behavior of advanced
              materials. This project is to acquire and develop high-frequency, elevated
              -temperature electrohydraulic equipment for automated fatigue and fracture
              tests.  The equipment will be used to investigate the mechanical behavior of
              advanced materials, such as ceramic-matrix composites (CMCs), metal--matrix
              composites (MMCs), polymer-matrix composites (PMCs), superalloys and
              intermetallics. Moreover, the new equipment will facilitate the study of aged
              materials and biomedical devices.   The research project will provide a
              valuable mechanism to support both teaching and research activities. In
              addition, the project has potential to impact the field as well as to the
              national infrastructure.
