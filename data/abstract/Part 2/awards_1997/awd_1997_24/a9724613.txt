Abstract    :
              CDA-9724613    Bansil, Arun    Northeastern University        Acquisition of a
              High-Performance Computation/Visualization Laboratory for Scientific Research  
                   Northeastern University is acquiring a symmetric multiprocessor, a network
              of workstations, and a cluster of high-performance graphics workstations to
              support scientific visualizations, the execution of medium scale science and
              engineering computations, and the development of scalable codes using standard
              programming languages and tools.  Research areas include high-energy physics,
              materials science simulations, cosmology, protein dynamics, and large
              non-linear dynamics systems simulation.    Northeastern University plans to
              include advanced computational techniques involving parallel platforms and
              languages into existing computational science courses.  One of the PIs of the
              proposal is also a co-coordinator of Academic Common Experience (ACE) at
              Northeastern University whereby non-science majors are introduced to science
              and technology. The high-performance facilities will also be available for use
              by such students.  Various departments represented in this proposal are active
              in outreach activities for local high school teachers and students.
