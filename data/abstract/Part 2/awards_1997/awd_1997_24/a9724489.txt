Abstract    :
              This standard grant will furnish partial support to  construct a facility to
              provide linearly polarized photons  at Jefferson National Laboratory.  Together
              with other  equipment already in place or committed, it will permit  studies of
              spin-dependent properties of the interaction  between electromagnetic radiation
              and protons and neutrons.  Polarized radiation (of which laser light is an
              example) has  electric and magnetic components whose direction is selected  in
              the polarization process, and this allows one to study  the distribution of
              charges and currents inside protons and  neutrons in a more precise manner than
              with unpolarized  radiation.  The Jefferson Laboratory experimental program is 
              of high priority within US nuclear science, as established  by the joint
              NSF/DOE Nuclear Science Advisory Committee in  its 1996 Long Range Plan, and a
              polarized photon source  represents a significant enhancement of the
              laboratory's  capability.  Education of students and postdocs is a strong 
              component of the Jefferson Laboratory experimental program.  This action is
              supported by the NSF Major Research  Instrumentation Program.
