Abstract    :
              9724462  Swets, Daniel L.  Augustana College    Major Research Instrumentation: 
              Acquisition of Laboratory Equipment for Parallel Algorithm Research Image
              Processing    A Major Research Instrumentation award has been made to Augustana
              College to support the acquisition of a cluster of high-powered Pentium
              machines to develop a parallel processing laboratory for use in academic
              instruction and research.  The parallel processing equipment will allow
              Augustana faculty and students to study parallel implementation of computer
              vision and image processing algorithms for the production of real-time,
              cost-effective image processing systems.  Augustana College has existing ties
              to the US Geological Survey EROS Data Center, Sioux Falls, South Dakota which
              makes available data from remote sensing sources including satellite, airplane,
              and ground radiometers.  Three senior personnel and eight undergraduates will
              be developing parallel algorithms for the processing and analysis of satellite
              images that include parallel cloud-cover data detection and extraction,
              parallel statistical data smoothing, and parallel land cover analysis.
