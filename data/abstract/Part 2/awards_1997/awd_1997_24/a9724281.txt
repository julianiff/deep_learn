Abstract    :
              9724281    Akansu, Ali    New Jersey Institute of Technology        Laboratory
              for Multimedia Signal Processing and Communication        New Jersey Institute
              of Technology (NJIT) is acquiring a high speed computing, data storage and
              retrieval facilities for processing, compressing and displaying real-time image
              and video sequences.  This equipment will support research projects in
              image/video processing and compression, and transmission over wired and
              wireless networks.  Additional image and video communication equipment will be
              acquired to support research projects on channel characterization, performance
              analysis and simulation for image and video communication.    NJIT, Princeton
              University and Rutgers University are founding partners of a recently
              established New Jersey Center for Multimedia Research (NJCMR).  NJCMR has been
              designated as a Research Excellence Center by the New Jersey State Commission
              of Science and Technology with a funding level of over $1 million per year for
              the coming 5 years.  The MRI-funded equipment will form part of a new
              laboratory for Multimedia Signal Processing and Communication to support
              research projects within this Research Excellence Center.    NJIT has a leading
              position in the State as a distance learning provider and the requested
              equipment will also be used to support multimedia technologies research and
              their application for educational and learning environments, as well as in
              advanced-level graduate course work on multimedia signal-processing,
              compression and communication.
