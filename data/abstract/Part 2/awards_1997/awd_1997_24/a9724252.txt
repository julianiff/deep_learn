Abstract    :
                  Our group of diverse biologists are actively using DNA analysis to conduct 
              integrative research on issues pertaining to 1) systematics, 2) genome 
              mapping, 3) behavioral biology, 4) conservation of endangered species, and  5)
              ecological genetics. We are using DNA sequence data for phylogenetic  analysis
              and using DNA markers for population-level and family-level  questions. We
              currently contract for DNA sequencing  services from distant facilities at
              other universities or generate our own  genotype data using  radioactive
              labeling methods and manual autoradiogram scoring. Our proposal  is for 
              instrumentation that will bring data generation to our university and  increase
              our capacity  for this type of analysis. On site instrumentation would lower
              the cost of  this analysis,  increase the use of molecular analysis by our
              faculty, increase the speed  of data generation,  and directly expose our
              students to the next generation in DNA technology  that is shaping our
              sciences. We need this instrumentation to keep our high  quality research
              programs  Competitive at national and international levels.
