Abstract    :
              9724825  Whitehead    This Americas Program award will fund a collaborative 
              research project between Dr. John A. Whitehead, Woods Hole  Oceanographic
              Institution, Massachusetts, and Dr. Sergey N.  Bulgakov, Universidad de
              Guadalajara, Mexico, to conduct  laboratory experiments that will shed further
              light on deep  ocean circulation.  The investigators will examine the flow 
              driven by subjecting rotating cylinders of water to  different temperatures
              along the top, side and bottom  boundaries,  in order to characterize length
              and velocity  scales of the resulting flow.  Comparison of the  experimental
              results with theory will be made over a wide  range of parameters, including
              simple linear theories,  numerical models, and measurements of circulation
              being done  in the Sea of Japan.    The  project,  motivated by the thesis work
              of Dr. Bulgakov,  has already produced  encouraging results from earlier 
              experiments.  The collaboration with Dr. Whitehead,  a  leader in applying 
              experimental results to real  oceanographic and geophysical problems,  has the
              potential  to provide significant insight  on a number of important 
              geophysical issues.  ***
