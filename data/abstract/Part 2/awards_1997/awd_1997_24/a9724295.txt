Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Major  Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will   assist the
              Department of Chemistry at University of Iowa to acquire a 400   MHz nuclear
              magnetic resonance  (NMR) spectrometer. This equipment will   enhance research
              in a number of areas including the following: (1)   synthetic fluoroolefin
              chemistry, (2) novel biologically active natural   products from fungi, (3)
              organometallic chemistry and reactivity of   unusual iron porphyrins, (4)
              synthetic chemistry and biology of novel   nucleosides, nucleotides and nucleic
              acids, and (5) synthesis of   phosphonates and bis-phosphonates.   Nuclear
              Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool   available to
              chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.   It is used to
              identify unknown substances, characterize specific   arrangements of atoms
              within molecules, and to study the dynamics of   interactions between molecules
              in solution. Access to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to
              chemists who are carrying out frontier   research. The results from these NMR
              studies are useful in the areas such   as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
