Abstract    :
              This is a request for $140,753 towards the purchase of an  electrospray
              ionization ion trap mass spectrometer (total  cost: $201,076).  This instrument
              will play a pivotal role  in the research projects of many investigators at the
              Salk  Institute and researchers at other academic institutions  (see letters of
              support).  These projects currently include  (A) characterizing the primary
              structure of conotoxins;(B)  identifying the role of phosphorylation in cell
              activation  and cell growth and (C) characterizing the site protein  ligand
              interactions.
