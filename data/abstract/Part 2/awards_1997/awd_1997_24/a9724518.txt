Abstract    :
              The proposal seeks support with a major investment in a servo-hydraulic
              instrumentation system (actuators, pump, hoses, computerized control system,
              support hardware, and force and displacement measurement transducers) to be
              used for medium load-range testing of structural members, components, and
              assemblies.  It will enable more aggressive experimental and performance
              analysis and innovation in materials and system design.  The horizons for
              educators and scientists in the departments of Forest Products and Civil
              Engineering will be elevated from single parts or small subassemblies tested
              under static loads to assemblies and complete light-frame structures tested
              under static and dynamic loading regimes.  This experimental direction is
              essential to make progress toward improved structural performance and safety,
              mitigation of structural damages given natural hazard loadings, optimization of
              structural systems, continued innovation of bio-based composite materials, and
              advanced understanding of plant physiological/mechanical functions.
