Abstract    :
              INT 97-24817  Price          This U.S.-Russian dissertation research project is
              on the analysis of a ring species.The principal investigators are Dr. Trevor
              Price and his graduate student, Darren Irwin, of the University of California,
              San Diego and  Dr. Gennady V. Kelberg of the "Stolbi" National Nature Reserve
              in Krasnoyarsk, Russia.  The PI and his graduate student plan to investigate
              the structure and dynamics of species limits in a purported Phylloscopus ring
              species.  They will test whether the species complex is truly a ring species by
              collecting blood samples at various locations throughout the complex to study
              patterns of genetic variation.  They will also investigate reproductive
              isolation by using playback experiments and analyzing song structures.   The
              project has general implications for the role of gene flow, local adaptation,
              and species interactions in species formation.  More specifically, it will
              evaluate the role of geographical variation in song and song recognition during
              the initial stages of speciation.      This project in population biology
              research fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts
              in the U.S. and Russia to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in
              areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality,
              reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
