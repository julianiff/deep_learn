Abstract    :
                    This project, `Development of a Multichannel Time-Resolved Fluorometer 
              for  Macro  and Microstudies', is to update and improve the ability of the
              Time-  Resolved   Fluorescence  Facility  at  Mount  Sinai  to  provide 
              pertinent  information  about the structure and dynamics of biological 
              macromolecules  and their complexes. The present instrumentation in the
              Facility was funded  in  part by a 1986 NSF award (DMB-8516318) entitled `A
              Multi-User Laser for  Time-Resolved Fluorescenc'. The new proposal has three
              main objectives:         replacement of the outdated, limited-wavelength range
              pulsed laser  system with a state-of-the-art pulsed        laser system capable
              of providing the UV and visible excitation  wavelengths required by numerous   
                  research programs         construct and implement a new sample chamber with
              three simultaneous  detection channels to enhance         the collection and
              the precision of time-resolved fluorescence  intensity and anisotropy data sets
                      combine time-resolved fluorescence with microscopy to permit studies 
              on 'micro' samples    A  three year program is outlined, with most of the
              acquisition/development  of the major components to  occur in the first year.
              Implementation, testing, and commissioning will be  performed in the following
              two years.
