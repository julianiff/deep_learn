Abstract    :
              Real agents must work within the limitations (bounds) imposed by their own
              makeup.  Among the   resources available only in limited quantities are time,
              space, and information.  This project is to study the   rational utilization of
              limited resources in reasoning.  Specifically, the tasks will be: (1) to devise
              and   implement a treatment of reasoning in bounded agents embedded in a rich
              environment, paying special   attention to their planning, reasoning about
              action, and resolution of conflicting information, using the   formalism of
              active logic; (b) to focus on the application of the above to web agents and
              their autonomous   time management (planning and scheduling) in order to meet
              user requests; (c) to continue the   development of a standard logic engine;
              and (4) to develop a computationally attractive syntactic account   of
              propositional attitudes, including belief, desire, and attention.  The results
              of the research will allow the   development of bounded web agents based on a
              firm theoretical foundation.
