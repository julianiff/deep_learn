Abstract    :
              9724014  Verma  Cell plate formation is a unique and important process in plants
              because - unlike in animals - plant cells do not migrate.  The orientation of
              the original cell plate determines the direction of growth. Several mutations
              have been obtained which alter the orientation of the cell plate. The focus is
              on the function of a protein, phragmoplastin, with homology to animal dynamin,
              that is associated with early events in plant cell plate formation. The work
              includes the analysis of phragmoplastin synthesis, ER- and Golgi-transport and
              insertion into the developing cell plate by monitoring GFP-phragmoplastin
              fusion proteins. This provides a real-time, live-cell, high-resolution picture
              of the event. Associated experiments will dissect the domain structure of
              phragmoplastin, determining the dynamics of cell plate formation, and
              monitoring of the exocytotic capacity that accompanies cell plate formation.
