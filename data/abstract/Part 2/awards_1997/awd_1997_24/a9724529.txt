Abstract    :
              This grant acquires an ultra-high resolution Fourier transform spectrometer
              (FTS) to study gas phase compounds.  The instrument, used jointly by
              researchers in the Department of Physics and Astronomy and the Department of
              Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Denver, develops and implements
              FTS methods to measure atmospheric gas phase compounds at remote field sites. 
              In addition, the investigators explore new research directions, including
              evaluating and understanding deployment issues involved in atmospheric remote
              sensing; acquisition of solar absorption spectra; gas cell absorption studies
              of molecular species; analysis of synthesized chemical substances coupled to
              electronic and molecular absorptions; and identification of chemical reaction
              products.   The researchers have historically incorporated students in their
              research; accordingly, the additional FTS instrument is an instructional tool
              for graduate and undergraduate training in gas phase spectroscopy at the
              University of Denver.     ATM-9724529
