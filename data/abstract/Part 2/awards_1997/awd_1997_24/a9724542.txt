Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program, the Major  Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program and the   Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) will assist the Department   of Chemistry at
              University of Idaho to purchase a 500 MHz  NMR   Spectrometer and accessories.
              This equipment will enhance research in a   number of areas including the
              following: (1) organometallic chemistry,   (2) porphyrin chemistry, (3)
              synthetic fluorine chemistry, (4) rational   drug design, (5) humic acid
              chemistry, (6) selective ligands for metal   complexation in supercritical
              fluids, and (7) theoretically interesting   molecules.  Nuclear Magnetic
              Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool   available to chemists
              for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.   It is used to identify
              unknown substances, characterize specific   arrangements of atoms within
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of   interactions between molecules in
              solution. Access to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to
              chemists who are carrying out frontier   research. The results from these NMR
              studies are useful in the areas such   as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
