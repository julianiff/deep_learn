Abstract    :
              9724432  Wattrus  This award to University of Minnesota supports acquisition of
              a multibeam sonar system for lake floor mapping and an acoustic doppler current
              profiler for measuring water column velocity.  Both systems are portable so
              they may be used on vessels of opportunity in the Great Lakes and elsewhere
              (including East Africa and South America, where these investigators have
              ongoing research projects).  In conjunction with these systems, they will
              acquire a high precision navigation system, which may be operated with both
              instruments, providing the necessary velocity, heading and motion sensors. 
              This project is supported under the Major Research Instrumentation Program, and
              includes substantial cost-share towards instrumentation and technician time by
              University of Minnesota.  ***
