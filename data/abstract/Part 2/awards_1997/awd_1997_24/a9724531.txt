Abstract    :
                    This proposal seeks funding for the completion of a state of the art, 
              bending magnet, protein crystallography station on the X9A beamline of the 
              National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) at Brookhaven National  Laboratories.
              The plan includes the purchase of the beamline optical  components (i.e.,
              monochromator and mirror) as well as a CCD detector and  associated automation
              and computing hardware for rapid and efficient data  collection and reduction.
              This facility will provide the crystallographic  communities at the Albert
              Einstein College of Medicine (AECOM), Rockefeller  University (RU) and the
              Sloan-Kettering Institute (SKI) with 170 days of  access per year to high flux,
              tunable synchrotron radiation, and will allow  for rapid progress on existing
              projects, as well as the initiation and  timely completion of new structural
              problems. In addition, this facility  will provide 60 days of beam time to the
              protein crystallography community  nationwide through the NSLS General User
              program, which requires that 25%  of the total beam time be distributed through
              a peer reviewed process  administered by NSLS.
