Abstract    :
                9724464  Flament    The University of Hawaii will acquire and install an array
              of   high frequency Doppler radars, capable of mapping surface ocean   currents
              within a distance of up to 70 km, operate the array,   analyze the resulting
              data, and produce various products that   will support oceanographic research. 
              The radar array will   provide time series of currents at a resolution of 3 km
              and data   will be updated often enough to provide good spatial and temporal  
              coverage for studying dynamic processes.  Radar-derived data on   currents will
              be compared with data from traditional current   meters. The PIs anticipate
              that advances will be made in   understanding processes such as tidal
              propagation around islands,   formation and decay of island-trapped waves, and
              eddy generation   in the lee of islands. Studies of biological processes such
              as   recruitment of pelagic larvae to adult coastal habitats,   requiring
              information on advection by ocean currents will also   benefit from this new
              capability.     An important byproduct of this project will be real-time  
              dissemination of surface current maps to aid those with a   requirement for
              such data, such as ship routing, coastal zone   management, pollution
              abatement, nearshore sediment transport and   other uses. The University is
              cost-sharing this project.
