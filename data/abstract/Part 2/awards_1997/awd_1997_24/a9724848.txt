Abstract    :
              Dr. David Ferguson received his Ph.D. in Mathematics and Science  Education from
              the University of California-Berkeley in 1980.   Currently he is a Professor in
              the Department of Technology and  Society at the State University of New York
              at Stony Brook.           Dr. Ferguson has been a major force behind the
              emergence of Stony  Brook s most successful programs for minority students. In
              addition  to recruiting other faculty colleagues to increase the minority 
              participation in their programs, Dr. Ferguson has accomplished the  following: 
                     Took the initiative and coordinated The Alliance for Minority      
              Participation (AMP) Program for the SUNY system.  His efforts       have
              impacted the entire state.               Raised several million dollars in
              addition to the above to       support mentoring programs from high school to
              graduate       school.         Provides leadership throughout the state in
              offering advanced       opportunities for minority students.              
              Impressive mentoring of undergraduate students.  These efforts       give
              students research experience, sustained academic support       and strategies
              leading to successful matriculation and degree       completion in science and
              engineering fields.         Impressive support letters noting his commitment,
              enthusiasm       and untiring efforts to recruit and retain underrepresented   
                 groups in science, engineering and mathematics.
