Abstract    :
              9724994  Patty    Systemic Reform of Mathematics 6-12 for Rural Virginia
              (SRMRV), a five-year project designed to encourage and implement systemic
              change in the high schools and middle schools of five school divisions in rural
              Virginia, is a partnership between Virginia Tech and the public schools of
              Buckingham County, Craig County, Montgomery County, Nottoway County, and
              Roanoke City.  Each of the 174 mathematics teachers in the participating
              schools engages in professional development built around nationally developed,
              cutting-edge, NSF-funded instructional material that is to replace traditional
              textbooks.  The project's major objective is to provide all 174 mathematics
              teachers with the background and resources to achieve whole-school reform in
              mathematics through the implementation of a mathematically integrated,
              problem-solving-based curriculum.       As a Local Systemic Change through
              Teacher Enhancement in Mathematics, Grades 7-12, project, the professional
              development in SRMRV has a focus on strengthening content and renewing
              pedagogy.  Twelve mathematics teachers in one high school, where the teachers
              have already engaged in significant professional development, receive 131 hours
              of enhancement.  Participants who teach both middle and high school mathematics
              receive 268 hours of professional development.  All other middle and high
              school mathematics teachers receive 173 hours.  The teacher enhancement
              curriculum is structured around:  ten-day (two-week) summer workshops;
              academic-year experiences that carry credit as graduate courses; five-day
              (one-week) summer workshops that follow the two-week summer workshops and
              intervening graduate courses; and two-hour, follow-up, academic-year sessions. 
                 The project also incorporates a small research component on the use of
              technology in the classroom.   Quantitative and qualitative methodologies will
              capture the various phases of technology use, addressing such questions as:   
              *   What aspects of technology are important?  *   How does tech nology
              interact with curriculum?  *   How do students use technology?  *   How do
              teachers use technology?       Cost-sharing, which is approximately 158% of the
              NSF-request, is derived from the participating school divisions and Virginia
              Tech.
