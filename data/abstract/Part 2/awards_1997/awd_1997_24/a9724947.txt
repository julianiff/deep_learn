Abstract    :
                  9724947  Tubbesing  As part of a Cooperative Agreement with FEMA, Earthquake
               Engineering Research Institute EERI has undertaken a project to  produce an
              Action Plan that will lay out the necessary steps that  must be taken to
              develop performance-based engineering design  criteria and the tools necessary
              for engineers to communicate  performance concepts to building owners, building
              officials, and  other design professionals.  FEMA intends to use the Action
              Plan  to initiate a Performance-Based Design Program for new and  existing
              construction.  This project will provide funds to  complement FEMA funding to
              support the participation of an  additional steering committee member selected
              from universities  who would represent the engineering research perspective in
              all  activities of the Project Steering Committee, in order to ensure  its
              inclusion in the resulting Action Plan.    This is an interagency collaboration
              in support of the National  Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP)
              activities.  ***
