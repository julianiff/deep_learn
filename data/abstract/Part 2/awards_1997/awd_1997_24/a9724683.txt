Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will   assist the
              Department of Chemistry at West Virginia University acquire an   electron
              paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer. This equipment will   enhance
              research in a number of areas including the following: (1)   characterize the
              electronic structures and spin delocalizations in metal   complexes of unusual
              tetrapyrrole compounds, (2) establish the site of   redox reactions of
              tetrapyrrole metal complexes, (3) paramagnetic   alkyl-nickel and
              hydrido-nickel complexes, and (4) characterization and   investigation of the
              highly electrophilic paramagnetic early transition   metal complexes.    An
              electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer is an instrument   used to
              obtain information about the molecular and electronic structure   of molecules.
              It may also be used to obtain information about the   lifetimes of free
              radicals which are often essential for the initiation   of tumor growth and/or
              a variety of chemical reactions.
