Abstract    :
              9724283  Mutter  This award to Columbia University in the City of New York
              provides funds for acquisition of a new digital multi-channel seismic
              reflection streamer and acquisition electronics for use by academic researchers
              throughout the United States and, collaboratively, around the world.  The
              system will be installed on R/V Maurice Ewing, a research vessel owned by NSF
              and operated by Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.  R/V
              Ewing is operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory
              System.  This award provides state-of-the-art capability for marine geophysical
              research, including 3-D surveying, and extends the existing streamer length by
              50%, allowing higher resolution imaging of ocean crustal structure. The award
              includes support from both Division of Ocean Sciences and the Major Research
              Instrumentation Program, and it includes a substantial cost-share contribution
              from Columbia University.  ***
