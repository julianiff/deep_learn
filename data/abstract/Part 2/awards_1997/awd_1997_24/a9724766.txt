Abstract    :
                9724766  BERELSON    This is a cooperative research project between William 
              Berelson of the University of Southern California and David  T. Heggie of the
              Australian Geological Survey Organisation,  Canberra.  Funds will be used to
              support testing the  components of new benthic chambers developed with research
               funding from the National Science Foundation's Division of  Ocean Sciences
              while conducting research into nutrient  recycling and denitrification in
              Australian bays and  estuaries.  The Australian research projects offer
              tangible  benefit to the U.S. research effort.  For example, they make 
              multiple chambers available to conduct side-by-side  comparisons, and they have
              analytical facilities and  expertise to process many chamber samples.  They
              offer  logistical field support with research vessels and divers,  and they are
              interested in conducting complex and expensive  manipulation experiments such
              as labeled N spike experiments  and N2  measurements.  This will contribute to
              the  development of the best device for use in shallow coastal  Australian and
              U.S. waters.
