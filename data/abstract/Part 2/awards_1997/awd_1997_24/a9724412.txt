Abstract    :
                      This proposal requests funding to upgrade four spectrometers of the 
              shared campus NMR Facility at the University of California, Davis. The 
              upgrades will consist of replacing the console, shims, probes, probe 
              interface, and gradients (when present) of the current spectrometers, 
              retaining only the magnets. The upgraded systems will constitute four 
              state-of-the-art spectrometers for NMR spectroscopy and NMR imaging  (MRI): a
              narrow bore vertical magnet 500 MHz, a wide bore vertical 400  MHz, a wide bore
              vertical 300 MHz, and a horizontal bore (183 mm) 300  MHz. The instruments will
              be used for a wide variety of studies in the  fields of chemistry, biology,
              materials science, and engineering. The NMR  Facility instrumentation is
              utilized annually by over 40 faculty members  from 22 departments of the Davis
              campus with $3,239,000 in annual direct  costs of extramural funding directed
              wholly or in part to NMR research,  including nine NSF grants. This proposal
              describes research plans of 19  of the most intensive Major Users of the
              Facility, documents the  inadequacies of the present equipment, and details the
              benefits the new  instruments will convey. The proposed instrumentation is
              shown herein to  be essential to the Major Users' research plans, and will also
              play a  major role in education and professional training on the Davis campus.
