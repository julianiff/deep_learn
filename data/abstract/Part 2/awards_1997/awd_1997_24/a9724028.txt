Abstract    :
              Cronin  9724028  Color is intimately linked to vision throughout the animal
              kingdom.  Color vision can play key roles in recognition of mates or
              competitors, and in determining effectiveness of camouflage for predators and
              prey.  Visual systems using color have all evolved in the context of the
              properties of the light in natural scenes; these spectral properties define the
              potential limits of biologically useful arrays of color receptors in the eyes
              of animals.  Marine animals sometimes lack color vision, but in the most
              complex forms, some crustaceans have as many as a dozen spectral receptor
              classes, far more than in any known terrestrial animals.  This project analyzes
              the spectral and spatial properties of natural underwater scenes where these
              complex crustaceans live, and the signaling systems that these animals use in
              color-based communication within and between species. The results will help
              answer how the integrated information from their many spectral types of
              receptors enables them to exploit color vision in the sea. This study will
              provide a valuable case of an aquatic invertebrate to compare to terrestrial
              color vision and its evolution in insects, birds and primates.  It is likely to
              have an impact beyond sensory science, on the fields of marine biology,
              evolution and ecology, and on the design of remote sensing devices.
