Abstract    :
               This award is for the purchase of two pieces of equipment that are essential
              for the overall research program in mechanics of materials, particularly on
              high strain rate research.  The first is electrodischarge machining equipment
              that can be used to cut samples of advanced materials to a high degree of
              precision.  The second is an argon ion laser to be used for interferometric
              monitoring of the stress waves induced during plate impact testing.  The new
              equipment significantly strengthens the existing experimental infrastructure
              for research in mechanics of materials and provides new capabilities for
              further research developments.   The new equipment provides new materials
              processing and monitoring capabilities and will have a catalytic effect on the
              existing research program by providing a missing link in a comprehensive effort
              to synthesize advanced materials, characterize their microstructures, measure
              their mechanical response, and analyze the resulting changes in microstructure.
