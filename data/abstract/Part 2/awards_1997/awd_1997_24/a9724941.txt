Abstract    :
              9724941  Lowenthal     In this project, a novel measurement approach will be
              developed with the goal of relating CCN (cloud condensation nuclei) activity,
              particle size distribution, and chemical composition. The objective is to
              determine those physical and chemical properties of aerosol particles that
              determine their ability to act as CCN. CCN measurements will be carried out on
              particles which have been dried and size segregated by two methods: (1) with a
              MOUDI cascade impactor, and (2) electrostatic classification with a DMA
              (differential mobility analyzer). The CCN spectra of the non-size segregated
              aerosol will be measured as well. Detailed chemical composition as a function
              of particle size will be determined from MOUDI cascade impactor samples. The
              detailed ionic, organic, and mineral composition of particles coupled with
              their critical supersaturation spectra will constrain the chemical mixing state
              of the CCN.    Field sampling will be conducted at a coastal site (Point Reyes,
              CA), where the aerosol is mainly marine, and at an inland location (near Reno,
              NV) which is exposed to both clean- and polluted-continental conditions, and
              where the aerosol composition is expected to be more complex, dominated by
              nitrates, sulfates, organic and elemental carbon, and mineral dust.
