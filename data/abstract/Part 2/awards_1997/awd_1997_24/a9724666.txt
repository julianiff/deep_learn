Abstract    :
              9724666  Jen, Erica  Sante Fe Institute    Major Research Instrumentation:  A
              New Computational Infrastructure at the Sante Fe Institute    The Sante Fe
              Institute (SFI) will be acquiring a cluster of multiple processing desktop
              systems together with individual workstations, and a 3D graphics engine
              dedicated to fast graphics and visualization.  The equipment will support a
              research initiative in the simulation of Complex Adaptive Systems.  The focus
              of the initiative will be on the computational, mathematical, physical,
              biological, and social sciences.    Research areas to be supported include
              adaptive computation, simulation of physical processes, simulations of
              biological processes, dynamics of evolutionary and ecological  systems,
              artificial life, and computational economics.    Although SFI is not a
              degree-granted institution, it has demonstrated a commitment to training the
              next generation of scientists.   Each research area described in the proposal
              has senior personnel working together with visitors, postdoctoral fellows and
              students from Universities.  SFI also runs the Complex Systems Summer School
              whose attendees are predominantly graduate students.  For several years SFI has
              offered NSF-funded REU Sites projects.
