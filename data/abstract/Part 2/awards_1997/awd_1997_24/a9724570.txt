Abstract    :
              This grant develops the Platteville Atmospheric Observatory, located in
              Platteville, Colorado.  The observatory currently has VHF, UHF, and boundary
              layer wind profilers for lower atmospheric measurements of winds, waves and
              stability.  The PI plans to establish a medium frequency radar and all-sky
              meteor radar, providing measurements of upper atmosphere winds.  She will also
              upgrade the VHF wind profiler and UHF boundary layer profiler to provide
              greater sensitivity for atmospheric coupling and precipitation studies.  In
              sum, these acquisitions, developments and upgrades will implement research of
              large scale wave motions and their influence on circulation, wave-wave
              interactions, coupling of energy and momentum between regions of the atmosphere
              via gravity waves, boundary layer evolution, and land-atmosphere hydrological
              processes.
