Abstract    :
               Thermal manufacturing processes represent a multi-disciplinary field
              incorporating the application of thermal, fluid, and material sciences, as well
              as systems design and control theory.  Most thermal manufacturing processes
              have the following characteristics in common: high temperature, luminous, and
              thermal distortion.  The extreme luminosity of the heat source in these
              processes often inhibits the thermal or geometrical process parameters from
              being monitored.     This award is to acquire instrumentation for the
              establishment of a Thermal Manufacturing Processes Laboratory to support
              teaching and research activities in the area of machine vision systems for
              welding, rapid prototyping, and feud deposition modeling. The research project
              has a balance between theory and experiment, and will provide valuable
              mechanism to support both teaching and research activities.
