Abstract    :
              9724821  Stahl    This Americas Program award will fund a collaborative 
              research project  between Dr. Philip Stahl, Washington  University, St. Louis, 
              Missouri, and Dr. Marisa Colombo,  Institute for Histology and Embryology
              (IHEM), Mendoza,  Argentina. They will conduct experiments, using in vitro and 
              in vivo approaches,  to determine the possible involvement  of key proteins in
              controlling phagocytosis, the process by  which cells internalize large
              particles.  These particles,  often including live microorganisms, are
              sequestered within  membrane-bound compartments called phagosomes.  The focus
              of  the proposal is to develop an understanding of the mechanism  of
              phagosome-endosome fusion and phagosome maturation..  In  vitro reconstitution
              assays will be used to dissect the  molecular mechanisms that regulate membrane
              fusion and  transport.  This technology, developed in the PI laboratory  in
              Washington University, is being further developed and  refined by the
              Argentinean collaborator in Mendoza    This is an important area of  basic
              research that could  elucidate the fundamental molecular mechanisms during 
              phagocytosis  necessary for the future development of anti-  infective
              strategies.  ***
