Abstract    :
              Most of our insight into the energetics of terrestrial locomotion is derived
              from studies of metabolic expenditure of animals running under steady-state
              (constant speed, long duration) conditions.  Non-sustainable locomotion of high
              intensity but short duration, of the type seen during prey capture, territorial
              defense, or predation avoidance represents behavior at least as important as
              long duration sustained locomotion, and is a type of activity with different
              metabolic underpinnings.  This research will examine the energetics of this
              type of activity.  The PI will investigate four aspects of non-sustainable
              locomotion:  1) the effects of duration, 2) the effects of different locomotor
              intensities, 3) the differential responses of an endotherm vs. an ectotherm to
              brief exercise, and 4) the role of hormones in defining this locomotor cost. 
              The study addresses a realm of animal activity for which we have no predictive
              database.  The preliminary data suggest that the net cost of non-sustainable
              locomotion may be an order of magnitude more expensive than when animals cover
              the same distance at aerobically sustainable speeds.  If supported by the
              proposed research, this finding will raise fundamental questions about the
              consequences of some types of animal behavior, and open a new chapter in the
              study of animal locomotion.
