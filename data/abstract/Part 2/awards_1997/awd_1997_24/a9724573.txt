Abstract    :
              An MRI award will support the acquisition of low-vacuum  scanning electron
              microscope wit EDS capabilities for a  multidisciplinary microscopy service
              facility. This facility  is the sole provider of scanning electron microscopy 
              services to the entire Syracuse academic community. The  microscope will
              replace an outdated piece of equipment.  Research projects which will benefit
              from access to the  instrument encompass the disciplines of chemistry, 
              engineering, and biology. They come from three different  institutions. With
              respect to chemistry, the proposed  projects involve polymer membranes and the
              analysis of  atmospheric and water-borne lead particles. With respect to 
              engineering, the projects involve the mechanical behavior of  wood,
              characterization of recycled fibers, strength  properties of individual fibers,
              and fiber-to-fiber bonds in  paper. With respect to biology, the projects
              involve the  cochlea and the vestibular sensory epithelia of the auditory 
              system, mechanisms of wood decay, decay identification and  prevention, and
              fungal morphology. The instrument will also  be used in training of students
              from a number of departments  and institutions.
