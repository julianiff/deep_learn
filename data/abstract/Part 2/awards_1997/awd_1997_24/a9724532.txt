Abstract    :
              9724532  Kellar    Atomic force/scanning tunneling (AFM/STM) and interfacial 
              force (IFM) microscopes will be acquired by the South Dakota  School of Mines
              and Technology (SDSMT).  The instruments  will support research in the areas of
              composite materials,  corrosion/leaching, super critical fluids and solid 
              mechanics.  The IFM purchase and usage will be implemented  through a
              collaboration with Sandia National Laboratory.  The instrumentation will be
              used by faculty and students  that form a "Surface and Interfacial Chemistry"
              cluster  within the state of South Dakota- and NSF-supported  Experimental
              Program to Stimulate Competitive Research  (EPSCoR) at SDSMT. The microscopes
              will also be used as  training tools in the undergraduate curriculum, both
              through  undergraduate research activities and through formal  laboratory
              courses.  %%%  Acquisition of this instrumentation will have a strong  positive
              impact on SDSMT's research and education goals.  This award is supported by the
              Major Research  Instrumentation (MRI) program and by the Experimental  Program
              to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).  ***
