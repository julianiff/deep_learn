Abstract    :
              9724810  Nelson  This award to Bermuda Biological Station for Research will
              provide instrumentation for research into ultraviolet radiation in marine and
              terrestrial environments of Bermuda and the Sargasso Sea.  Proposed use of this
              land- and underwater-based UV monitoring instrumentation includes study of
              impact of ultraviolet radiation at several wavelengths on marine bacteria,
              phytoplankton and coral reefs.  ***
