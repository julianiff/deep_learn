Abstract    :
               9724915   Levine    This award supports a research planning visit in
              preparation  for long-term collaborative anthropological field research  in
              Qinghai Province, China.  The goals of the planning visit  are to identify
              three communities for future study and to  refine research hypotheses related
              to the integration of  nomadic pastoralists into China's economy and to the 
              processes of economic differentiation and the ways in which  households adapt
              to periods of economic variability.
