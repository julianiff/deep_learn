Abstract    :
              9724535  Schultz    A scanning plasmon resonant probe microscope will be
              developed at  the University of California-San Diego.  The microscope utilizes 
              individual, sub-micron metal particles that exhibit well-defined  plasmon
              resonance (PR) scattering of light as probes or scanning  tip element.  The PR
              particles act as "point source" (about 50  nanometers in size) optical
              transducers that feature enhanced  local electric fields.  In the near-field
              configuration,  instrument design goals include down to 10 nanometer resolution
               for the scanning microscope working in either of three  spectroscopic modes:
              surface enhanced Raman, surface enhanced  fluorescence and two-photon
              excitations (fluorescence or Raman).  State-of-the-art experimental techniques
              involved include  nanolithographic preparation of metal particles,
              nanofabrication  of ultrathin SiN window substrates, and design and
              construction  of a 1 nanometer-precision, 100 micron-scanning range, ultra- 
              stable scanning stage.  %%%  The development program involves the participation
              of graduate  and undergraduate students, and post-doctoral associates in the 
              design, construction and testing of advanced instrumentation.  Applications of
              the microscope in the material and biological  sciences include sub-wavelength
              resolution of Raman signals from  wear-track residues in magnetic disk drives
              and motor protein  motion.  ***
