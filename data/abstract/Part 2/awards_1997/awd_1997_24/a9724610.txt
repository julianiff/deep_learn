Abstract    :
              The PIs plan to develop a novel research instrument designed for the
              interdisciplinary research of future connections with I/O counts higher than
              5,000 per chip and placement precision better than 1 micron.  All the assembly
              processes will be performed by the institute thus controlling cleanliness,
              temperature pressure, chemical compositions, surface, reactions,
              solidification, contact  formation, and thermomechanical  forces.  Successive 
              assembly steps are grouped into separate chambers that are clustered  together
              into one instrument.  Transfers between steps are also done under controlled
              conditions  The instrument will be placed into the Advanced Facility for
              electronic Packaging (AFEP) at Cornell University for shared use.  The proposed
              Instrument opens a new frontier for integrated interconnect  research  and
              education for the next 15 years.  This instrument will help explore fundamental
              materials, interfaces, contact  physics, interconnect structures, fabrication
              process, manufacturing, assembly, and reliability  issues in future high
              density, and high precision  interconnect packages.
