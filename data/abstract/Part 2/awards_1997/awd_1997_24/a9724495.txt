Abstract    :
              9724495  Goldberg, Mark  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute    Acquisition of
              Instrumentation to Facilitate Large Scale Parallel Computation    Rensselaer
              Polytechnic Institute (RPI) will be acquiring three four-processor
              shared-memory computers.  The equipment will be used to support research in
              parallel adaptive computation, silicon simulation, software tools development
              for parallel scientific computation, generic software libraries for parallel
              computation, learning algorithms for combinatorial optimization, and query
              optimization in heterogeneous mediated systems.  RPI will also be developing a
              library of programming tools for handling distributed computing on a cluster of
              high-power shared memory workstations and will make this software freely
              available to the scientific community and accessible through the World Wide
              Web.    The equipment will also be used in undergraduate courses in
              computational science and engineering, in particular a studio course in
              algorithm design and a second course in the design and implementation of
              generic software.  Both of these courses provide hands-on experience for
              students and will thus allow direct involvement with the new equipment.
