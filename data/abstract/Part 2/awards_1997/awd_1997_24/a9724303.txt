Abstract    :
              9724303  Landman    A parallel processing computer system will be acquired by
              the  Georgia Institute of Technology.  The computer system will  support
              research in modeling and simulation of physical and  chemical processes in
              complex materials systems, including  tribology, elastohydrodynamics,
              lubrication, chemical dynamics,  clusters and nanostructured materials.  The
              computer system will  be part of the Computational Materials Science Center at
              Georgia  Tech, where it will be available to students as part of formal 
              courses that incorporate a "hands-on" experience in computational  activities. 
              The Center also organizes a seminar series and an  annual workshop where topics
              pertaining to the use of computers  in solving challenging scientific problems
              are discussed.  %%%  The investigations proposed address fundamental issues
              which are  often of relevance for the development of new technologies.  The 
              complex nature of the phenomena investigated requires large-scale  simulations
              and calculations, involving a large number of degrees  of freedom and prolonged
              time scales in order to model reliably  the systems being studied.  The
              parallel computer system will  enhance current capabilities at Georgia Tech and
              open new, and  otherwise inaccessible, avenues of research.  ***
