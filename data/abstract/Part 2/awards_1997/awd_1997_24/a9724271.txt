Abstract    :
              9724271  Geist, Robert  Dawson, Darren  Clemson University    Acquisition of a
              Silicon Graphics Workstation for Modeling, Simulation, and Virtualization of
              Physical Phenomena    Clemson University is acquiring a graphics supercomputer
              to support modeling, visualization and simulation of physical phenomena
              research conducted by the departments of computer science, electrical and
              computer engineering, and mechanical engineering.  Specific research projects
              include materials research, wireless communications, mechatronics and design,
              visualization and geometric computation.    The supercomputer facilities will
              be available to both undergraduate and graduate students pursuing research in
              all of the areas described above.  Clemson University also has plans to
              distribute information on research results regionally via a Web site, VHS video
              and a Supercomputer information brochure.
