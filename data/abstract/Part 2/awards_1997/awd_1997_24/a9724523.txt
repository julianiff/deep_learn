Abstract    :
              9724523  Ray  The purpose of this proposal is to request funds for the 
              acquistion of a modern technical compute server and cluster  of workstations to
              extend capabilities in Computer-Aided  Engineering and simulation-based design
              research within The  Center for Computer-Aided Design at The University of
              Iowa.  It includes a 12-processor parallel technical compute server  to serve
              as the Center's primary resource for  computationally intensive applications. 
              In addition to the  compute server three graphics visualization workstations 
              will provide an interface to the compute server and provide  pre- and
              post-processing capabilities.  Obtaining high-  performance computional
              facilities is critical to  maintaining an expanding the Center's activities in
              finite  elements analysis, nonlinear explicit finite element  analysis, 
              optimization, multibody  dynamics, and  meshless  methods.  ***
