Abstract    :
              A scanning probe microscope will be acquired and of competency  with the
              instrument will be developed. The microscope will be  shared between the
              various departments in the school of  Engineering at The University of
              Mississippi, as well as being  available to other departments outside of the
              School of  Engineering. The School will maintain graduate student support  for
              the instrument to assure continuing proficiency with the  instrument, thus
              minimizing the learning curve as various  departments utilize the instrument
              for their projects. The  School will also provide the on-going maintenance cost
              of the  instrument. The microscope will have a significant impact upon  the
              research of each department in the School of Engineering at  The University of
              Mississippi. The microscope will enable the  various research groups to delve
              deeper into existing projects  as well as opening doors to a wealth of new
              research areas.  Some of the current projects that would be impacted include; 
              improvement of fiber-reinforced composite manufacturing;  analysis of nitrogen
              oxide catalyst surfaces; examining the  nature of surface-engineered
              reinforcing-fillers; water and  C12/C14 adsorption onto mineral surfaces
              involved in mineral  dating and well purging; and determination of the efficacy
              of  new techniques in integrated chip development and  manufacturing.
