Abstract    :
              Kay    9724120    Circadian clocks are known to regulate many essential cellular
              processes in all organisms so far examined. In higher plants most major
              metabolic pathways are subject to circadian regulation, as well as
              developmental events such as the photoperiodic control of flowering. However,
              the molecular components of these biological clocks remain unknown. Using
              Arabidopsis thaliana as a model plant and the luciferase gene fusion  and
              bioluminescence imaging system developed in this laboratory, work will be
              continued on the identification and characterization of the DNA-protein
              interactions involved in regulated chlorophyll A binding protein (CAB2) gene
              transcription, the genetic analysis of the interactions between circadian and
              phototransduction pathways and genome-wide identification of clock-controlled
              genes in Arabidopsis.    The long term goal is to further our understanding of
              how circadian clocks are built in eukaryotic cells. Although they are known to
              regulate many essential cellular processes in all organisms thus far analyzed,
              the molecular components of these biological clocks remain unknown. Using
              Arabidopsis as a model plant, genetic and molecular approaches  will be used to
              enhance our knowledge of the mechanistic basis of the regulated response of
              gene expression to circadian rhythm.
