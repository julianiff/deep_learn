Abstract    :
              9724823  Grossman    This Americas Program award will support a cooperative 
              research project on the modeling and solution of nonlinear  optimization
              problems that involve discrete and continuous  variables.  Collaborators are
              Dr. Ignacio Grossman, Carnegie  Mellon University, and Dr. Jaime Cerda,
              Universidad Nacional  de Litoral, Argentina.  The major goal of the project is
              to  investigate a new modeling and solution approach that is  based on the idea
              of representing these optimization  problems through the use of logic
              propositions and  disjunctions involving Boolean and continuous variables.  The
              specific objectives include theoretical characterization  of these problems,
              development of algorithms for  disjunctions with multiple terms, implementation
              in the  software package LOGMIP, and numerical testing as well as  comparison
              with algebraic mixed-integer.    The project should yield new and powerful
              tools for non-  linear discrete optimization, and advance the state of the  art
              in non-linear modeling and optimization methodologies  for Process Systems
              Engineering.  It will benefit the  technical process industry of both the US
              and Argentina.  ***
