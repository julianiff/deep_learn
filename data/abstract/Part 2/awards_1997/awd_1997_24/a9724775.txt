Abstract    :
              INT 9724775  Berry      This is a cooperative research project between Prof.
              James  Berry, Department of Biological Sciences, State University  of New York
              at Buffalo, and Dr. William C. Taylor, Division  of Plant Industry, CSIRO,
              Canberra, Australia.  Also  included in the project is Ms. Amy C. Corey,
              graduate  student working with Professor Berry. The senior  investigators share
              complementary knowledge and research  experience in different C4 plants.  The
              unique  photosynthetic qualities of C4 plants make them an important  object of
              study.  The investigators will analyze amaranath  transcriptional and
              post-transcription reporter gene  constructs in transgenic Flaveria bidentis, a
              transformable  C4 transformation system.  This will provide new information 
              about processes which regulate cell type-specific and light  mediated gene
              expression, and aid in the further development  of amaranth for agriculture and
              industry.
