              Title: Video Documentary Describing the Tropical Ocean Global  Atmosphere
              (TOGA) Program    NSF, NOAA, NASA and ONR supported the climate project called 
              Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere (TOGA).  It was conducted from  1985-1995.  It
              was highly successful in its efforts to explore the  theoretical and practical
              predictability of seasonal to interannual  variations of the El Nino-Southern
              Oscillation.    NOAA's Office of Global Programs is producing an outreach- 
              educational film about TOGA.  This grant, combined with funds from  NASA, ONR
              and NOAA support that effort.
