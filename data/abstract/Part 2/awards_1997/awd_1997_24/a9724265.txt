Abstract    :
              ***  9724265  Murnane  The Center for Ultrafast Optical Science at the
              University  of Michigan will develop a new state-of-the-art high power  short
              pulse (femtosecond) laser, in cooperation with  industrial partners.  The
              development of this new laser will  follow from recent advances made at CUOS in
              ultrafast  intense pulse generation.  The facility will be used by  scientists
              both from within and outside of the University of  Michigan in such diverse
              fields as electrical engineering,  physics, chemistry, materials science, and
              radiology.  This action is supported by the NSF  Major Research Instrumentation
               Program.  ***
