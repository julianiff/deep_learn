Abstract    :
              9724312  Kawalec  The Ohio College of Podiatric Medicine is a non-Ph.D. 
              granting institution and one of only seven podiatric  colleges in the nation. 
              This small proposal requests $36,  050 to purchase an MTS Model 858 Low Force
              biomechanical  test system which measures the mechanical and fatigue 
              properties of various materials.  One area where the  equipment will be used is
              in testing pyrolytic carbon as a  material for replacement of the small joints
              in the foot.  In one study, atomic oxygen will be used to produce a porous 
              surface on the carbon which should increase the strength of  the graft-bone
              interface.  Another research area is the  determination of the pull-out
              strengths of various suture  anchors.  These anchors are used to reattach
              tendons and  ligaments to bone.  ***
