Abstract    :
                  9724126  Chappell  Plant isoprenoids comprise a structurally diverse group
              of compounds that can be divided into classes of primary and secondary
              metabolites.  Isoprenoids that are primary metabolites include sterols,
              carotenoids and growth hormones, secondary metabolites include monoterpenes,
              sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes, compounds that are important mediators of
              plant-environment interactions.  The work will continue
              biochemical/physiological studies of the secondary metabolites in tissue
              culture.  The focus will be on the regulation and activity of two enzymes in
              the pathway, squalene synthase and sesquiterpene cyclase which are located at
              branchpoints at which the biochemical pathways diverge leading to different
              compounds.  The analysis also includes analysis of the genes and transcripts
              for these enzymes.
