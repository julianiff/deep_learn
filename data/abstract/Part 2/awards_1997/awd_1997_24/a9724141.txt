Abstract    :
              This project focuses on understanding how peptides in the central nervous system
              regulate various physiological functions.  In particular, the PI is interested
              in a peptide that inhibits heart rate.  This peptide is referred to as DMS or
              dromyosuppressin.  The DMS peptide is encoded by the dromyosuppressin gene.    
               DMS inhibits heart rate in a dose dependent manner when introduced into the
              animal.  The PI is conducting research in an animal amenable to genetic
              analysis and proposes to generate mutations in the gene that encodes DMS to
              better understand the role of the peptide in animal physiology.  After
              obtaining these mutations, the PI will use molecular and physiological
              techniques to determine when the peptide is expressed and how altering the
              presence of DMS might affect the animal.  Because this peptide is conserved in
              structure and function, our work will have broad application to other
              organisms.
