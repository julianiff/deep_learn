Abstract    :
                                        Abstract           This proposal describes the types
              of plant biology  research and range of reach-in and walk in controlled 
              environment chamber capabilities that are required in the  three complexes on
              the Purdue Agriculture campus.  The  proposal further describes how unique
              environmental  capabilities of the new equipment in the three clusters will  be
              networked, managed, and made available to funded programs  in a truly
              multi-user instrumentations system.
