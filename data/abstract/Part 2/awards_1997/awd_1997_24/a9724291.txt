Abstract    :
              9724291  DiSalvo    An electron microprobe system will be acquired by Cornell 
              University.  The instrument will perform elemental analysis  on the micron
              length scale for research programs in the  Applied Physics, Chemistry, Geology,
              Materials Science and  Engineering, and Physics departments at Cornell.  The 
              instrument will be part of an Electron and Optical  Microscope facility that is
              managed by the Cornell Materials  Science Center, where it will be accessible
              to all on-campus  researchers and to researchers and students from local 
              colleges.  The microprobe will also be part of several  courses in various
              departments that include its utilization  for the study of materials.  %%%  The
              instrument will impact a large number of  interdisciplinary research programs
              and the education and  research training activities of undergraduate and
              graduate  students.  *  *  *
