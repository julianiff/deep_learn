Abstract    :
              9724792  Buttry    This U.S.-Brazil award will support a research collaboration 
              between Dr. Daniel Buttry of the University of Wyoming to  work with Professors
              Roberto M. Torresi and Susana Cordoba  Torresi at the University of Sao Paulo. 
              Their collaboration  is on enhanced power density in polymeric, thin film
              battery  materials.    These two research labs want to work together to define 
              materials and conditions that make the  most of charging and  discharging rates
               of lithium-based batteries.  Specifically  they are looking at the mechanism
              of the polyaniline (PAn)  catalyzed oxidized 2,5-dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole
              (DMcT)  redox process.  This is a thin-film mixture that has been  shown to
              have extremely high energy density under certain  conditions that are relevant
              to use as a cathode material in  a lithium battery.  This research is important
              not only for  industry, which has an increasing need for portable power 
              sources, but also for the projected need for society's  conversion to electric
              vehicles.    The University of Wyoming lab specializes in electrochemical 
              quartz crystal microbalance methodology, in  spectroelectrochemical (EQCM)
              methods of analyzing thin  films and in the complex chemistry  of the Pan/DMcT
              system.  The University of Sao Paulo lab possesses skill in the  synthesis of
              new conducting polymer derivatives and in using  the EQCM in conjunction with
              other measurement methods.  The  expertise brought by each side is unique and
              essential to  the project.  ***
