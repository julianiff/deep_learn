Abstract    :
              Long  9724999  This Small Grant for Exploratory Research is based on the
              discovery that the filamentous fungus, Pestalotiopsis microspora, has a unique
              ability to convert non-replicating transforming DNA into self-replicating
              plasmids.  This is in stark contrast, in terms of both efficiency and
              mechanism, to essentially all other filamentous fungi which replicate
              transforming DNA through chromosomal integration.  Two aspects of  P.
              microspora transformation, high efficiency and generation of self-replicating
              plasmids, could, if applicable to other filamentous fungi, have substantial
              impact on the growing field of molecular genetic engineering of this important
              class of organisms.  This research develops methods for amplification of  P.
              microspora plasmids, structural and functional characterization of these
              plasmids, and experiments to test their ability to replicate in other
              filamentous fungi.
