Abstract    :
                    9724948  Wang  In this project, research is conducted toward development
              of a  method of direct stress measurement based on the measurement of 
              magnetization characteristics of ferro-magnetic structural  materials.    It
              has been shown that the magnetization characteristics of  ferro-magnetic
              materials are related to the stress level, and a  number of successful
              magneto-elastic sensors have been designed  by researchers around the world. 
              Most of these sensors are  cylindrical in design and are primarily designed for
              measuring  force and stress in cylindrical specimens.  This is sometimes  seen
              as a severe deficiency, since the bast majority of  structural elements in a
              typical structure are planar (girders  and beams, plates and decks) and the
              specimen under investigation  cannot be enclosed within the sensor.    A novel
              planar sensor design will be achieved using the concept  of magnetic reluctance
              measurement for stress analysis.  The  sensor design philosophy emphasizes the
              ability to make stress  measurements in the post yield region of the structure.
               The  research consists of the following tasks:         1) design of sensors
              that can operate in the postyeild        zone, 2) development of a residual
              stress sensor capable of          detecting yielding, 3) development of a
              surface mountable        planar sensor design in contrast to a cylindrical
              design,       and 4) development of a suitable constitutive model for         
              determination of permeability-stress relationships for           sensor design
              and calibration.    The proposed sensor is flexible and can be utilized for a
              variety  of structural monitoring schemes, force measurement of inplanar  and
              circular cross-sections, monitoring of prestress loss in  bridge girders, and
              postearthquake evaluation of structural  members.    ***
