Abstract    :
              Karr    9724473    This proposal describes a shared confocal microscopy 
              facility at the University of Chicago that will open new  lines of research for
              a broad range of scientists.  To meet  the immediate and anticipated demands of
              the user base, the  proposed facility will include two stand-alone systems, a 
              Zeiss LSM confocal systems have complementary strengths, but  both are capable
              of producing high-resolution confocal  images and are suitable for either fixed
              or living  specimens.  Visualization of datasets will be accomplished  using
              Macintosh PowerPC and Silicon Graphics computers and  associated software for
              image analysis and display.  Because  biological imaging and visualization is
              still very much a  "hands on" enterprise and remains for the most part quite 
              technical, the proposed facility is designed to provide a  "user friendly"
              environment to made the technology  accessible to individual investigators,
              their trainees and  students.  To this end, the facility will be a staffed by
              an  FTE whose mission will be to train and assist researchers  who wish to
              utilize the capabilities of these powerful  machines.
