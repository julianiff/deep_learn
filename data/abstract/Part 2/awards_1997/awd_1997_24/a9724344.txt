Abstract    :
                                                   The aim of this proposal is to acquire
              state-of-the-art  instrumentation that will form  the foundation for a
              Molecular Analysis Center at the University of  Houston. The requested
              BIAcoreTM 2000 will advance studies  addressing DNA replication, learning and
              memory, circadian rhythms,  antibody/antigen recognition, enzyme structure and
              mechanism,  enzyme design, control of RNA stability, assembly and maintenance 
              of nerve myelin, DNA structure, and biotechnology, by facilitating  the
              identification and/or quantification of the diverse  biomolecular interactions
              occurring during these processes.
