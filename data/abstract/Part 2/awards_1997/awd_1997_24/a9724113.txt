Abstract    :
              9724113  Bush  Biosynthetic enrichment with stable isotopes, 13C and 15N, will
              be employed in an NMR and molecular modeling study of the conformation and
              dynamics of a series of complex polysaccharides and oligosaccharides.  Data on
              a collection of closely related structures will be analyzed to determine the
              influence of specific structural features, such as branching and substituent
              positions, on the conformation and dynamics of complex polysaccharides.  The
              strategy of enrichment of the samples with stable isotopes will confer unique
              advantages to this research project, making it possible to measure accurate
              values of 3JCH, 3 JCC, 2JCC, and 3JHH by 3-dimensional heteronuclear NMR
              methods such as HMQC-NOESY, HCCH TOCSY and quantitative coherence transfer. 
              Long range coupling constants will serve as a direct measure of the dihedral
              angle of the glycosidic linkage.  Molecular modeling, including molecular
              dynamics simulation, will be used to interpret the experimental NOE and
              coupling constant data.  Enrichment in stable isotopes will make it possible to
              study the conformation and dynamics of the oligosaccharides bound to lectins by
              using NMR spectroscopy with isotope filters.    The research will provide a
              significant improvement in the understanding of conformation and dynamics of
              complex oligosaccharides and their interaction with specific binding proteins
              such as lectins, glycosidases and glycosyl transferases.  An improved
              understanding of oligosaccharide conformation and dynamics will be valuable in
              the biotechnology of polysaccharides, which are widely used as food additives,
              as well as for other applications in materials science.  ***
