Abstract    :
                  Biologists at the City College of New York are requesting matching  funds to
              purchase a             transmission electron microscope (TEM). The new TEM will
              replace a  Phillips 300 purchase 26 years ago.    The research aided by the new
              equipment is quite broad in aspect, covering fields such as  Neurobiology,
              Molecular Developmental Genetics, Immunobiology,  Protistology, Molecular
              Systematics, Endocytobiology, and Evolution.  More specifically the following
              projects will be aided: 1) Phagosome-  phagolysosomal processing in
              diatom-bearing endosymbioses in  foraminifera;  2)   Karyokinesis and
              systematics of foraminifera; 3) Molecular    systematics of planktonic diatoms;
               4) Cell surface phenotypes of thymic nurse cells; 5) Contact between 
              thymocytes and thymic nurse cells; 6) Molecular and genetic analysis  of the
              Drosophila compound eye; 7) Molecular mechanisms underlying  axonal development
              and connection specificity in the embryonic and  metamorphosing nervous system
              of the frog Xenopus laevis; and 8)  Studies of growth factors and
              neurotransmitters involved in the  signal cascade by means of which the retina
              modulates growth of the  sclera which, when awry, can lead to myopia.
