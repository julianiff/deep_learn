Abstract    :
                  This is a request for a cognitive neuroscience research  facility comprised
              of a topographic EEG/EP mapper that would  permit our faculty to engage in
              state of the art research in  cognitive neuroscience.  The essence of this
              proposal is  that measurement of electrophysiology provides an avenue for 
              performing basic research on the question of how the brain  processes
              information.  In addition, a computer workstation  is requested to permit
              faculty and students to engage in the  off-line analysis and editing of the
              data which will result  from faculty-student collaborative research.  As our
              faculty  are already heavily engaged in research with undergraduates  that
              leads to co-authored presentations and publications and  our majors are
              required to generate their own in their  senior year, this instrumentation will
              be heavily used.
