Abstract    :
              Dr. Warner received his PH.D. in Analytical Chemistry from the  University of
              Washington in 1977.  At present he is chair of the  Chemistry Department at
              Louisiana State University.  According to  the documentation, he has been  an
              exemplary role model for both  students and peers.    This is supported by the
              fact that he was  nominated by colleagues in the chemistry department from
              another  institution.  Highlights of Dr. Warner s accomplishments in  mentoring
              include:         A thorough understanding of the steps needed to keep      
              disenfranchised students involved in science, leading them to       successful
              careers.          Impressive letters from students concerning his mentoring    
                activities.         Impressive research credentials as a scientist.        
              Innovative efforts to encourage minorities in the pursuit of       scientific
              degrees and careers.         Has received numerous awards for excellence in
              teaching and       engineering.
