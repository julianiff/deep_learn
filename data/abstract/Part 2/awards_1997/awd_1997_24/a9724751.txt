Abstract    :
              9724751  Wilkes    This award supports a 6 month National Science Foundation 
              Dissertation Enhancement Award for Dr. R. J. Wilkes at the  Super-Kamiokande
              Neutrino Observatory, Mozumi, Japan,  operated by the Institute for Cosmic Ray
              Research (ICRR),  Tokyo, Japan.  Dr. Wilkes's student, Mr. Ross Doyle, will 
              work with Professor Yoji Totsuka, Director of ICRR, on a  research project
              entitled "Atmospheric Neutrino Observations  with Super-Kamiokande".   
              Evidence from experiments conducted over the last two  decades consistently
              suggests there is a discrepancy between  the number of electron neutrinos
              observed coming from the  sun and the number that might be expected. 
              Experiments such  as Homestake, SAGE, Kamiokande II, and GALLEX have all 
              reported fewer electron neutrinos than standard models  predict.  Because no
              solar models have yet been developed  that are adequately able to both predict
              the observed level  of neutrinos and yet account for all the other observed 
              features of the sun, the possibility of neutrino  oscillations has been invoked
              as an explanation for the  measured deficit of one species.  The proposed
              research is  designed to determine whether these neutrino oscillations 
              actually occur and, if so, measure the solar electron  neutrino flux with
              greater accuracy than has been  accomplished previously.  ***
