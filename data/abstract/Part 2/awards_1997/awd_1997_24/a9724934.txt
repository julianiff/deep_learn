Abstract    :
                                      ABSTRACT       The proposal seeks funding to co-sponsor
              a one-day workshop on "Thermophysical Phenomena in Microscale Sensors, Devices,
              and Structures."  The workshop will be held on Saturday, August 9, 1997 in
              Baltimore, Maryland.  The workshop is scheduled a day before the beginning of
              the 1997 ASME National Heat Transfer Conference, which will also be held in
              Baltimore.  The workshop will provide a cross-disciplinary forum for
              presentation of new ideas and results, and assess the status of the field and
              identify future research needs.  Funds requested include travel support for
              participants who would normally not attend the National Heat Transfer
              Conference.
