Abstract    :
              INT 97-24747  Aratyn        This U.S.-Bulgarian cooperative research project is
              on "Integrable Systems and Applications to Quantum Physics."  The principal
              investigators are Dr. Henrik Aratyn of the University of Illinois at  Chicago
              and Drs. Svetlana Pacheva and Emil Nissimov of the Institute of Nuclear
              Research and Nuclear Energy of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.  The
              researchers propose to focus on four main topics: 1) the relation of reduced KP
              integrable systems and the theory of affine Kac-Moody symmetry; 2)
              discrete-difference analogues of the classical integrable systems; 3) the
              relations of continuum and discrete integrable systems and quantum integrable
              models; and 4) some interesting physical application of their results.  The
              research topics are some of the most central in mathematical physics in the
              past twenty years and are still actively developing.  The work is significant
              for new instights into physically relevant field-theoretic models ranging from
              completely integrable systems in nonlinear soliton physics and planar
              statistical mechanics to string and membrane theories.  It will represent an
              advance in the development of consistent systematic methods for understanding
              links between continuous and discrete integrable models.     This project in
              physics research fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading
              experts in the U.S. and Bulgaria to combine complementary efforts and
              capabilties in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of
              equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
