Abstract    :
              9724000  McCarty      This proposal continues our investigation of the molecular
              mechanisms that underlie VP1 mediated gene activation and repression. The VP1
              factor of maize plays a central role in integration of the maturation and
              germination pathways in the developing seed.  The VP1/AB13 family of regulatory
              proteins is unique to the plant kingdom.  Recent studies indicate that related
              proteins function in other phases of plant development.  Dr. McCarty has shown
              that VP1 functions as an activator or repressor depending upon the target
              promoter and he has recently been able to demonstrate a cooperative sequence
              specific DNA binding activity.  He will address three key issues:    1)  The
              unique properties and regulation of the B3 DNA binding domain of VP1.      2) 
              The mechanism by which  promoter context is interpreted to determine whether
              VP1 activates or represses transcription.    3)  The identification of partner
              proteins that provide the context information and mediate repression.
