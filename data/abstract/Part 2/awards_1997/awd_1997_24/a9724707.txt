Abstract    :
                   The objective of the proposed research is to adapt  embedding methods for
              modeling nonlinear time-series  developed by the academic community for their
              routine use in  engineering problems.  The specific methods to be employed  are
              based of those developed to model chaotic nonlinear  systems.  These methods
              will be adapted so that they can  handle nonlinear systems describing
              input/output data from  industrial devices under test.  Specifically, current 
              modeling methods developed for automonous systems will be  extended to handle
              systems driven by mixed signals.  Input/output systems are fundamental to
              engineering and  industrial applications.  Currently, the majority of 
              input/output modeling techniques are designed for linear  systems and provide
              the basis for a wide range of test  equipment (spectrum, signal, and network
              analyzers) and an  engineering methodology at the heart of our modern 
              technology based society.  However, industrial systems and  devices typically
              exhibit nonlinear behavior when stressed,  and industry has a continual need
              for methods that work when  devices are pushed beyond their original design
              envelope.  Therefore, the proposed research will address the generic 
              industrial needs for improved modeling and diagnostics of  nonlinear devices
              based on the latest research from  nonlinear dynamics, dynamical systems
              theory, and nonlinear  time-series analysis.
