Abstract    :
              9724198  Stebbins    This award provides partial (58%) funding for the
              acquisition of a  nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer that will be 
              installed and operated in the Department of Chemical Engineering at  Stanford
              University. Stanford University is committed to providing  the remaining funds
              necessary for the acquisition of the  instrument.     The NMR technique is
              uniquely capable of yielding data on the  local, molecular scale structure of
              material surfaces and amorphous  solids and liquids. The  principal
              investigator, colleagues, and  graduate students at Stanford will use the new
              NMR spectrometer in  a wide variety of research projects including
              investigations of the  structure and dynamics of silicate and other oxide melts
              and  glasses, the study of surface and interface properties of ceramic 
              materials, catalysts, electronic materials, biomolecules, and  organic
              polymers. This award is funded by NSF's Major  Instrumentation Program and by
              the Office of Multidisciplinary  Activities.  ***
