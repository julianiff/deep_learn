Abstract    :
              9724282  Murray    This grant, made through the Major Research Instrumentation
              (MRI)  Program, provides $100,000 as partial support of the costs of  acquiring
              an inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer  (ICP-ES) for rapid
              analyses of major and trace element  concentrations in a variety of sample
              matrices including natural  waters, sediments, rocks and biological tissues. 
              Specific  studies that will take advantage of the analytic capabilities of 
              this new instrument include utilize major element and trace  element analyses
              of seawater and sediment samples to make  inferences about past conditions in
              the oceans (i.e. primary  productivity, preservation of biogenic minerals,
              eolian particle  flux to the seafloor etc.), studies of the geochemistry of 
              volcanic ashes recovered in Antarctica for use in provenance,  chronologic
              correlation and tectonic history studies of the  Transantarctic Mountains,
              petrologic studies of batholith  granites in the Sierra Nevada extensional
              region to elucidate  possible mantle involvement in their formation, studies of
              the  major and trace element compositions of high strain schists and  gneisses
              to understand diffusional mass transfer during  metamorphism and ecotoxologic
              studies of heavy metals in  freshwater alga tissues and their possible effects
              on  photosynthesis. This instrument will complement the analytical 
              capabilities of several ICP-MS instruments recently acquired at  several
              institutions within this region (i.e. Harvard, MIT, WHOI,  URI and Brown), thus
              making the BU ICP-ES a truly regional  facility for major and trace element
              geochemistry.  ***
