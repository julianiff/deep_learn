Abstract    :
              9724904  Gallant    Under this U.S.-Australia cooperative research award, Dr. 
              Esther Gallant, Department of Veterinary Biology, University  of Minnesota, and
              Dr. Angela F. Dulhunty, John Curtin School  of Medical Research, Australian
              National University,  Canberra, will join forces to study the regulation of the
               ryanodine receptor in skeletal muscle excitation-  contraction. Skeletal
              muscle excitation-contraction coupling  involves the interaction of two calcium
              channel proteins,  the dihydropyridine receptor and the ryanodine-receptor. A 
              short dihydropyradine peptide sequence is required for in  vivo
              excitation-contraction coupling and can substitute for  the dihydropyridine in
              ryanodine-receptor activation. The  investigators will record currents through
              ryanodine-  receptor channels inserted in artificial lipid bilayer  membranes
              to determine 1) concentrations of coproteins and  ligands necessary for optimal
              ryanodine-receptor function,  and 2) ryanodine-receptor activation by
              dihydropyridine  receptor peptides under these optimal conditions. The U.S. 
              and Australian investigators are experts in the area of  excitation-contraction
              coupling in muscle.  Both will  approach the study from different perspectives:
               Prof.  Gallant has focused at the cellular and tissue level; while  Prof.
              Dulhunty has experience with the single-channel,  artificial bilayer technique.
               Prof. Gallant will employ the  new knowledge gained in Australia to develop a
              similar  apparatus in Minnesota.  In addition, this project will  provide an
              opportunity for Dr. Gallant's graduate student to  participate in research in
              Australia.
