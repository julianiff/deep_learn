Abstract    :
              INT 9724168  de Lanerolle      This U.S.-Czech research project between Primal
              de Lanerolle of the University of Illinois, Chicago, and Pavel Hozak of the
              Institute of Experimental Medicine, Prague, will attempt to identify a
              non-filamentous motor protein, myosin I, by cloning and sequencing the cDNA for
              it.  Their intent is to initiate the process of defining the physiological
              functions of this protein by using immunogold electron microscopy to identify
              the structures it associates with in the nucleus.  Results of the sequencing
              will be compared to published sequences for members of the myosin superfamily
              to determine whether the 120 kDa protein is myosin I, some other unconventional
              myosin, or a totally new actin, ATP and calmodulin binding ATPase in the
              nucleus.    Central to the effort is an antibody to myosin I, which the U.S.
              and Czech researchers have produced and affinity purified from bovine adrenal
              glands.  This antibody inhibits the actin-activated ATPase activity of purified
              adrenal myosin I but not that of purified adrenal myosin II.  These antibodies
              recognize a 120 kDa protein that is larger than the antigen (16 kDa) in the
              cytoplasm and in the nucleus.  Comparative studies using different antibodies
              to myosin I suggest that these antibodies recognize a unique, previously
              undescribed myosin I isoform that is an intranuclear actin-based molecular
              motor.  If successful, this research effort to unequivocally identify the 120
              kDa protein could make fundamental contributions to our understanding of the
              cellular functions of myosin and the biology of the cell nucleus.    This
              project in cellular organization fulfills the program objective of advancing
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and
              Central Europe to combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas of
              strong mutual interest and competence.    ??
