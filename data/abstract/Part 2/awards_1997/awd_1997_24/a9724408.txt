Abstract    :
                         The purpose of this grant is to acquire a high-resolution field-     
               emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) with backscattered-      
              electron-detection capability. We are requesting the Hitachi S-       4500-II,
              which produces high-resolution images at both low and       high accelerating
              voltages, accommodates a range of sample sizes,       and has an excellent
              service and reliability record. Other       equipment items essential for
              obtaining or processing high-       resolution images are also requested,
              including a critical-point       dryer, a thin-film sputter coater, and a
              high-resolution printer.       The applicants are a group of investigators at
              Johns Hopkins       University Medical School who need the 10- to 20-fold
              improved       resolution offered by FESEM over standard scanning electron     
               microscopes. The microscope will be housed in the Johns Hopkins      
              Microscopy Center, a facility that offers ready access to optical       and
              electron microscopes to both the Hopkins community and the       wider
              scientific community in Baltimore.
