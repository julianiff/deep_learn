Abstract    :
                     Development of a Single Molecule Laser Optical              
              Trap/Fluorescence Detection System           This proposal describes the
              development of a state-of-  the-art instrument that has the capacity to measure
               molecular forces and the ability to detect the emission of  light from single
              fluorescent molecule.  The instrument is a  microscope that contains a laser
              optical trap and a ultra-  sensitive, low light detection system.  This novel 
              instrument is intended to serve both the research needs for  a significant
              number of investigators at the University of  Vermont and as a unique teaching
              tool to introduce  undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students to 
              molecular biophysics.
