              URL:HTTP://ncmi.bioch.bcm.tmc.edu  at Baylor College of  Medicine (BCM)
              requests partial funding to acquire a 300 keV  electron microscope equipped
              with a field emission gun and a  liquid helium specimen stage.  NCMI is a
              national resource  center supported by the National Center for Research 
              Resources of NIH.  Its mission is to develop electron  imaging of
              macromolecular assemblies near atomic resolution.  We also conduct methodology
              development, collaboration,  service, technology dissemination and training. 
              The  improved imaging capability will be used in all these  components of the
              NCMI research mission.
