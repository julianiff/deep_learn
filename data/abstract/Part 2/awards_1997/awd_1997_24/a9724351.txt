Abstract    :
              ***  9724351  Saulnier  This award provides funding to establish a research 
              infrastructure that will enable faculty and students at a  liberal arts college
              to undertake a multifaceted project  consisting of three categories of
              scattering experiments  interwoven with computational simulation.  These
              include  development of a low-coherence heterodyning technique to  image
              structures imbedded in a highly scattering medium, a  new time-resolved photon
              and phonon correlation  spectroscopic technique, and pulse transmission
              time-of-  flight measurements to be employed as part of the first two 
              experiments.  Results of the efforts are potentially of  practical use in the
              development of a medical diagnostic and  in geological remote sensing.  This
              action is partly  supported by the NSF Major Research Instrumentation Program 
              and partly by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary  Activities.  ***
