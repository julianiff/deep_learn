Abstract    :
              9724625  Goodenough    An optical float zone, image furnace will be acquired by
              the  University of Texas at Austin for the growth of complex  refractory oxide
              and manganese oxide crystals.  The furnace will  be part of a facility under
              the oversight of a Materials  Institute that the University is in the process
              of establishing.  It will be used to grow materials where narrow-band phenomena
              are  present, including high temperature copper oxide superconductors  and
              manganese oxides exhibiting "colossal" magnetoresistance.  %%%  The equipment
              will support research in a  highly topical field  with significant momentum. 
              It will also enable continued  emphasis and training in bulk crystal growth
              techniques.  ***
