              This award provides renewed support of the National Drosophila Species Resource
              Center (NDSRC), a collection of 250 species of the fruit fly Drosophila. The
              collection, which began operation at the University of Texas (Austin) over 50
              years ago, includes over 1405 living strains that are used for basic studies in
              genetics, developmental and population biology, ecology and evolution. The
              number of species in the collection has increased by about 10% since 1990. Each
              year, the NDSRC provides approximately 1000 samples of its collection to
              scientists throughout the world at modest charge. Operation of the collection
              is guided by the principal investigator, Dr. Jong S. Yoon, and an extemal
              advisory committee first established by the American Society of Naturalists in
              1975.\par \pard  \par  \ql \fi4680 ~31,,@=.n.{\'ae}u.n.\par \pard  \sect \pard
