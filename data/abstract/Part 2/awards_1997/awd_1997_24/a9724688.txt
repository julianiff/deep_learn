Abstract    :
              9724688  Hanley    Under this collaborative research award, Dr. Luke Hanley of 
              the Department of Chemistry, University of Illinois-Chicago,  will cooperate
              with Dr. Besim Ben-Nissan of the Department  of Materials Science, University
              of Technology, Sydney,  Australia  to develop, analyze, and test new bioceramic
               orthopedic implant materials through the application of  advanced methods of
              surface analysis and biomaterials  engineering.  Two types of implant materials
              will be  studied: 1) coralline implants made from coral samples from  the Great
              Barrier Reef and 2) hydroxyapatite coated implants  which have been treated
              with bone cell growth factors.
