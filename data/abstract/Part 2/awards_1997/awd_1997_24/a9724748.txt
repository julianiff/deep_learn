Abstract    :
              9724748  Fraumeni    This three-year award supports US-UK cooperative research
              in  education economics between Barbara Fraumeni at Northeastern  University
              and Nicholas Oulton at the National Institute of  Economic and Social Research
              in London.  The objective of  their project is to generate improved measures of
              investment  in education and human capital in the United Kingdom from  the
              1950s up to the present.  The US and UK investigators  will apply a methodology
              for valuing investment in education  developed by Dr. Fraumeni and her research
              partner Dale  Jorgenson of Harvard University.  The estimates of education 
              output and investment in the UK will then be compared to  estimates for the US
              and Sweden and used to determine the  efficiency of the education sector and
              the impact of  investment in human capital to economic growth.    The US
              investigator brings to this collaboration expertise  on the theoretical
              approach and knowledge of the US and  Swedish systems.  This is complemented by
              the British  investigators' expertise on the UK economy and education  system
              and their access to education data in the UK.  ***
