Abstract    :
              9724553  Schwarz    A time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometer (TOF-SIMS)
              will  be acquired by Queens College.  The instrument will be a  component of
              the Center for Polymers at Engineered Interfaces, a  Materials Research Science
              and Engineering Center encompassing  several institutions in the New York City
              area.  The TOF-SIMS  will be used for studying polymer film phenomena,
              including depth  composition profiles, dewetting and spinodal decomposition of 
              tailored surfaces.  It will also be a part of the Center's  undergraduate
              research and high school outreach programs.  %%%  The instrument will
              significantly enhance the Center's research  capabilities and its education
              programs.  ***
