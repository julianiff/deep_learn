Abstract    :
              This project develops new laser instrumentation, and is supported jointly by
              Atmospheric Sciences and Materials Science Research as part of the Major
              Research Instrumentation Program.  Researchers are designing and building a
              multi-functional suite of nanosecond pulse-length optical parametric
              oscillators (OPOs) in collaboration with industrial partners.  All participants
              have extensive experience in the application and construction of
              state-of-the-art light sources.  The instruments will be shared among the group
              of university researchers for in situ studies of atmospheric radicals and
              greenhouse active gases, laboratory studies of critical atmospheric reactions, 
              optical and infrared diagnostics of chemical vapor deposition, and
              characterization of solid earth minerals under extreme conditions.  By
              developing the new laser systems, these investigators will enhance existing
              NSF-sponsored research, and explore and develop new interdisciplinary
              activities.  The new laser instrumentation will transfer several of the
              proposers' recent inventions to the private sector through the participation of
              the industrial partners (i.e., Coherent, Spectra Physics, and Casix, Inc.). 
              Licensing of both existing designs and newly developed instruments emerging
              from this partnership assists the rapid transfer of new laser technology to
              broader-based science and engineering.  Finally, the project will enable
              graduate and undergraduate participation in several OPO instrument development
              subtasks, and further involve the students in novel applications to atmospheric
              science, cluster chemistry, thin film deposition, and solid earth materials.
