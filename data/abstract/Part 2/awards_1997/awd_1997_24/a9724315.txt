Abstract    :
              Abstract- Miller  CTS-9724315    An X-ray microscale computed tomography system
              is acquired. This will be used for research in advanced materials processing,
              failure analysis of advanced materials, multiphase particulate technology,
              microelectromechanical systems, fault mechanics and fluid transport, bone
              architecture and multilayered ceramic composites.
