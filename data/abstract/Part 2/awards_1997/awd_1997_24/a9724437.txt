Abstract    :
              This three-year project is designed to improve the computational  facilities at
              the Institute for Scientific Computation (ISC), an  interdisciplinary research
              unit housed within the Department of  Mathematics at the University of Wyoming.
               ISC supports a variety  of mathematicians, scientists, and engineers whose
              research  involves mathematical modeling, scientific computation, and 
              scientific visualization.  Though certainly not a complete list,  several
              examples of specific research foci of investigators using  ISC resources are
              the following:  .     Migration and growth of  biofilms in porous media;  . 
              Scale-up of stochastic,  heterogeneous medium properties;  .New finite-element
              techniques  for flow and transport problems with reactions, 
              heterogeneity,sharp fronts;  .     Domain decomposition and  multilevel schemes
              for flow problems with highly variable  coefficients;
