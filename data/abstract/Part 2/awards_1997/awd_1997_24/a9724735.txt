Abstract    :
              9724735  Nielsen    This Americas Program award will fund a short-term planning 
              visit to Chile for Ms. Karina Nielsen,  currently completing  work on her
              doctoral dissertation at Oregon State  University.  The purpose of the visit is
              to prepare a  proposal on the relationship between oceanographic  conditions
              and intertidal community structure and dynamics  along the central Chilean
              coast, to be submitted to the  International Post-doctoral Fellowships Program.
               The  specific goals include visiting and identifying appropriate  field sites,
              selecting species for experimental  manipulations, determinations of specific
              methods and  collection of preliminary data on community structure at  field
              locations.  This preliminary work will be conducted in  collaboration with Dr.
              Sergio Navarrete, Pontificia  Universidad Catolica de Chile.  ***
