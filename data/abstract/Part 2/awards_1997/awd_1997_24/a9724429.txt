Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will   assist the
              Department of Chemistry at Eastern Michigan University to   acquire a
              multi-angle laser light scattering spectrometer. This equipment   will enhance
              research in a number of areas including the following: (1)   determination of
              accurate molecular weight of novel polybenzotriazoles,   (2) study of the laser
              photothermal surface lensing effect, (3) studying   the photogenerated thiols
              for epoxy curing, (4) metal-catalyzed thermal   decomposition of synthetic
              lubricants, and (5) probe of the changes in   the molecular shape of proteins
              and RNA of known molecular weight.   A laser can provide important information
              about chemical reactivity. Its   use may enable breakthroughs in  our
              understanding of the properties of   reactivity and non-reactivity of
              molecules..
