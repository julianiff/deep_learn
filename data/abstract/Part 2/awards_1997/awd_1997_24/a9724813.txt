Abstract    :
              9724813  Van Stryland    This U.S.-Mexico award will support Prof. Eric Van
              Stryland  of the University of Central Florida in a research  collaboration
              with Prof. Mehrdad Mohebi of the Applied  Physics Division of CICESE (Center
              for Scientific Research  of Ensenada) in Ensenada, Mexico.  The researchers
              intend to  enhance the sensitivity of current laser methods for  measuring both
              the non-linear refraction and absorption  coefficients of materials.  This will
              allow them to greatly  expand the number of materials that can be studied for
              non-  linear all-optical switching applications and, specifically,  develop a
              computer controlled, fully automated improved scan  techniques for routine
              measurement of optical properties of  materials.    The research will combine
              the CICESE Center's expertise in  modeling propagation of laser beams in
              non-linear materials  with experimental resources in Florida.  The results from
               this research will have immediate applicability to the study  of organic
              materials useful in the development of ultra-fast  switching applications.  ***
