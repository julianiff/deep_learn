Abstract    :
              The rapidly unfolding story of the nuclear receptor superfamily has radically
              changed the understanding of hormone action.  One of the subgroups of that
              superfamily appears to have evolved at least 500 million years ago prior to the
              divergence of arthropod and chordate lineages.  This subgroup of receptors
              plays an important role in the control of the complicated events of development
              and growth.  Because of their early divergence, the mechanisms that involve
              these receptors appear to be very similar in the invertebrates as well as the
              vertebrates.    There have been several international symposia (including both
              EMBO and Keystone symposia) that address the "form and function" or "the
              superfamily of nuclear receptors" in general, but until now there has been no
              systematic attempt to compare the similarities or differences of the
              form/function of nuclear receptors across phylogenetic lines.  The symposium
              proposed here will bring together researchers working on these receptors and
              their ligands in a variety of vertebrates and invertebrates.  Through this
              proposed symposium, the PI hopes to foster a broader discussion of the
              comparative structures of venous receptors, of the degree of
              post-transcriptional processing of gene products, and of the wide array of
              developmental and growth-related events that are controlled by this family of
              transcription factors.
