Abstract    :
                    9724980  Ide     This award provides partial support for the conduct of a
              symposium on the subject of "General Circulation Model Development" which will
              be held at the University of California - Los Angeles campus, 20-22 January
              1998.  The symposium is in honor of Dr. Akio Arakawa, one of the pioneers and
              continuing leaders in the field of general circulation model (GCM) development.
               The invited papers will be published in a book which will serve as a valuable
              reference on the history and state-of-the-art of GCMs.  International
              participation will be strong and partial support is being provided by the World
              Climate Research Program, the Japanese Meteorological Agency, and several U.S.
              federal agencies.
