Abstract    :
              A new source of polarized light ions, including protons and  deuterons, will be
              produced for use with the Indiana  University Cyclotron Facility (IUCF).  IUCF
              is a national  user facility for nuclear physics, with particular emphasis  on
              studies of the meson exchange character of the nucleon-  nucleon force.  IUCF
              serves a user community numbering in  the hundreds.  The new source will
              increase the intensity of  polarized beams available using the IUCF Cooler ring
               accelerator (a 500 MeV synchrotron) twenty-fold, opening up  new and more
              stringent tests of our understanding of the  nucleon-nucleon potential.  The
              IUCF research program also  includes tests of theories of the strong
              interaction  relating to synthesis of the structure and dynamics of  complex
              nuclei from the fundamental nucleon-nucleon  potential.  These topics are of
              high priority within U.S.  nuclear science, as established by the joint NSF/DOE
              Nuclear  Science Advisory Committee in its 1996 Long Range Plan.  Education of
              students and postdocs is a strong component of  the IUCF experimental program.
