Abstract    :
              9724305  Drucker    Imaging instrumentation consisting of a laser scanning
              confocal  microscope and an atomic force microscope will be acquired by the 
              University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP).  These instruments will  support
              research in several areas of environmental, material and  life sciences,
              including biological systems, optical display and  photovoltaic materials, and
              nanomaterials.  This instrumentation  will also be a resource for both graduate
              and undergraduate  education and research training.  The instruments will be 
              integrated into graduate training programs targeted at imaging  and image
              interpretation, and into out-of-classroom research  experiences for
              undergraduate students.  %%%  Acquisition of this instrumentation will impact
              research,  research training and education in several programs which UTEP  has
              identified as current and future strategic thrust areas.  The  instrumentation
              will enhance UTEP's capability for meeting its  goal of integrating research
              into the undergraduate curriculum  and of increasing retention and graduation
              of Hispanics, a group  underrepresented as scientists and engineers.  The award
              is  funded by NSF's Major Research Instrumentation program and by the  Office
              of Multidisciplinary Activities.  ***
