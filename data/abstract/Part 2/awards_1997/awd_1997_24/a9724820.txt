Abstract    :
              9724820  Baragiola    This Americas Program award will fund a collaborative 
              research project between Dr. Raul Baragiola, University of  Virginia, and Dr.
              Edith Goldberg, Instituto de Desarrollo  Tecnologico para la Industria Quimica
              (INTEC), Argentina.  They will investigate fundamental processes in insulating 
              thin films and at metal surfaces resulting from high energy  excitations by UV
              photons, ions or electrons. The main  questions to be addressed are how
              electrostatic charges are  developed under irradiation, and how the resulting
              electric  fields affect the relaxation of the electronic energy into  light,
              damage, and the emission of atomic particles.  The  problem of how the
              interface between the insulator and a  metal electrode neutralizes holes and
              relaxes energy will  also be studied.    These are fundamental problems central
              to a number of  disciplines, including industrial applications of insulators 
              (electrical, electronic and xerography industries),  atmospheric physics
              (electrical charging), and in biology  (radiation damage to cells).  The 
              complementary expertise  of both research groups will  allow a range of
              experimental  and theoretical approaches to the project that will prove 
              beneficial to both countries.  ***
