Meyerovich

This three-year award will support collaborative research
              between Alexander Meyerovich of the University of Rhode Island and Professors
              Giorgio Frossati and Reijer Jochemsen at Rijks University in Leiden, The
              Netherlands.  The proposed research on spin-polarized quantum systems requires
              close cooperation between experimental and theoretical groups and will deal
              with thermodynamic and transport properties of macroscopic quantum systems. 
              

The US PI brings to the collaboration extensive experience in the theory of
              spin-polarized quantum systems, while the Dutch counterparts represent one of
              the world's leading experimental groups in this field.  The collaboration is
              expected to help fill the gap in the theory of spin-polarized Fermi systems,
              contribute to the theory of anamalous spin dynamics near the instability
              points, and develop a new theory of transport to understand boundary slip and
              slip effects in classical systems with large free paths.
