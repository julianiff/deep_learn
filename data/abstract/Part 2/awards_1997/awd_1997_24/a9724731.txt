Abstract    :
              9724731  Meyerowitz    This U.S-Mexico award will support Dr. Elliot Meyerowitz
              of  the California Institute  of Technology in collaboration with Dr. Elena
              Alvarez Buylla  of the Instituto de  Ecologia of the Universidad Nacional
              Autonoma de Mexico  (UNAM).  The  researchers intend to study the molecular
              basis and  evolution of the plant,  Lacandonia schismatica.  Lacandonia is a
              unique endemic  plant from Chiapas,  Mexico, whose flower is the only known
              example of a  functional spatial inversion  of the reproductive whorls, that
              is, stamens in the central  whorl and carpels in the  third one.  Dr.
              Meyerowitz has been a leader in developing  models for the  molecular
              mechanisms of flower development, models which  have been  corroborated by
              studies in other flowering plants, including  Arabidopsis.  The  researchers
              now plan to establish the phylogenetic  relationships by using rDNA  sequences
              as sources of characters, to clone and  structurally characterize the  genes
              similar to the ABC genes of Arabidopsis and to test in  other ways the 
              similarity or differences in the genetic control of flower  development in the
              two  genera of plants.    Because of its functional uniqueness, Lacandonia
              provides  the necessary exception  to the pattern of flowers in angiosperms for
              a rigorous  testing of molecular models.  The two laboratories have
              complementary skills: the U.S. lab  provides the expertise  in molecular
              technology, while the Mexican lab brings to the  collaboration its  expertise
              in phylogenetic and population biology.  ***
