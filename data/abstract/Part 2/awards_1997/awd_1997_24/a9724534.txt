Abstract    :
               This project aims to develop an advanced five-axis high speed milling machine
              and test stands.  This equipment will be used for research and testing of the
              five-axis high speed milling technology currently under investigation.  This
              technology is of interest to forging die, stamping die, and injection mold
              making and other industries, particularly those in the aircraft manufacturing
              businesses.  It is also useful to many fields for rapid prototyping of parts. 
              An emphasis of the equipment development will be the longevity of the drive and
              guideway components subjected to frequent accelerations and decelerations which
              are much higher than in the current practice.   The development will employ the
              latest numerical control and servo control techniques.  The development of the
              five-axis high speed machine tool utilizes and integrates leading-edge
              technologies on feed drives, guideways, and spindles.  The equipment is
              valuable for research on high-speed machining of various materials and
              geometries and on development of open-architecture controllers.  The project is
              done in collaboration with several industrial companies.
