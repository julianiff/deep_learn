Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Major  Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will   assist the
              Department of Chemistry at Bowdoin College to acquire a 400   MHz nuclear
              magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. This equipment will   enhance research
              in a number of areas which include enantioselective   catalysis, b-amino acid
              synthesis, organometallic synthesis, organic   photochemistry, and oxidative
              phosphorylation.  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
              powerful tool   available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
              molecules.   It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific  
              arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of  
              interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art   NMR
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier   research.
              The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such   as polymers,
              catalysis, and in biology.
