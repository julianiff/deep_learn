Abstract    :
              9724383  Butman  This award to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in
              Massachusetts provides funds for construction of a new seawater flume system
              and related instrumentation. The new instrumentation is expected to contribute
              substantially to research in fluid dynamics, marine biology of larval
              settlement, marine sediment dispersal research, and related geological and
              ecological studies.  This award is jointly supported by the Major Research
              Instrumentation Program and the Instrumentation Program of the Division of
              Ocean Sciences.  Substantial cost-share is offered by Woods Hole Oceanographic
              Institution towards this project.  ***
