Abstract    :
              IBN-9724062  PI:  Herness  Taste buds in the mouth of mammals each contain
              around 50 taste receptor cells.  When they respond to certain tastes, their
              signal is transmitted to nerve fibers that carry taste information to the
              brain.  Information about taste is processed not only within each individual
              cell, but there is likely to be processing within the taste bud itself if
              activity in a given receptor cell is modulated by activity of its neighbors. 
              For example, an important molecule in the digestive system is the gut peptide
              cholecystokinin (CCK), and recently it also has been found localized in taste
              cells, and it affects their membrane channels that carry ionic currents during
              cellular stimulation.  CCK has important physiological effects on secretion and
              neurotransmission in the brain as well as in the gut.  This project uses
              immunocytochemistry and cellular electrophysiology to determine the
              localization, regulation, and possible physiological role of CCK in taste
              cells, to see how it might have a role in modulating peripheral information
              processing in taste.     Results of this work will be important beyond simply
              understanding cellular mechanisms in the taste bud, because the potential
              impact extends to studies of human nutrition and to studies on the modulatory
              effects of CCK in other sites in the nervous system.
