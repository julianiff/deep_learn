This one-year award will support participation of eleven US
              researchers in a symposium to be held in Sintra, Portugal, June 1-4.  The US
              organizer is Gloria Ferreira of the University of South Florida.  The
              Portuguese organizers are Jose J.G. Moura and Ricardo Franco of the University
              of Lisbon.  The symposium will be supported on the European side by the
              Luso-American Foundation. The goal of the symposium is to bring together
              scientists from differing disciplines, and different countries within Western
              Europe, who are working on structural, functional, and molecular regulatory
              mechanisms of iron metabolism.  The symposium is an opportunity to develop
              international approaches to problems of the rapidly developing field of
              inorganic biochemistry.
