Abstract    :
              9724492  Simpson         This award provides partial funding (70%) for the
              acquisition  of a mass storage system to be installed and operated in the Data 
              Management Center (DMC) of the Incorporated Research Institutions  for
              Seismology (IRIS). The IRIS consortium is committed to  providing the remaining
              funds necessary for the acquisition of the  mass storage system.     IRIS is a
              consortium of 87 U.S. research universities with major  programs in seismology.
              The IRIS DMC is responsible for the  collection, quality control, and
              distribution of data collected by  a globally distributed network of
              permanently installed  seismographs and by a pool of portable seismographs
              deployed for  shorter periods of time to solve specific regional problems in 
              geophysics. The DMC services a very substantial fraction of the  world-wide
              community in seismology in its need for access to  reliable data to be applied
              to research in earthquakes and the  dynamics and structure of the Earth's deep
              interior. In addition,  the DMC also acts as a collection center for data
              collected under  the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) monitoring activity.
              The  data storage needs of the DMC are very large. Current storage is 
              approaching the 3 terabyte range, and there is an urgent need to  replace the
              current obsolete system with a new storage system.  ***
