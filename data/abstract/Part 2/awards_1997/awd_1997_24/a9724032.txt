Abstract    :
              9724032  Weiss  For genes which exhibit strict tissue specific expression or are
              expressed only upon induction, the contribution by negative regulatory elements
              is particularly important.  The objective of this research is to define the
              nuclear factors which interact with the negative regulatory element NEG-1 of
              the Interleukin-4 (IL-4) gene.  IL-4 is produced only by mast cells and certain
              T cell subsets, and then only upon induction.  Messenger RNA levels for IL-4
              increase rapidly after induction and then decrease once the inducing stimulus
              is removed.  This observation coupled with other data indicates that IL-4
              production is under transcriptional control.  Previous studies have
              demonstrated that there are several DNA regulatory elements within the 5'
              flanking region of this gene and that specific nuclear factors interact with
              these sequences to regulate the inducible transcription of IL-4.  The recently
              defined DNA element NEG-1, (-326 to -302 relative to the transcription
              initiation start site) contributes to the down regulation of this gene. 
              Preliminary results indicate that two sub-sequences (A and B) within NEG-1
              interact co-operatively and that NEG-1 A forms a specific complex with mast
              cell nuclear factor(s) found in both unstimulated and stimulated cells.  This
              research identify the nuclear factor(s) in direct contact with the A region of
              NEG-1, and will use heparin-sepharose and DNA affinity chromatography to purify
              enough factor to obtain sequence information.  A cDNA library will be
              constructed and screened with degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to the
              sequence information obtained.  Positive clones will be subcloned, sequenced,
              and expressed; their NEG-1 A binding ability will be confirmed by EMSA.  %%% 
              For genes which exhibit strict tissue specific expression or are expressed only
              upon induction, the contribution by negative regulatory elements is
              particularly important.  Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is produced only by mast cells
              and certain T cell subsets, and then only upon  induction.  The objective of
              this research is to define the nuclear factors which interact with the negative
              regulatory element NEG-1 of the IL-4 gene.  ***
