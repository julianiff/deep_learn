Abstract    :
              9724240  Davis    Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) equipment will be acquired by
               the California Institute of Technology.  The equipment includes  200 MHz, 300
              MHz, and 400 MHz NMR spectrometers.  The instruments  will support research
              projects in materials chemistry and  materials physics, including synthetic and
              catalytic studies of  molecular sieves, order and dynamics in polymers, and the
               development of high sensitivity NMR methods.  %%%  The instrumentation will be
              part of a unique multi-user, solid  state NMR facility, accessible to users
              within the Los Angeles  basin.  Students will be trained in the technique and
              in the use  of the instruments, both through individual sessions and through  a
              formal course.  ***
