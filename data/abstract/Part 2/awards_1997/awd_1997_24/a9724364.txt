Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Major  Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will   assist the
              Department of Chemistry at Harvey Mudd College to acquire a   300 MHz nuclear
              magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. This equipment   will enhance research
              in a number of areas including the following: (1)   kinetics and thermodynamics
              of monolayer self-assembly, (2)   stereoselective Claisen rearrangements
              involving ketals of heterocyclic   ketones, (3) intermolecular interactions,
              and (4)  studies of reactive   intermediates.  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy is the most powerful tool   available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules.   It is used to identify unknown
              substances, characterize specific   arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
              to study the dynamics of   interactions between molecules in solution. Access
              to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are
              carrying out frontier   research. The results from these NMR studies are useful
              in the areas such   as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
