Abstract    :
              PI:  Denver, R.  IBN-9724080   Normal development of the vertebrate brain
              requires thyroid hormone (TH).  Insufficient amounts of hormone during fetal
              life results in severe defects in neural development (e.g., cretinism in
              humans).   On a global scale, congenital hypothyroidism is one of the most
              pervasive and detrimental human health problems, resulting in entire
              populations of mentally impaired ad physically stunted individuals in certain
              areas of the world.  In addition to hypothyroidism caused by iodine deficiency,
              recent reports of disruptive effects on the thyroid axis of various
              industrially-produced compounds suggest the possibility for profound negative
              effects of environmental pollutants on developmental processes of humans and
              wildlife.  The proposed research aims to understand the molecular basis of TH
              action on the development of the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS). 
              Tadpoles of the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis will be used to study
              TH-induced neural development and to clone TH-target genes in the CNS.  This
              model in invaluable for understanding post-embryonic brain development since it
              affords easy access to all stages of development, and the basic
              neurodevelopmental processes are similar in frogs and other vertebrate animals
              including humans.  The primary objectives are to: 1) understand how TH
              receptors transduce the hormonal signal to the cell nucleus resulting in
              changes in gene expression, and , 2) understand the structure and function of
              TH target genes in the CNS.
