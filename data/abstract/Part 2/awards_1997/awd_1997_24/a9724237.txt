Abstract    :
              9724237  Wilhelms, Jane  University of California, Santa Cruz    Acquisition of
              a UCSC Scientific Visualization Laboratory    The University of California,
              Sanat Cruz (UCSC) will be acquiring a high-speed multi-processor graphics
              system with associated large disk array, video equipment for high-quality
              illustration, and a virtual workbench for large stereo display to support
              research in astronomy, biology, chemistry, computer science and engineering,
              earth science, ocean science, physics, and science communication.  This
              facility will support the development of new scientific visualization
              techniques to speed up visualization, to analyze validity and usefulness of
              final images, to compare formally alternative visualization methods, to
              represent data uncertainty, and to explore physically justified
              data-interpolation methods.  Collaborative and remote visualization systems
              will be developed, along with appropriate user interfaces.    The equipment
              will be available to graduate students and undergraduate students working on
              research in computer science and the natural sciences.  An existing teaching
              laboratory will be connected to the scientific visualization laboratory for
              classes and laboratories.  USCS has experience in outreach to the larger public
              audience through film and TV documentaries using computer visualizations of
              simulations and data.  The scientific visualization equipment will enhance
              these existing efforts.
