Abstract    :
              9724189  Hilton    This grant, made through the Major Research Instrumentation
              (MRI)  Program, provides $277,718 as partial support of the costs of  acquiring
              a rare gas mass spectrometer equipped with UV and IR  laser probes, in-house
              manufacture of the associated gas extraction  lines and half-time support for a
              lab technician for the noble gas  isotope geochemistry laboratory at Scripps
              Institution of  Oceanography.  Establishment of this state-of-the-art facility
              will  allow high spatial resolution micro-sampling of geologic materials  and
              subsequent high sensitivity analyses of rate gas isotopic  compositions in
              order to resolve such issues as crustal versus  mantle contributions to hotspot
              and arc volcanics, production rates  of cosmogenic nuclides (i.e. 21Ne) in
              subaerial rocks for use in  exposure-age dating and studies of the Earth's
              ancient atmosphere  based on analyses of the 20Ne/22Ne ratio of gases that may
              be  preserved in mineral fluid inclusions in Proterozoic rocks.  ***
