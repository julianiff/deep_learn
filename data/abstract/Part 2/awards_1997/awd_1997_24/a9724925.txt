Abstract    :
              INT 9724925  Weerts      This U.S.-Czech research project between Hendrik Weerts
              of Michigan State University and Vladislav Simak of the Institute of Physics,
              Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, will feature joint efforts to
              understand the fundamental structure of matter using proton and antiproton
              colliding beams at the Tevtron accelerator, Fermi National Accelerator
              Laboratory (Fermilab).  In addition to optimization of neutron shielding, this
              cooperative work will feature upgrades of the central tracking detectors and
              muon detectors.    Czech production of components for a high voltage
              distribution system for the muon detector and their contributions to analysis
              of the multijet interactions and triple boson vertex should substantially
              strengthen the total "D 0" effort at Fermilab.  Overall, results are expected
              to contribute to the infrastructure for understanding the fundamental dynamics
              of electroweak interactions in elementary particle physics.    This U.S.-Czech
              cooperation fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
              enabling experts in the United States  and Central Europe to combine
              complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual
              interest and competence.   ??
