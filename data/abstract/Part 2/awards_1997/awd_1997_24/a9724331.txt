Abstract    :
              9724331  Archer  This proposal requests $120,123 to purchase a micro laser 
              Raman spectropotometer for polymer and biomedical research  applications, and
              for classroom instruction.  Five research  projects will utilize the equipment.
               These projects include  the monitoring of small molecule transport on polymer 
              surfaces, the stability of polymeric matrix composites, the  interaction of
              B-amyloid peptides with cell membranes, and  for tissue characterization.  The
              equipment will also be  used in a newly developed course on biomedical optics.
