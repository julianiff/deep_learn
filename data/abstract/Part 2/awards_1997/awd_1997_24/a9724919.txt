Abstract    :
                9724919  DiTullio        The Subantarctic Zone of the Southern Ocean plays a
              critical  role in both past and present global climate change, and is 
              therefore of considerable interest to the international  science community.
              This proposal seeks funds to support a  unique collaboration with Australian
              marine scientists to  investigate biogeochemical cycling in this oceanic
              region.  The prinicipal investigator, Professor Giacomo Di Tullio, of  the
              Department of Geology, University of Charleston, and his  counterpart, Dr.
              Peter N. Sedwick, of the Cooperative  Research Center for the Antarctic and
              Southern Ocean  Environment, University of Tasmania, will conduct and 
              interdisciplinary study of the physiological status and  response of the whole
              microbial community to growth  limitation by iron and major nutrients.
              Experiments will  examine the possibility that iron may control Si:N 
              utilization ratios by the biotas (including implications for  species
              dominance), heterotrophic/autotrophic competition  for iron, and iron and major
              nutrient effects on production  of the radiatively important gas
              dimethylsulfide (DMS) and  its precursor DMSP. The field program and research
              cruise on  the Australian vessel RSV Aurora Australis will involve  Australian,
              New Zealand, and French researchers as well as  the American researchers
              supported under this project.  Results will contribute to our understanding of
              factors  affecting global carbon cycling, and will further the  exchange of
              ideas and encourage cooperation between the  marine science communities of the
              United States, New  Zealand, France, and Australia.
