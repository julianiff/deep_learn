Abstract    :
              9724497  Lewis  New developments in telecommunications systems, wireless
              networks, flexible manufacturing systems, etc. place severe demands on the
              design of decision-making supervisory controllers.  On the other hand, new
              developments in advanced machinery, manufacturing tooling, lightweight and
              mobile robots, etc. place high demands on the design of real-time device-level
              motion controllers.  The objective of this project is to design a controller
              with both multi-agent decision-making and machine-level motion control
              functions.  To achieve this objective, new pieces of equipment are required for
              the development of an intelligent material handling cell (for multi-agent
              supervisory control), the development of a real-time control system (for
              machine-level control), and the development of a FMS/Machine Tool Controller
              (including both supervisory and real-time motion control functions).  The
              equipment is essential for the development of a new class of controllers which
              have both multi-agent decision-making and machine-level motion control
              functions.  The project benefits from the collaborative relationship of the
              investigators with companies such as Simis Labs and Caterpiller Inc.
