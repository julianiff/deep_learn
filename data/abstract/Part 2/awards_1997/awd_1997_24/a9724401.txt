Abstract    :
              Acquisition of Two Microscopes with Image Processing and  Analysis
              Instrumentation, for Biological Research at St.  Joseph's University          
              The Biology Department at St. Joseph's University  proposes to acquire:  1) a
              research microscope with  epifluorescence, phase contrast and Differential 
              Interference Contrast (DIC) capability; 2) a research-  quality inverted
              microscope to be used for microinjection of  cells and 3) hardware and software
              to facilitate capturing,  analyzing, and documenting microscopic images.  This 
              instrumentation, along with equipment already in the  department, will
              constitute an image analysis facility for  all Biology faculty and student
              researchers.  The equipment  will be located in adjacent research labs shared
              by the  primary users, who will also share management duties.
