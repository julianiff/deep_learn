Abstract    :
              We propose to develop a new photoacoustic instrument that has  microscopic
              spatial resolution and enhanced sensitivity, thus allowing  first-time
              measurements of oxygen evolution, energy utilization, and  energy dissipation
              within individual mesophyll layers of leaves. Such  an instrument will make it
              possible to discern how photosynthesis in  integrated across the tissues of the
              leaf, thus providing a more  mechanistic understanding of photosynthetic
              performance at the level  of the whole-leaf. No current instrumentation has the
              sensitivity,  capability or spatial resolution for these types of measurements.
