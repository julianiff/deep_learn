Abstract    :
                9724768  Leng    This award will support a planning visit by Professor 
              Russell Leng to New Zealand to consult with Professor Jacob  Bercovitch of the
              Department of Political Science of the  University of Canterbury, Christchurch
              on the development of  collaborative research on mediation in militarized
              crises.  They will develop the research design for an investigation  of the
              effects of different mediation strategies, occurring  within different
              contexts, on the evolution and outcomes of  interstate crises.  Professor
              Leng's data set provide  detailed, act-by-act descriptions of the evolution of 
              crises.  Professor Bercovitch's data provide important descriptions  of the
              context in which mediation was undertaken.  The  integration of the two sets
              will provide a more  comprehensive understanding of the problem and solutions.
