Abstract    :
                  9724360  Jenkins  Highly compliant (flexible) structures, such as membranes,
              must  use noncontact methods of vibration sensing, due to the extreme  thinness
              of the material.  Full-field dynamical descriptions of  large civil or
              mechanical structures, or vibration measurements  in hostile environments, are
              other example where traditional  methods of analysis are insufficient.  This
              proposal seeks to  acquire a laser vibrometer, which is a multi-point
              measurement  system which can be used for model analysis, design studies, 
              nondestructive testing, and system identification.  The system  uses laser
              doppler interferometry to make accurate noncontact  vibration measurements on
              complex systems without the drawbacks  of conventional vibration testing
              techniques.  ***
