Abstract    :
              9724184  Gealt  This is an award to provide support for instrumentation to 
              conduct collaborative research on metal release from biologically  mediated
              sulfide minerals, metal separation/recovery from  wastewater, metals in
              drinking water and metal transport and  effects on bioprocesses in natural
              water.  The proposal leading  to this award was submitted in accord with the
              NSF Instrument  Development and Acquisition Solicitation, NSF 97-24, Major 
              Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program.    The research being conducted on the
              transport and fate of metal  contaminants of water addresses a topic that has
              been  significantly displaced by emphasis on organic contaminants of  water. 
              Results of the collaboration between investigators that  is likely to be
              enhanced through use of this instrumentation is  expected to improve our
              understanding of dominant processes that  control the fate of metals in natural
              systems as an important  step in management of the quality of environmental
              resources.  ***
