Abstract    :
              Acquisition of Equipment for a Virtual Reality Laboratory  for Vision,
              Visuomotor and Synthetic Environment Research    Project Summary    Twelve
              members of the Institute for Mathematical Behavioral  Sciences, the Department
              of Cognitive Sciences, the  Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering,
              and the  Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of  California,
              Irvine, plan to establish a virtual reality  laboratory for vision, visuomotor
              and synthetic environment  research.  These faculty include Myron Braunstein,
              Charles  Chubb, Carol Cicerone, Rui deFigueiredo, Michael D'Zmura,  Glenn
              Healey, Gregory Hickok, Donald Hoffman, Tarow Indow,  Michael McCarthy, George
              Sperling and Charles Wright.    The purpose of the laboratory is threefold:  to
              promote  research in human and artificial visual and visuomotor  systems by the
              participating faculty, to further knowledge  of human behavior and performance
              in synthetic environments,  and to advance research training among students.
