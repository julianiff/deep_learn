Abstract    :
              9724004  Hatcher    This two-year award supports US-France cooperative research
              between Philip Hatcher at the University of New Hampshire (UNH) and researchers
              affiliated with INRIA (French National Institute for Research in Informatics
              and Applied Mathematics) at the Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS-Lyons). 
              The UNH team are experts on the construction of compilers and run-time systems
              for parallel computers.  The ENS-Lyon researchers have recognized expertise in
              design, transformation and validation of parallel proposals, as well as
              expertise in programming environments based upon multithreading.  These
              complementary strengths will be brought together to study issues such as:  the
              utility of multithreaded implementations of data-parallel programming
              languages, the compilation of Java programs for high performance execution on
              clusters of multiprocessor PCs, and the utilization of thread migration to
              effect load balancing in both data-parallel and Java programs.
