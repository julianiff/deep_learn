Abstract    :
              9724075  Dangl      A detailed understanding of the molecular events leading to
              plant disease resistance presents an interesting basic research challenge. 
              Genetic control of disease reactions is often determined by specific
              interactions between alleles of a pathogen gene locus and an allele of the
              corresponding plant disease resistance locus. Recent breakthroughs in this
              field include the molecular identification of the first resistance genes,
              including RPM1 which is the focus of the proposed work.  The protein(s) encoded
              by Rpm1 recognize pathogen-derived factors in an as yet unknown manner. 
              Engagement of the RPM1 protein triggers signal transduction and defense
              responses.  One important result is that RPM1 encodes a  dual specificity , by
              eliciting resistance to the action of another, unrelated pathogen function. 
              The proposed work will address structure-function relationships of the RPM1
              protein, its subcellular localization and the number and nature of proteins
              with which RPM1 interacts.
