Abstract    :
              Abstract- Glezer  CTS- 9724471    Micromachining facilities and diagnostic
              equipment are consolidated and expanded into an integrated facility for
              development and testing of robust fluidic sensors and activators.  Equipment
              acquired includes a large-area alignment system, a parylene deposition system,
              a hot vacuum press, a precision machining apparatus,  a laser vibrometer, a
              particle image velocimetry system, and microscope/video systems.  Initial
              application will be in research on thermal management, modification of
              aerodynamic surfaces, thrust vectoring, hybrid activators, real-time viscosity
              measurement, and mixing in combustion.
