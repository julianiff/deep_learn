Abstract    :
              9724307  Beebe    A time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometer (TOF-SIMS)
              will  be acquired by the University of Utah.  The instrument will  support
              numerous research projects that fall into four general  categories: advanced
              materials and processing, biotechnology of  surfaces, environmental research on
              surfaces and development of  new methodologies related to all three of the
              above areas.  The  instrument will be housed in a centralized facility where it
              will  be used by over 25 faculty researchers, 8 other industrial and 
              university scientists, and about 60 graduate students and  postdoctoral
              associates.  The instrument will also be used in the  education and research
              training of students, as an integral part  of a graduate course in surface
              chemistry and of an undergraduate  course on instrumental analysis.  %%%  The
              instrument will significantly enhance the University's  research capabilities
              in the area of surface science.  It will  have a large impact on research and
              education due to the large  number of investigators and projects involved. 
              Many existing  industrial collaborations will also benefit from use of the 
              instrument.  ***
