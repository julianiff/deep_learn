Abstract    :
                  Research in Chemical Sciences and Engineering  Proposal Number:  CTS-9724404
               Principal Investigator Norman Wagner and Douglas Doren  Institution:   U.
              Delaware    Profs. Wagner and Doren will purchase a new central facility for
              computational research in Chemical Engineering and Chemistry in disciplines
              that involve the description and prediction of molecular phenomena. Research
              and education areas of application are in complex fluids and mixtures, physical
              interaction at interfaces, and catalysis and surface chemistry. The proposed
              facility will complement and reinforce the existing theoretical effort with a
              new capability to run vectorial and parallel jobs that require large memory,
              disk space, and high-speed visualization. An eight-processor Silicon Graphics
              Origin 2000 will be the centerpiece, complementing an existing network of
              workstations.
