              9724778  Noltie      This project supports the visit to Australia of Professor 
              Douglas Noltie of the Department of  Natural Resources,  University of
              Missouri-Columbia, and his graduate student,  Mr. Kenneth Lister, to develop a
              cooperative research  project in cooperation with  Dr. William F. Humphreys of
              the Department of the Department  of  Terrestrial Invertebrate Zoology of the
              Western  Australian Museum, Perth on the ecology, biology and  evolution of 
              cave fish that inhabit our respective  continents.  They will survey
              prospective field sites in the  vicinity of Exmouth, Australia, ca. 1200 km
              north of Perth,  as well as lay the groundwork for their collaboration and 
              proposal submission.
