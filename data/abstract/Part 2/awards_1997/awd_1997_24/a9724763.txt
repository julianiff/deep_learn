Abstract    :
              9724763  Cutkosky    This award supports a 3 month NSF Dissertation Enhancement 
              Fellowship for Dr. Mark Cutkosky at the Mechanical  Engineering Laboratory in
              Tsukuba, Japan.  Dr. Cutkosky's  student, Allison Okamura, will work with Dr.
              Kazuo Tanie,  Director of the Bio-Robotics Division, on a research project 
              entitled, "Dextrous Manipulation and Haptic Exploration of  Unknown Objects."  
               Advances in controls, tactile sensing and motion planning  are beginning to
              make it possible for robot hands to  accomplish autonomous exploration and
              manipulation of  unknown objects.  Drawing upon human-inspired exploratory 
              procedures, a robot can build and refine object models using  the data obtained
              from position, force and tactile sensors.  During the proposed research,
              dextrous hands and fingers  will be equipped with tactile sensors and
              programmed to  evaluate different exploratory procedures and object models 
              developed during thesis research.  Experiments will also be  conducted to test
              the ability to display derived object  properties to a human observer through
              haptic interface.  The proposed experiments in exploratory procedures, object 
              modeling, and display will contribute directly to the  development of systems
              for autonomous or supervised haptic  exploration of objects in remote or
              hazardous environments.  ***
