Abstract    :
              9724555  Stoffa  This award to University of Texas at Austin provides funds for
              acquisition of new computer and software development resources for seismic
              reflection processing and analysis at the Institute for Geophysics.  This award
              from the Major Research Instrumentation Program is expected to provide
              substantial improvements in analytical capabilities for 3D seismic reflection
              research projects and modeling, and will provide state-of-the-art capabilities
              for training graduate and undergraduate students in geophysics.  Substantial
              cost-share (37%) is offered by the Institute towards this project.  ***
