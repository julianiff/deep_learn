Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) will   assist the
              Department of Chemistry at Ripon College in the purchase of a   300 MHz NMR
              spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a   number of areas
              including characterization of the electron transfer   properties of the enzyme
              glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase and studies on the   nucleophile reactivity in
              substitution reactions.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the
              most powerful tool   available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure
              of molecules.   It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize
              specific   arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
                interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art   NMR
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier   research.
              The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such   as polymers,
              catalysis, and in biology.
