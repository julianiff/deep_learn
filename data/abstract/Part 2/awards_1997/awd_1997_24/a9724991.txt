Abstract    :
              9724991  Kang  This proposal is on research to establish a safe, non-  invasive,
              and rapid computer aided diagnostic technique for  the detection of malignant
              skin tumors utilizing near  infrared (NIR) multiple wavelength information (8 
              wavelengths from 450-800 nm at a 50 nm interval).  The  research objectives
              are: (1) early detection of malignant  skin tumors, which can not be confirmed
              by the physician  without biopsy, and (2) malignancy identification from 
              multiple suspicious moles (hundreds) from patients with  atypical mole syndrome
              or with dysplatic nevus syndrome.  A  preliminary study has been completed
              using experimental  tissue models with skin tumor models at four different 
              hemoglobin concentrations.  The experimental results suggest  that
              multi-spectral analysis of NIR images can differentiate  the four experimental
              models.  The planning grant seeks to  carry this research to a point where a
              regular proposal can  be submitted.  ***
