Abstract    :
                Abstract  9724599  Besson  This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) project
              will develop a means of detecting ultra-high energy elementary particle showers
              which develop within the ice sheet at South Pole, Antarctica for the purpose of
              doing neutrino astronomy.  Neutrinos are a decay product of most high energy
              nuclear interactions; however, they interact only weakly with matter and so can
              be expected to escape from the region of interaction even if it is surrounded
              by dust, gas or other obscuring material.  If a neutrino telescope can be made
              to work it will provide a look inside densely obscured regions, such as the
              center of galaxies and may also point to the (unknown) sources of very high
              energy cosmic rays and possibly even gamma ray bursts.  A major portion of the
              funding for this project is being provided by the University of Kansas as
              matching funds.  ***
