Abstract    :
              9724752  LeBowitz    This three-year award supports US-UK collaborative research
               in cell biology between Jonathan H. LeBowitz, Purdue  University and Keith
              Gull, University of Manchester,  Manchester, UK.  The objective of their
              research is to  understand the structure and function of the paraflagellar  rod
              (PFR), a cytoskeletal substructure of trypanosomatid  flagella.  They propose
              genetic, biochemical and cytological  experiments, using electron microscopy,
              in order to develop  a molecular description of PRF in Leishmania mexicana. 
              The PFR is essential for the normal motility of Leishmania,  a protozoan
              parasite and human pathogen. Yet the molecular  structure, assembly and
              function of this unique cytoskeletal  structure are not well understood.  Its
              lack of similarity  to other cytoskeletal proteins and its complex architecture
               suggest a novel type of filament and organization.  The US  investigator
              brings to this collaboration expertise in  molecular biology and molecular
              genetics of Leishmania.  This is complemented by the UK investigator's
              expertise in  electron microscopy and immunofluorescence microscopy. This 
              research effort will advance understanding of the PFR's  functional importance
              for parasite motility and the  potential for utilizing PFR components as an
              anti-Leishmania  vaccine.
