Abstract    :
              9724279  Narayan    A field emission, atomic resolution, transmission electron 
              microscope will be acquired at North Carolina State  University. The instrument
              will support research in  semiconductors, solidstate electronics, photonic
              materials,  ceramics, intermetallics and high temperature  superconductors. 
              The microscope will also serve in the  training of graduate students, both
              through regular courses  and through summer courses, and for establishing
              research  and training links with other institutions in the Research  Triangle
              area.  %%%  The high resolution electron microscope will impact the  research
              of many investigators working in problems that  require such capability.  The
              instrument will also impact  the education and research training activities of
              students  both at N.C. State and at other universities in the area.  ***
