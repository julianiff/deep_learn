Abstract    :
              This significant upgrade of the Large Plasma Device (LAPD) facilitates
              controlled studies of fundamental plasma processes in the behavior of naturally
              occurring plasmas in the auroral ionosphere, magnetosphere, solar wind, solar
              corona, and interstellar medium.  Upgrade activities include a 1 1/2 increase
              in length, doubled magnetic field strength, 100% increase in diagnostic port
              access, auxiliary ion heating capability, and dual sources for
              counter-streaming studies.  The device will continue to provide new results and
              training for young researchers.
