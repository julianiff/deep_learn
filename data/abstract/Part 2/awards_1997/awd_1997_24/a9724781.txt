Abstract    :
              9724781  Branson    This is a cooperative research project between U.S. 
              principal investigators Thomas Branson and Palle Jorgensen  of the Department
              of Mathematics, University of Iowa, and A.  Rod Gover of the Queensland
              University of Technology School  of Mathematics and D.W. Robinson of the
              Australian National  University School of Mathematical Sciences.  The U.S. 
              investigators will spend a total of approximately 105 person-  days in
              Australia working with their counterparts on  invariant elliptic and
              subelliptic operators and their role  in geometry and representation theory. 
              Among the goals is a  deeper understanding of the conformal and tangential
              Cauchy-  Riemann geometrics.  They will proceed on the basis of a new  method
              with the common feature that control of the spatial x-  variable as well as the
              dual frequency x-variable is  required.  In this sense, the proposed work is
              connected on  a fundamental level with modern problems in wavelet theory,  and
              may in the long run shed light on the underlying  geometric structure of
              wavelets.
