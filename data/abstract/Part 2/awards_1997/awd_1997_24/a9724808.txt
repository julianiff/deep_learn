Abstract    :
              9724808  Schuller    This Americas Program award will support travel and related
               expenses for six senior researchers and six young  investigators, to
              participate in two workshops on research  of current interest in the fields of
              solid state physics and  materials science.  These workshops will be held 
              concurrently with a Latin American Symposium of Solid State  Physics (SLAFES),
              in Oaxaca, Mexico, January 11-16, 1998.  The topics to be discussed in the two
              workshops will be the  physical properties of heterostructures and the magnetic
               properties of low dimensional systems.  Organizers are Dr.  Ivan Schuller,
              University of California, San Diego, and Dr.  Jose Luis Moran Lopez,
              Universidad Autonoma de San Luis  Potosi.    The physics and materials science
              of low dimensional systems  is an important current subject of research
              worldwide, but  much of the research is performed by small groups in many 
              institutions. Therefore, there is a strong need to bring  together this small
              group of researchers for open  discussions of past research and future
              directions. The two  workshops will meet this need, especially with the 
              opportunity of holding them concurrently with the Latin  American Symposium,
              which has had US participation since its  inception and has played an important
              role for the  development of American collaboration for many years.    ***
