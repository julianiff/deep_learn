Abstract    :
              9724750  Chrobak    This Dissertation Enhancement Award will send the PI's 
              graduate student, John Noga, to the Institute for  Mathematics at the Graz
              University of Technology for two  months.  There he will work with Dr. Gerhard
              Woeginger in  the area of online algorithms.  Dr. Woeginger is well  respected
              as an expert in this area.  The proposed work will  find new solutions to
              several problems in online algorithms,  in particular, the problem of managing
              two-level memory for  paging, scheduling of machines, vector cover, and vector 
              packaging.  In addition to advancing the state of knowledge  in the field, the
              student's research in Austria will expose  him to new ways of attacking these
              problems, and allow him  to establish international collaborative partners.  It
              is  expected that the contacts made by the student will continue  to grow
              throughout the rest of his career.  ***
