Abstract    :
                This collaborative effort between IRIS, University of Hawaii,   Woods Hole
              Oceanographic Institution and a private corporation   will result in a
              multi-purpose seafloor observatory for   geophysical research.  The Hawaii-2
              undersea telephone cable   between Hawaii and California has been retired by
              AT&T and   transferred for scientific re-use by the geoscience community.   The
              initiation of a deep-ocean facility-the Hawaii-2 Observatory   (H20)-will
              provide the capability for long-term geoscientific   research at the sea floor
              using the Hawaii-2 cable for power and   two-way, real-time communications. A
              site midway between Hawaii   and California optimizes coverage for the IRIS
              Global   Seismographic Network, and will potentially contribute to  
              geomagnetism, tsunami studies, and physical oceanography.    A junction box
              with eight independent underwater-mateable   connectors will be connected to
              the Hawaii-2 cable. A broadband   seismometer and hydrophone package will be
              deployed (plugged in).   Ample power availability  to the observatory opens up
              the types   of instrumentation that can be added (or changed) later using a  
              remotely operated vehicle (ROV) or a manned submersible. The data   from H20
              will be available in real time on a disk buffer via   Internet or telephone
              dial-up. Data will be archived and   distributed by the IRIS Data Management
              Center in Seattle. The   seismic station at H20 will become a part of the IRIS
              Global   Seismographic Network.
