Abstract    :
                The San Antonio Pre-Freshman Engineering Program (PREP) is based  within the
              College of Science and Engineering at the  University of  Texas at San Antonio
              (UTSA).  The program was established in 1979  at UTSA and has now been extended
              to eight community and senior  college campuses in San Antonio and to several
              other campuses in  Texas.  Through support from the Hispanic Association of
              Colleges  and Universities, PREP will soon be used as a model at seven 
              institutions outside of Texas.  Involvement in PREP is achieved  with minimal
              cost to participants.        The program focuses on developing the academic
              potential of   middle and high school students through summer activities
              (course  work, engineering projects, and career seminars).  PREP appears to 
              have influenced the introduction of Algebra I to 7th and 8th grade  students
              and increased Calculus and Physics offerings at the high  school level within
              the San  Antonio school system.  PREP is also  involved with the city's Urban
              Systemic Initiative.        Since its inception, PREP has served more than
              6,600 students   though one or more summer sessions.  Minority and women  
              involvement has been substantive.  The program's summer impact has  grown from
              50 students in 1979 to 1,154 participants in 1996.  The  strengths of the
              nominee include:      .  The high percentage of participants who complete high
              school       (99.9 percent).    .  The large number of high school graduates
              who opt for science       or engineering majors and complete the curricula (55
              percent).    .  The expansion of the program to other Texas sites and its      
              recognition as a model for sites outside Texas.        In summary, PREP excels
              at quality academic preparation of high  school students in science,
              mathematics, and engineering and  provides access for all students.  Its
              success is shown in the  replication of the program throughout Texas and soon
              to other  national locations with Hispanic populations.  The program has 
              impacted large numbers of minority and  female students.  Materials  show good
              student success rates.  In addition, the San Antonio PREP  and the Texas PREP
              have received several citations and awards that  demonstrate organizational
              program distinction in the advancement  of student career development in
              science and engineering.
