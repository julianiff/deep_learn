Abstract    :
              Nielsen  9724755    This award supports a nine month Science and Technology 
              Agency of Japan (STA) Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. James  Nielsen at the
              Mechanical Engineering Laboratory, Tsukuba,  Japan.  Dr. Nielsen will work with
              Dr. Tamio Tanikawa,  research scientist in the Department of Robotics, on a 
              research project entitled, "Structural Design Optimization  of an Ultra Micro
              Manipulator."    The proposed research seeks to optimize both the design and 
              function of an ultra-micro manipulator, a device which has  the precision
              necessary to manipulate biological cells,  micro-machined parts, and other
              small-scale objects.  Specifically, the analysis will focus on developing the 
              structure of an "in-parallel" mechanism used to actuate the  fingers of a
              robotic micro hand.  The choice of an in  parallel manipulator, which uses six
              parallel legs to  perform prescribed activities, is natural for this 
              application in that the design possesses a high degree of  both stiffness and
              precision and the required range of  motion needed for the fingers is
              comparatively limited.  The  primary goal of the project will be to optimize
              the  structural arrangement for use in biotechnological, micro  machine, and
              micro-surgery techniques.  ***
