Abstract    :
                 The somatosensory cortex of the mammalian brain is a major area concerned  
              with touch on the body, and shows a 'map' of activity.  Neurons, or nerve
              cells,   become active in a location that correlates with the relative location
              of the part of the body that is stimulated.  It has been know for a long time
              that this map is plastic, and so it can change with experience; responding
              areas of the map may increase in size if there is a lot of stimulation over
              time, or decrease when the stimulation is blocked or removed.  Sometimes these
              changes are rather rapid, over hours, yet the mechanisms for that rapid change
              still are not understood. This project uses electrophyisological, local
              pharmacological, and   neuroanatomical techniques to explore how the inputs to
              particular neurons can   reorganize quickly.  A novel approach includes using a
              reversible sensory   blockage by a small cold probe.  The hypotheses to test
              are whether some of this   rapid change results from 'unmasking' of inputs that
              have before been inhibited,   whether the subthreshold inputs are regulated by
              control of the inhibitory   neurotransmitter molecule called GABA, and whether
              most of the regulatory   connections lie within the cortex itself.   Results
              from these studies will be important to understanding plasticity in the brain,
              and so will be important beyond simply sensory physiology, extending their
              impact to developmental neuroscience, and to relevance to mechanisms underlying
              learning.
