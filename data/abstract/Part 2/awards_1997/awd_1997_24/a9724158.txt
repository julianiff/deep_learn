Abstract    :
                This three-year award will support participation of US postdoctoral
              associates, new   faculty and graduate students in annual workshops in
              computational science including the   fields of atomic and molecular physics,
              plasmas, condensed matter, materials science,   quantum chemistry, and chemical
              engineering.  The workshops will be held at the Ecole   Normale Superieure in
              Lyon, France under the sponsorship of CECAM (the European   Center for Atomic
              and Molecular Computations).  CECAM is a consortium of nine   Western European
              research organizations.  Its goal is to act as a catalyst for emerging  
              research fields in computational science through the organization of workshops
              on major,   complex research themes.  The workshops take advantage of CECAM's
              unique resources   and provides international opportunities for US scientists
              at an early stage in their careers.  US participation in the 1997-98 CECAM
              workshops is funded by the Office of   Multidisciplinary Activities,
              Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and the   Western Europe
              Program, Division of International Programs.
