Abstract    :
              9724732  Byrne        This is a 12-month award proposed by Drs. Timothy Byrne
              and  Jean Crespi, the University of Connecticut and Professor  Louis S. Y.
              Teng, National Taiwan University.  Dr. Byrne  requests funds for 11 U.S.
              scientists and two graduate  students to travel to attend the bilateral meeting
              on the  Taiwan ARC-Continent Collision in Chungil, Taiwan  between  November 4
              and 9,  1997.  The purpose of this workshop is to  better understand the
              boundary between the uplifted and  exhumed pre-Tertiary metamorphic basement
              and the apparently  down-dropped and sediment-filled Longitudinal Valley.  The 
              Taiwan ARC-area is a unique site for studying crust  deformation.  This
              workshop is a timely opportunity for U.S.  and Taiwan scientists to compare
              data and past research  results prior to a new study, which will be carried out
              by  Dr. Byrne on the tectonic exhumation in an ARC continent  collision site in
              Taiwan. This project also addresses an  important focus area: a unique site in
              an important  geophysical area with little or no data.  This project is 
              jointly supported by the Taiwan National Science Council and  the NSF.
