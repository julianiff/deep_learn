Abstract    :
              9724544  Griffin  Sacred Heart University is an independent, liberal arts 
              institution with 3500 undergraduate and 1500 graduate  students.  The school
              does NOT offer any Ph.D. programs.    The proposal requests $94,500 to purchase
              equipment that  will be used to investigate the biology of hypothalamic 
              neurons and their response to chemical and environmental  pressures.  Among the
              equipment required are computers,  signal amplifiers, oscilloscopes, data
              recorders,  microtomes, etc.    Until recently the University has provided
              little  opportunity for undergraduate research.  There is a current  high level
              commitment to improve these opportunities as  illustrated by the construction
              and renovation of new  biology and chemistry laboratories, new science faculty,
              and  by the appreciable matching funds to this proposal.  One  goal of this
              proposal is to improve the recruiting and  retention of talented
              undergraduates, and to improve the  quality of the undergraduate training.  ***
