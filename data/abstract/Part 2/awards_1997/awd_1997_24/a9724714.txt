This two-year award will support collaborative research
              between Jovan Mijovic of the Brooklyn Polytechnic University and Francesco
              Bellucci of the University of Naples in Italy.  The principal scientific
              objective of the proposed research is a systematic investigation of
              polarization due to migrating charges in crosslinking polymers by simultaneous
              impedance/near-infrared spectroscopy.  

The US side brings to the
              collaboration expertise in chemorheology of reactive polymers and relaxations
              and molecular motions in glass-forming materials.  This is complemented by the
              Italian side's research on the diffusion of ions in various media and use of
              electrochemical methods to study different polarization mechanisms.  The
              knowledge that emerges from this study will be attractive to the adhesive and
              coating, automotive, and aerospace industries in both countries.
