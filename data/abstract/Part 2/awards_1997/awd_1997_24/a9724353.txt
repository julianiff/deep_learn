Abstract    :
              9724353  Camper  The Center for Biofilm Engineering, an Engineering  Directorate
              supported research center, is a world recognized  leader in biofilm science and
              engineering.  One of the most  valuable tools used in the study of films and
              coatings is a  confocal scanning laser microscope (cslm) which provides the 
              ability to study films at various depths and "ages".  The  Center purchased a
              cslm shortly after the programs  initiation in 1990, and it has been used
              extensively since  then.  It has been key to over 100 papers during that span, 
              and has been a part of over 50 theses.  An outreach training  laboratory
              centered around the cslm is being developed.    The new unit will replace the
              original unit which is deemed  obsolete.  New features include the ability to
              use new  probes, 3-dimensional visualization of the data, optical 
              cross-sectioning and increased resolution and image clarity.  The instrument
              will be used for programs on bioremediation,  biocide efficiency,
              microbial-induced corrosion, oral health  care, etc.  ***
