Abstract    :
              9724254  Safinya    Optical imaging instrumentation consisting of a laser
              scanning  confocal microscope with real-time video-rate capability and a 
              micromanipulation system will be acquired by the University of  California at
              Santa Barbara.  The instrument will support real-  time studies of novel
              biomolecular materials, confined complex  fluids, ceramics, alloys and
              composites.  It will be housed  within the Materials Research Laboratory at
              UCSB, where it will  be accessible to all campus researchers.  %%%  Acquisition
              of this instrumentation will impact research and  research training in an
              interdisciplinary program at UCSB in the  general area of complex materials
              that involves about 30 graduate  students, 15 post doctoral associates and 11
              faculty.  ***
