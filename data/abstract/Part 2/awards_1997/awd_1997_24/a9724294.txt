Abstract    :
              9724294  Robinson    A synchrotron beamline dedicated to the new field of
              coherent x-  ray diffraction (CXD) will be built at the Advanced Photon Source 
              (APS) by scientists at the University of Illinois at Urbana  Champaign (UIUC). 
              Because CXD functions by collecting the  diffraction pattern from the entire
              field of view at the sample,  it can be used to reconstruct an image somewhat
              in the same way  that a hologram does.  The scientific potential of the
              technique  is enormous, not only because it is sensitive to the specific 
              arrangement of the microstructure, but also because structural  fluctuations in
              the time domain can be observed using photon  correlation spectroscopy.  The
              project  brings together eight  faculty members from the departments of
              Physics, Materials  Science and Engineering, and Chemistry at UIUC.  The 
              instrumentation will support research in a variety of material  systems,
              including thermal fluctuations and faceting of surfaces,  electrochemical
              interfaces, and materials containing defect  structures.  %%%  The novel CXF
              technique depends on the use of high brightness,  third generation hard x-ray
              synchrotron sources to be successful.  There are only three such sources in the
              world: the APS at  Argonne National Laboratory, the ESRF in Grenoble, and
              Spring8 in  Osaka.  This synchrotron beamline affords the potential for many 
              new insights into the dynamics of structural changes of a wide  class of
              materials which are not possible by other techniques.  This project is
              co-supported by the Major Research  Instrumentation program and the Office of
              Multidisciplinary  Activities.  ***
