Abstract    :
                9724716  Affatigato and Feller    This award supports extension of research
              funded under DMR  9623681 to include cooperation with the Physics Department 
              of Fudan University, Shanghai, on formulation and  characterization of
              interesting and potentially  technologically significant glasses.  In the
              current proposal, the two PI s, one senior and one a  recent Ph.D. will be
              joined by several undergraduates in a  joint project that will combine the
              glassmaking and property  characterization capabilities of the Coe College
              group with  the expertise in nonlinear optics resident in Dr. Wang  Wencheng's
              group in the Laser Physics and Optics Lab at  Fudan University, Shanghai.  The
              main scientific goal is to  investigate the second-order nonlinear optical
              properties of  poled bismuth and lead borate and silicate glasses.  Most of 
              the manufacturing and measurement work at Coe will be  carried out by
              undergraduate students.  Sharing of  facilities and expertise is at the core of
              the proposal.  The glassmaking equipment and knowledge necessary for the 
              project is unavailable at Fudan University, while the Coe  College group has a
              long tradition of manufacturing novel  glasses at extreme compositional limits.
               On the other hand,  the group at Fudan is internationally recognized for their
               expertise in nonlinear optics, which is lacking at Coe.  Support on the
              Chinese side will be provided by the National  Natural Science Foundation of
              China.
