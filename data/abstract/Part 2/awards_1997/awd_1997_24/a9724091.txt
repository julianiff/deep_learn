Abstract    :
              PI:  Summy-Long, J.  IBN-9724091  Large cells in the brain that produce the
              hormones vasopressin (VP) and oxytocin (OT) comprise the magnocellular
              neuroendocrine system.  These cells also make nitric oxide (NO), a gas that
              regulates the function of neurons and their interconnections and cellular
              structure.  These structural changes (termed plasticity) are known to occur on
              oxytocinergic neurons late in pregnancy and are maintained throughout
              lactation.  Current research indicates that NO, as well as OT, released within
              the brain during nursing, may be necessary to maintain these plastic changes in
              the oxytocinergic neuron.  In the proposed research it is postulated that more
              magnocellular cells synthesize or produce NO during lactation to meet the
              increasing demand for NO to influence plasticity.  Current methods in
              neuroscience (immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization) will be used to
              localize and count the number of cells throughout the magnocellular system that
              express different forms of NO synthase, the enzyme needed to produce NO. 
              Specifically, we will determine if an increased expression of NO synthase
              occurs in magnocellular neurons during lactation.  Findings from these proposed
              studies will clarify a role for NO in regulating plasticity of the
              magnocellular system during lactation.  Aside from the recognized contribution
              to our understanding of the neuroendocrinology of lactation, these studies have
              the potential to increase our knowledge regarding the action of NO on the
              nervous system with implications for the neurobiology of learning and memory
              and the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
