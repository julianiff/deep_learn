Abstract    :
              9724212  Reid  This award to University of Miami in Florida provides funds for
              acquisition of a new scanning electronic microscope and related
              instrumentation.  This field-emission environmental scanning electron
              microscope allows both high magnification sample analysis in high vacuum mode
              and analysis of wet or uncoated samples in low vacuum mode, significantly
              enhancing researchers' ability to study environmental samples without
              preparation artifacts.   This award from the Major Research Instrumentation
              Program is jointly supported by both Division of Ocean Sciences in the
              Geosciences Directorate and the Division of Biological Infrastructure in the
              Biological Sciences Directorate.  It is expected to provide major improvements
              over existing analytical capabilities for researchers in both earth and
              biological sciences, as well as other fields, and it is anticipated that it
              will serve as an important catalyst for integration of research and education
              in environmental sciences at University of Miami and other South Florida
              colleges.  Substantial cost-share is offered by the University of Miami towards
              this project.  ***
