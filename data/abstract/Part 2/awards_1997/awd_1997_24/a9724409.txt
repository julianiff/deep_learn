Abstract    :
              9724409  Carlson    This grant, made through the Major Research Instrumentation 
              (MRI) Program, provides $574,172 as partial support of the  costs of acquiring
              a multi-collector, high resolution  inductively coupled plasma mass
              spectrometer (MC-HR-ICP-MS)  with a laser ablation microprobe for high
              sensitivity, high  precision and high spatial resolution studies in 
              geochemistry, geochronology and cosmochemistry.  The multi-  collector
              HR-ICP-MS is considered a potentially  revolutionary instrument for studies of
              the isotopic  composition of elements with high ionization potentials  which,
              prior to the advent of the MC-HR-ICP-MS, have alluded  serious study.  The
              Micromass Iso-PlasmaTrace ICP-MS that  the PI's will acquire will enhance
              and/or make possible  fundamental studies in the Earth sciences.  Evidence for 
              core-mantle exchange based on high precision analyses of  platinum group
              elements (PGE) in mafic and ultramafic  samples, determination of the degree of
              chemical  heterogeneity in the early mantle using Lu-Hf isotope  systematics
              and geochronologic investigations of time scales  of magma transport through
              the mantle based on uranium  disequilibria series isotope systematics are just
              a few of  the examples of the research that can be addressed given the  stated
              capabilities of this new generation instrument.  This  instrument will also
              provide training on state-of-the-art  geochemical instrumentation for some of
              the top earth  science scholars in the world through CIW-DTM's 
              postdoctoral/guest scientist program.  ***
