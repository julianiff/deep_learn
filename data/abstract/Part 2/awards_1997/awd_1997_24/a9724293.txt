Abstract    :
              This MRI proposal is to build a network of cosmic ray detectors (neutron
              monitors) at high latitudes. The detectors are placed at strategic Polar
              locations to obtain information about the cosmic rays' angle of arrival. With
              such an array, the entire Earth acts as a directional cosmic ray detector. The
              fact that the Earth's magnetic field deflects the particles is used to
              determine the direction of arrival of energetic cosmic rays. Compared with
              cosmic ray detectors flown in space, this new "Spaceship Earth" will enjoy
              counting statistics far exceeding current spacecraft capabilities.   The
              Spaceship Earth network is an international project, with participation from
              US, Russia and Australia. The network consists of 9 high-latitude stations,
              roughly equidistant in longitude (1 in Antarctica owned and operated by the
              Australians, 4 in Russia, and 4 in Northern Canada which are covered by this
              proposal). The new network will be used for research, graduate education, and
              postdoctoral training. The data will be analyzed to understand the acceleration
              and transport of solar energetic particles, to probe the structure of magnetic
              turbulence in the solar wind, and to elucidate the mechanism of transient
              cosmic ray variations. The network has a high societal impact because the PI's
              will examine the role of cosmic rays in the context of space weather, and
              evaluate the network role to forecast space weather. An advance warning of as
              much as 10 hours of potentially damaging magnetic storms might be possible.
              (Presently, only one hour advance warning is possible).
