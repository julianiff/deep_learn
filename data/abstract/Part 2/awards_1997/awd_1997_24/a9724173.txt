Abstract    :
              9724173  Rea    This award provides support for Professor David Rea, of the 
              Department of Geological Sciences of the University of  Michigan and several of
              his colleagues to travel to Lanzhou,  China  to assess the feasibility of
              collaborative research  on the Miocene to Recent rocks and sediments deposited
              to  the north and east of the Tibetan Plateau.  The area  concerned appears to
              contain a unique record of the detailed  behavior of the Earth's magnetic
              field; of the geologic and  climatologic consequences of the Tibetan uplift,
              and of  mammalian evolution during this time of significant global  change. 
              The U.S. team has been invited to China by  Professor Li Jijun, Dean of the
              Resources and Environment  School of Lanzhou University.        P: eap/REA
