Abstract    :
              9724923  Incera    This Americas Program award will fund travel and related 
              expenses for Dr. Vivian Incera, and Dr. Efrain Ferrer of the  State University
              of New York at the Fredonia campus, for a  short-term visit to Mexico to plan a
              research collaboration  in theoretical physics with Dr. Carlos Villareal and
              Dr.  Manuel Torres of the Instituto de Fisica of the National  Autonomous
              University of Mexico (UNAM).  They also plan to  visit Dr. Ricardo Capovilla of
              the Center for Research and  Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic
              Institute  (CINVESTAV) and Dr. Jose Luis Lucio, of the Universidad de 
              Guanajuato, two additional well-known centers for  theoretical physics in
              Mexico.  In the past year, several  areas of common interest and complementary
              strengths have  been identified with these groups through electronic and 
              telephone contacts, but it is necessary now to discuss the  details of the
              research problems to be studied, as well as  the strategies to be followed. 
              The completion of this visit  is likely to lead to a long-term research
              collaboration with  various strong groups in Mexico.  ***.
