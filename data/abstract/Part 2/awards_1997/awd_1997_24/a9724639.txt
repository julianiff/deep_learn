Abstract    :
              Abstract- Long  CTS-9724639    A system is assembled for simultaneous
              high-volume computation and high-performance real-time visualization linked
              with high-speed networking connections.  The parallel computing system is
              centrally located, while the visualization capability is distributed to sites
              convenient to primary users. The system includes an expandable 16-mode parallel
              computer system and four distributed visualization engines.  Initial
              applications include fundamental physics of turbulence-acoustic interactions,
              emissions and control of combustion, large eddy simulation of reacting flows,
              molecular-dynamic simulations of laser ablation, Monte Carlo analyses of the
              physics of fluids, and supercritical fluid applications.
