Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds to upgrade the existing instrumentation and test
              equipment in the University of Washington (UW) structural and geotechnical
              engineering research laboratory.  This upgrade will allow UW and other Pacific
              Northwest researchers to work at the forefront of structural and geotechnical
              engineering research.  Specifically, it will provide three important
              capabilities that do not currently exist: (1) the ability to test large
              full-scale structural components, (2) the ability to perform pseudo-dynamic
              tests in which actual earthquake loading and response of full-scale structures
              and components is simulated, and (3) the ability to perform shaking table tests
              on soils, particularly liquefiable soils, and structures.  These three
              capabilities are vital to the advancement of knowledge, the education of future
              structural and geotechnical engineers, and public safety.
