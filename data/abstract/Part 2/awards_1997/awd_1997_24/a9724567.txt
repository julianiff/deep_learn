Abstract    :

               High Performance of Processors and Networks for Video Compression, Distributed
              Visualization, Database Systems and Collaborative Telepresence    USC has
              received a Major Research Instrumentation award for the acquisition of
              processing hardware; a special purpose high-speed-resolution digital video
              storage and display hardware; and miscellaneous data communications hardware;
              for an Integrated Media Research Network (IMRN) to support research and
              training programs in high-performance multimedia, graphics, visualization, and
              database systems.    Research projects to be supported include the generation,
              compression and transmission of real-time video over shared networks;
              processing of remote high resolution 3-D visualization and
              computation-intensive graphics; robust distribution and networking of
              interactive multimedia data within a heterogeneous distributed computing
              environment; distributed database management techniques for video and audio
              servers; and utilization of multiprocessor computers for collaborative
              telepresence over long physical distances.    Besides making the enhanced
              facilities available to students pursuing research in high-performance
              graphics, visualization and database systems, USC plans to connect the IMRN to
              the Institution's School of Engineering's Instructional Television network
              which supports two-way live interactive broadcasts of regular credit courses
              from engineering, computer science and mathematics.  It is envisaged that this
              connection will allow students to work on research projects anywhere on the
              main campus, medical school campus and USC's Information Sciences Institute and
              will allow classroom demonstrations over these locations as well as the local
              Los Angeles area.  Research results on database management for video data and
              distance learning will contribute directly to these distance learning
              activities.
