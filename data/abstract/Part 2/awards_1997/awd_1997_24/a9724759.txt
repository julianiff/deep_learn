Abstract    :
              9724759  CORNELL      Professors Howard Cornell and Ronald Karlson of the 
              Department of Biology at the University of Delaware, and Dr.  Terence P. Hughes
              of the Department of Marine Biology of  James Cook University, Australia, will
              sample corals in six  sectors of increasing regional species richness across
              the  Indo-West and Central Pacific Ocean to quantitatively  evaluate the
              relative influence of regional and local  processes on local richness.  Data
              will be collected on  species presence, relative abundance, habitat breadth,
              and  depth range of selected species to test the effects of the  increasing
              regional pool on local richness, evenness,  habitat compression, and habitat
              overlap.  This synthesis of  regional and local perspectives should provide an
              integrated  conceptual framework not only for basic studies of community 
              ecology but also for applied problems associated with  species extinctions,
              habitat loss and fragmentation, and  ecological restoration.
