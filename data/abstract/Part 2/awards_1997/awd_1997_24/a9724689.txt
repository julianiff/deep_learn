Abstract    :
              9724689  Hicks    This award supports a 12 month National Science Foundation 
              Dissertation Enhancement award for Dr. David Hicks at the  Chiba University
              Department of Cultural Anthropology, Chiba,  Japan.  Dr. Hick's student, Ms.
              Jennifer Callans, will work  with Dr. Hideo Takei,  Professor of Anthropology,
              on a  research project entitled, "Meiji Era Art Motifs and  Contemporary
              Japanese Conceptions of Identity."    The proposed research seeks to illuminate
              how art stimulates  cultural identity by determining whether natural or 
              technological motifs associated with the Meiji Era (1868-  1912) serve as a
              foundation for Japanese collective  identity.  Although the Meiji Era is
              considered a crucial  period in Japanese history, there has been no attempt to 
              examine the association between Meiji art and a contemporary  Japanese sense of
              collective self, that is, "Japaneseness"  (Nihonrashisa). The proposed research
              builds on current  historical and anthropological studies to analyze how the 
              Japanese people create and sustain a sense of collective  identity and how
              diverse interpretations of the identity  potentially undermine existing
              attitudes and induce social  change.  ***
