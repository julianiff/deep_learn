Abstract    :
                  9730257  Moran    This team of scientists from the Univbersity of Rhode
              Island  and  the  University  of  Minnesota  will  test  the  hypothesis  that 
              horizontal advection plays a significant role in the transport of  the 
              radioisotopes  230Th and 231Pa in the water  column  of  the  North  Atlantic. 
              Studies will involve measurement of  230Th  and  231Pa  in North Atlantic Deep
              Water, the Labrador Sea, and  other  water   masses  of  the  North  Atlantic 
              as  well  as   downcore  measurements  of the excess 231Pa/ 230Th isotopic
              ratio  in  high  sedimentation  rate  cores  from the  Labrador  Sea.  
              Laboratory  studies would be conducted to determine distribution coefficients 
              of  these  isotopes  between seawater and  particulate  surfaces.  Such  
              studies   should  prove  important  in  interpreting   the  sedimentary record
              left by these isotopes inasmuch as that record  provides  insight into the
              paleoceanogrphy of the North Atlantic,  especially the formation of North
              Atlantic Deep Water.
