Abstract    :
              9730435  Liu    The project is a modeling study of the thermocline  variability
              in the extratropics.  The thermocline  variability will be studied in terms of
              various planetary  wave modes along with their interaction with mean 
              thermocline flow.  A concurrent study of analytical and  numerical modeling
              will be used to highlight the essential  physics.  Idealized and realistic
              Pacific studies will be  performed, and the results will be compared with 
              observations.
