              Proposal Title:  Calculus:  Catalyzing a National Community for Reform     
              Abstract:  The mathematical Association of America (MAA) is publishing and
              disseminating Calculus:  Catalyzing a National Community for Reform
              (1987-1995),  The report provides a timely encapsulation of the characteristics
              of the NSF Calculus Program, evidence of impact of the NSF Calculus Program, a
              timeline for calculus reform, and summary abstracts of all NSF calculus awards
              over the period 1987-1995.  The MAA's Notes Editorial Board believes that the
              report is very valuable to all teachers of calculus and that it nicely
              complements several other MAA publications on calculus reform.  Dissemination
              includes all department heads in two-year colleges, four-year colleges, and
              universities.
