Abstract    :
              9730008  Marton-Lefevre  ICSU will undertake a series of activities to advance 
              scientific  planning related to research on global change and the  environment.
               These activities include those of ICSU's Advisory Committee  on the 
              Environment (ACE); ICSU's Environmental Sciences Officer who  provides staff
              support for ACE; and scientific planning  activities  of the World Climate
              Research Programme (WCRP), the  International  Geosphere-Biosphere Programme
              (IGBP), and the International  Dimensions (of Global Environmental Change
              Program (IHDP).  ACE  will promote coordination regarding global change
              research  among  ICSU's various international scientific unions (e.g., the 
              International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG);  International  Union of
              Geological Sciences (IUGS); International Union of  Biological Sciences (IUBS);
              and International Union of Pure  and  Applied Chemistry (IUPAP)); between
              relevant ICSU bodies and  external partners, especially the intergovernmental 
              organizations  co-sponsors of global change research (e.g., the World 
              Meteorological Organization (WMO); the Intergovernmental  Oceanographic
              Commission (IOC); and the UN Environment  Programme  (UNEP)); and other
              international organizations representing  the  interests of the social and
              engineering sciences and  industry in  global change research.  ACE will review
              and provide  scientific  guidance to the WCRP, IGBP, IHDP and their component 
              projects; to  the international global change observing systems (for  climate 
              (GCOS), for the oceans (GOOS), and for the terrestrial  system  (GTOS); to all
              other ICSU activities related to global  change and  environment research (such
              as those of the Scientific  Committee on  Problems of the Environment (SCOPE);
              and to  intergovernmental  bodies concerned with global change issues such as
              climate  change,  biodiversity and desertification.  ***
