Abstract    :
                9730123  SUN    This award provides funding for an Engineering Research
              Centers (ERC) Program/Centers for Research Excellence in Science and Technology
              (CREST) Program Partnership between the Engineering Research Center for
              Collaborative Manufacturing at Purdue University and the Crest Center for
              Innovative Manufacturing of High Performance Materials at Tuskegee University
              entitled "Design, Analysis, and Manufacture of Connectors Joining Components of
              Advanced Composite Materials."  Purdue's ERC and Tuskegee's CREST share a
              common interest in the manufacture of advanced materials and structural
              components.  While Purdue focuses on developing close collaboration with
              industry in conducting the research, Tuskegee places more emphasis on enhancing
              its research capability and on its equallu important objectives in education. 
              This project will provide a meaningful linkup between these two Centers, from
              which both Centers will benefit in fulfilling and expanding their goals.  The
              research proposed is to develop connectors for joining composite structural
              components which calls for an integrated design, analysis, and manufacture of
              efficient and effective connectors for tubular and sandwich composite
              structures.
