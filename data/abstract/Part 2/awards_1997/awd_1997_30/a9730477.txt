Abstract    :
              9730477  The proposed instrumentation project requests funds to develop a low
              cost, versatile and adaptable fluid sampler for deployment in depths up to 6000
              m. It will be designed to 1) determine the relative importance of fluid
              expulsion via diffuse and focused flow,  2) quantify the geochemical fluxes
              associated with each of the modes of fluid flow, and 3) establish the
              importance of episodic flow.    The experimental fluid chamber will capture and
              isolate fluids escaping the sediment-water interface with little or no
              disturbance of the flow regime. It will consist of a long, thin-walled
              cylindrical chamber of narrow bore, and a length to diameter ratio of 10:1 or
              greater. A frame will convey the chamber to near the bottom and support it from
              a wide-spread tripod. After tripod emplacement, the chamber will be deployed to
              rest just on the sediment-water interface with no near-by surfaces to disturb
              or redirect the normal upward advection of fluids from the sediment surface. No
              back-pressure is created in the system by avoiding flow area restrictions.
              Normal flow will enter the chamber through the bottom of the cylinder and
              continue through, exiting at the top.  Two tracers will be continuously
              injected into the system to help determine the direction and rate of flow.
              Intended duration of initial deployments will be weeks to months, and
              eventually years.
