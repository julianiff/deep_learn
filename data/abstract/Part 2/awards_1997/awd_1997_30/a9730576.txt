Abstract    :
              This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to the University of  
              Pennsylvania supports the research of Professor Marisa C. Kozlowski.  The  
              theme of the research is the asymmetric synthesis of alpha-amino acids by  
              transition-metal catalyzed hydroformylation of imines.  Both diastereo-   and
              enantioselective variants are proposed.  Multistep reactions   involving
              sequential alkene hydroformylation, imine formation, and imine  
              hydroformylation will be performed using a single catalyst.  Mechanistic  
              studies will elucidate the course of the reactions and aid in the design   of
              appropriate catalyst systems.  The successful development of the synthetic
              process studied here   represents a significant improvement over existing
              methods in that a   large number of chiral amino acids can be produced
              inexpensively from   readily available starting materials.  Such materials are
              important in   catalysis and asymmetic synthesis.
