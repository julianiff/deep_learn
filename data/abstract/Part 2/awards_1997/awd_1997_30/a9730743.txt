Abstract    :
              9730743  Basu    This grant provides three years of partial salary support for a
               Technical Associate in the mass spectrometry laboratories of the  Department
              of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of  Rochester.  The
              isotope geochemistry Technical Associate will  provide support for both the
              thermal ionization and plasma source  mass spectrometer laboratories under the
              directions of Dr. Asish  Basu and Dr. Ariel Anbar, respectively.  The combined
              mass  spectrometer laboratories at Rochester offer unique analytical 
              capabilities for a variety of trace element and isotope ratio  measurements
              that will augment the research of faculty and students  in earth processes and
              evolution.  The support for the technical  position will allow collaborative
              work among Rochester faculty and  with outside investigators, and will promote
              in-house analytical  research involving trace element and isotope geochemistry.
