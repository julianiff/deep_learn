Abstract    :
              9730643  Soloviev    The project will analyze the turbulence data obtained by
              the  Russian bow sensors during TOGA COARE legs of the R/V Moana  Wave.  The
              main goal is to quantify turbulence levels in the  near-surface layer of the
              tropical ocean under a variety of  forcing and mixed layer conditions.  The
              objectives are to:  1)  compare the observed turbulence dissipation rate with 
              theoretical values; and 2) find typical spatial patterns of  the turbulence
              parameters.
