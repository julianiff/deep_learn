Abstract    :
              9730433  Moum    This oceanographic instrumentation development project is to
              build   and test a low-cost and low power sensor for in situ ocean  
              measurements of velocity on small space scales that are critical in  
              microstructure and turbulence studies.  The proposed approach is to   adapt a
              three-component pitot tube probe, presently used for   atmospheric measurements
              on aircraft, for use on different   oceanographic instrumentation packages. The
              recent commercial   availability of low-cost and low-power differential
              pressure strain   gauges suggests that newly designed velocity sensors can
              replace   certain existing oceanographic sensors that are relatively  
              expensive and that have high power requirements. The new sensor   should be
              capable of resolving velocities with mms-1 resolution on   scales of a few
              centimeters. The sensors will be adapted for   dropped, towed, and moored
              instrument packages and will be useful   for planned and envisioned long-term
              deployments of observational   platforms for physical oceanographic
              investigations.
