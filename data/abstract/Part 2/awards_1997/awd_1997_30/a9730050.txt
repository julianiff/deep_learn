Udwadia
This award supports Firdaus E. Udwadia, and up to ten other
              researchers to attend a workshop on Dynamics and Control to be held August
              17-19, 1998 in Lambrecht, Germany.  Special emphasis will be given to the
              topics of nonlinear dynamics, control of uncertain systems, and game theoretic
              approaches to solving current problems.  U.S. participants will be chosen from
              a broad range of universities and geographic locales.  The workshop will bring
              together experts, senior researchers and students from western Europe, eastern
              Europe, and the United States.  This workshop answers a need for increased
              interaction in this field between scientists from the United States, western,
              and especially eastern Europe.  It is also expected to lead to new
              collaborations between scientists from those areas.  East European participants
              will be supported by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis;
              West European participants will be funded by the Humboldt Foundation; the cost
              for room and board for all participants will be paid by the Volkswagen
              Foundation.
