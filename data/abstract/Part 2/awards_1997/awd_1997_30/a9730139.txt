Abstract    :
              9730139  Zucker    SRI International is developing a set of problem-solving
              modules for students in grades 6, 7, and 8.  The modules will be distributed
              via CD-ROMs, will have Internet connections, and will use multimedia, including
              video segments, to present real-world problems tied to the NCTM Standards.  A
              kit of computer-based tools, with appropriate "helps", will be included with
              each CD-ROM.  All problems will be designed so it is appropriate for students
              to use the computer-based tools while they work to solve the problems.  The
              materials are to be aligned and coordinated with Connected Mathematics,
              Mathematics in Context, STEM, and other NSF-supported middle school mathematics
              instructional materials development projects.  A major part of the project is a
              research component to identify topics in the cited instructional materials for
              which a multimedia environment provides learning opportunities not available in
              a traditional format.
