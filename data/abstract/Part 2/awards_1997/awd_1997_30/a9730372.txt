Abstract    :
              This research investigates a test data compression method  which fully utilizes
              the unique characteristics of test  data. The key idea is to perform the
              Burrows-Wheeler (BW)  transformation on individual test sequences, and then to 
              apply two different compression schemes. The BW  transformation reduces the
              number of transitions for test  sequences, which leads to a higher compression
              ratio  compared with the original test sequences. Research topics  are: 1.
              study characteristics of test data that form a basis  for the work and to
              measure redundancy of test sequences  along pins and across pins; 2. determine
              how best to merge  correlated test sequences to achieve a higher compression 
              ratio; 3. study the BW transformation and the strings  generated by successive
              applications of the BW  transformation to enable one to construct a test set
              with a  minimal number of transitions; 4. integrate the research  findings into
              the P.I.'s existing tool for test data  compression.
