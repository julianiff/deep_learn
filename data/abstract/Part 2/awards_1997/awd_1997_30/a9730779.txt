Numerically efficient and mathematically rigorous tools
              are developed for theoretical study of problems of wave propagation in
              composite wedges. Experimental and theoretical studies are conducted for the
              scattering of surface acoustic waves by a solid wedge adhered to a solid
              half-space made from another material. These developments have a broad variety
              of technical applications in seismology, geophysics, acoustoelectronics, ocean
              acoustics, nondestructive ultrasonic evaluation, radar, and mobile
              telecommunication systems.***
