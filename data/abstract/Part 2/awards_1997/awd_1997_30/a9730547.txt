Abstract    :
                This collaborative research is concerned with understanding the impact of
              redistricting on legislative elections.  The standard wisdom holds that
              redistricting has only a minimal effect on elections; producing tiny changes in
              partisan gain or doing little to protect incumbents.  While a great deal of
              research has been undertaken on this problem, the researchers argue that
              previous work has improperly modeled the effects.  Using a formal model of
              strategic redistricting, the PIs show that a variety of actors, ranging from
              state legislators to state judges have important effects on how redistricting
              lines are drawn.  While this is well known, they also show the conditions under
              when their strategic behavior will have an impact on partisan gains and
              incumbent advantage.  The researchers test crucial features of their model by
              examining the array of redistricting changes that occurred in the 1960's.  This
              was a key period in American politics and has often been associated with the
              rise of an incumbency advantage.  The researchers find that redistricting is an
              important strategic tool to change partisan advantage and to protect
              incumbents.
