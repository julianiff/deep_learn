Abstract    :
              9730699  Donahue    This grant provides an additional three years partial
              support of  the operations and maintenance budget for the University of 
              Arizona accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) facility.  The  Arizona AMS lab has
              been in operation since 1981 under continuous  NSF funding with the intentions
              of supporting the frontier in-  house research and technique development
              conducted by the Arizona  AMS staff and to provide radiocarbon (14C) dating
              services  primarily for NSF-funded PI's. The lab presently analyzes the 14C 
              content of over 3,500 samples per year of which about 19% were  for in-house
              research.  This facility supports the needs of not  just Earth scientists, but
              also, oceanographers, glaciologists,  hydrogeologists, archaeologists,
              planetary scientists and  atmospheric scientists.  Examples of research that
              have relied on  Arizona AMS analyses include: paleoclimatological studies of
              ice  sheet dynamics in Antarctica and mountain glacier dynamics in the 
              mid-latitude Chilean Andes; studies in paleoseismology;  archaeological studies
              of the timing of Paleoindian settlements  in the Americas; atmospheric and
              oceanographic studies of upper  water column dynamics based on the 14C/13C
              signatures recorded in  coralline skeletons; coupled 14C and U/Th dating of
              corals and  speleothems to extend atmospheric radiocarbon calibration beyond 
              the present dendrochronologic limit of ca. 11.5 ka; the use of  14C as a tracer
              of the pools of dissolved organic and inorganic  carbon pools in groundwater;
              and 14C investigations of the origin  of carbon in chondrites and the inferred
              Martian meteorites.  Furthermore, this lab trains a diverse array of
              undergraduate,  graduate and post-doctoral students engaged in physics,
              chemistry  and geoscience research programs that utilize AMS techniques.  Due
              to the diverse range of scientific fields supported by this  facility,
              continued NSF support is shared by the Division of  Earth
              Sciences/Instrumentation and Facilities Program, programs  within the Office 
              of Polar Programs and the SBER/Archaeometry  program.  ***
