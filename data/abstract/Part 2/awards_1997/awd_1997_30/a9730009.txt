Abstract    :
              Gregg  9730009  Fast-response thermistors capable of measuring temperature 
              microstructure throughout  most of the ocean from vehicle moving as fast as two
              knots  will be developed using  modern material sciences technology. Two
              techniques will be  used: one making  uniform thin glass coatings and another
              laying thin film  thermistors on substrates to  combine the sensitivity and
              long life of thermistors with  the fast response of cold films.  In addition,
              it is hoped that the new design will lead to  smaller (and  thus faster) probes
               with more uniform shapes (same dynamic response for units of  the same
              design).
