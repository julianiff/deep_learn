Abstract    :
                This research undertakes a series of seven experiments designed to test
              theoretically derived predictions hypothesized to explain the causes and
              correlates of the Own Race Bias.  The ORB, the tendency for people to be better
              at identifying members of their own racial group in comparison to members of
              other groups, has been demonstrated empirically for years, but remains
              unexplained.  The first four studies examine the impact of variables
              hypothesized to underlie the ORB.  Specifically, perceived typicality,
              familiarity, and memorability may interact with race and perceptual expertise
              to determine facial recognition accuracy.  In addition, the role of racial
              attitudes, cognitive strategies people use to search their memories, and their
              eye scanning patterns will be examined.  The other three studies investigate
              whether and ORB exists for descriptions of faces, whether incentive motivation
              to remember influences accuracy, and the ORB exists not only for photographs,
              but for lineups.  In each case, research participants will be shown photographs
              or videotaped stimuli and later asked to identify previously seen individuals
              who have been embedded within new distractor stimuli.  Participants are
              self-identified African Americans, of mixed racial ancestry, or white
              non-Hispanics.  Stimuli are African American or white.  Dependent variables
              common to each of the studies are hit rate, false alarms, and A' signal
              detection measures.  Data will be analyzed via MANOVA. This work will not only
              have direct theoretical relevance to social and cognitive psychological
              theories, but applicability at the practical level as well.  For example, the
              occurrence of an own-race bias to responses in lineup situations has direct
              relevance for what should or should not be testified to by expert witnesses in
              court cases.  %%%  This research undertakes a series of seven experiments
