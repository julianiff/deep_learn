Abstract    :
              Lupton  9730431  Funds are provided to analyze helium isotope samples  collected
              along two  meridional hydrographic sections in the Pacific as part of  the
              World Ocean  Circulation Experiment and make the data available to the 
              community. The  samples will be analyzed for their helium isotope ratios and 
              for 4He  concentration using a special mass spectrometer. The helium 
              measurements will  be useful in determining what the deep circulation patterns 
              are and how  consistent they are with other analyses and model results.
