Abstract    :
                  Recent volcanic activity on Monteserrat in the Lesser  Antilles has led to
              generation of pyroclastic flows by the  collapse of growing andesitic dome.
              Some flows have been  sufficiently mobile to have traveled over the sea surface
               while other parts interact explosively in shallow water.  A  delta is being
              constructed on the east coast of the island  and shoaling of 150 m at a
              distance of three km offshore has  been measured. The project will study these
              flows during a  nine-day marine geological survey using side-scan sonar,  Chirp
              II and bubble pulser system, from a locally charted  vessel. The results will
              lead to better understanding of the  depositional mechanisms of pyroclastic
              flows and the types  of deposits that form in the marine environment.
