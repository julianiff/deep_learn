Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT      FERNANDEZ & RUSTAD  DEB-9730110    Greenhouse gas emissions are
              expected to increase mean global temperature by 3-5 C  in the next 50-100
              years. The consequences of this warming for primary ecosystem processes are not
              yet understood, and have become tile focus of an emergent field of ecological
              research. This project will bring together a multi-disciplinary, international 
              group of scientists representing 22 soil/air warming sites from seven countries
              to synthesize  the current knowledge on the effects of elevated temperature on
              terrestrial ecosystems. In  addition, the participantswill use this forum to
              discuss and launch a new GCTE Ecosystem Warming Consortium, which will have far
              reaching effects in supporting and promoting future information exchange,
              technology transfer, and synthesis efforts in ecosystem warming research.
