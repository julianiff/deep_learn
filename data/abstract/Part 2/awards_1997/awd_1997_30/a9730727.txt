Abstract    :
              0730727  Micikas    The BSCS (Biological Sciences Curriculum Study) is working
              with an advisory panel to do an in-depth study of integrated science for high
              school level courses. The project acknowledges the growing interest in
              integrated science as states have increased their science requirements for
              graduation and as states, school districts, and individual schools have
              struggled to implement various standards in science education.  This project is
              to help make sense of the diverse assumptions now in place about the goals,
              placement of, and content for integrated science in high school. The work  plan
              involves solicitation of substantive guidance from constituencies concerned
              with integrated science such as scientific organizations, publishers, teacher
              educators, teachers, science educators, mathematics educators, specialists in
              technology, and state science supervisors.  The advisory committee sets the
              framework for the design study and reviews the process of the BSCS staff.  The
              projected outcome is a report available in hard copy and on the BSCS web site.
