Abstract    :
                      9730584  Ridge  This research project focuses upon factors that
              influence the  adoption of seismic adjustments.  Two field experiments will be 
              carried out to identify three strategies: (1) engaging  reciprocity norms
              through a process of reciprocal concessions,  (2) engaging commitment and
              consistency motivations through a  process of sequential requests, and (3)
              engaging normative  pressures through a process of comparative feedback.  The 
              research will demonstrate the power of social influence  principles for
              inducing compliance with seismic safety adjustment  behaviors.  It will be the
              first experimental research in the  hazards domain that systematically
              manipulates social influence  strategies to investigate their effects on
              behavioral compliance,  thus allowing for casual inferences to be drawn. 
              Moreover, the  research will be conducted in an understudied seismic zone
              (Utah)  and may increase the level of earthquake preparedness in a  population
              of vulnerable citizens.  ***
