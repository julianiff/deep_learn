Abstract    :
              9730654  Kreps    Since its inception in 1970, the Conference on Econometrics
              and Mathematical Economics (CEME) has sponsored a number of annual meetings on
              a variety of topics in economic theory and econometric methodology.  This grant
              renews support for the six CEME seminars in Bayesian Inference, Time Series,
              Forecasting, Microeconometrics, Decentralization, and General Equilibrium.  
              The purpose of this ongoing conference series is to stimulate discussion and
              research on the frontiers of econometric and economic theory, and to
              investigate the application of mathematical, statistical, and computational
              techniques to empirical economic studies.  It is intended to both encourage
              research on new topics and speed the dissemination of the latest findings by
              leading scholars.  To this end, these meetings have been exceptionally
              successful, providing forums for the exchange of ideas in economic theory and
              methods which are not constrained by more formal frameworks of journal
              publication.  The informal channels of communication opened by affording
              specialists in selected topic areas to meet regularly at widely dispersed
              institutions and for longer periods than is generally possible at meetings of
              professional society has been especially fruitful, particularly for young
              scholars at the beginning of their professional careers.  Since its inception,
              seminar groups have produced hundreds of working papers, books, and articles in
              professional journals, which have been broadly circulated, making the contents
              of the seminars more broadly available.  A number of collections of papers
              presented at CEME meetings have been published in special issues of
              professional journals.          ??
