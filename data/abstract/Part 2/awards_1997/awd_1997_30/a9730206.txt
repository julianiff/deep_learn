                Principal Investigator: Weimar   Proposal Title: Pages of Math      abstract:
               This project develops an on-line learning guide covering mathematics taught in
              grades K-12 (except Calculus) as reflected in the evolving standards promoted
              by the NCTM and others.  This curriculum resource grows out of and extends
              projects of the Math Forum such as Ask Dr. Math in which users interact with
              mathematicians and these interactions are achieved as a resource for others to
              use.  The project exploits features on the WWW that enable independent
              exploration for remedial and advanced work, takes advantage of opportunities
              for non-linear learning, provides access to multiple approaches for problem
              solving, and involves users in the continuing development process.  In this
              proof-of-concept phase, the PI will develop and test the hypertext environment
              by providing different voices that can be accessed and used to present several
              key perspectives that maintain their integrity but enable the user to pursue an
              investigation matching his or her needs and interests.  Cost sharing is 6%.
