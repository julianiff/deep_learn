Abstract    :
              Conversational interviewers--survey interviewers who depart from strictly
              standardized methods by explaining critical survey concepts to respondents--can
              sometimes improve response accuracy in fact-based surveys.  Using experimental
              methods, the current research examines in more detail how different kinds of
              conversational interviewing affect response accuracy, defined as the fit
              between respondents' answers and the official definitions of key concepts in
              the questions.  The aims include understanding the cues that interviewers
              consider as they judge whether respondents need help interpreting questions,
              and understanding how and when respondents know that they don't know how to
              answer survey questions.  This project contributes to several practical goals. 
              Knowing more about how different kinds of interviewer deviations from the
              survey script affect response accuracy can help survey researchers choose
              interviewing techniques most appropriate for their research goals and cost
              constraints; that is, any gains in accuracy from conversational interviewing
              may not be worth the additional expense.  Knowing more about what leads
              respondents to ask interviewers for help interpreting questions, when
              respondents display other kinds of uncertainty, and how this uncertainty is
              displayed is essential for training conversational interviewers.  The results
              can inform current face-to-face and telephone survey interviews, as well as
              potential computer-based survey systems, both textual and spoken.
