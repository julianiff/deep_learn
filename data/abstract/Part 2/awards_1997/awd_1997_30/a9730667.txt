Abstract    :
              This project involves a structural approach to the study of plant level
              substitution and reallocation responses to energy price changes. The role of
              plant entry and exit is examined in the determination of aggregate substitution
              and factor demand responses to energy price changes. Plant level technology
              parameters related to energy intensity and energy substitution are estimated. 
              Further, the joint distribution of these parameters in the population of
              manufacturing plants is characterized, its evolution over time tracked, the
              consequences for aggregate outcomes spelled out, and the efficiency costs of
              government policies that impede factor mobility quantified. The main focus of
              the analysis is a rich source of annual data on U.S. manufacturing plants from
              1972 to 1993.  The following sorts of questions are addressed:  1. How are
              plant level technology parameters (energy intensity and energy substitution
              elasticities) related to observable plant and industry characteristics?  2. To
              what extent is energy intensity embodied in the capital stock?  3. How has the
              plant level distribution of energy related technology parameters evolved over
              time? Were large changes in this distribution triggered by the oil price shocks
              of 1973 74, 1979 80 and 1985 86?  4. What contribution do plant entry and exit,
              between plant factor reallocation, within plant substitution responses and
              between industry output shifts make to the aggregate substitution and factor
              demand responses to energy price shocks?  5. Does the asymmetric aggregate
              response to oil price ups and downs reflect changes over time in the plant
              level distribution of energy related technology parameters?  6. How costly are
              the frictions in factor reallocation and technology adjustment that slow the
              economic response to energy price changes?  7. How large are the efficiency
              costs of government policies that impede plant exit and between plant
              reallocation responses to energy price changes?  8. How have spatial and
              industry differences in energy prices evolved since 1972?  9. How large were
              the efficiency costs of government policies that hampered the spatial arbitrage
              of energy prices?
