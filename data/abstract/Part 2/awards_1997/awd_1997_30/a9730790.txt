Abstract    :
              Funds are provided for a high-resolution multi-channel seismic survey of
              tectonically active area in northwestern Gulf of California.  The Gulf of
              california is one of the very few accessible areas where the transitional crust
              from continent to ocean can be studied in a region of oblique estension.  Most
              models of the region show a single, simple plate boundary, due to lack of
              deeper understanding.  Two end-member models are possible:  diffuse deformation
              in a broad active zone, and localized slip in two separate zones in the
              northern Gulf.  The key to discriminating between the two models lies in
              shallow Gulf of California.  The PIs will use the LDEO portable high resolution
              MCS system on a Mexican research vessel to obtain seismic reflection profiles
              of active tectonics, augmented with sonobuoy refraction profiles, to image the
              young faults, transform faults and the spreading center.  Modeling will
              quantify estimates of kinematics of the current plate motions and strain
              partitioning and lead to an understanding of the organization of the
              strike-slip and rift segments during transition from a continental to an
              oceanic system.
