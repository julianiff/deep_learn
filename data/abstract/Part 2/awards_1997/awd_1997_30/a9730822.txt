Abstract    :
                Committees, focus groups, and self managed work teams have become permanent
              fixtures in many organizations.  Reliance upon small groups in our society can
              be attributed in part to the pervasive belief that groups outperform
              individuals working alone.  The power extended to small, decision making groups
              is especially interesting when viewed in light of the research exploring group
              and team efficacy.  An extensive research literature supports the notion that
              group performance is frequently superior to individual performance, but recent
              findings suggest that groups can also increase the likelihood of error under
              certain circumstances.  In our program of research we have demonstrated that
              for some decision making tasks, incorrect minorities can sway correct
              majorities toward their preferred incorrect alternative (e.g., Tindale, Smith,
              Thomas, Filkins, Sheffey, 1996.)  In using the notion of a shared task
              representation, we have been able to predict when groups will perform better or
              worse than individuals working alone.  With the proposed research we will
              attempt to generalize our findings to new domains, define the origins of shared
              representations (i.e., culture, ideology) and how these representations operate
              in the various contexts in which groups make their decisions.  Our ultimate aim
              is to devise ways with which we can reduce the potential biasing effects of
              shared representations.
