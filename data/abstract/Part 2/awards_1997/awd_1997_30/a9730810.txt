Abstract    :
              9730810  Deering    This award to the University of Delaware will provide
              instrumentation for oceanographic research for use on the R/V Cape Henlopen, a
              research vessel operated by the University of Delaware as part of the
              University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.  Specific
              instruments to be acquired include water sampling bottles, sensors for
              measuring conductivity, temperature and depth, an attenuation and absorption
              meter for studies of sea water clarity, and an acoustic tracking system for
              monitoring depth and altitude of towed instrumentation.  The shared-use
              instrumentation supported here will assist marine scientists conduct
              NSF-supported research, particularly along the central Atlantic U.S. coast, in
              1998 and in future years.
