Abstract    :
                  Tools for the automatic remote acquisition of electron  micrographs will be
              developed. These will allow an  investigator to design, oversee and manage
              protocols for the  collection of large number of low dose electron micrographs.
               By the judicious combination of automated algorithms and  input from an
              experienced transmission electron microscope  operator, the proposed system of
              software tools will provide  a reliable method for collecting large numbers of
              high  quality electron micrographs with a minimum of manual labor.
