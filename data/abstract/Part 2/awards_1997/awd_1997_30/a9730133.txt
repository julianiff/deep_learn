Abstract    :
              9730133  Leahy    This project continues research begun under an earlier NSF
              grant on the macroeconomic implications of microeconomic frictions.  The
              dynamics of variables such as prices, employment, investment, and consumption
              represent the core of business cycle analysis.  In each case the smoothness of
              the aggregates masks the lumpy nature of the individual decisions that underlie
              them.  Much progress has been made in the past decade in understanding the
              relationship between individual and aggregate dynamics in these markets.  The
              main weakness is the lack of appreciation for equilibrium interactions in these
              settings.  This project addresses this omission.  The project consists of
              theoretical and empirical components.  The theoretical contribution consists of
              a method of constructing equilibria in a model with lumpy adjustment. 
              Equilibrium in these settings is complicated by the fact that the evolution of
              aggregates usually depends on the entire distribution of individual states. 
              The approach in this project is to make natural approximations to the
              distributional dynamics that retain the essential economic interactions while
              making the construction of equilibria tractable.  The empirical component is
              twofold.  The first task is to test the validity of the approximation.  The
              second task is to match the responses predicted by the model with those evident
              in the data.        ??
