Abstract    :
                       Calcium is a major dissolved species in seawater with a  residence time
              of about a million years. Its sources include rivers  and hydrothermal fluids,
              as well as small amounts via sediment  diagenesis. Ca is also tied to the
              carbon cycle via carbonate  precipitation in the oceans.  The PI proposes that
              detailed  measurements  of Ca isotopic variations in present day Ca sources 
              and sinks will shed light on the details of the oceanic Ca cycle.   Such data
              could then be used to interpret past changes in Ca  isotopic abundances, which
              would ultimately be related to climatic  variability and changes in global
              carbonate preservation and  temperature fluctuations.  The PI has demonstrated
              the ability to  make these unique measurements with the high precision
              necessary to  study Ca cycling, and he proposes to make new measurements in 
              existing samples of river water, hydrothermal fluids and marine  sediments and
              basalts.  These data, together with existing seawater  results, would provide a
              signifcant advance in our understanding of  the oceanic Ca cycle.
