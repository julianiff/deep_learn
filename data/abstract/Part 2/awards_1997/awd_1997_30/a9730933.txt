Abstract    :
                           The PIs are acknowledge leaders in the field of marine  sediment
              geochemistry and early digenesis.  With this proposal,  they plan to continue
              studies into the activities of bottom-  dwelling animals and how they can alter
              material transport and  digenetic reactions in surface sediments of the
              seafloor.  The  proposal is divided into three general research areas: a) the 
              irrigation and diffusion structure of solutes in the bioturbated  zone, b) the
              permeability of burrow linings and mucoid secretions,  and c) a
              multi-dimensional study of solute distributions.  The  proposed development of
              novel optical fluorosensors to measure  small scale variations in pore water
              chemistry is considered an  exciting and important new direction in studies of
              early digenesis  in marine sediments.
