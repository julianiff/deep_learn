Abstract    :
              9730222  Silver    This Americas Program award will support travel and related 
              expenses for two junior scientists and one graduate student  from US,  and four
              scientists from Nicaragua, to participate  in a  workshop on imaging and
              modeling the processes  occurring on the seismogenic zone of Costa Rica and 
              Nicaragua.  The workshop, organized by Dr. Eli Silver,  University of
              California, Santa Cruz,  in cooperation with  experts from Central America,
              will take place in San  Francisco in December, 1997.  Three previous
              international  workshops have recommended Costa Rica-Nicaragua  as one of  two
              highest priority regions for focused study  on the  mechanics  of the
              seismogenic zone in subduction  environments.  Following that recommendation,
              the workshop  was organized with the goal to better define the nature of  the
              problem, prioritize potential scientific studies, and  organize international
              teams to focus on different aspects  of the structure and behavior of the
              seismogenic zone.  There is great international interest in the seismogenic 
              zone and specifically in Central America, and this is a  first step in the
              preparation for deep riser drilling into  an active seismogenic zone.  ***
