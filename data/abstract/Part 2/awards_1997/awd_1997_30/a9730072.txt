Abstract    :
              9730072  Chen       It has been known for some time that orography plays a
              substantial role in the   production of heavy rainfall.  Orographic induced
              flash floods are a problem world-  wide.  In 1987, the U.S. in conjunction with
              Taiwan executed a research project  aimed at investigating the dynamics of
              heavy rainfall in mountainous terrain.  This  project, known as the Taiwan Area
              Mesoscale Experiment (TAMEX) produced a  wealth of data which is being used to
              understand the interactions between  environmental and orographic induced flows
              and their impact on precipitation  production.       In this study, the
              Principal Investigator will continue analysis of TAMEX data  in conjunction
              with modeling studies using an advanced mesoscale numerical model.    Specific
              objectives include to investigate 1) the structure and dynamics of the barrier 
              jet along the northwestern coast of Taiwan under the pre-frontal southwesterly 
              monsoon flow; 2) the role of mesoscale convergence generated by the deflected 
              airflow and environmental flow on the occurrences of localized heavy rainfall
              along  the northwestern coast.  In addition, with the dense surface and rain
              gauge networks  that are already in place, the Principal Investigator will
              study the diurnal evolution of  island-scale airflow and rainfall distributions
              over the island.       Successful completion of this research should lead to a
              better understanding of   critical dynamical structures of orographic induced
              flash floods and may lead to better  forecasts of such life-threatening events.
