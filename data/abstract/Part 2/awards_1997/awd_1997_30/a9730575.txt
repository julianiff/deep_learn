Abstract    :
              9730575  Glower  This project supports senior design projects by electrical 
              engineering students at North Dakota State University which  will aid the
              disabled.  These projects are on the design of  software and/or hardware on
              topics such as force  measurements for amputees, foot stabilization, a
              wheelchair  for the obese, a walker for children, an ultrasonic cane, a  seeing
              pad, a voice amplifier, and a voice spectrum display.  ***
