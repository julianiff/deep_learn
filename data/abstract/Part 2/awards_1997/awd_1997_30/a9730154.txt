Abstract    :
                Exchange is the essence of economics, and there is a large literature
              extolling the virtues of using money as a means of  exchange over other forms
              of exchange. Despite this, many trades do  not take the form of goods for cash,
              even in instances where money  could conceivably be used.  For instance,
              individuals provide favors  for one another, with the promise of a future
              reciprocated favor acting as implicit payment.  Similarly,  there is 
              considerable evidence from sociology and anthropology that there is  a marked
              reticence to use money in social relations. This proposal  considers why many
              trades remain non-monetized even in modern monetized economies.  We consider
              three separate aspects of  non-monetary trade in this proposal, namely, (i) the
              role of money  in reciprocal exchange, (ii) the use of money in social
              situations,  and (iii) the use of commercial barter exchanges. In each of these
               settings, we illustrate novel reasons why agents may prefer to avoid  using
              fiat money despite its usual advantages in achieving a double  coincidence of
              wants, and may instead employ non-monetary exchange.  By addressing the
              importance of non-monetary exchange for  reciprocity, payment-in-kind, and
              barter markets, we develop a richer understanding of how agents trade, the most
              basic  ingredient of economics.
