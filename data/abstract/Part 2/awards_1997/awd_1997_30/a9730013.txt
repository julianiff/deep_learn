Abstract    :
              9730013  Flower    This grant provides partial support of the costs of
              relocating  and upgrading a functioning electron microprobe (EMP) from 
              Northwestern University (NWU) to the University of Illinois at  Chicago (UIC). 
              A JEOL 733 that was originally purchased in 1985  for ca. $415,000 with
              matching funds from NSF in the amount of  $250,000 will be housed in a new
              centralized research  instrumentation facility at UIC where trained and
              experienced  microscopy technicians and complementary microscopy facilities 
              (i.e. TEM, SEM) already exist.  A large number of PI's will make  use of this
              probe for research spanning the fields of petrology,  geochemistry, mineralogy
              and material science including analyses  of melt inclusions in oceanic basalts,
              thermobarometric studies  of mantle xenoliths based on high-resolution EMP
              data,  phyllosilicate mineralogy, high-temperature crystallography and 
              analyses of impurities in ceramics and semiconductors.  ***
