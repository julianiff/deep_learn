Abstract    :
                    9730627    Hutchinson    The Children Designing and Engineering (CD&E)
              Project is developing twelve "TechEdge Topics," instructional units for grades
              K-5. The units reflect apply a design and technology approach to real-world
              activities. The units are intended to increase the scientific and technological
              literacy, capability, and responsibility of all students.     The "TechEdge
              Topics" for grades K-2 and 3-5 are based upon subject matter that is both
              interesting to young learners and relevant to business and industrial settings
              in such areas as transportation, food, safety and security, health, utilities,
              and industries. Each unit for grades K-2 is comprised of a "Guided Portfolio,"
              a "Big Book, and a "Teacher's Guide." Units developed for grades 3-5 each
              include a "Guided Portfolio," a "Technology Education Topic Book," and a
              "Teacher's Guide."     The project taps the potential of business, industry,
              and engineering communities to assist curriculum developers and educators in
              developing and disseminating integrated science, mathematics, and technology
              materials. TIES Magazine and the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce will lead in
              distribution of the materials after field-testing and revision.
