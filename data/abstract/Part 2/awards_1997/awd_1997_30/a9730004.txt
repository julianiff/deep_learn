Abstract    :
              9730004  Oechel  This research will elucidate the short- and long-term responses
              of arctic tundra ecosystems to climate change and associated changes in soils
              water content and active layer depth. These objectives will be accomplished by
              a combination of field observations, manipulative experiments, and modeling.
              Northern latitude temperature records and permafrost temperature profiles
              indicate that average annual temperature has increased by 2-4 C over the last
              30 years. Associated with this warming has been an increase in growing season
              length, a decrease in surface soil water content, and a decrease in the extent
              and distribution in snow and ice cover. These physical changes have altered
              arctic ecosystem function, which could result in a significant positive or
              negative feedback to global atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Much of the net CO2
              flux data is from growing season measurements of terrestrial surfaces, however,
              aquatic systems are known to be net sources of CO2, and substantial cold season
              CO2 losses have recently been demonstrated. This project will measure net CO2
              exchange over annual cycles using eddy covariance methodology, which allows
              direct measurement of hectare-scale exchanges in CO2, H2O vapor, and energy.
              These measurements will be conducted over the annual cycle to determine both
              the warm- and cold-season contribution to annual net CO2 exchange in arctic
              tundra ecosystems. In addition, in-situ manipulative experiments will allow
              determination of short- and long-term responses of whole ecosystem net CO2
              exchange and the physiological components that drive net CO2 flux to
              alterations in soil temperature and water table depth. These studies will help
              elucidate important mechanisms involved with plant- and whole-ecosystem
              responses to alterations in climate, as well as long-term trajectories of
              potential compensatory responses. Observations to date indicate that the
              long-term response of arctic ecosystems to climate change may be quite
              different than initial short-term response s.
