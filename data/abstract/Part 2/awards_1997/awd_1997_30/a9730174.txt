Abstract    :
              9730174  Lapp    The LASER project disseminates and implements high-quality,
              NSF-supported K-8 science curriculum materials in more than 300 school
              districts.  These districts serve some 1,000,000 K-8 students across the
              country.  To accomplish this, LASER has formed partnerships with:  (1) eight
              regional sites, to be located in Alabama, California, New Jersey, Oklahoma,
              Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Washington.  Each site contains
              a coalition of institutions that includes academic institutions, corporations,
              state departments of education, SIs, and museums, and (2) six publishers.  The
              National Science Resources Center (NSRC) provides the regional sites with
              expertise and materials around building awareness, strategic planning, criteria
              for materials selection, professional development, science materials support,
              assessment, and administrative and community support.
