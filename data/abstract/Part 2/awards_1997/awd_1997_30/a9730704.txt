Abstract    :
                Risk analysis is a formal method to assess the probabilities and consequences
              of hazards to human health and the environment.  The assessment of
              probabilities and consequences is complicated, when little data exist, when
              models are inadequate, and when experts disagree.  In these situations, risk
              analysts increasingly use formal processes for eliciting probabilities from
              groups of experts.  The intention is to incorporate a broad spectrum of
              scientific opinions and to acknowledge and incorporate scientific uncertainties
              as well as scientific disagreements.  This project will study how to best
              involve scientific experts with different approaches and different opinions in
              this process.  The study will compare several methods of eliciting
              probabilities and consequences of risks from groups of experts, including
              eliciting them separately versus in groups and allowing disagreements versus
              forcing consensus.  The study will be conducted by performing experiments both
              with engineering students and with experts in the field.  The results should
              contribute substantially to improve the science and practice of risk
              assessment.
