Abstract    :
              This joint work between Prof. Mani Soma (U. of Washington)  and Jacob Abraham
              (U. of Texas). The research is on fault  models, test generation, and design
              verification for analog  and mixed-signal Integrated circuits. A top-down
              approach to  test and verification in mixed-signal design is being  pursued.
              Research topics include the following. Develop  algorithms for abstracting a
              circuit from the description of  a mixed-signal circuit. Define testability
              figures of merit  for major analog blocks such as converters, filters, etc., 
              and develop methods to compute them. Investigate algorithms  to evaluate
              testability of mixed-signal design using high  level design information. For
              design verification, the group  is finding accurate transformation algorithms
              to map analog  blocks to discretized form. Also, abstractions to reduce  state
              space complexity during verification are being  explored. The algorithms and
              methods are being built into  testability and test tools.
