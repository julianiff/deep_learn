Abstract    :
              9730958  Diller  This grant provides travel support for US participants in an 
              international symposium on heat and mass transfer in  biological tissues.  This
              conference will provide a forum to  bring together scientists and engineers
              from around the  world involved in bioheat and mass transfer research, for an 
              in-depth discussion and exchange of the state-of-the-art of  related theory,
              experiments, and applications.  The topic of  heat and mass transport in
              biological systems is an area of  burgeoning interest from both the scientific
              and  applications perspectives.  Transport phenomena govern many  processes in
              both biotechnology and bioengineering.  The  program includes technical
              sessions in a broad array of  topics which includes: (1) heat and mass
              transport in tissue  engineering processes, (2) energy based surgical
              modalities  including; microwave, ultrasound, radio frequency, laser and 
              cryosurgery, (3) thermally coupled phenomena in living  systems including;
              laser tissue optics, hyperthermia cancer  therapy, burn injury processes, and
              tissue and organ  cryopreservation, (4) mass transport limited function in the 
              design and operation of artificial organs, (5) measurement  and modeling of the
              thermal influence of blood perfusion in  living tissues; thermal methods to
              measure blood perfusion,  (6) microscale and molecular heat and mass transport 
              phenomena in biological systems, (7) design for commercial  scale tissue
              processing protocols, and (8) temperature-  triggered drug delivery in living
              tissues.  Participation in  this conference will be international and will
              include  biomedical engineers, mechanical engineers, chemical  engineers,
              biochemical engineers, medical scientists,  biologists, chemists, and
              physicists.  ***
