Abstract    :
              Dr. Philip P. Power, Chemistry Department, University of California -   Davis,
              is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic   Chemistry
              Program, to study homo- and heteronuclear multiple bonding   involving heavier
              group 13 and 14 elements and for the preparation of low   valent group 2
              complexes that contain metal-metal bonds. The   ortho-terphenyl and related
              ligands will be utilized to stabilize group   13 and 14 elements in low
              coordinate environments which are amenable to   the formation of multiple
              bonds. The ability of the heavier members of   these two series to multiply
              bond with one another and with other   heteroatoms will be explored by a range
              of physical techniques including   x-ray diffraction, multinuclear and dynamic
              nmr, uv-visible, infrared,   and epr spectroscopies. The terphenyl ligands will
              be similarly employed   with the group 2 metals to construct species capable of
              forming the first   metal-metal bonded complexes of these elements.   The
              question of the nature of an element's chemical bonds is one of the   most
              basic in chemistry. This project will probe the ability of aluminum,   gallium,
              indium, germanium, and tin to form double or triple bonds. In   general these
              elements prefer single bonds, but in some cases can be   induced to participate
              in multiple bonding. In addition, the first direct   beryllium-beryllium and
              related magnesium-magnesium species will be   sought. The results of the study
              will define the sorts of compounds these   elements can form and will
              contribute to the design of, e.g., catalysts   or advanced materials that are
              based on them.                                                      ¥©Á ?Á¢?À>
