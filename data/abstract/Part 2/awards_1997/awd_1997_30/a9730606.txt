Abstract    :
              9730606  Thier    The thirteen SEPUP (Science Education for Public Understanding
              Project) modules, previously developed, are revised to update the science
              issues and evidence in the modules, to align them more closely to the science
              standards and to develop an authentic assessment system for them.  The
              assessment system is based on that used in SEPUP developed course, Issues,
              Evidence and You.  At the request of teachers, an additional module on energy
              is developed with partial funding from EPRI.  The SEPUP (formerly CEPUP)
              modules have been used nationwide to change the way science is taught and
              learned primarily in the middle schools.  The target of the revised and
              enhanced modules is grades 7 - 9.  A Guide to SEPUP Modules and the Science
              Standards correlates each module to the Standards and Benchmarks and recommends
              groupings of modules to address different content areas at different grades.  A
              video on Issue Oriented Science Using SEPUP illustrates for teachers how the
              modules address standards for content, assessment and teaching and how they can
              provide access for students with different learning styles.  Teachers are
              involved with the revision and testing.  The modules contain suggestions for
              including educational technology.  LAB-AIDS continues to distribute the printed
              materials and kits.
