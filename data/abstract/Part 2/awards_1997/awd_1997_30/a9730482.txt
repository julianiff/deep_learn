Abstract    :
              This is a planning grant to assist in the preparation of multidisciplinary
              research on information technology, culture and social institutions.  The aim
              of the project is to determine the social context and impacts of communications
              and spatial information technologies on the formation, strategies and
              effectiveness of a global coalition of non-governmental and grass-roots
              organizations resisting the expansion of the shrimp farming industry in
              tropical coastal zones of the developing world. A parallel examination will be
              done of the industry's efforts to counter the activities of the global
              resistance network.  The planning conference will bring together social and
              natural scientists involved in research on information technologies, society,
              acquaculture, and representatives of activist NGOs.  The lead researcher will
              conduct pilot research in Latin America on shrimp acquaculture to complement
              research in Asia.  The workshop, to be held at the University of California,
              Santa Barbara, will allow project collaborators and investigators to design a
              program of research on how new information technologies affect the formation
              and maintenance of resistance as well as industry networks in this one
              case-study industry.  The resulting research should be valuable in advancing
              our understanding of how global coalitions of interest groups use new
              technology to influence policy and social practice.
