Abstract    :
              The plasma membrane regulates many essential cellular  processes such as active
              transport of molecules, enzymatic  reactions, and signal transduction.  In
              order to understand  these fundamental processes, it is necessary to determine 
              the structure of and the mechanisms at work in the plasma  membrane.  In recent
              years, the structure of the plasma  membrane has been found to be considerably
              heterogeneous on  a nanometer scale.  The tiny scale of these dynamic membrane 
              features has presented a major challenge to microscopists.  A new
              super-resolution scanned probe optical microscope  based on
              microelectromechanical systems will be constructed.  Specifically, the
              objectives are to manufacture,  characterize and optimize
              microelectromechanical sample  mounts, to produce a scanning microscope using
              this  technology and to apply this technology to the study of  membrane
              structure and function.  The new instrument will  have the potential to address
              questions concerning the  proximity of cell surface receptors, the extent of
              co-  aggregation of lipid components, and the function of plasma  membrane
              domains on a resolution scale of tens of  nanometers.
