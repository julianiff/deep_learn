Abstract    :
              9730155  Abrevaya    This project investigates a specific branch of the
              semiparametric econometrics literature known as rank estimators.  The project
              focuses on the development of new rank estimators for various econometric
              models and consideration of their asymptotic theory.  This research should be
              of interest to both theoretical and applied researchers in statistics and
              economics.  The estimators are simple to compute and avoid the well-known
              problem of bandwidth selection.     More specifically, existing U-statistic
              asymptotic theory will be applied and extended, when necessary, in order to
              derive asymptotic formulas for the following: rank estimators for the censored
              and truncated regression models; new estimators of the transformation model
              based on a fourth-order U-process; a new estimator for duration models that
              estimates the coefficients of a proportional hazards model with unobserved
              heterogeneity; and an estimator for the semiparametric binary choice models
              with symmetric errors.  Monte Carlo simulations will be used in order to
              examine the performance of the new estimators relative to existing estimators. 
              An exhaustive library of routines for the rank estimators in the literature
              will be developed and made available over the Internet so that practitioners
              will be able to use the estimation techniques.      ??
