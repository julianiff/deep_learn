Abstract    :
                    This project will use data and modeling to develop a  quantified
              description of the relationship between the  diagenesis of redox-sensitive
              trace metals (Fe, Mn, Mo, V,  U, Re, Cd) and sediment oxidation state. 
              Sediment solid-  phase and pore-water data will be generated for a suite of 
              sediment cores from the Chile margin that experience a range  of oxidation
              states, and the data will be used to assess a  diagenetic model.  The model
              will then be applied to a  global database of bottom-water oxygen, organic
              carbon flux  and sedimentation rate to determine authigenic fluxes of the 
              metals.  Key goals are (1) to develop a quantitative  capability to predict
              bottom-water oxygen levels and organic  carbon flux from sediment metal data
              and (2) to derive  estimates of global metal fluxes between sediments and 
              bottom waters in the present and recent geologic past.  ***
