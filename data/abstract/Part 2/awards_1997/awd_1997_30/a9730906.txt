              Biometric Conference - Cape Town

Abstract: 


The International Biometric
              Conference is the biennial meeting of the
International Biometric Society, a
              Society dedicated to the "advancement
of biological science through the
              development of quantitative theories and
the application, development and
              dissemination of effective mathematical
and statistical techniques". Members
              and conference participants are
concerned with the cross-disciplinary and
              interdisciplinary interface of
the theoretical and application oriented
              real-world problems. This
proposal requests partial support for ten U.S.-based
              individuals from
academic and nonprofit institutions to participate in the
              International
Biometric Conference to be held in Cape Town, South Africa, on
              December
13-18,1998.  About one third of those supported will be those with an
              
official capacity and two-thirds will be new researchers especially
              those
traditionally underrepresented groups such as women and minorities.
