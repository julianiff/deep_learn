Abstract    :
                9730152  MOUDGIL    This award provides funding for an Engineering Research
              Centers (ERC) Program/Centers for Research Excellence in Science and Technology
              (CREST) Program Partnership between the Engineering Research Center for
              Particle Science and Technology at the University of Florida and the CREST
              Center for Advanced Materials and Smart Structures at NC A&T State University. 
              This partnership will also involve collaboration with North Carolina State
              University and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  The vision and goal of this
              partnership are to develop novel particulate synthesis and processing
              techniques for cutting tools materials so that their mechanical properties can
              be suitably enhanced.  Specifically, new methods will be explored which can
              result in the fabrication of cutting tools possessing high strength, high
              toughness and are capable of operating in high-speed machining environments. 
              This joint effort enhances and integrates the expertise of the key research
              personnel in the areas of synthesis of engineered particulates, microstructural
              and mechanical property characterization, nanoparticle science and technology,
              and processing of intermetallic materials.
