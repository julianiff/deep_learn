Abstract    :
              OCE-9730639  Barth    The project is to finish the analysis of the data
              collected  during the Coastal Jet Separation experiment and to  definitively
              evaluate dynamical theories for the separation  from the coast of an
              along-shore upwelling jet.  Analysis  tasks include construction and
              interpretation of sections  and maps of potential vorticity, spiciness and ADCP
              stream-  function.  Dynamical insights will be gained by applying  steady,
              layered, potential vorticity conserving models, but  extensions to
              time-dependent model will be pursued as  needed.
