Abstract    :
              Wallace  Visualization is becoming an increasingly important part of modeling as
              a result of the integration of computer graphics into modeling software.  In
              addition, technological advances are making it possible for rapidly growing
              numbers of the general population to become modelers, for example, by using
              spreadsheet software.  The proposed research is based upon our previous
              experimental work, our theory of the role of visualization in modeling, and the
              literature on visualization and cognitive science.  We have selected as the
              target of our visualization a component that is central to the modeling process
              and to our understanding of it: the heuristics sued in constructing models.  In
              order to assess our theory, we intend to build visualization systems for two
              different types of modeling tasks, one in a physical domain, and the other in
              an abstract domain.  The first experiment will be conducted in the physical
              domain of groundwater modeling with the Where Next heuristics visualization
              system.  The second experiment will be conducted in the physical abstract
              domain of machine learning as applied to consumer credit.  As part of our
              experimentation, we will construct a `modeler's assistant` for each of the
              problem domains.  The contributions of the research are to better understand
              the process of modeling and the role of visualization in this process, and to
              integrate visualization techniques into the process of modeling in order to
              capitalize upon advances in computer graphics technology.
