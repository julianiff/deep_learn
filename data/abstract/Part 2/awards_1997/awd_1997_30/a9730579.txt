Abstract    :
              9730579    Brown    The project will investigate two topics relating to the 
              kinematics of ocean surface gravity waves.  For the study of  wave scattering
              by randomly rough topography, a diffusivity  will be derived within a transport
              equation framework.  For  the study of extreme wave events, an integral
              representation  of transient surface gravity wavefields will be derived,  using
              Maslov integral formalism.
