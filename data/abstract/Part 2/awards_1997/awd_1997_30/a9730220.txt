Abstract    :
                Inquiry into the dynamics of persuasion is axiomatic to political science,
              psychology, and communication studies.  This dissertation project argues that
              persuasion is not so much about convincing others to change their minds as much
              as it is about framing the terms of the debate - - getting people to think
              about issues in desired terms (e.g. defining the debate over abortion in terms
              of women's rights rather than `life`).  Visceral appeals enhance prospects for
              persuasion in that they distract the message receiver from the propagandist's
              manipulation.  Thus, the most persuasive rhetoric should incorporate elements
              of both cerebral, `hard` arguments and emotionally laden `easy` arguments. 
              This hypothesis is tested by analyzing the relationship between talk radio
              listening and public opinion/political behavior.  Content analysis and surveys
              are used to discern the extent to which talk radio hosts activate particular
              mental maps to induce listeners to resist governmental activism, oppose
              Democratic candidates, and participate in various political activities.  Survey
              based results indicate that negative, humor-laden messages that `prime` some
              values over others (e.g. personal responsibility over philanthropy), succeed at
              moving opinions and engendering participation.   The dissertation executes a
              careful experimental design and promises to enhance substantially our
              understanding of the topic.
