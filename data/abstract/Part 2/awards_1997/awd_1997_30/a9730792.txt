Abstract    :
              Schmidt, Gary  AST  97-30792    Dr. Schmidt will carry out a program of research
              to investigate the effects of magnetic fields on accretion processes in binary
              systems and on compact stars.  He will explore accretion processes in extremely
              high magnetic fields by using both observational and theoretical approaches,
              such as magnetohydrodynamics calculations of regions near the inner Lagrange
              point to study the timescales for mass transfer episodes, Doppler tomography to
              map the path of the accretion stream, and detailed models of the optical
              spectra to evaluate magnetic field strength and morphology.  He will also
              search for much weaker fields on a sample of single white dwarfs to better
              understand the incidence of magnetism on white dwarfs, and by extension also on
              main-sequence stars of solar-mass range, as well as provide measurements of
              field strength for reference in asteroseismological studies.  Finally, he will
              perform high speed photometry and spectrophotometry of cataclysmic variables
              for reverberation mapping of the accretion disks and surrounding gas in compact
              neutron star and black-hole X-ray binaries. These projects take advantage of
              polarimetric equipment on the Steward Observatory 2.3-meter and the converted
              6.5-meter Multiple Mirror Telescope.  ***
