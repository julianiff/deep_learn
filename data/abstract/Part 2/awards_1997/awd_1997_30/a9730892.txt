Abstract    :
                                        06/30/98    This award supports the development of new
              methodology to  enhance the NMR imaging and spectroscopy performance of the  7T
              horizontal bore spectrometer at Yale Magnetic Resonance  Center for
              quantitative blood-oxygenation level dependent  (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI)
              image-contrast.  The main  significance of this project is that it will provide
              the  fundamental basis for converting the BOLD images into  neuronal activity
              maps.  Autoradiography studies on animals  and PET studies on humans have
              provided the standards for  quantitative measurements of changes in cerebral
              activity by  detecting alterations in cerebral perfusion and metabolism  at
              high spatial resolution.  However, the major  disadvantages of these techniques
              are that both  methodologies require radioactive tracers and temporal 
              alterations in neuronal activity cannot be monitored.  The  BOLD fMRI method,
              in contrast, does not require exogenous  tracers and provides a dynamic measure
              of brain activity.  The proposed project will allow the BOLD signal to be 
              quantitatively related to cerebral metabolism and perfusion,  providing a
              quantitative MRI method of probing the  physiological parameters that are
              coupled to cerebral  activity.  A non-invasive and non-radioactive method for 
              quantitatively mapping alterations in neuronal activity in  the mammalian brain
              would be a very important tool in  neuroscience.  Applications would include
              brain mapping of  sensory and cognitive functions, assessment of altered 
              cerebral activity in the diseased or injured brain, and long-  term
              investigations of brain development and functional  plasticity.
