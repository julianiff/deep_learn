Abstract    :
              Funds are being provided to study the seismicity of an active continental
              breakup in the western Woodlark Basin, offshor Papua New Guinea.  Low-angle
              normal detachment is a fundamental process in passive margin evolution but
              conflicts with basic Andersonian tenet of frictional slip on faults.  24 to 35
              degree low-angle slip planes are know in the low-angle seismicity.  A
              marine-land passive seismic experiment will be undertaken, focused on a region
              of high-localized strain.  Seafloor instruments will be arrayed to record
              microseismicity and PASSCAL instruments will be deployed on surrounding islands
              to record regional seismicity.  ODP drilling will provide additional
              constraints on faulting.
