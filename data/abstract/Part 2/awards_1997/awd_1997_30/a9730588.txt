Abstract    :
              9730588  Stephen  This award will support the U.S. participation in a joint
              seismic  experiment with scientists from Germany. The objective of the  project
              is to acquire seismic reflection and refraction data from  the Ninety-East
              Ridge in the Indian Ocean. The U.S. scientific  component will be responsible
              for measurements to be recorded in a  borehole to be drilled as part of the
              Ocean Drilling Program. The  seismic sources for this experiment will be
              deployed from a German  vessel which will rendezvous with the drillship, JOIDES
              Resolution,  and will be undertaking a regional study of the crustal structure 
              of the ridge. Specific scientific questions being addressed include  crustal
              anisotropy and heterogeneity, and the detailed velocity  structure surrounding
              the drill site which will be the location of  a permanent seismic station to be
              installed by French scientists.  ***
