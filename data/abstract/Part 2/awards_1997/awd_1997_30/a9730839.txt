Abstract    :
                9730839  Tombrello    This project utilizes a combined
              modeling-simulation/experiment  approach to advance understanding of
              cluster-atom trajectories  and track morphologies in solids from MeV cluster
              ions. Ion  implantation into semiconductors for doping and other processing 
              continues in prominence, and with multiple ion and cluster source  availability
              basic understanding of the fundamental processes  involved can provide future
              guidance for utilization in  electronic/photonic materials processing. The
              overall objective  of the project is to employ computer simulations to extract
              basic  knowledge from laboratory experiments.  Since the physics of the 
              interaction between the ion-ion cores of the cluster atoms is not  known for
              clusters traveling in solids, the simulations include  this needed information
              only as a parameter.  By comparing the  results with various experiments,
              increased understanding of  these interactions can then be gained.  %%%  The
              project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of  materials science
              having high potential technological relevance  in semiconductor processing. 
              The research will contribute basic  materials science knowledge at a
              fundamental level to important  aspects of electronic/photonic device and
              circuit fabrication. An  important feature of the program is the integration of
              research  and education through the training of students in a fundamentally 
              and technologically significant area.  ***
