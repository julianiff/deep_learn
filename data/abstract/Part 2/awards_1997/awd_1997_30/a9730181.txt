Abstract    :
                This grant supports the continuation of several research projects. One project
              studies new issues in monopoly and oligopoly pricing that arise as firms come
              to have more information about the purchasing habits of consumers. Previous
              work by the PI studied the use of `upgrade discounts` by monopoly sellers of
              software, and `buybacks` of old goods by sellers who want to prop up the price
              of a new Improved version. The proposed work would study attempts by firms to
              `poach` the current customers of their competitors by offering them special
              discounts or other inducements to switch. The project will analyze equilibrium
              poaching both with short term contracts and when long term contracts are
              practical; one question will be the overall impact of this sort of price
              discrimination on consumer welfare.  A second project has developed equilibrium
              concepts for extensive form games, based on the idea that players may
              persistently make mistaken forecasts of how opponents would respond to actions
              that have never been tried. Previous work studied the case where players have
              no information about their opponents' payoff functions, and so are unable to
              make deductions about how the opponents would respond to untried actions. The
              proposed work will study the way that prior information about opponents'
              payoffs can restrict the set of equilibrium outcomes. A key issue in this
              development is what sort of prior information about payoffs should be
              considered.
