Abstract    :
              9730010  Minschwaner     This project will extend the twenty-year record of the
              hydroxyl radical (OH) column abundances from Fritz Peak, CO. The hydroxyl
              radical is one of the most chemically active constituents in the Earth's
              atmosphere, playing a direct role in the chemical budget of stratospheric ozone
              and mediating the transformation between reactive and stable compounds of
              chlorine and nitrogen.    These are ground-based measurements of the resonant
              absorption of sunlight at 308 nm using a custom designed, high
              resolution-luminosity product spectrometer. Additional observations will be
              made using a second instrument located at the New Mexico Institute for Mining
              and Technology, with emphasis on new instrumentation and analysis procedures.
              Efforts will be made to improve the signal to noise ratio in auxiliary
              measurements of OH which involve the Doppler shift in solar limb spectra. A
              comprehensive analysis will be undertaken of the stray light characteristics of
              the spectrometers, including comparisons to other instruments, such as the
              MAHRSI instrument on the Space Shuttle and the FTUV measurements at JPL.
              Analysis work will be continued through the development of a 1-D version of the
              NCAR ROSE model and testing of various mesospheric mechanisms. Current
              photochemical models fail to reproduce the observed geographic, diurnal,
              seasonal, and secular changes observed in the OH column abundances.
