Abstract    :
              This award is made by the Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry   Division
              and the Solid State Chemistry Program in the Division of   Materials Research
              to the University of Utah in support of the research   of Joel S. Miller. The
              research will explore structure- function   relationships in
              metalloporphyrin/tetracyanoethylene(TCNE)-based magnetic   materials with the
              goal of discovering new organic based magnets with   high critical
              temperatures, magnetic saturation moments and ambient   stability. Research
              thrusts which will be emphasized are the role of   spins on the periphery of
              the porphyrin ligand, effect of covalent   bonding and supramolecular hydrogen
              bonding, synthesis of new magnets   based on  anion-radical acceptors other
              than TCNE,  synthesis of   porphyrin complexes with other high spin metal ions,
              photomagnetic   effects in manganese porphyrin/TCNE complexes, and the pressure
                dependence of ferromagnetism on pressure.  Collaborative physical  
              measurements and computational studies will supplement the synthetic   aspects
              of the research.  Organic based magnets are tractable and offer the synthetic
              diversity   necessary to design a variety of magnetic materials with
              predictable and   controllable properties. This research will help define  
              structure-performance relationships   for a new generation of magnets with
              potential applications in electronic   and photonic devices.
