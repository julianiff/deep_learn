Abstract    :
              It is well known that it is highly desirable to operate  scanning electron
              microscopes at low voltages such as 1 kV.  This is due to the fact that at low
              voltages penetration of  the incident electrons into the specimen is small and
              any  specimen damage is restricted to the surface layer. However,  the use of
              low voltages reduces the available resolution due  to chromatic aberration
              effects. The only practical way to  avoid this problem is to use lenses of very
              short focal  length, but with a lens of conventional design this is not 
              feasible. This proposal will support continuing development  of a prototype
              microscope in which the lens of new design has  been placed below the specimen.
              This makes lenses of very  short focal lengths feasible. Theoretically this
              development  should improve the resolving power of the microscope two, or  even
              three, times over any instrument that is currently  available. The funds
              requested in this proposal will be used  both to refine the prototype
              microscope and demonstrate its  usefulness using well-characterized biological
              specimens.
