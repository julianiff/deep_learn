Abstract    :
              9730648  McInerney    The Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS), in
              collaboration with the Expert-center for Taxonomic Identification (ETI),
              Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and Ward's Natural Science Establishment, Inc.
              Rochester, New York, are developing and publishing an interactive CD-ROM on
              taxonomy, systematics, and biodiversity for use in high school biology courses.
               Ten developed activities are interactive and laboratory-based investigations
              that allow students to use a variety of data (for example, morphological,
              behavioral, and molecular) to construct and analyze classifications of groups
              of organisms both extant and extinct.  The approach is one of viewing
              classification systems as active hypotheses that represent current
              understandings and relatedness of life on earth.  Students are able to access
              the database that is central to the CD-ROM and are directed to other, public
              databases that are related to systematics and biodiversity.
