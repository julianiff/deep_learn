Abstract    :
              9730617  Mao    This award provides funding for the operation, maintenance, and 
              further development of an X-ray diffraction facility dedicated for 
              ultra-high-pressure diamond anvil cell experimentation at the  National
              Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) at the Brookhaven National  Laboratory. The
              facility makes use of the unique characteristics of  the brilliant X-radiation
              produced by the wiggler magnet at the  NSLS beamline X17C to characterize the
              physical and chemical  properties of materials subjected to pressure (up to
              four million  atmospheres) held between the jaws of a diamond anvil cell.  ***
