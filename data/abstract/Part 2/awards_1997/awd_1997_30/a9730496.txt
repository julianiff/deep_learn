Abstract    :
              Abstract    Davis    The PI will carry out a set of modeling investigations of
              accretionary wedges and how they grow.  How deformation is distributed in a
              forearc with oblique convergence has been investigated, theoretically and
              experimentally, by several workers for a variety of rheologies and boundary
              conditions.  The PI will investigate three related areas of accretionary prisms
              and their growth.  1) Non-critical wedges that grow at a non-critical taper; 2)
              Coupled fluid-mechanical modeling to produce a truly coupled fluid mechanical
              models for the development of deformation and excess pore pressure in wedges;
              and 3) Forearc slivers and oblique subduction zones.
