Abstract    :
              Contemporary public discussion of the sciences oscillates between uncritical
              adulation and sweeping rejection.  Neither of these attitudes is appropriate
              for societies such as ours, which are profoundly affected by the sciences'
              intellectual development and technological achievements.  Scholars in the
              social and cultural studies of science, the latest to mediate between science
              and society, have argued that the sciences are permeated and significantly
              shaped by social and cultural interests.  They further argue that philosophical
              conceptions of reasoning and observation have no bearing on understanding
              scientific practice.  Such arguments leave nonscientists unable to
              differentiate between competent and incompetent, credible and disputable,
              science.  The PI rejects the dichotomy between the social and the cognitive
              that underlies both social constructivists and their philosophical opponents. 
              Instead, she develops an analysis of scientific inquiry that both acknowledges
              the social dimensions of inquiry and keeps room for the normative and
              prescriptive concerns that have been the traditional preoccupation of
              philosophers.  Her work will proceed through a detailed analysis of scientific
              papers in two areas of research, leading to a book that will examine the
              consequences of controversy and disunity in science for our conception of the
              nature of scientific inquiry.
