Abstract    :
              This award to the University of Illinois at Chicago, (UIC) entitled"EuroLink: 
              High Performance International Internet Services between Research and Education
              Institutions in the United States and Europe/Israel" provides support for a
              High Performance International Internet Services connection between the
              advanced networks of the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway
              and Sweden), France, Netherlands, Israel and NSF's very high-performance
              Backbone Network Services (vBNS).  The overall consortium (European networks
              plus UIC) is called EuroLink.  EuroLink proposed to provide four links, each
              nominally at 45 Mbps, between the European NRNs and the vBNS via the NSF-funded
              international connection point for high-performance networks, STAR TAP , in
              Chicago.  It is anticipated that other European countries may join EuroLink in
              the future.  Round-the-clock operational support will be provided under
              subcontract to the Indiana University Network Operations Center (NOC).  The
              Indiana NOC also serves under a companion HPIIS award to TransPAC for
              Asia-Pacific collaborations, and it also provides operational support to the
              Internet2/Abilene network.
