Abstract    :
              9730655  Jovanovic    The objective of this project is to construct the first
              models in which the following features arise:  (a) Growth and cycles are
              endogenous,  (b) They are driven by innovation,  (c) The number of inventions
              is large,  (d) There are no "big" inventions, and  (e) Growth and its variance
              can be negatively correlated.  These new models integrate the business-cycle
              half of macroeconomics with the growth theory half.  They provide a rigorous
              way of studying the dynamics of business cycles and economic growth that is
              more consistent with the U.S. experience.  This project should provide valuable
              new insights into the growth process and its variability.          ??
