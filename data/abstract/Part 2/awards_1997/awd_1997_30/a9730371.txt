Abstract    :
                  Istopic fractionation of boron, carbon and oxygen will be evaluated  under
              controlled conditions.  Accurate equilibrium fractionation  factors from these
              inorganic calcification experiments will provide  a common yardstick against
              which to evaluate the potential  magnitude of biogenic disequilibrium
              calcification.  Simutaneous  experimental analysis of 8 11 B, 8 13 C, and 8 18
              O fractionation  during inorganic calcificaiton is attractive because a recent 
              theory of biogenic calcification proposes correlated kinetic  dissequilibria in
              8 13 C and 8 18 O as a function of calcification  rate.  According to this
              model, isotopic disequilibrium arises from  rate dependent inorganic hydration
              and hydroxylation reactions  during calcification.  Because calcification rate
              is controlled to  some extent by solute pH at the site of calcification, 8 11 B
               fractionation, which is pH sensitive, should be correlated with   8 13 C, and
              8 18 O kinetic disequilibrium.  A pH controlled,  continuously stirred tank
              reactor (CSTR) will be used to evaluate  the effects of temperature and
              precipitaiton rate (solute  chemistry) on the isotopic composition of seeded
              inorganic calcite  precipitation.  Carefully selected reagent grade calcite
              seed  material with XRD confirmed mineralogy and known isotopic  composition
              will be employed during these experiments to control  for fractionation effects
              due to minerological differences (e.g.  aragonite vs. calcite).
