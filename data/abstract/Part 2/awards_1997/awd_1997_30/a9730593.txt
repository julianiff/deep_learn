Abstract    :
              The PI will make a series of heat flow measurements during a 30-day cruise in
              the sediments of the continental basement areas of the newly rifting Woodlark
              Basin to examine the evolution of extension from rift to conjugate margin
              stage.  Thermal effects have not yet dissipated in this young margin.  Heat
              flow values will provide constraints on temperature-dependent mechanical
              properties of the lithosphere during extension.  Environmental and hydrothermal
              effects on the heat flow regime are considered to be small and swath
              bathymetry, sidescan imagery and gravity and magnetics data already exist.
