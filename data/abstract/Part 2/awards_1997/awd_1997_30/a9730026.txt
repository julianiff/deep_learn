Abstract    :
              9712209  Talley    This is a collaborative study of the circulation and various 
              dynamical and water mass features of the Pacific.  The  contribution of the
              present proposal is to provide initial  reference level estimates for the
              inverse modeling, and to  interact with the other investigators as the model is
               developed.  Specific research interests will be continued  and completed in
              the course of developing the 3-D  circulation model.  The project will also
              produce atlas of  the one-time WHP survey data.  There will be two volumes: 
              (1) the composite vertical sections and property-property  plots and (2)
              selected isopycnal maps. Each volume will  consist of a printed atlas with
              standard plot selections,  and an online atlas with interactive plotting and
              data  extraction capability.
