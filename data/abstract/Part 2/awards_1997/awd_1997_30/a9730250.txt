Abstract    :
                    9730250  McGehee    The University of Minnesota-Twin Cities plans to
              introduce middle school students to the notion that there are many possible
              shapes for a three-dimensional universe.  The students learn by example, using
              paper and scissors activities, Web-based computer games, and a
              computer-animated video to explore a few of the simplest possible universes in
              an intuitive, hands-on way.   These materials are designed to spark the
              interest of students at risk of being turned off to mathematics.  The project
              team will develop a preliminary version of the one-week unit in the spring of
              1998.   Piloting and field-testing by a broader group of teachers and their
              students will follow the design phase.  The unit will be published and
              presented at NCTM.
