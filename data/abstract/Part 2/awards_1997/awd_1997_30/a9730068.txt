Abstract    :
                                      ABSTRACT       This proposal is to fund innovative
              exploratory research on two-phase flow heat transfer in microchannels. 
              Microchannels have applications in electronics cooling and miniature heat
              exchangers involving high heat fluxes.  The new idea is to employ a porous
              boundary to act as a wick to assist in the removal of condensate.  Existing
              knowledge about heat and fluid flow in porous media involving larger channels
              does not applied because the forces acting on the fluid do not scale linearly
              with the physical dimensions.  The Principal Investigator proposes to conduct
              experiments to study the physics of condensing two-phase flow behavior and
              determine the effects of the porous boundary on heat transfer.
