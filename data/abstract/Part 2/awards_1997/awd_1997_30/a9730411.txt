Abstract    :
              9730411  Robinson      This project is to develop, test and distribute nine
              interactive biology learning programs that are designed to use Web-based
              CD-ROMs ("Web-on-a-Disc"), and have accompanying activity sets and teacher
              guides.  Inquiry-based activities are based on light microscope images that
              lead to a wealth of images from electron microscopy (Scanning Electron
              Microscopy  SEM  and Transmission Electron Microscopy  TEM ), laser confocal
              microscopy, fluorescence microscopy and laser flow cytometry.  The goal is to
              use these microscope and research technologies, that are so often used in
              experimental biological research, to provide teachers and ultimately students
              with up-to-date biology images that better reflect current cell biology. 
              Subject matter developed with these images includes cellular structures, cell
              membrane physiology, cell cycle/genetics, plant tissues, animal tissues,
              protists, fungi and monerans.  Materials are developed under HTML using JAVA,
              the latest WEB technologies and are designed on the CD-ROM Web-on-a-Disc
              concept.  The CD-ROMs are interfaced with the WEB, allowing a multi-platform
              interactive environment for the user.
