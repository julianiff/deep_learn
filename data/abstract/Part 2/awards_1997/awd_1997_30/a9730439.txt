Abstract    :
              Webster  Funding is providedto continue the operation of the Data  Information
              Unit (DIU)  to serve the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE)  through it
              final phase,  called AIMS (Analysis, Interpretation, Modeling, and  Synthesis),
              until 2002. The  proposed operations maintain existing procedures (on-line 
              web-based catalog of  all available WOCE data sets, search capabilities to
              allow  users to find and  obtain these data sets, guide to the status of data
              sets  still in preparation) while  adding new developments and activities to
              meet the need of  the AIMS phase  (tracking of the status and availability of
              new AIMS  products). The DIU serves the  needs of scientists from over 30
              nations.
