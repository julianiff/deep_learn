Abstract    :
                CARTER  9730381    This award provides funding for an Engineering Research
              Centers (ERC) Program/Centers for Research Excellence in Science and Technology
              (CREST) Program Partnership between the Engineering Research Center for
              Computational Field Simulation at Mississippi State University (MSU) and
              Florida A&M University and Florida International University CREST Center for
              Distributed Computing, entitled "An ERC-CREST Partnership in Distributed and
              Computational Systems."  This partnership will be initially founded on
              collaboration in four research projects:  (1) The Hector Run-Time Environment;
              (2) Data Compression and Visualization using Wavelets; (3) Engineering
              Distributed and Parallel Software; and (4) Application of  Parallel Computing
              Environments to Molecular Reaction Theory.  The partnership will increase
              interactions and improve the educational experiences of students at all three
              institutions with the additional exposure serving to attract more students,
              particularly minority students into research careers.
