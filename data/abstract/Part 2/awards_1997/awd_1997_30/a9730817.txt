Abstract    :
              Abstract    Hammond/Brewer    Radon isotope Rn-222 is a tracer that may provide
              some insight into kinetics of hydrate formation and their characteristics. 
              Little is know of the interaction of radon with methane.  The work will focus
              of measurements in the lab on the ability of Rn-222 to be incorporated into
              methane hydrates as they form and its post-crystallization retention.  The
              high-pressure apparatus of MBARI will be used.  Cores and seep samples will be
              collected from the Cascadia margin and Eel River basin to measure naturally
              occurring Rn/CH4 ratios in hydrates.  Local benthic flux measurements will
              characterize the carbon dynamics in the vicinity of the hydrates.  The work
              will establish whether Rn can be used as a geochronometer.
