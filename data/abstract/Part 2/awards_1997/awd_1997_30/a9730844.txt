Abstract    :
              The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Ken Leopold of the  
              University of Minnesota-Twin Cities Campus in his Fourier-transform   microwave
              (FTMW) spectroscopic studies of the structural and electronic   properties of
              Lewis acid-base complexes.  In these studies, he will focus   on complexes in
              which the donor-acceptor bond is only partially formed,   i.e., a bonding
              regime intermediate between van der Waals and chemical   interactions. In
              previous work, Prof. Leopold observed that gas phase   species which lie in the
              intermediate regime between van der Waals and   chemical bonding undergo
              enormous changes in structure upon   crystallization.   In these studies, he
              will (1) extend this work to a   wider number of complexes to investigate the
              effects of Lewis acidity and   basicity on the nature of the donor-acceptor
              bond, (2) measure dipole   moments of partially bonded molecules, and (3)
              characterize larger   clusters containing a partially bonded unit.    Partially
              bonded species are important in a variety of areas of   chemistry.  One of the
              most interesting aspects of partially bound   systems is their hypersensitivity
              to a surrounding medium.  The   phenomenon is most apparent when comparing gas
              phase species with their   crystalline analogues.  These studies will provide
              an experimentally   grounded complement for a growing body of theoretical work
              aimed at   further understanding the nature of the electron pair donor-acceptor
                bond.
