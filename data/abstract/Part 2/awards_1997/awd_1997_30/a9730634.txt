Abstract    :
              9730634  Stacy    Living by Chemistry is a modular high school course to promote
              change in teacher practice and increase in student science literacy by
              embedding the concepts of inquiry-based chemistry in meaningful contexts.  The
              six modules, focusing on a life theme, are diagnosing disease, the sense of
              taste, enzyme reactions, breathing, blood chemistry, and energy from food.  The
              first two modules focus on bonds between atoms; the next three modules focus on
              how arrangements of atoms change in transformations; the last module focuses on
              using energy concepts to predict chemical and physical changes.  The
              multidisciplinary context can engage a diverse set of students.  The core
              content addresses the National Science Education Standards and the Project 2061
              Benchmarks.  The science processes emphasize learning science the way science
              is done.  Students ask questions, provide initial ideas, gather data and refine
              the ideas.  Initially, the instructor models the thought processes of
              scientists and guides the investigations that model the nature of science.  In
              later modules, students ask their own questions, design experiments to answer
              them and monitor their own understanding.  The assessment measures conceptual
              understanding, model generation and refinement, and experimental design. 
              Teachers are involved in the development and testing of the materials. 
              Dissemination is by commercial publication.  Products include a CDROM and print
              materials.
