Abstract    :
              9730870  Spiess    This group  has been developing geodetic techniques for use 
              in ocean basins that involves development of precision  acoustic transponders
              for underwater distance  measurements  and a combined underwater acoustic and
              Global Positioning  System approach.  Measurements on the Juan de Fuca plate 
              conducted in 1994, 1995 and 1996 agree in magnitude with  global plate motion
              studies but differ in the magnitude of  the components of motion. The present
              project will involve  additional data analysis and repeat measurements in 1999
              and  2000.
