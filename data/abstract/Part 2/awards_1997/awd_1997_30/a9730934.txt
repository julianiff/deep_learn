Abstract    :
                  Herbig, George  AST  97-30934    Dr. Herbig continues his observational
              studies on star formation and early stellar evolution.  His research program
              follows two main lines of investigation 1) detection and study of new T-Tauri
              stars in star forming regions, to determine if young star-forming regions
              always contain low-mass stars in the proportions specified by a universal
              initial mass function, and 2) high resolution spectroscopy FU Ori stars to test
              current theories about their structure.
