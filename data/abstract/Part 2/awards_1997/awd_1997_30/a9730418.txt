Abstract    :
              Riser/Pillsbury  9730939/9730418    The rate of exchange of water between the
              Okhotsk Sea and  the N. Pacific will  be quantified by deploying two moorings
              instrumented with  current meters,  temperature/salinity recorders, and
              Acoustic Doppler Current  Profilers in the  Bussol Strait for a two-year
              period. In addition, four  bottom pressure gauges will  be deployed in the
              strait. These observations will be  complemented by a similar  mooring array
              and CTD observations by Japanese scientists.
