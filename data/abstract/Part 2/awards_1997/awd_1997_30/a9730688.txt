Abstract    :
              9730688  Ichimura    Much recent work in econometrics has been directed towards
              developing non-parametric and semi-parametric estimation approaches.  These
              methods improve on traditional methods by allowing researchers to better
              uncover relationships in the data without having to make as many a priori
              modeling assumptions.  They can also be used to test for the validity of
              parametric restrictions.  Yet despite the potential broad applicability of
              these new estimation methods in empirical economic research, they are not
              widely used.  This project addresses the reasons these methods are not used by:
              (1) resolving arbitrariness left in many semi-parametric procedures; (2)
              deriving general approximation results for data-dependent smoothing and
              trimming methods; (3) developing methods and software that overcome
              difficulties in computation with large data sets and (4) demonstrating how
              semi-parametric methods are useful for empirical work.    The arbitrariness
              left in many semi-parametric procedures, which takes the form of parameters
              left unspecified, is addressed by developing effective, data-driven methods for
              choosing unspecified parameters.  A preliminary Monte Carlo study comparing 
              alternative methods demonstrates the effectiveness of the new methods.  New
              asymptotic approximation results, needed to justify estimators that use
              data-dependent smoothing and trimming methods, are developed.  Computational
              problems are resolved by adapting highly effective approximation techniques for
              use in estimating semi-parametric models.  Two classes of empirical problems
              are shown to be promising areas to apply semi-parametric models:  regression
              comparisons of two or more groups and the binary choice model.              ??
