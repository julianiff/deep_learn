Abstract    :
              9730786  Babcock    This is a study of existing multichannel siesmic data to 
              determine crustal thickness variations and the character of  Moho reflectors.
              The objectives are to obtain precise  crustal thickness measurements at the
              segment scale, to  ascertain the continunity and character of Moho reflections 
              and their relationship to the ridge crest, to examine the  response of Moho
              reflections to identify other geologically  plausible crust-mantle transitions.
