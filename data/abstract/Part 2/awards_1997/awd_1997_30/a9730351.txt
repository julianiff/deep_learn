Abstract    :
              9730351  Gould    A network of automated telescopes that can be controlled from
              the classroom may greatly enhance the teaching of middle and high school
              physical and Earth science. The investigations emphasize practical
              understanding of core concepts of motion, light and color, thermodynamics, and
              size and shape.  Students guide the telescopes and have ownership of the images
              and data provided.  They are encouraged to engage in inquiry-driven student
              projects share data, enter into informal collaborations among students and
              between students and scientists, and communicate and publish their results. 
              The investigations move teachers toward more effective practice by engaging
              them in discovery-based activities with their students.  Curriculum developers
              learn about effective use of on-line scientific instruments and collaborations.
               Evaluation determines the changes in students' learning and teacher practice.
