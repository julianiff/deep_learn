Abstract    :
              9730693   Tarter     This is a collaboration of the SETI Institute and three
              other scientific organizations (the California Academy of Sciences, the
              Astronomical Society of the Pacific and NASA Ames Research Center) to develop
              six modules (4-6 weeks each) to form a year-long high school integrated science
              curriculum on cosmic evolution, planetary evolution, origin of life,
              diversification of life, Hominid evolution and evolution of technology.  In
              doing so, the course treats a variety of topics traditionally covered in
              separate courses on astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology and physics.  The
              materials follow the BSCS - 5E learning model design.  The lesson plans and
              teachers manual are delivered on CD-ROM; other curricular materials include
              soft-cover student readers, databases and software on CD-ROM, and inter-school
              telecommunications projects.  These products are to be published as a complete
              set for use as a year-long science course and are to be available as individual
              modules for use in discipline-based courses.
