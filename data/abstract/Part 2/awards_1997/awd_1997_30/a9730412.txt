Abstract    :
                This proposal seeks funds to establish a regional coordination office for the
              Northeast Pacific project of the U.S. GLOBEC program.  The office will be
              responsible for coordinating the many, diverse research activities that are
              beginning in the two Northeast Pacific regions that are the focus of U.S.
              GLOBEC - the California Current System (CCS) and the Coastal Gulf of Alaska
              (CGOA).  Specifically, the office will 1)  develop and implement a framework
              for local administration of the NEP program, 2)  produce recommendations for a
              data management plan, 3)  provide coordination among GLOBEC NEP projects, and
              4) build cooperative bridges between U.S. GLOBEC NEP efforts and the efforts of
              other national and international programs in the Pacific.  It is important to
              the U.S. GLOBEC program that the NEP research is more than a few isolated,
              individually funded projects; the regional coordination office will be crucial
              in ensuring that the GLOBEC NEP program is coordinated into an integrated,
              truly `regional` program.
