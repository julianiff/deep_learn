Abstract    :
                  9730846  Ruppel    Rates of gas hydrate fromation remain unquantified. This 
              modeling study will fill the gap in our knowledge of the gas  hydrate systems
              through the development of 3-phase (liquid-  gas-hydrate) model for porous
              marine sediments constrained  by empirical temperature, pressure, salinity,
              stability of  seawater and hydrate data.  Temperature gradients in marine 
              sediments will also be taken into account.  The model will  then be applied to
              determine how climatic change in pressure  (sea level fluctuations) and bottom
              water temperature affect  hydrate stability zone.
