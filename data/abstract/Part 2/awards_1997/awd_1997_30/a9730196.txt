Abstract    :
              The purpose of this dissertation project is to describe the post-colonial
              negotiations among contemporary Muslims by using science as a case.  The
              project will contribute to both science and technology studies and the
              anthropology of science by improving knowledge of the practice and perception
              of science outside the Euro-American context.  Specifically, this project will
              examine the Islamization of knowledge debate concerning the legitimacy and
              relevance of Islam and science as means to address the particular needs of the
              Islamic world.  This debate constitutes one locus for Muslim intellectuals'
              re-evaluation of the meaning and relevance of `Islam,`   `science,` and
              `modernity` in the wake of the perceived failure and collapse of pan-Arabism,
              the main alternative to Islamism, during  and after the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. 
              Based on preliminary research, the project hypothesizes that individuals'
              debate positions will broadly cluster into three groups which the researcher
              labels modernization, indigenization, and nativization; however specific
              intellectual orientation will be strongly interrelated with local and national
              contexts and personal backgrounds.  Methodologies include
              participant-observation at institutions and conferences; semi-structured and
              life history interviews; and analysis of technical and popular literature.
