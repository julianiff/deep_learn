Abstract    :
              ***  9732129  Street    The project is for a one year study to explore the
              physics  of topographically-  induced turbulence impinging on a free-surface,
              and to  explore the feasibility  of surface detection of bottom topography in a
              variety of  circumstances.  The  PI will perform a Large-Eddy Simulations (LES)
              with a free-  surface for flows in  four scenarios:  1) a single polynomial
              hill, 2) two-  dimensional sinusoidal  topography, 3) three-dimensional
              sinusoidal topography, and  4) a channel and  shoal configuration.  The
              numerical output will be analyzed  to investigate  patterns of stress and
              advection on the surface which may be  used to identify  underlying topography.
