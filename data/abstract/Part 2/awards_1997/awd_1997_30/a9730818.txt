Abstract    :
              	This project was submitted for consideration under the NSF Program, "Career
              Advancement Awards for Minority Scientists and Engineers".  The research
              consists of a series of atmospheric methane measurements that will provide a
              North-South Pacific Ocean transect distribution for methane abundance and
              stable carbon isotopic composition (13C and 12C).  The main scientific
              objectives of the measurements are to determine the latitudinal mixing ratios
              of atmospheric methane in order to understand the dominant sources that might
              be contributing to its increasing global concentration levels.  
	Surface
              clean air samples will be analyzed for 13C/12C, D/H and mixing ratios at
              different latitudes and longitudes from shipboard collections.   The
              collections will be made from a transect of the Pacific Ocean between Los
              Angeles, CA and Auckland, New Zealand.  The air samples (collected using
              pressurized cylinders) will be analyzed using GC/FID (methane concentration)
              and for 13C/12C and D/H abundances using a isotope ratio mass spectrometer
              (IRMS, Finnigan MAT).  Data will be incorporated into an existing database for
              a global distribution of atmospheric methane abundance and isotopic
              composition.  Overall, the study will help to develop global information on
              atmospheric methane that can be incorporated into models which assess the
              secular trends, source strengths, and influence of this important greenhouse on
              global climate.
