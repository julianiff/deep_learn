This award to Indiana University, entitled "TransPAC:  A
              High-Performance Network Connection for Research and Education between the vBNS
              and APAN" provides support for a High Performance International Internet
              Services connection between the networks of the Asia-Pacific Advanced
              Networking consortium (APAN) and NSF's very high-performance Backbone Network
              Services (vBNS).  APAN presently involves advanced networks in Japan, Korea,
              Singapore and Australia and is expected soon to involve other countries in the
              Asia-Pacific region.  The overall consortium (APAN plus Indiana University) is
              called TransPAC.  TransPAC proposed to provide a 35 Mbps link between the Tokyo
              node of APAN and the vBNS via the NSF-funded international connection point for
              high-performance networks, STAR TAP, in Chicago.  TransPAC will initially
              provide a high performance connection for about 50 joint US/Asia-Pacific
              projects that will leverage an estimated $200 million of research over the
              period of the TransPAC award.
