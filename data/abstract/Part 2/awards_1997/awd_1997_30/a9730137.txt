This project will investigate factors facilitating
              or impeding post-earthquake redevelopment following the Northridge (Los
              Angeles) earthquake of January 17, 1994, and the Great Hanshin (Kobe, Japan)
              earthquake of January 17, 1995.  Data will be collected from study sites in Los
              Angeles and Kobe over a two-year period.  The research team will assemble a
              record of planning documents, publications, and land parcel maps on
              pre-disaster and post-disaster economic, physical, institutional, and planning
              circumstances in each city; use field observations, interviews, analysis of
              land parcel data, and collected documents to investigate the influence of such
              factors as financing and institutional arrangements on redevelopment outcomes.
