Abstract    :
                This investigation expands prior work on the fulfillment of party pledges
              (platforms) in the United Sates and United Kingdom.  Prior work included a
              comparison of pledge fulfillment under Reagan and Thatcher, and an analysis of
              pledge fulfillment in the U.S on economic and social welfare policy from Carter
              to Bush.    The investigators collect data using various legislative reference
              books, official budgets and statistics, secondary sources, and computer
              databases.  Most of the United Kingdom work is done with resources available in
              the U.S., using secondary sources, bill texts, government publications and
              statistics, and party information.  The researchers also examine archived party
              materials and conduct interviews with platform drafters and policy makers.  The
              study contributes much to debates about the performance of democratic
              governments under various conditions.  A consistent standard of
              performance--pledge fulfillment--is applied to two countries over an extended
              time period of time, facilitating valid comparisons between countries and time
              periods.  The dataset will be of value to numerous scholars and substantially
              enhances our understanding of the topic.
