Abstract    :
              9730813  Cormier    A  night field program using the Autonomous Benthic Explorer
               (ABE)  to survey the seafloor on a previously-funded  cruise  to   17oS  on 
              the  East  Pacific  Rise  is  proposed.   The  previously-funded cruise will
              include ALVIN  dives,  DSL-120  side-looking  sonar, wax coring, and dredging
              operations  to  determine  the petrological, geochemical, and volcanological 
              aspects of this mid-ocean ridge environment.  The use of the  ABE  should allow
              the better identification of lavas  flows,  their  morphology, dimensions, and
              along axis continuity.  A  magnetometer  has been added to the ABE for the 
              purpose  of  identifying  recent,  highly magnetized  feeder  dikes  and, 
              potentially, non-magnetized feeder dikes.
