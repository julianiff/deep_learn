Abstract    :
                    Bailyn, Charles  AST-9730774      Dr. Bailyn will continue his research
              into black hole X-ray novae, binary systems in which a black hole accretes mass
              from its companion star.  He will carry out a program of optical and infrared
              observations of transient X-ray sources using primarily the Yale 1-meter
              telescope at CTIO.  Frequent and guaranteed access to the telescope will allow
              long term monitoring campaigns to provide improved data on several known
              systems as well as the identification and study of systems recently discovered
              from X-ray data.   Optical studies of these systems provide measurement of
              orbital parameters that lead to limits to the mass of the accretor and proof
              that the systems actually do contain black holes, and strongly constrain
              activity in the outer parts of the accretion disk where matter first comes
              under the influence of the gravitational field of the black hole.
