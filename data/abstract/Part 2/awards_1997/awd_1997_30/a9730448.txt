Abstract    :
                Cost-effectiveness analysis can illustrate society's best opportunities for
              optimizing health benefits in the face of limited resources.   But while recent
              years have witnessed a dramatic increase in the performance and publication of
              cost-effectiveness analyses, the methods used have varied widely, raising
              questions about the usefulness of the information to policy makers.    The
              primary objectives of the research are to investigate variations in methods
              used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a broad range of interventions, and
              to compare the cost-effectiveness of the interventions, after standardizing the
              ratios.  The research calls for:  1) the development of a comprehensive
              database of lifesaving interventions that have used costs per quality-adjusted
              life years (QALYs) to measure health benefits; 2) comparisons of the methods
              used to estimate cost-effectiveness across studies; 3) comparisons of
              unadjusted and adjusted, standardized ratios; 4) the construction of a league
              table of cost/QALY ratios that adhere to the recommendations of the U.S. Panel
              on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine; and 5) analyses investigating the
              impact of using different methods in estimating costs and quality-adjusted
              survival.   The findings should help public and private policy makers better
              understand the relative benefits of diverse interventions and aid in resource
              allocation decisions.  It should also help move the field toward consistency in
              estimation techniques.  Given the well-documented lack of standards in the
              field, and the need for a common metric for purposes of comparison, the
              research should prove important to future policy makers in a wide range of
              disciplines.
