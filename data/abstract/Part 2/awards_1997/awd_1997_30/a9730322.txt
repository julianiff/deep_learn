Abstract    :
              A multi-institution field experiment is designed to study  the spatial and
              temporal  evolution of North Brazil Current (NBC) retroflection and  the
              separation of rings  from the retroflection. The physical structure of the
              rings  after separation from  the NBC, including their sizes, vertical
              structure,  horizontal swirl velocities and  the volume of South Atlantic water
              they trap and transport  will be determine. The  observations will combine
              complementary techniques: an  inverted echo sounder  array within satellite
              altimeter tracklines, current,  temperature and salinity  mooring, Lagrangian
              surface drifters and subsurface floats  and shipboard  surveys.
