Abstract    :
                  9730878                                Abstract           Hydrothermal vent
              communities are characterized by the  use of geothermal energy to drive the
              primary production of  organic carbon.  The vent communities originated earlier
               than the Silurian, at least 430 million years ago.  Because  of the largely
              local production of food, the organisms are  independent of surface produced
              organic carbon.  One genus,  the polychaete Alvinella, is found at modern vents
              and  apparently has been a member of this community since the  beginning.  The
              members of this genus are characterized by a  living habitat in close proximity
              to black smoker effulent  which is exposed to extremely high temperatures of up
              to 80  oC.  We propose to build a heated pressure retaining  container to
              collect live alvinellids and use these for  shipboard experiments in already
              existing pressure vessels.  We will test their temperature tolerance and verify
               measurements made in situ.  This should provide access to  the apparently most
              heat tolerant animal known and allow us  to begin to investigate the mechanisms
              allowing this  phenomenon.  As a final goal, we will describe conditions  and
              metabolic responses which may have developed during the  early period on earth
              and may have been carried over in a  refuge from surface extinctions; the
              hydrothermal vent  community.
