              Instrumentation:  Integrated Video Encoding and Networking     This research
              instrumentation grant contributes to enable the following  research projects:  
              - Multiple Description Coding and Multiple Path Transport for Video  
              Communication over Unreliable Networks,  - Video  Packet Transmissions with
              Renegotiated Service Parameters,   - Traffic Control and Admission Control for
              Video Networks,  - Dense Motion Field Estimation and Representation for Video
              Compression, and   - Stereo Sequence Compression.    The next generation
              Internet must support many applications with widely varying performance
              requirements.  Among these, the transmission of delay-sensitive compressed
              video traffic poses a unique challenge. The main objective of this project is
              to show that the efficiency of a video network can be improved by increasing
              the integration of video coding and video networking. Solutions with practical
              impact can only be achieved if the concepts are shown to be practically
              feasible in an actual testbed. The requested instrumentation will be used to
              set up a Video Networking (VINE) testbed. This testbed will enable
              collaborative research in robust video encoding and transport, video-aware
              resource reservations, and traffic control and admission control of video
              services. The requested video equipment will also facilitate other video coding
              research.
