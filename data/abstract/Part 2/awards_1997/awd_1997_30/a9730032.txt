              Personalized Analysis and Visualization    This is the first year of a
              three-year continuing award. The goal of this research is to develop an
              intelligent workbench for Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), that will
              be used to explore research issues related to coordinated work. Promising
              information analysis and information visualization techniques are used to
              address such CSCW problem as: idea convergence difficulty, information
              overload, vocabulary difference, increased cognitive demand, and
              interface/display problems. Evaluation of the feasibility and effectiveness of
              these technological mixes is carefully performed in lab experiments. The
              results of this research will provide insights to designs for human-computer
              interaction and collaboration, with possible applications in groupware, digital
              libraries, and Internet searches. http://ai.bpa.arizona.edu
