Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    This project will demonstrate the capabilities of the Poisson
              Maximum a Posteriori Probability (MAP)   super-resolution algorithm as applied
              to ground-based astronomical image processing.  Its performance   will be
              compared with the Richardson-Lucy and Maximum Entropy algorithms, which are in
              general use in   the astronomical community.  The MAP algorithm will be
              exercised over a range of SNR and image   dynamic range.
