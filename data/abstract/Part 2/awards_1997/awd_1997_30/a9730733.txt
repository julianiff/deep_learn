Abstract    :
              Research on Domestic Violence has grown significantly over the last several
              decades, though few studies have examined this issue in the lives of women
              living in poverty. This dissertation project will document the prevalence of
              domestic abuse among a representative sample of welfare recipients. It will
              also document the incidence of sexual trauma, depression, substance abuse and
              homelessness within this sample. The project will explore the connection
              between domestic violence and welfare receipt as it impacts on education,
              training and employment. The role of domestic abuse, as an impediment to
              economic progress, will be a central focus of the study. The project will
              employ both quantitative and qualitative research methods. Survey data will be
              collected from approximately 800 participants in a welfare-to-work training
              program. Following the surveys, twenty-five to thirty past or present victims
              of domestic violence will be interviewed at length in their homes. The study
              will contribute to the sociological literature through empirical and analytical
              exploration of abuse and trauma in relationship to poverty. The investigation
              of the connection between domestic violence and poverty has important
              implications for ideological premises inherent in the welfare reform debate.
