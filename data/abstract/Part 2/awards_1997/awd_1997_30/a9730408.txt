Abstract    :
              9730408    Summary:  The proposed instrumentation project requests funds to
              develop a sensor that can be used to determine the Eulerian or profiled
              measurement of turbulent kinetic energy rates in high energy environments such
              as the bottom and surface boundary layers.  The new sensor will offer the
              capability to measure the full dissipation spectrum directly via backscatter. 
              It will also permit the analysis of statistics of the dissipation variable. 
              Initial development of the single-axis laboratory prototype of this sensor was
              funded via an NSF SBIR grant (95-60930), and follow-on funding for final
              development was recommeded by the Phase II SBIR technical panel (see reviews
              for 97-10425), but was not ultimately obtained.    This proposal is a
              collaborative proposal with Dr. John Trowbridge at WHOI (9812514).  First, the
              Pi proposes further development of the instrument, which is necessary since a
              two (2) axis system will be required for a field instrument and the PI plans to
              incorporate a new fast Doppler signal processor and data storage media. 
              Secondly, the PI and Dr. Trowbridge (WHOI) will conduct a bottom boundary layer
              inter-comparison experiment on the south shore of Martha's Vineyard.  The
              object of this experiment is to examine dissipation as measured directly by the
              laser sensor, and as deduced from turbulent spectra using an acoustic Doppler
              velocimeter.
