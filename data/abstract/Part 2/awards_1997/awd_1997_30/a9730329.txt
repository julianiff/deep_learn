Abstract    :
              9730329  Katz    The Mathematical Association of America is developing twelve
              instructional modules based on the history of mathematics to be used in high
              school classrooms.   Each module will contain: 1) a teacher's guide to the
              lesson; 2) the historical and cultural background for and current applications
              of the topic; 3) biographical information about the mathematicians (where
              possible) who contributed to the topic; 4) detailed lesson plans; 5) copy
              masters; 6) exercises for students; 7) suggestions for student projects; 8) a
              bibliography; and 9) questions to be answered by students as part of a written
              journal.  The modules contain mathematics topics already present in the high
              school curriculum and are intended to be replacement or supplementary units. 
              Mathematical and historical content enhancement is provided the teacher-writers
              and field test teachers through a Faculty Enhancement grant, DUE 9752755.
