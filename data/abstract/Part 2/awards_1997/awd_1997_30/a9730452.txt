Abstract    :
              A classical result in the theory of income accounting is that for the case of a
              time-autonomous technology with no uncertainty and a constant real interest
              rate, ideal Green NNP exactly equals annuity-equivalent consumption. In this
              case, a theoretically appealing measure of economic activity exactly forecasts
              a theoretically appealing index of potential future power to consume. This
              research will extend the basic model beyond its classical assumptions to
              investigate four important extensions: (1) technological progress, (2)
              uncertainty, (3) welfare foundations, and (4) empirical applications.  The main
              theoretical part of project will provide a rigorous connection between the
              following five concepts: (1)   Sustainable Equivalence, meaning the level of
              sustainable-equivalent utility the economy can provide, evaluated at the rate
              of pure time preference; (2) Annuitized Consumption, meaning the hypothetical
              stationary-equivalent consumption the economy can deliver, evaluated at the
              prevailing rate of interest; (3) Green NNP, meaning the most inclusive
              consumption-based measure of NNP that can be assembled in practice with
              reasonably accurate efficiency prices on investments; (4) Incompleteness,
              meaning the degree to which the list of available capital goods fails to
              account for all sources of growth, as measured by the relative strength of the
              residual factor; (5) Linearized Hamiltonian, meaning an affine scaling
              procedure that makes utility-based and consumption-based systems be comparable.
               The main empirical part of the research evaluates numerically the loss of
              global welfare from running out of each of the major non-renewable resources,
              including petroleum. The research will provide actual numerical estimates of
              how much final consumption the world loses on average from finiteness of the
              earth's resources.
