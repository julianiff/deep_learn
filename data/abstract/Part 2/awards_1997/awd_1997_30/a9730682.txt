Abstract    :
              9730682  Gersmehl    Activities and Reading in the Geography of the World
              (ARGWorld) is a CDROM and a comprehensive set of related hands-on student
              activities for use in world geography courses in grades 7, 8 and 9.  The CDROMs
              and the activities can be used together, but each stands alone.  Students use
              the tools of geographic analysis to address intuitively interesting problems in
              compelling situations.  Extensive use is made of original maps, remotely sensed
              imagery, and links to relevant web sites and other sources of real-world
              geographic information.  The CDROM features photographs, interactive maps, and
              animated explanations of key concepts of scientific geographic analysis. 
              Weaving together multiple strands of basic locations, place, images, analytical
              skills, explanatory theories and value issues increases the learning of
              geographic facts, concepts and skills.  The development team has produced
              previous materials and has been active in developing the geography standards. 
              An international steering committee selects case study locations that serve as
              contexts for activities.  The materials are tested by teachers in state
              geographic alliances.  Dissemination is assisted by the NASA Education
              Division.
