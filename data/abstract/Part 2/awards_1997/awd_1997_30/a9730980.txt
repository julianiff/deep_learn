Abstract    :
                9730980  PERONA    This award provides funding for an Engineering Research
              Centers (ERC) Program/Centers for Research Excellence in Science and Technology
              (CREST) Program Partnership between the Center for  Neuromorphic Systems
              Engineering at California Institute of Technology and Tennessee State
              University CREST.  This partnership will involve the development of improved
              visual telepresence systems through improved algorithms, control loops, user
              interfaces and the application of these techniques to be teleoperated robots. 
              The research collaboration between the Caltech ERC and the Tennessee State
              CREST will involve topics that will draw on the expertise of faculty at both
              institutions as well as involve graduate students.  This partnership based in
              research which is compatible to the research goals of the participating Centers
              will build a long-term bridge between the two centers that will link their
              faculty and graduate/undergraduate students in research.
