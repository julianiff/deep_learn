Abstract    :
              Quellmalz  9730651    This project builds on the notion that states, districts,
              and teachers need innovative approaches to sharing exemplary assessment
              resources, collaborating on the development of new ones, and understanding how
              the use of standards-based performance assessments can advance education reform
              at all levels of the system.    This project, a collaboration between SRI and
              the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) will develop a type of
              electronic library--an on-line, standards-based interactive resource bank of
              science performance assessments.    Specifically, the project has two goals:   
              1. To develop a two-tiered on-line performance assessment resource library for
              K-12 science from multiple sources.  One tier will be a password-protected,
              secure accountability pool of assessments and the second will be for use by
              teachers and professional development organizations.    2. To identify, study,
              and evaluate the effectiveness of policies, implementation models, and
              technical quality requirements for the use of the two tiers of PALS.
