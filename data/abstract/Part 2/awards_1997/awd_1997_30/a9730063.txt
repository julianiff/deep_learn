Abstract    :
              9730063  Hazen      Life thrives in a remarkable variety of aqueous,
              high-pressure   environments.  Hydrothermal vents support rich ecosystems,
              while rock-bound   microbes survive in deep aquifers associated with granite,
              basalt, and   sediments.  Life is generally sparse at depth, but it's potential
                Significance is great, for these habitats may represent a crustal volume  
              exceeding a billion cubic kilometers.  The extent to which high-pressure  
              organisms exploit this vast volume will depend, in large measure, on the  
              efficiency of high-pressure, hydrothermal organic synthesis.  Modern  
              organisms use enzymes to catalyze metabolic reactions, notabley steps by  
              which molecules are enlarged through CO2 addition?  In the proposed  
              experiments mineral surfaces, including transition metal sulfices, will be  
              investigated as possible catalysts for these reactions under high-pressure,  
              hydrothermal conditions.  This exploration will provide fundamental data on  
              organic synthesis under geologically relevant conditions--data essential to  
              future studies of life in extreme environments.
