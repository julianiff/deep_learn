Abstract    :
              OCE-9730697  Weingartner    The project is for a field study over the northern
              Bering  Sea shelf to test new theoretical ideas about shelf  convection and the
              spreading of ventilated waters away from  the convective region.  These ideas,
              which have now been  explored in a number of publications by several 
              investigators, propose alternatives that are significantly  different from
              earlier ideas of ventilation by quasi-  geostrophic plumes.  The filed work
              consists of deployment  of eight moorings, instrumented with Seabird 
              temperature/salinity recorder and conventional current  meters.  In addition,
              PIs plan to acquire independent  information from remote sensing on the polynya
              development  and on surface feature tracking.
