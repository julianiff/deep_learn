Abstract    :
              9730138  Silevitch      This project creates a widespread implementation
              capacity for the use of standards-based curricula in the New England region. 
              The project builds from the work initiated by the Project for the Enhancement
              of Science and Mathematics Education (CESAME) at Northeastern University. 
              Specifically, the project:    1. Identifies, selects, develops, and supports at
              least seven Curriculum Implementation Centers (CICs) at regional locations
              throughout New England (Rhode Island, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont.)  2.
              Prepares the CICs to create awareness and assist districts in the selection and
              implementation of standards-based curricula.  3. Connects the CICs with
              physical and electronic networks.  4. Supports the professional development of
              an Implementation Advisor (IA) for each Center.  5. Identifies and develops
              over 100 Curriculum Trainers (CTs) to work with teachers in participating
              districts.  6. Continues to use the CESAME task force to identify emerging new
              programs and tools for participating districts.
