Abstract    :
                9730304  Petrenko    This project addresses photoplasticity, dislocation
              motion and  interaction in II-VI materials. Most of the research will be 
              conducted with CdS and ZnSe with emphasis on identifying and  developing
              greater understanding of the physical mechanism of the  x-ray plastic effect
              (XPE). Under certain conditions, this  phenomenon can cause significant
              material hardening, for example  causing a doubling of yield stress and a
              decrease in rate of  plastic deformation by two to four orders of magnitude. In
              these  studies, this effect will be used as a tool to study mechanisms  of
              dislocation motion.  %%%  The project primarily addresses research issues in
              materials  physics. The research will contribute basic knowledge at a 
              fundamental level to a somewhat narrow, but unique phenomenon  observed when
              materials are exposed to X-rays. The basic  knowledge and understanding gained
              from the research may  contribute to improving the performance and stability of
              advanced  devices such as blue lasers and light emitting diodes (LEDs).  ***
