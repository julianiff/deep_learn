Abstract    :
                Investigators conducting research on human decision-making frequently have
              been deterred from working with people of varying experience, expertise, age,
              socioeconomic status, culture, etc. because of logistical difficulties.  Recent
              developments in computer technology may provide a solution to many of these
              logistical problems.  Potential participants may be reached at home or in their
              offices through the Internet using aesthetically enticing video and audio
              materials.  The primary goal of this project is to develop and test a prototype
              Internet-based Decision Research System (IDRS).  This system will be capable of
              reproducing simulated decision environments and conducting research using other
              typical laboratory procedures at remote locations while gathering many of the
              measures typically obtained in the laboratory (e.g., time spent accessing
              different sources of information, order of access, self reports of confidence,
              subjective probability estimates).  The efficacy of the IDRS will be tested in
              a demonstration project aimed at an important applied problem: providing a
              better understanding of the information processing and decision-making
              strategies used by aircraft pilots.  Pilot errors are blamed for most aviation
              accidents and incidents.  Understanding how pilots make decisions and how the
              strategies they use change with experience could help in the development of
              improved training materials and safety procedures.  In this study, pilots will
              participate in simulations of typical aviation problems.  What information they
              access and what strategies they follow in making their decisions will be
              analyzed.  If the IDRS proves to be useful, this system and others like it
              could dramatically alter the way behavioral research is conducted.
