Abstract    :
                  Funds are provided to complete a suite of laboratory  analyses on partially
              lithified sediments retrieved during  ODP drilling. The objective of the study
              is to constrain the  changes in physical properties of sediments above, below
              and  within major fault zones and to integrate these data with  seismic
              reflection data to understand the mechanics and  dynamics and enhance our
              ability to interpret seismic data  in various settings.
