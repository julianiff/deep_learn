              Earth Observatory  Title: Squeezing the Juice Out of Paleoclimate Proxies   
              This "Accomplished-Based Renewal" supports work on the paleoclimate  record for
              the last 150,000 years and its implication to our  greenhouse future.  The work
              is focussed on the causes of the  abrupt climate changes which are so
              prominently displayed in the  Greenland ice core records and to decipher how
              much of these past  changes have come in abrupt steps as opposed to how much
              has been  a simple sinusoidal response to orbital forcing.  The large and 
              abrupt global climate shifts may reflect discontinuous jumps in the  inventory
              of atmospheric water vapor and are hence driven from the  tropics.  Dr. W.S.
              Broecker seek ways to reconstruct past changes  in the hydrologic cycle at low
              latitudes and continue to explore  the ocean's thermohaline circulation.
