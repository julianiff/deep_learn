Abstract    :
                    9730685  Chen    Mid-ocean  ridges represent the longest plate boundaries 
              on  the  earth's  surface  and  their persistent  volcanism  has  produced 
              over  half  of  the earth's  crust.  Understanding  mantle  upwelling  and
              crustal accretion processes  at  mid-  ocean  ridges is important in our
              understanding  how  global  plate  tectonics  work to shape the earth's 
              surface.   This  proposed  two-year  investigation is designed  to  construct 
              three-dimensional  ridge  crustal  flow  models  at  a  fast  spreading
              mid-ocean ridge. The main goal is to test  if  the  along-axis  crustal  flow 
              at  fast  spreading   ridges   is  sufficient  to  smoothen  the gravity, 
              topography,  crustal  thickness and other observables if mantle upwelling at 
              fast  ridges is three-dimensional. This is the key to discriminate  between the
              current  two competing hypotheses for the mantle  flow  and  crustal accretion
              at mid-ocean  ridges.  This  is  inexpensive  and  effective  approach  toward 
              solving   the  current  dilemma of the production of oceanic crust and  its 
              related processes at fast spreading ridges.
