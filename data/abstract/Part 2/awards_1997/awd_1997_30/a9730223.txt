Abstract    :
                                      The central role of Dissolved Organic Matter  (DOM) in
              the ocean carbon cycle and the  influence of DOM on numerous physical, 
              chemical, and biological processes are widely  recognized, but fundamental
              questions about  the sources, reactivity, and cycling of DOM  remain to be
              answered.  Many of the answers to  these questions lie hidden within the
              chemical  structures of DOM, but characterization of DOM  is challenging
              because concentrations are low  and salts are abundant in seawater.  Novel 
              approaches to the isolation and chemical  characterization of DOM are beginning
               transformations of this major carbon  reservoir.  Tangential-flow
              ultrafiltration  has emerged as a powerful approach for the  isolation of
              different size classes of marine  organic matter.  Recent efforts in the 
              characterization of ultrafiltered material  have provided a wealth of new
              information  about marine DOM.  Over the next three years  research will focus
              on the characterization of  seawater DOM and build upon major findings of  the
              past three years of research on the  characterization of ultrafiltered DOM. 
              The  major objectives of the proposed research are:   1) to investigate
              relationships among size,  composition, and microbial reactivity of  marine
              organic matter, and 2) to characterize  the distribution and cycling of
              terrigenous  DOM in the ocean.
