Abstract    :
              9730964  Crawford    Seafloor compliance inversion is one of a very few 
              techniques for determining the melt distribution at oceanic  spreading centers.
               Existing measurements provide evidence  for melt in the lower crust and upper
              mantle beneath the  East Pacific Rise at 9 degrees north. Existing
              computational  algorithms designed to calculate compliance over laterally 
              varying basement will be improved and tested, and two- and  three-dimensional
              data inversion routines for complicance  data will be developed.
