Abstract    :
              Weitao Yang of Duke University is supported by a grant from the   Theoretical
              and Computational Chemistry Program at NSF for studies of the   electronic
              structure of large-scale systems.  He will continue   development of 
              methodological aspects of density-functional theory,   including linear scaling
              algorithms based on parallel implementations and   improved-accuracy density
              functionals based on localized orbitals.  One   application of this improved
              methodology is an investigation into the   structure and reactivity of cytidine
              deaminase.   These studies employ Professor Yang's divide-and-conquer approach,
              which   divides the electronic structure of a large system into many smaller  
              systems and then determines the electron density of each system   separately.
              This technique provides a powerful new  way to apply   density-functional
              theory to the accurate prediction of energies and   properties of large
              systems, such as condensed matter and biological   molecules.
