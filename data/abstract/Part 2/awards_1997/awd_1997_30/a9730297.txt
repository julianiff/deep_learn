Abstract    :
              After 1997, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) will move to biennial data
              collection, with the next scheduled interviews to be conducted in 1999.  This
              move will require questionnaire design changes so as to gain retrospective
              reports of events occurring up to two and a half years prior to the interview
              date.  This project will directly test the data quality obtained by
              questionnaire design methodologies that require the use of scripted questions
              versus a flexible event history calendar (EHC-F).  The EHC-F methodology
              utilizes sequential and parallel autobiographical memory cues that are
              unavailable to scripted questionnaires, as such cues must be customized to meet
              the idiosyncratic needs of respondents.  As a secondary objective, the study
              also assesses the data quality of gaining reports from a scripted questionnaire
              list (Q-list) design versus a scripted questionnaire that includes an event
              history calendar component as an interviewing aide (EHC-S).  A total of 600
              PSID respondents who were interviewed in 1997 to obtain economic and
              demographic measures for 1996 will be randomly assigned to conditions.  They
              will be interviewed in 1998 (an off-year for the full PSID panel) about events
              that occurred in both 1996 and 1997.  The economic and demographic outcome
              measures will include reports on weeks worked, hours per week worked, weeks
              unemployed, annual salary, receipt of food stamps and AFDC, and changes in
              occupation, residence, and household composition.  The consistency between the
              1997 and 1998 reports on 1996 events will serve as the primary indicator of
              data quality.  By providing the first direct comparative test of the quality of
              responses obtained from a scripted Q-list, a scripted EHC, and a flexible EHC,
              this project will be able to determine the relative utility of such
              methodologies in promoting the quality of retrospective reports obtained on
              events occurring up to two and a half years prior to the interview date.
