Abstract    :
              The objective of the research is to develop an integrated system for monitoring
              live load and verifying live load carrying capacity of highway bridges. 
              Therefore, the proposed research will deal with the development of the control
              system for live load on bridges and the control system of live load carrying
              capacity.  The anticipated major contributions will include: the improvement of
              field testing procedures using remote sensors and transmitters on-site
              processing of the data, calculation of critical truck loads, accumulated
              fatigue load spectra, maximum deflection, derivation of reliability-based
              criteria for acceptability limits, elements of active control with on-site
              response to critical overload as determined by comparison with the developed
              reliability-based criteria, integration of truck weigh-in-motion with
              diagnostic testing and proof load testing, derivations reliability-based
              criteria for establishing proof load level for bridges.  The research will be
              based on the experience gained in an extensive field testing program and bridge
              reliability analysis at the University of Michigan.
