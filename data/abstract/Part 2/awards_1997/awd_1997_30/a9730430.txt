Abstract    :
              9730430  Godbold    The Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications is
              developing instructional materials for a fourth year high school mathematics
              course that complements the materials for the first three years of the
              Applications Reform in Secondary Education (ARISE) project and, thus, completes
              the materials for a high school curriculum.  The materials are field-tested and
              are complemented by a teacher'' edition, a teacher's resource guide, a
              solutions manual, and a CD-ROM containing relevant calculator and computer
              programs.  The entire series of instructional materials is being marketed under
              the title, Mathematics:  Modeling Our World.  Additionally, a study is being
              conducted to learn how students perform in college when they have had four
              years of a reform curriculum.
