Abstract    :
              Firing  9730953  The direct velocity measurements collected under the 
              hydrographic program of  the World Ocean circulation Experiment (WOCE) will be 
              combined together with  other observations to provide a complete description of
              the  ocean current field in  the Pacific. Both shipboard and lowered Acoustic
              Doppler  Current Profiler  (ADCP) data  will be used in regional and basin-wide
               analyses. The  observations will be compared with the out put of general 
              circulation and tidal  models to assess the temporal context of the
              observations.
