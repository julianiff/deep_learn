Abstract    :
              This research focuses on characterizing the chemistry of singlet oxygen   with a
              specific emphasis on its reactions with alkenes and dienes.     Product yields,
              determined as a function of reaction conditions, and   correlated with
              transient intermediates, will be used to develop a   protocol to predict and
              control the reactions of this ubiquitous,   metastable form of oxygen.  
              Undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral   students will be introduced to the
              chemistry of this energetic form of   oxygen and, through the development of
              the methods needed to characterize   singlet oxygen delayed fluorescence, the
              fast reaction techniques used to   explore its properties.   With this award,
              the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program   supports the research of Dr.
              Christopher S. Foote of the Department of   Chemistry and Biochemistry at the
              University of California, Los Angeles.     Professor Foote will develop methods
              to predict and control the   chemistry of an energetic form of oxygen, called
              singlet oxygen, that is   currently implicated in the aging of sun-exposed
              skin, cataract   induction, and photocarcinogenesis.   Professor Foote's
              research will   introduce undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students to
              the   chemistry of this energetic form of oxygen, and to the techniques to  
              characterize the properties of transient intermediates.
