Abstract    :
              9730376  Mix    This project will examine a variety of sediment indicators  in
              two transects of sediment cores from the western margin  of South America, to
              address questions concerning ocean  circulation on glacial/interglacial time
              scales. The Pis  hypothesize that cooler water in the glacial eastern 
              equatorial pacific resulted from stronger flow of the  Humboldt Current, that
              mid-latitude westerly winds shifted  to the north as a result of an expanded
              southern ice sheet,  and that variations in the Humboldt Current were in phase 
              with those Of the California Current. Analyses will include  taxonomic and
              stable isotope composition of foraminifera and  radiolaria, and alkenone
              saturation indices.
