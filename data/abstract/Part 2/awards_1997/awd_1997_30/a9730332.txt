Abstract    :
              Incomplete information studies of bargaining impasse have used assumptions from
              Nash's bargaining problem as experimental treatment variables. Results show
              that when negotiators are uncertain about the size of the surplus to be divided
              or the outside options of each other, breakdowns can result. Until now,
              research has not analyzed the affects of private information in the third
              determinant of the bargaining problem-bargainerr preferences. This study will
              develop a methodology for determining bargainer preferences or type and use
              this information as the treatment variable in another series of economic
              experiments. One treatment provides bargainers with complete information in all
              aspects of the bargaining game except for each other's type. The second
              treatment truly constitutes complete information because in this case
              bargainers will also know their opponent's type. Based on previous bargaining
              work done by experimental economists, reciprocal fair behavior and
              individualistic behavior will be identified and used to construct a taxonomy of
              subject type. Using the possible combinations of these two types, three
              bargaining cells will constitute each treatment. A comparison of the impasse
              rates of the two treatments will test whether impasse vanishes under conditions
              of complete
