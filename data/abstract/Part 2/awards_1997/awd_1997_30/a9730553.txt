Abstract    :
                OCE-9726583  Johnson          The project is for a joint observational and
              theoretical  investigation into the dynamics of the interannual  variability of
              the tropical instability waves in the  tropical Pacific Ocean.  Considerable
              data exist, allowing a  quantification of mean circulation and instability wave
               dynamics.  Models will be used to investigate the structure  and dynamics of
              instability of background states constructed  from ADCP/ATLAS transects.  The
              structure will be compared  with observations.
