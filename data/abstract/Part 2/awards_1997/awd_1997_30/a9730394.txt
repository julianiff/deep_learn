Abstract    :
              SUMMARY

Oceanic hot spots leave trails of volcanoes that can be interpreted
              in terms of tectonic plate motion.  The motion of the Pacific Plate is most
              prominently reflected in the Hawaiian/Emperor seamount chain with a
              characteristic bend at about 42 Ma.  The timing of this change based on dating
              of rocks is almost 10 million years younger than the age calculated from marine
              magnetic anomalies, and it has been suggested that the Hawaiian hot spot may
              have moved with respect to other hot spots.  The Gilbert Ridge and the Tokelau
              seamount chain display a similar bend at their southern terminations, and offer
              an opportunity to improve our accuracy of absolute Pacific Plate motion and to
              test for the validity of the fixed hot spot concept.  This project will dredge
              rocks from these seamount chains and date samples by 40 Ar/39 Ar isotopic
              methods.
