Abstract    :
              Eric Herbst  Ohio State University  FY 98: $99,007     FY 99: $99,238   FY 00:
              $99,223    Interstellar Astrochemistry.    Dr. Herbst will continue a research
              program in which he seeks to understand and utilize chemistry to explain and
              guide astronomical observations of molecules, and to better our understanding
              of interstellar and circumstellar objects.  The astronomical regions of
              interest include carbon rich circumstellar shells, hot molecular cores,
              reflection nebulae, novae, cold interstellar clouds, translucent clouds, and
              disks around young stellar objects.  During this award period a wide variety of
              modeling studies will be pursued, to be backed up with improvements to the
              group's standard models.  A significant portion of the research time is spent
              on theoretical studies of relevant gas-phase and surface processes.  ***
