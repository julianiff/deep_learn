Abstract    :
                The proposed study will employ cross-sectional survey data to explore a
              variety of social and psychological factors associated with marital infidelity.
              The study has three goals: (1) to develop and test hypotheses linking sexual
              infidelity to a) sexual values and tastes, b) risks to the primary
              relationship, and c) opportunities for illicit sex; (2) to investigate
              well-documented gender differences in sexual infidelity; and (3) to analyze
              characteristics of secondary sex partners to illuminate gender differences and
              matching processes. This study integrates piecemeal findings into one
              theoretical framework. Sexual behavior is considered in the context of
              decision-making, an approach directing attention to preferences, constraints,
              and opportunities. From this follows a set of testable hypotheses on the
              factors associated with infidelity. The 1992 National Survey of Health and
              Social Life (NSHSL) will provide data. It offers a large, nationally
              representative sample using several different measures of infidelity. Although
              the project is motivated by a broad theoretical issues, i.e., the mechanisms
              which two-party unions use to foster cooperation and manage conflict, the
              transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases via secondary sex
              partners underscores the study's pragmatic importance.
