Abstract    :
                Description: This award is for support of a cooperative project by Dr. G.
              Thomas Strickland, Director, International Health Program at the University of
              Maryland, in Baltimore, MD, and Dr. Mohamed Abdel-Hamid, Director of the
              Virology Laboratory at the Liver Institute in Menoufia University, Shebin El
              Kom, Egypt.  The objective of this joint research is to investigate the
              relationship between specific biomarkers of environmental exposures to the
              development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).  Techniques have recently been
              developed to determine whether hepatic cancers frequently occur in people with
              specific acquired genetic mutations.   The hypothesis to be tested is: exposure
              to chemicals that damage the p53 gene will increase risk of HCC, especially in
              persons with concurrent viral exposures.  Scope:  This project will involve two
              laboratories with complementary capabilities to conduct research in an
              important field for both countries.  This proposal meets INT objective of
              supporting U.S.-foreign collaboration in areas of mutual benefit.  The project
              was generated as a result of a workshop on biotechnology organized by the
              National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Egyptian Government.  NIH was
              involved in the evaluation of the project and in recommending its support. 
              This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program,
              administered by the US Department of State, which provides grants to scientists
              and engineers in both countries to carry out cooperative activities.
