Abstract    :
                                                 ABSTRACT      A new approach and
              instrumentation for CO2 research will be developed. The  proposed project will
              attempt to capture up to 70 tons of CO2 per day  currently being emitted
              naturally into the Los Angeles Department of Public  Works Mono Tunnel aqueduct
              which nms under the Inyo National forest. This CO2  is currently being vented
              to the atmosphere. The proposed work will lay the  ground work for a truly long
              term CO2 experiment in mature, native pine  forest in California. The proposed
              research will develop the necessary  instrumentation and approaches to utilize
              a natural non-commercial source to  provide the CO2 necessary for an extensive,
              replicated FACE (Free Air CO2  Enrichment on a natural forest. The proposed
              activities will develop the  procedure and instrumentation necessary to collect
              and deliver the gas in a  highly controlled manner using a FACE system within a
              native pine forest in  the Inyo National Forest.    Benefits of this research
              include expansion of FACE into a native forest  setting, provision for a truly
              long term FACE experiment and establishment of  links with other elevated CO2
              experiments. It will contribute to a  comprehensive assessment of CO2 effects
              on the ecosystems of the Western  region of the United States.
