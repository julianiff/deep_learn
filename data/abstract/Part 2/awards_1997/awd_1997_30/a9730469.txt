Abstract    :
              9730469  Sadler    DESIGNS is a one year, middle school, physical science and
              technology course.  It is based upon engineering design projects previously
              developed and tested.  "Design-under-constraint" challenges, in which students
              creatively optimize the functioning of existing devices and processes, are
              alternatives to traditional and discovery-based experiments.  The challenges
              have been found to significantly change students' science process skills and
              change their preconceptions.  The course addresses the physical science content
              standards of the science standards through challenges in the construction of
              batteries, bridges, electromagnets, solar heating and a gravity car.  Each
              challenge begins with student construction of a standard device.  The students
              are challenged to optimize the performance of a variable that has a large
              range.  The construction takes little time and the outcome is tested publicly. 
              Students are asked to predict results of trials and explain the outcomes. 
              Teachers are involved in the development and testing of the materials.  The
              materials are distributed commercially.
