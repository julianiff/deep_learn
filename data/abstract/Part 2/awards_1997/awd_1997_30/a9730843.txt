Abstract    :
              9730843  Kloosterziel    The project is for a modeling study of the centrifugal 
              instability of vortices that includes the effect of  stratification. 
              High-resolution three-dimensional numerical  experiments will be used, in
              conjunction with linear  stability analysis.  Parameter regimes will be chosen
              that  are appropriate for the strong anti-cyclones observed in the  Hawaiian
              waters and the North Atlantic.  The research will  be contrasted with and
              guided by recent and forthcoming  detailed observations of the oceanic flow in
              the Hawaiian  waters.
