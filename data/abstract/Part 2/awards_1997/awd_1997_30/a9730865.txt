Abstract    :
              9730865  Blackman    The mechanisms by which lower crustal and upper mantle
              rocks are unroofed, uplifted and exposed on the seafloor will be investigated
              via a series of numerical experiments.  Previous models of the formation of
              metamorphic core complexes in extended continental regions will provide a
              starting point for this modeling of oceanic core complexes.  The intent is to
              develop numerical predictions that can help guide future mapping efforts.
