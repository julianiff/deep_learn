Abstract    :
              Swift  9730807  Funds are provided to develop a platform independent version  of
              the  OceanAtlas program that allows hydrographic data to explored  on screen in
              an  interactive and flexible manner. OceanAtlas is used at sea  to examine and 
              quality control data as they are being collected as well as  by oceanographers,
               teachers and students to study the distribution of ocean  properties and 
              fundamentals of the ocean circulations. The new version  written in the Java 
              language will run on every major personal computers and UNIX  workstations 
              which will greatly broaden its user base.
