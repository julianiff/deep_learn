Abstract    :
              This project will extend previous work on ion orbit tracing to examine the
              condition and stability for thin current sheets.  The calculations are fully
              three dimensional and realistic geomagnetic field models are used.  A realistic
              electric field model will be added in this further development.  The focus will
              be on the current sheet in the geomagnetic tail.  Specific topics for
              investigation will include the transfer of kinetic energy between thermal and
              bulk flow forms, the possibility of defining and equation of state, heat
              fluxes, and the work done by particle and electromagnetic forces.  Detailed
              comparison of calculated distribution functions with satellite observations
              from several satellite missions is proposed.
