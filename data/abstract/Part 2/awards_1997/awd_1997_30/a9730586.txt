Abstract    :
              9730586  Unruh    PRISMS (Physics Resources and Instructional Strategies for
              Motivating Students) is a series of physics activities designed to engage high
              school students and their teachers in constructivist learning of physics in the
              context of everyday and interesting phenomena.  The activities employ the
              learning cycle and address student preconceptions.  Students explore physical
              phenomena, find patterns and relationships and develop explanations and
              interpretations for how nature works.  PRISMS has been disseminated in the
              National Diffusion Network and via teacher workshops.  The PRISMS activities
              are to be revised to more completely address the National Science Education
              Standards.  New activities demonstrate connections to other disciplines,
              increase the level of inquiry by introducing longer term projects and requiring
              communication to parents and other students, and incorporate technological
              design and educational technologies.  Authentic assessments and rubrics for
              their use are developed.  Activities are also available in Spanish.  Teachers
              are involved in the development of the materials and in the pilot and
              field-testing.  The materials are commercially disseminated.
