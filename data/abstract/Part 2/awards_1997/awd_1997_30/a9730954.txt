Abstract    :
                  This award will support a detailed study of sedimentation in  the maldive
              Archipelago in the western Indian Ocean.  Analysis of the history of
              sedimentation in the region will  be used to examine the history of sea level
              for this  carbonate-dominated sedimentary regime.  Study of a global  array of
              such sites is needed to separate local tectonic  affects from globally
              synchronous changes in sea-level.  Additionally, the data and analysis will be
              used to evaluate  the potential for future drilling in the region by the Ocean 
              Drilling Program.  ***
