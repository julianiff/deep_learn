Abstract    :
                Chemical deterrence has long been recognized as an important strategy by which
              terrestrial macrophytes defend themselves against herbivores.  Chemical defense
              also has been documented extensively for marine multicellular organisms.  By
              comparison, we know astonishingly little about chemical defenses by planktonic
              microbes.  The proposed study focuses on chemical defense by marine
              phytoplankton, which are responsible for roughly half the photosynthesis on
              Earth, against protozoan grazers, their dominant consumers.  It is well known
              that potent phytoplankton-derived toxins, such as the saxitoxin synthesized by
              the dinoflagellate Alexandriwn, can kill or incapacitate predators.  We argue
              that less severe chemical interactions, which merely deter feeding on specific
              prey, may be more common and may strongly influence predator-prey interactions
              within the microplankton.  We present a recently-discovered model for subacute
              chemical defense by the coccolithophorid alga Emilianiahuxleyi.  In this
              species, enzymatic cleavage by dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) lyase to form
              dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and acrylate is activated by protozoan grazing, and at
              least one protozoan species feeds preferentially on E. huxleyi clones with low
              lyase activity.  Since production of DIVIS and acrylate is widespread among
              bloom-forming algal taxa, we propose to build on the above observations to
              understand the mechanisms by which this reaction influences protozoan
              herbivory.  We will also investigate in detail how the reaction serves to
              communicate the chemical message `don't feed on me`.  Using this defense model,
              we will begin to evaluate how prey chemistry alters predator choice and feeding
              dynamics, and how these responses might in turn affect the evolution of prey
              populations.
