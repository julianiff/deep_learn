Abstract    :
                This research tests whether American's evaluations of the president have
              become more volatile in the postwar era.  If the American public has become
              more volatile, less consensual and more uncertain in their evaluations of the
              president, it becomes more difficult for presidents to build and maintain
              legislative coalitions, unify domestic actors behind foreign policy
              initiatives, and maintain their own electoral coalitions.  The proposal has two
              parts.  The first explores changes in aggregate, group and individual bases of
              presidential approval.  This part develops new measures of volatility in
              assessing Presidential approval.  The second part turns toward the consequences
              of volatility for presidential success in Congress.  This study uses new
              methodological techniques to combine public opinion poll data and legislative
              roll calls.  These data constitute a new and valuable resource for scholars of
              the Presidency and Congress.
