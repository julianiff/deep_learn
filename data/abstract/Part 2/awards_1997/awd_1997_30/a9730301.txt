Abstract    :
              9730301  Morris    Convergent margins are places where a large percentage of 
              the crustal material is recycled at the subduction zones and  yet poorly
              understood.  Funds are provided to hold an  international workshop entitled
              Subduction Factory to bring  together marine geoscientists to plan an
              integrated and  multidisciplinary study focused on one or two of the Earth's 
              convergent margins.  The targeted margins will be have to be  drillable in the
              incoming plate, the forearc, the arc, and  possibly the backarc, using existing
              and riser drilling  technologies. The Subduction Factory is a high priority 
              issue identified under the MARGINS initiative. The workshop  will be held in
              the summer of 1998 and some 35 participants  are expected.
