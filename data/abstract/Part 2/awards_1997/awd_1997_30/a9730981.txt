Abstract    :
                This project involves two separate empirical analyses of corporate and
              managerial liability.  The first analyzes criminal sentencing of corporations
              under the new federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations.  The research
              compares the new Guidelines to existing practice and to optimal corporate
              liability.  The project also analyses the use of corporate probation
              (nonmonetary sanctions) as well as the fate of the individuals responsible for
              corporate wrongdoing.  The second project focuses on wrongdoing by managers
              against shareholders.  The research examines the nature of fiduciary  duties
              imposed on managers to induce them to perform their jobs diligently (take `due
              care`) and not misappropriate the firm's assets for their own purposes (`duty
              of loyalty`).  Economic theory suggests that these duties are the same, yet the
              law treats them differently.  This second subproject will test the legal
              distinction using experimental methods. Experimental subjects serve as
              principals or agents, randomly determined, and play a two-stage game.  In the
              first, the pairs of participants decide if they will combine their assets in a
              joint project.  In the second, the agent has an opportunity to misappropriate
              assets. The central proposition will be tested by evaluating whether subjects
              establish different penalties when withholding their own assets than when
              misappropriating the assets of the other (care vs. Loyalty).  The first
              subproject will use a database on corporate sentencing prior to the enactment
              of the Guidelines and create an analogous  dataset on sentencing since.  The
              results of this research will advance sociolegal theory about corporate
              criminal sentencing in federal courts and advance or knowledge of how people's
              behavior does or does not conform to legal notions of managerial duty.   %%%
