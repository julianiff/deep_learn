Abstract    :
              ***  ***  9730464  Duch    This investigation identifies, explores, and explains
              the evolving political and economic preferences of citizens in new African
              democracies.  How committed are African elites to the political and economic
              freedoms introduced by reform movements in the late 1980s and early 1990s?  How
              popular are liberalization initiatives among ordinary citizens?    Beyond these
              empirical questions, for which currently there is little information, lie
              issues of broad theoretical import.  Are there relationships between support
              for political democracy and support for a market economy?  Are attitudes to
              reform manifest in political and economic behavior?  At stake here is the
              emergence of a political and economic culture that can help a fragile regime of
              democratic capitalism to survive and, over the long run, to consolidate.   
              Designed comparatively, this collaborative investigation elicits
              individual-level data from both mass and elite actors by means of national
              probability sample surveys in three countries.  Data are gathered and analyzed
              by the investigators each working closely with a partner research institution
              in Benin and Ghana.  These countries differ significantly in terms of their
              colonial experiences, cultural and ethnic characteristics, recent economic
              history and endowments, and institutional experiences.  Thus, sub-Saharan
              Africa offers social scientists a rich diversity of settings in which to
              comparatively evaluate explanations of support for democratic capitalism.  ***
