Abstract    :
                9730462  Henrik    Materials are developed to teach field inquiry techniques
              through the study of elephant seal biology.  A continuously updated database of
              images and environmental data from an elephant seal rookery is provided to
              students nation-wide via the World Wide Web.  Other web materials are designed
              to teach field inquiry techniques with an in-depth set of modules covering key
              aspects of elephant seal biology including natural selection, behavior,
              reproduction, physiology, metabolism, genetics, population and conservation
              biology.  A graduate studnet researcher will maintain a menu of frequently
              asked questions and responses for teachers to consult.  Materials on the web
              include virtual tours of the Island where the seal rookery is located in
              Mexico.  The materials are bicultural and include an introductory video in both
              Spanish and English.
