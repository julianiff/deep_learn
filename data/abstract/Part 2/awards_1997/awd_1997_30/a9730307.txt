Abstract    :
              9730307  Bjork    "BioLogica" (TM) is a Java-platform, computer-based
              manipulative that enables students to explore a variety of different genetic
              phenomena building their own knowledge through direct observation and
              manipulation.  As the successor to GenScope, it allows high school and middle
              school students to conduct real experiments in a virtual environment through
              the observation and study of Mandolin genetics in real or imaginary organisms
              at six different levels: DNA, chromosome, cell, organism, pedigree, and
              population.  This project develops scripted software called interactivities
              that applies the BioLogica engine to different organisms.  These
              interactivities can be customized to treatments in specific texts and provide
              alternative learning consistent with wet labs and other hands-on activities. 
              The project integrates software with biology curricula to produce materials
              that allow teachers to introduce the software into their practice and students
              to reap the benefits of using complementary ways to learn.  Teachers can use
              the scripts to develop their own materials or use them in conjunction with
              proven texts.  The materials also provide teachers logs of student work and
              embedded assessments.  The new materials are developed with the input from
              teachers and tested in schools.  An extensive evaluation provides data on
              student learning.
