Abstract    :
              9730847  Kubodera    This  award provides funds to permit Drs. Kuniharu Kubodera
               and  Fred  Myhrer,  Department of  Physics  and  Astronomy,  University of
              South Carolina, to pursue with Dr.  Hyun  Kyu  Lee, Department of Physics,
              Hanyang University, and Dr. Tae-  Sun  Park,  Center for Theoretical Physics,
              Seoul  National  University,  Seoul,  Korea, for 36  months,  a  program  of 
              cooperative   research  on  chiral  symmetry  and   nuclear  physics.   This 
              investigation will focus on  studying  the  dynamics  of hadronic and nuclear
              systems with a particular  emphasis on the relation to underlying chiral
              symmetry  and  the  consequences  of  nuclear chiral perturbation  theory.  The
              researchers will address several specific phenomena  of  great  current
              interest that concern nuclear  and  hadronic  systems in normal and extreme
              environments.    This project will initiate new collaboration with nuclear 
              theorists at Hanyang University and Seoul National  University.  Such
              collaboration will add an international  dimension to research presently funded
              under NSF Grant No.  PHY-9602000.  The U.S. researchers expect this new 
              collaboration to enhance the productivity of their local  research group.  This
              project is relevant to the objectives  of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science
              Program which seeks to  increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and
              Korean  scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific 
              information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through  collaboration on
              problems of mutual benefit.  Korean  participation is supported by the Korea
              Science and  Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).  ***
