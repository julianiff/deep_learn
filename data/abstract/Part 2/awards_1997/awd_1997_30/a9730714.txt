Abstract    :
              9730714  Moore    Duke University is developing a family of web-based,
              interactive modules for use by high school students who have completed a
              yearlong calculus course.  These materials will support an independent,
              self-paced, post-calculus that emphasizes applications.  Additionally, the
              modules may be used by high school teachers for enhancement study.  The modules
              are written in HTML with a companion computer algebra system file (e.g. Maple
              of Mathematica) that can be downloaded onto the user's local machine.  On-line
              guides are provided for students and faculty, workshops are provided for
              faculty monitors and special summer workshops for other undergraduate schools
              that are interested in adopting the program.
