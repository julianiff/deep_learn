Abstract    :
              9730038  Maughan  The overall goal of the proposed research by Drs. Maughan and
              Vigoreaux is to understand the molecular basis of the high power output of
              insect flight muscle, using Drosophila melanogaster as the experimental
              organism.  The PIs postulate that the extended N-terminal amino acid sequence
              of a regulatory protein (the myosin regulatory light chain, or RLC) on the
              motor molecule of muscle plays a key role in the amplification of its stretch
              activation response.  By helping to understand the relationship between
              structure and function of the myosin regulatory light chain in Drosophila, this
              study will help advance our understanding of the molecular basis of muscle
              contraction and enhanced power output.
