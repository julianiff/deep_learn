Abstract    :
              9730087  Gates    ABSTRACT: The Department of Geological Sciences at Rutgers, in
              collaboration with the Liberty Science Center, the New York State Museum,
              Palisades Interstate Park Commission, Appalachian Trail Conference, and
              ABS-Capital Cities, Inc., has a planning grant to develop a universal model
              that will encourage science education in conjunction with outdoor recreational
              activities in wilderness parks near urban centers.  The initial effort will
              focus on the Harriman and Bear Mountain State Parks and the Sterling Forest
              lands, all near New York City.  Current plans for the full project include
              development of:  1) an illustrated guidebook describing the features chosen as
              "exhibits" at the sites, 2) a map showing locations of the "exhibits", 3)
              plaques marking the features of the exhibits, 4) proposals for new trails to
              access outstanding botanical and geological features, 5) a web site with
              virtual reality filed trips of the sites chosen, 6) museum displays and media
              programs at Liberty Science Center, the New York State Museum, and other sites,
              7) regular field trips from Liberty Science Center, New York State Museum, and
              Bear Mountain Trailside Museum, 8) workshops for high school teachers, and 9)
              special project to get more public use of the park resources.  During the
              planning stage the project will gather data on public interest, determine the
              most effective means of dissemination, identify and contact other organizations
              and scientist that could contribute to the full project, and develop a
              coordination plan and schedule for this complex project.   Small examples
              and/or written descriptions of the web-site, the guidebook stops, museum
              displays, and field trips will also be produced in the planning phase.
