Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry   Program
              supports research in the laboratories of Dr. M. Frederick   Hawthorne  at the
              University of California, Los Angeles. The research to   be performed involves
              the development of macromolecular assemblies based   upon icosahedral
              carboranes. Utilizing nucleophilic substitution,   dicarbollide preparation, or
              electrophilic halogenation, ortho-, meta-,   and para-icosahedral carboranes
              will be functionalized with hydrophobic   or hydrophilic moieties. Linear
              assemblies, carborods, will be   synthesized using para-carboranes alone or in
              combination with   linear-bifunctional linking groups. The ionic association
              and   thermotropic liquid-crystal characteristics of carborods will be  
              examined. Cyclic assemblies, carboracycles and mercuracarborands, will be  
              synthesized using ortho- or meta- carboranes and bifunctional-spacer   groups. 
              The host-guest interactions, electrophilic catalytic activity,   and lyotropic
              liquid-crystal characteristics of carboracycles and   mercuracarborands will be
              investigated. Additional research topics   include the functionalization of
              decakismethyl para-carborane and   investigation of dicarbollide reactivity. 
              Exploration of molecular self-assembly will lead to the development of   unique
              molecular architectures and advance our understanding of the  
              interrelationship of structure and function. This research may lead to   the
              development of analytical probes for molecular recognition and new   catalysts.
