Abstract    :
               The aim of this research is to analyze how people of different cultures exhibit
              similar understandings of the meanings of words in particular semantic domains
              such as emotions.  Using an interview technique developed in cognitive science
              that elicits judgments of similarity between terms, and produces
              multidimensional maps of similarity-distance of terms, the project will elicit
              data from a range of respondents in different languages and cultural contexts
              (bi-lingual English-Japanese Japanese students in the US as well as in Japan,
              Chinese respondents from Taiwan in China and in the US, as well as other
              non-Indo-European language speakers).  The study will examine the changes in
              the patterns of similarity meanings elicited from respondents with varying
              degrees of multiple-language use, from monolingual to fully bilingual speakers.
               The technique used will allow the PI to estimate the proportion of variation
              that is culturally specific as compared with variation due to universal
              patterns and individual characteristics.  The role of gender in predicting this
              semantic domain structure will also be examined. The significance of this
              project is that it will advance our understanding of the extent of universal
              features in semantic domains, as well as provide new methods for the discovery
              of patterns of meaning in linguistic terms.  The findings will contribute to an
              understanding of the extent to which there is an underlying `psychic unity`
              among all human cultures.
