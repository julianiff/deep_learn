Abstract    :
              Weatherly  9730120  Funds are provided to complete the analysis, interpretation 
              an synthesis of  current meter mooring and hydrographic data collected in the 
              South Atlantic  under the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). The 
              analysis will focus  on the transport and heat flux associated with the flow of
               North Atlantic Deep  Water and Antarctic Bottom Water in the Brazil Basin. In 
              addition, a  collaboration with French Oceanographers to analyze the 
              hydrographic data  they collected in the South Atlantic will expand this study 
              of abyssal circulation  to the whole western South Atlantic.
