Abstract    :
                  9730698  Casey    Boston College plans to design, develop, evaluate, and
              disseminate innovative mathematics instructional materials for teaching spatial
              skills, spatial patterning, and geometric concepts at the kindergarten level. 
              These stand-alone modules will center on the creation of multicultural stories
              that pose geometry and spatial problems.  Kindergartners will solve the
              problems using manipulatives and other hands-on materials.  Based on NCTM and
              NAEYC recommendations, these instructional materials will do the following:  1.
              Incorporate gender, racial, and ethnic diversity in the mathematics curriculum
              in a substantive way;  2. Integrate mathematics learning through the
              kindergarten curriculum using developmentally appropriate practices; and  3.
              Shift the focus of early mathematics education from a mainly arithmetic-based
              curriculum to one that incorporates geometry and spatial skills.
