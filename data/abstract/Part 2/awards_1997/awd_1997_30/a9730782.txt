Abstract    :
              9730782  Latz  This interdisciplinary project is to examine the shear
              sensitivity of marine dinoflagellates, one of the most shear-sensitive
              organisms known.  Luminescent dinoflagellates respond essentially
              instantaneously to mechanical stimulation via a unique and easily monitored
              bioluminescent effector system.  These plant-like cells will be used as a model
              system for investigating fundamental questions in sensory biology with
              important engineering applications.  The main questions relating to the
              mechanosensory signal transduction pathway are: (1) what is the role of G
              proteins in signal transduction; (2) how is applied mechanical stress related
              to fluid shear stress and cell strain; and (3) how is shear sensitivity
              affected by the cytoskeleton?  ***
