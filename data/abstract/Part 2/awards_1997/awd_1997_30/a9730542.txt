Abstract    :
              9730542  Forsyth           This project will compare repeated bathymetric and
              side-  scan sonar surveys along a three-hundred kilometer long  segment of the
              very fast-spreading East Pacific Rise to  detect possible changes in seafloor
              morphology associated  with eruptions, exial-caldera collapse, off-axis
              faulting,  or inflation or deflation of the axial magma chamber.  over  the
              past two years, four cruises have resurveyed the East  Pacific Rise along the
              same track lines; three times with  the same multibeam system, providing an
              optimum survey  strategy to solve changes in seafloor elevation and 
              reflectivity.
