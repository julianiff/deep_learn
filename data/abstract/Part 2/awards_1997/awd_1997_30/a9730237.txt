Abstract    :
                During a decision, people tend to distort new information to make it seem more
              favorable to the leading alternative than it really is.  The present research
              explores this predecisional distortion of information in several ways.  First,
              what are its causes?  Is distortion a sacrifice of decision accuracy in order
              to preserve consistency among all evaluations, to reduce effort, or to maintain
              a more positive mood based on a successful progression toward a clear decision?
               Alternatively, is distortion caused by using consistency as a misguided signal
              of accuracy?  Second, what are its implications?  Can manipulating the order or
              format (but not the content) of information influence the alternative that
              people choose?  The answer may well be yes.  Third, what are the limits of
              information distortion?  Does it extend to the evaluation of single
              alternatives as well as to choices, to objective decisions, to predictions of
              future events, to very precise information like single numbers (e.g., prices)? 
              Finally, how can people eliminate or at least reduce information distortion so
              that they do not end up choosing an inferior alternative?  Will warning alone
              work?  Does the apparatus of multiattribute utilities analysis prevent
              distortion?  And last, does deciding in a group help (or hurt)?  In many
              important real decisions, information is acquired sequentially (e.g., filling a
              job, market research, and medical diagnosis).  Furthermore, organizational
              pressure to justify the next step in the information-gathering sequence may
              enhance distortion (rather than detecting biased judgment).  In sum, there are
              material implications of the information distortion phenomenon for decision
              making in real, consequential situations.
