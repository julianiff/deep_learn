Abstract    :
              9730728  Barstow    This is an integrated high school curriculum called
              "Astrobiology - The Search for Life On Other Worlds" that is developed by TERC,
              Inc. in collaboration with NASA.  The course explores such topics as how
              planets form, what physical and biochemical conditions are required for the
              origin of life, how the evolutionary tree for terrestrial organisms is
              constructed , what evidence exists for the possibility of life on Mars and
              Europa, and how space missions gather additional evidence and search for
              extraterrestrial intelligence.  The course covers basic concepts traditionally
              taught in biology, chemistry, geology and physics courses and thus is an
              integrated science course for high school students.  The curricular materials
              are delivered in a printed Teacher's Guide, a printed Student Research Manual,
              a CD-ROM with images and data, and a website.
