Abstract    :
              The research is directed toward improved modeling of urban climates.  An
              existing simulation model will be extended and improved by: (a) considering a
              wider range of conditions (seasons, meteorological conditions, canyon
              geometries) in the simulations; (b) incorporating more complex, but realistic,
              components that will account for buoyancy effects, moist surfaces, and
              advection; (c) eliminating unrealistic aspects of the current model; and (d)
              validating the model against observational studies in the literature.  The
              model can then be used to investigate the causal elements of urban
              microclimates, and it will also serve as a tool to be used by planners
              concerned with urban design. Results from this type of modeling are likely to
              become more important in the design of future cities given that urbanization is
              increasing at an unprecedented rate and there is greater concern with human
              comfort and safety in urban environments.
