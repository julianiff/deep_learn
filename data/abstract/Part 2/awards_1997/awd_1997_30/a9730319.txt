Abstract    :
                This dissertation project involves testing the relations among law, state
              institutional capacity, and societal transformation by conducting and in-depth
              historical analysis of early implementation of Title VII of the 1964 Civil
              Rights Act.  Despite ant initially ambiguous statues and weak enforcing agency,
              Title VII was aggressively enforced and has had an enormous impact on the
              resources available to minority groups in the workforce.  The research explores
              primary documents in presidential libraries, EEOC's administrative  history
              from its archives, and the memos, papers, and correspondences of influential
              organizations such as the NAACP will provide data.  The results of this
              research will advance sociolegal theory about state centered enforcement and
              state institutional transformation and offer tests of the conditions under
              which 'weak' state administrative structures become `strong.`   %%%  This
