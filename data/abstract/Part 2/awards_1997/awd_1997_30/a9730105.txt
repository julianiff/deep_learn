              Resource Management for the Integrated Services Internet      The IETF has
              defined several key components for enabling an integrated services Internet: 
              (1) service classes, which define the service models for supporting end-to-end
              per-flow QoS, (2) a link sharing model, which defines how different
              organizational entities  (agencies) can share the same physical resources, and
              (3) a resource reservation protocol, which provides the signaling mechanisms to
              support these services.    While these capabilities are indeed revolutionary as
              compared to the current Internet, serious impediments remain to achieving the
              vision of a ubiquitous multi-service Internet.  In particular, efficient 
              resource management algorithms must be available that actually deliver these
              services to the applications. Packet scheduling algorithms must be devised that
              can meet the service requirements of heterogeneous applications and different
              agencies while, at the same time, exploiting statistical multiplexing;
              admission control algorithms must be designed to allocate the minimum amount of
              network resources without violating any of the service requirements.  At
              present, no set of resource management algorithms is available that can provide
              multi-service capabilities while considering the complex dynamics among
              connections, services, and agencies.    This project will provide the first
              truly integrated resource management infrastructure for multi-service networks.
              Taking a new and comprehensive approach at resource management algorithms
              within the framework of the integrated services Internet, we propose to
              develop:    (1) A novel hierarchical link sharing service model and algorithm
              that simultaneously supports all of the services proposed by the IETF without
              sacrificing efficient utilization  of network resources,    (2) Traffic control
              and scheduling algorithms that are amenable to efficient implementation in high
              speed and scalable switching systems,    (3) Admission control algorithms for
              an enforceable controlled-load service with statistical quality of service
              guarantees,     (4) Robust admission control algorithms for measurement-based
              controlled-load services, and     (5) Traffic control algorithms that provide
              graceful quality-of-service adaptation in the presence of transient
              fluctuations of the network load.    This project will develop the theoretical
              underpinnings of integrated resource management algorithms for multi-service
              networks. Moreover, in a collaboration that involves an integrated services
              network provider (MCI Telecommunications), a network equipment vendor (Ascend),
              and academic researchers (CMU, Rice, Polytechnic), the PIs will build a
              complete prototype implementation of the proposed algorithms on the vBNS
              national network infrastructure. This reference implementation will provide a
              first-of-its-kind platform for experimental research on the integrated services
              Internet that will yield critical input to both practitioners in the field and
              standards bodies on the effectiveness of current and newly proposed resource
              management algorithms.
