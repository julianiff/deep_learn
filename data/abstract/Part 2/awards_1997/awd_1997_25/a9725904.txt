Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT  Crumpton  EEC-9725904  Mississippi State      This award provides
              support for a two-year, Research Opportunity Award to Mississippi State
              University.  The overall goal of this research project is to evaluate the
              effects of the total body fatigue on human reliability.  The research work will
              be performed at the I/UCRC on Ergonomics at the Texas A&M University, by an
              Assistant Professor from the Department of Industrial Engineering at
              Mississippi State University.
