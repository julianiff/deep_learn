Abstract    :
              9725131  Encarnaci n  Flood basalts represent voluminous (millions of cubic km)
              amounts of magma that were emplaced on continental crust.  AU1 The combined
              Karoo and Ferrar (in Africa and Antarctica, respectively) flood basalt province
              is the oldest and largest of a series of flood basalt provinces that punctuated
              the breakup of the Gondwana supercontinent. Although the Ferrar and the
              southern part of the Karoo province appear to have been emplaced synchronously,
              and over a short interval  (in about 1 million years) the timing and duration
              of the northern Karoo province is poorly constrained. Were the northern parts 
              of the Karoo magmatic province emplaced over a brief period, and were they
              synchronous with the southern province? What is the timing of early alkaline
              magmatism in relation to the dominant tholeiitic magmatism, and the later
              rhyolitic events in the north? Are there any younger magmatic events that may
              be associated with final rupture of Africa and Antarctica and seafloor
              spreading? Answers to these questions bear on the magmatic evolution of this
              large igneous province, its relationship to mantle thermal anomalies (plumes?),
              lithospheric extension, and continental breakup, and may provide insight to the
              relationship between flood basalt events and mass extinctions. This project
              aims to approach these issues by obtaining precise age constraints on a variety
              of samples in the Karoo province.       AU1
