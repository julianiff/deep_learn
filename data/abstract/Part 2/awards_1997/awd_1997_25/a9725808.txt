Abstract    :
              9725808  Helmberger    This research is a continuation of highly successful work
              to map  details of earth structure by means of seismic tomography and 
              wave-form matching.  Significant results include the discovery of 
              ultra-low-velocity zones just above the core-mantle boundary,  whole mantle
              convection, and seismic anisotropy in the earth's  inner core.  The research
              continuation will concentrate on the  physical shapes and locations of the
              ultra-low-velocity zones,  the characteristics of inner-core anisotropy in
              terms of strength  distribution and orientation, the agreement of tomographic
              3-D  models with observed wave forms traveling through the structures,  and the
              sharpness of the upper-mantle transition zones, 410 km  and 640 km, as a
              function of tectonic environment.  ***
