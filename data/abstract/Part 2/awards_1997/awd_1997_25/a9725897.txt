Abstract    :
              9725897  Rossman    This grant provides partial support of the costs of
              acquiring a  new Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer for structural 
              mineralogic and petrologic research at the California Institute  of Technology.
               A state-of-the-art Nicolet FTIR spectrometer will  replace Caltech's current
              Nicolet 60SX FTIR spectrometer which  was purchased in 1984.  This new
              instrument will provide over an  order of magnitude greater sensitivity for
              analyses of volatile  components (primarily H2O and OH-) within minerals and
              glasses  relative to their current FTIR spectrometer.    Rossman's research
              focuses on the quantitative analysis of  hydrous components (H2O and OH-) in
              minerals and glasses and has  shown hydrogen to be one of the most pervasive
              elements in the  crust and upper mantle.  This research has had a major impact
              on  our understanding of the hydrogen budget of the Earth and has  profound
              implications for the rheology and electronic properties  of the crust and upper
              mantle.  This grant provides the latest  tool for continued research in mineral
              spectroscopy including  studies of the behavior of water and hydroxide through
              mineral  phase changes and studies of volatiles in inclusions, mantle 
              silicates, basaltic magmas, experimental high-pressure run  products and
              synthetic zeolites.  ***
