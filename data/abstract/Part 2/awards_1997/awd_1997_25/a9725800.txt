                                        Abstract                      P.I. Giacomo DiTullio   
                                     OPP97-25800    Preliminary dimethylsulfide (DMS) and 
              dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) data indicate that  Phaeocystis antarctica
              plays an important role in carbon and  sulfur cycling in the Ross Sea.  High
              sediment DMSP and DMS  concentrations, coupled with deep (> 400m) fluorescence 
              peaks, suggest that the carbon export flux associated with  Phaeocystis blooms
              may be significantly underestimated.  The  Phaeocystis-associated carbon flux
              to deep water also may  have important implications for the glacial iron
              hypothesis.  For example, if silicate depletion in the subantarctic zone 
              occurred, then enhanced eolian iron deposition during the  last glacial maximum
              may have preferentially stimulated  Phaeocystis populations.  Phaeocystis
              blooms in the marginal  ice zone may sequester carbon and promoted a decrease
              in  atmospheric pCO2.  The proposed research will measure DMS  and DMSP
              concentrations in the water column, sediments and  in the atmosphere of the
              Ross Sea as part of the ROAVERRS  project. In particular, we propose to
              determine the  significance of Phaeocystis blooms in the Ross Sea to carbon 
              and sulfur fluxes to deep water and to the benthos.  Phytoplankton species
              composition will be compared to DMS  dynamics and to DMSP fluxes to the
              sediments.  In addition,  the cycling of DMS and DMSP, and the relationship
              between  DMS production/consumption and atmospheric concentrations  will be
              examined.
