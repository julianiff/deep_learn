Abstract    :
              9725711  Wiltschko   There is a general consensus that high fluid pressure is an
              important controlling mechanism for the evolution of accretionary prisms and
              the motion of individual thrust sheets in a continental fold and thrust belt. 
              However, the existence of such high fluid pressure in ancient thrust belts
              remains problematical for lack of direct evidence in ancient continental thrust
              belts, this project will develop a more complete hydromechnical model of a
              layered wedge that incorporates strength and hydraulic heterogeneity.  Data on
              actual mechanical properties of rocks such as yield strength, strain
              hardening/softening behavior and hydrologic permeability will be included in a
              finite element analysis.  Results should provide a critical wedge model that
              includes these important hydrologic and mechanical parameters so that the role
              of high fluid pressure during rock deformation can be properly assessed.
