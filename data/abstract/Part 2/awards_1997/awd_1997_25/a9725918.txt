Abstract    :
              9725918  Brook  This award supports a project to develop and apply a new 
              technique for quantifying temperature changes in the past  based on the
              thermodynamic principle of thermal diffusion,  in which gas mixtures in a
              temperature gradient become  fractionated.  Air in polar firn is fractionated
              by  temperature gradients induced by abrupt climate change, and  a record of
              this air is preserved in bubbles in the ice.  The magnitude of the abrupt
              temperature change, the precise  relative timing, and an estimate of the
              absolute temperature  change can be determined.  By providing a gas-phase 
              stratigraphic marker of temperature change, the phasing of  methane (with
              decadal precision) and hence widespread  climate change (relative to local
              polar temperature changes)  can be determined (across five abrupt warming
              events during  the last glacial period).
