Abstract    :
              ***  9725976  Roman      As part of the JGOFS Synthesis and Modeling Initiative,
              Drs.  Roman and Dam will synthesize JGOFS mesozooplankton  research. A major
              objective of the JGOFS Synthesis efforts  will be to determine how food web
              structure influences  carbon cycling within the euphoric and the sinking carbon
               flux. Mesozooplankton grazing (consumption of phytoplankton  and protozoa),
              sloppy feeding (DOM release), fecal pellet  production and downward carbon
              transport due to diel  vertical migrators (part of carbon export) are essential
               elements of this analysis. Although this proposal focuses on  mesozooplankton,
              the our efforts will be collaborative with  other JGOFS synthesis efforts. They
              will participate with  other groups who are synthesizing and modeling
              biological  control of biogeochemical fluxes. Using the JGOFS datasets  from
              the Sargasso Sea (ZOOSWAT), North Atlantic (NABE),  Equatorial Pacific (EqPac),
              Arabian Sea (ASPS) and Southern  Ocean (AESOPS, when available), as well as
              other appropriate  data (i.e. from VERTEX and SUPER) they will examine the 
              predictive relationships between mesozooplankton biomass,  grazing and fecal
              pellet production with phytoplankton  biomass (by size), protozoa biomass,
              total primary  production (by size), new production and export flux. The 
              results will provide essential parameters for realistic  models of carbon
              cycling in the euphoric zone.  ***
