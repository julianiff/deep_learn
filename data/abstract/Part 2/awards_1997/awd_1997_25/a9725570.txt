Abstract    :
              9725570  Wiltschko   The dynamics of fold and thrust belts has received
              considerable theoretical and field attention due to their role in collision and
              mountain-building.  A leading model is based on the idea that a fold/thrust
              system maintains a specific wedge taper by deforming internally.  Rigorous test
              of the wedge model requires data on the motion of thrust belt structures.  This
              project takes advantage of the high rate of growth of the Taiwan arc-continent
              collision to study fold and thrust belt motion, principally by use of extensive
              GPS data.  Results are expected to illuminate relative roles of folding and
              faulting both at the thrust front and across the belt, document the uplift and
              displacements of structures and to help discriminate and geodynamic models,
              including the wedge model for fold and thrust belts.
