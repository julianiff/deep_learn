Abstract    :
              9725792  Silver    This study will investigate how the distribution of strain
              rates  across the Papua New Guinea (PNG) convergent margin evolves from 
              oceanic subduction at the New Britain trench to the broader  continental
              collision.  Because the overall rates of motion are  high, a geodetic network
              in PNG can be used to determine the  extent to which deformation is distributed
              rather than focused on  discrete faults and the degree to which the primary
              basal  decollement is locked.  Working together with scientists from  Australia
              and PNG, the P.I.s will measure an expanded GPS network  (48 sites) across the
              Huon Peninsula and Finisterre Range and  across the Markham valley to the New
              Guinea Highlands, an area of  approximately 350 x 350 km.  They will occupy the
              expanded network  during June, 1998, and again in June, 2000.  Purchasing an 
              additional instrument, an Ashtech Z-12, to leave in PNG between  campaigns,
              will give scientists at UNITECH the opportunity to  remeasure baselines between
              campaigns, an effort of great value  for the study of interseismic and
              intraseismic slip.  ***
