Abstract    :
              9725910  McIntosh  This award is for support for a project to establish a
              detailed  record of volcanism at Mt. Takahe volcano in Marie Byrd Land that 
              will provide absolute age and elevation data on inland paleo-ice  levels on the
              West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) during the most  recent glacial cycle. 
              Previous work at Mt. Takahe documented  volcanic deposits located on the lower
              flanks that were erupted  beneath, at, or above the level of the WAIS.  These
              deposits have  been dated to between 104,000 and 7,000 years before present and
               suggest that the inland WAIS was much higher during the last  glacial cycle
              than it is today.   The inland paleo-ice level can  be used  to test
              conflicting hypotheses about the configuration  of the WAIS in late Wisconsin
              time and the role of  WAIS retreat  in global sea level rise.  Well constrained
              limits on inland  paleo-ice-levels during the past 100,000 years can be
              compared  with global records of climate change in order to assess the 
              relationship between the WAIS and the climate system.  Finally,  precisely
              dated paleo-ice- levels can be used as "hard" input  data for numerical models
              of ice sheet dynamics.
