Abstract    :
              SECME, Inc., formerly the Southeastern Consortium for Minorities in 
              Engineering, has been in existence since 1975 and is structured to  impact the
              educational pursuits of K-12 students and influence  their selection of
              science, engineering and mathematics careers.   SECME programs are now
              established in 12 states.  The organization  provides year-long support for a
              large number of K-12 students.   Since 1980, more than 49,000 SECME
              participants have graduated from  high school.  The partnership brings together
              students, teachers  and administrators and influences SEM career selection
              through a   variety of institutes, workshops, conferences and competitions.  In
               addition to educational support from more than 65 corporations  and/or
              government agencies.  This program appears to be an  excellent feeder toward
              SEM careers.  The strengths of the nominee  include:        .  Since 1980,
              SECME has coordinated programs which have           mentored an impressive
              number (49,475) of K-12 students, who       have enrolled in post-secondary
              institutions.    .  Documentation indicates that more than 50 percent of the
              SECME       alumni have enrolled in SEM.    .  Data indicate that a large
              number of SECME students enroll in       college.  Currently, five SECME alumni
              are pursuing the Ph.D.       degree.    .  SECME has imparted the educational
              exposure of minorities by       influencing enhancement of both teaching and
              learning at the       K-12 level.    .  In 1996, SECME received the National
              Action Council for       Minorities in Engineering (NACME) Reginald H. Jones
              Award for       its influence on the education of minority groups.    .  As a
              model SECME involves students, teachers, faculty and       administrators
              through a team approach.    .  Linkages with several K-16 systems have already
              been           established.    .  The SECME network demonstrates collaboration
              among businesses,        governmental agencies, foundations, universities,
              school       systems, students and parents.    .  SECME's  impact on the K-12
              system has been documented and is        significant.    .  SECME, as an
              enhancement program, has the potential for          improving K-16 education
              and impacting the SEM careers.    In summary, this nomination for the
              Presidential Awards for  Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering
              Mentoring is a  great one.  The organization has been in existence since 1975
              and  has reached over 50,000 students.  The impact on enhancing the  number of
              students pursuing science careers has been excellent.   The organization has
              had steady success with its impact on  students.
