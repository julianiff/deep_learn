Abstract    :
                In  the field of biological sciences, there is a sense of  expectation and
              conviction that it is timely to provide  training to students, postdoctoral
              fellows and investigators  the most up-to-date developments in the theory and 
              application of sedimentation. Beckman Instruments takes the  leadership role in
              establishing and financing an annual  symposium, the first of which will be
              held at the campus  of the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas
               from November 14 to 16, 1997.
