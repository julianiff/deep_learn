Abstract    :
              9725817  Rowley   The India-Asia collision, being the only active example of a
              continent-continent collision, has been from many points of view.  However,
              many conclusions hinge on knowing accurately when the ocean floor between India
              and Asia was consumed and the two continental masses touched.  This project
              will address this by studying a sequence of strata in the Nieru valley region o
              f the High Himalayan which likely preserves a syn-collisional stratigraphic
              sequence.  Mapping and biostratigraphic dating of this sequence is expected to
              document the syn-collisional nature and to accurately date the event.  
              Results, when combined with other evidence will begin to address not only
              timing of initial contact, but also explore possible diachroneity along the
              suture.
