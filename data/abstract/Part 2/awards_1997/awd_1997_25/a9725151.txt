Abstract    :
                The main force of the Association for Women in Science (AWIS)    Mentoring
              Project model stems from its ability to be    replicated nationwide.  With AWIS
              presentations made    throughout the United States, at a UN Conference on Women
              in    Beijing, China (1995), in the former Soviet Union, South    Africa, and
              throughout Europe, this mentoring model has    realized international influence
              and distinction.  The program    has reached across disciplines with diverse
              organizations    participating such as Americorps, Association for Women in   
              Mathematics, U.S. Department of Energy, Iowa Department of    Transportation,
              and the U.S. Forest Service; corporations such    as Bell Atlantic Foundation
              or The Scripps Research Institute;    and institutions such as Edmunds
              Community College, Iowa State    University, and Stanford University.  The
              strengths of the  nominee include:        .  Have created a national model for
              attracting female students       into science.    .  Model strategy has been
              adapted in many institutions.    .  The multi-strength nature of the program.  
               .  The program has mentored over 6,000 female students since       1990.    In
              summary, this nomination for the Presidential Awards for  Excellence in
              Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring is  an excellent one.  The
              program has produced numerous written  materials that other
              institutions/organizations have used to  implement successful mentoring models
              of their own.  Through its  large scale operation and influence, the AWIS
              mentoring  project is significantly increasing the number of women  scientists
              who can in turn be mentors for others just beginning  their training.
