Abstract    :
              EEC-9725036  Pamela A. Eibeck  Northern Arizona University  "Integrating
              Practice into Advanced Engineering Education"      ABSTRACT      This award
              provides funding for a practice-oriented Master of Engineering degree to be
              developed,  coordinated, and implemented among three Arizona state-supported
              universities:  Northern Arizona University, Arizona State University, and the
              University of Arizona.  This graduate program is a shift from a
              "university-centered" research-oriented graduate education to a
              "student-centered" program in which practicing engineers define individualized
              programs of advanced study, choosing among course materials at any of the three
              state universities and obtain instruction, delivered via multiple delivery
              modes, as one-credit hour modules.   This award will develop 36 one-credit hour
              modules of instruction and support dissemination of project outcomes through
              conference presentations and a workshop to be held at Northern Arizona
              University.  The participating universities will contribute instructional
              technology equipment and market analysis; industry will contribute employee
              time for collaborative activities, including course development and
              instruction.
