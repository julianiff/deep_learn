Abstract    :
              9725682  Rose  This proposal is aimed at the investigation of the first week or
              so of interaction between volcanic clouds and the atmosphere, when silicates
              are still present or maybe even dominant. We will use data jointly obtained
              from two satellite detectors: a) a two band infrared detection system that is
              aboard many satellites and which retrieves data on the size and masses of
              silicate particles, and b) an ultraviolet detector (TOMS), which is capable of
              measuring SO2 and can also provide data on silicates. Our research foci are to:
              1) investigate the shape of volcanic particles with long (>2 hrs) atmospheric
              residence; 2) study the occurrences of anomalous distal fallout (ADF), where
              fallout of fine ash occurs in unusual thicknesses very far from the volcano
              after tens of hours in the atmosphere; and 3) investigate the chemical
              interaction of irregular volcanic silicates with gases in the volcanic cloud,
              including the wettability of the ash and the adsorption of SO2 and other gases
              on ash surfaces. The primary goal of this research is to produce a quantitative
              shape index for use in calculating the fallout rates of small particles. The
              proposed research is driven by the issue of aircraft hazards of volcanic clouds
              and by the need to understand the potential hazards of distal fallout based
              explaining past events in the geologic record.
