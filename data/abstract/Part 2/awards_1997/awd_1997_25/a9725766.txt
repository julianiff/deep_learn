Abstract    :
              9725766  Wernicke    It is unclear if intracontinental plate boundaries, usually
               expressed as wide zones of diffuse deformation, behave as a system  of
              microplates, or as a continuum.  The Great Basin is a prime  example of an area
              that behaves in this way.  To determine if the  observed strain pattern of
              today reflects a microplate trend, an 18  station GPS network has been
              established and has been operating for  one year.  This award provides an
              additional three years of funding  to complete a total of four years of
              monitoring the network.  After  such time, the rate uncertainties will be
              sufficient to distinguish  between microplate and continuum behavior.    The
              basic scientific question to be solved will be a better  understanding of
              intracontinental plate boundaries.  This  understanding is a fundamental
              concept to add to our knowledge of  plate tectonics.  In addition, the seismic
              hazard of such areas may  be further quantified.  To such an end, it is
              important to know if  intraplate strain is localized within seismic belts, or
              if  seismicity migrates secularly across a wide zone of relatively  uniform
              strain accumulation.  To solve this question, the Principal  Investigator is
              using a series of GPS stations to compute yearly  displacement in mm/yr and its
              distribution.  From this, stress and  strain can be calculated and the stress
              field examined to answer  these questions.  ***
