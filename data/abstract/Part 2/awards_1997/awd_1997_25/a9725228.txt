The investigation will study a number of the projects
              that NSF is funding which students collect, share, and analyze real-world data
              in the course of conducting scientific investigations. IN these projects to
              date, the data gathering and sharing activities have gone more smoothly than
              the data ansalysis, in which many students and teachers have struggled.  Such
              difficulties pose a serious barrier to fostering authentic mathematics and
              science learning and to enabling shared inquiry among students and scientists. 
              This research will study the nature of the data analysis problems to provide a
              specific information that can help current projects better support data
              analysis skills, and a research base that can inform the development of future
              data analysis projects, materials, software, and teacher development efforts. 
              The study will focus on issues such as data authenticity, tractability, and
              accessibility to students and teachers.  Major products will include (1)
              analyses of individual projects' data sets, including and assessment of the
              extent to which interesting and interpretable findings can be reached and
              suggestions on how to make this data more accessible to students, and (2) a
              technical report that summarizes major findings, includes representative case
              studies that highlight both the problems and possibilities of students
              analyzing real world scientific data and makes recommendations about the design
              of data sharing and analysis projects, including ancillary materials and
              tools.
