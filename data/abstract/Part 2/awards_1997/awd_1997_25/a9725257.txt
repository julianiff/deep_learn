Abstract    :
              ***  9725257  This award is to support a project to measure cosmogenic nuclides
              in the Siple Dome ice core. Cosmogenic radionuclides in polar ice cores have
              been used to study long-term variations in several important geophysical
              variables, including solar activity, geomagnetic field, atmospheric
              circulation, snow accumulation rates, and others. The investigators will
              measure profiles of Beryllium-10 (Be-10) and Chlorine-36 (Cl-36) in the entire
              ice core, which spans the time period from the present to about 100,000 years
              before present.  The resulting time series of nuclide concentrations will be
              applied to three main problem areas: deducing the history of solar activity,
              deducing the history of variations in the geomagnetic field, and  a detailed
              comparison of Be-10 and Cl-36 production and the Carbon-14 (C-14)  profile.  It
              will be particularly instructive to compare the Antarctic record with the
              detailed Arctic record from the GISP2 ice core.  ***
