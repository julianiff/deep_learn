Abstract    :
              9725140  Villasenor    This research is a continuation of a cooperative effort
              between the  Colorado School of Mines and the U.S. Geological Survey to 
              systematically relocate historical seismicity based on travel-time  information
              compiled in several catalogs of global seismicity.  A  final product from this
              project, a consistent global earthquake  catalog covering the 20th Century,
              will triple the length of the  current earthquake data bases.  Earthquakes are
              relocated using a  new location algorithm that dynamically re-identifies
              earthquake  phases based on the probability density function of each phase's 
              arrival time derived from modern observations.  This research is a  component
              of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
