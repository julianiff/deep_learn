Abstract    :
                                    Donald B. Siniff                           OPP-9725820    
                                     Abstract    The Weddell seal is found in regions of pack
              ice or fast ice  close to the Antarctic continent. This species has been the 
              focus for long-term population studies in McMurdo Sound  since the mid-1960's.
              This data set, one of the few of its  kind in the world, has provided valuable
              knowledge towards  an understanding of the survival and reproductive patterns 
              of a long-lived vertebrate. Within the framework of this  study, an examination
              of the breeding system and  reproductive fitness will be conducted, using
              recently  developed techniques in molecular biology. An examination of  the
              behavioral ecology and mating system through paternity  analysis of breeding
              males will provide precise estimates of  reproductive success and effective
              population size in this  aquatic breeding species. A second aspect of the study
              will  focus on population demographics, which is a continuation of  the annual
              analyses, parameter estimation and hypothesis  testing associating with the
              existing 30-year data base. A  new addition to this aspect is a comprehensive
              analysis of  the population dynamics focusing on the role that  immigration and
              emigration play in the population dynamics.  As the southern-most breeding
              mammal in the world, the  Weddell seal exemplifies an extreme in environmental 
              adaptability. Knowledge of the strategies employed in this  environment will
              contribute to the basic understanding of  pinniped evolution and population
              dynamics and competition  in marine mammals.
