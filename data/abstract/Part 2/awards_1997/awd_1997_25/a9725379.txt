Abstract    :
              9725379  Sammis    This research is an extension of work that investigated 
              precursory seismicity along the San Andreas Fault and found  that all events
              since 1906 with magnitude greater than 6.5  were preceded by a power-law
              increase in seismic energy  release.  The work aims to address the question of
              whether  the crust is in a continuous state of self-organized  criticality or
              whether large earthquakes produce local  excursions away from criticality.  If
              the latter holds true,  earthquake forecasting may be possible since the
              subsequent  approach back toward criticality is expected to have 
              deterministic, observable characteristics such as the  increase in precursory
              seismicity.  This work will extend  the precursory seismicity study to the
              worldwide catalogs,  studying as many large events in both shear zones and 
              subduction zones as the data allows.  This research is a  component of the
              National Earthquake Hazard Reduction  Program.  ***
