Abstract    :
              9725351  Hauri  This is a geochemical and geochronological study of volcanic
              islands and seamounts comprising the Austral Islands chain of French Polynesia.
              This chain is being studied in order to determine whether the Hawaiian model of
              a focused, narrow mantle plume is an adequate one for describing all aspects of
              the actively convecting part of the Earth's mantle. The Austral Islands are
              differ in almost every aspect from the Hawaiian islands. New Ar-Ar dating of
              lavas and seamounts will be combined with plate-motion reconstructions using
              Pacific pole of rotation fixed by the Hawaiian and Louisville hotspots to
              determine if the size of the Austral anomaly is consistent with a narrow plume,
              a sheet, or a leaky plate over a diffuse warm-spot. Combined geochemical
              studies on lavas, xenoliths, and melt inclusion will address several key
              questions regarding the coupled morphologic and geochemical variation across
              the Austral Fracture Zone including what  role the oceanic lithosphere plays in
              the style and composition of the Austral volcanism. The combined Os, O and He
              isotope studies will help determine if the chemical characteristics of the
              Austral HIMU and EM sources are more consistent with crustal recycling or
              intra-mantle metasomatism.
