Abstract    :
              9725913  Anderson  This is a renewal grant to support theoretical research on 
              high-temperature superconductivity and related phenomena.  The research has a
              two-fold thrust: (1) to exploit the  theoretical framework established during
              the last grant  period both in terms of explanation of the complex array of 
              experimental data available and in terms of broadening,  deepening and making
              more detailed the theoretical basis for  this framework. (2) Using the cuprates
              as a paradigm, to  look for comparable breakdowns of conventional theory in 
              other systems including organic superconductors, spin ladder  compounds and
              mixed-valence electron systems.  %%%  This is a renewal grant to support
