Abstract    :
                                       Castellini                           OPP97-25859       
                                  Abstract    Lipid metabolism is the primary source of
              energy in seals  and accounts for over ninety percent of the resting  metabolic
              rate of these marine mammals. As a consequence,  they have adapted to a high
              fat marine-based diet, large  lipid stores (blubber), a clear reliance on lipid
              for energy  and minimal dependence on carbohydrate metabolism. Beyond  the
              basic requirements of glucose for central nervous system  demands, it appears
              that seals have a variety of metabolic  options for utilizing lipid for almost
              all other  requirements. One intriguing aspect of the lipid based  metabolism
              of seals is their ability to fast for extremely  long periods. Even the pups of
              some species, such as  elephant seals, can go without good or water for several
               months. This metabolism is driven by lipid stores, but  regulation of the
              process is not understood. Questions exist  regarding the transfer of lipids
              between maternal blubber  stores, the milk and the pups. The distribution in
              time and  location of various types of lipid compounds in seals is not  known.
              This project will analyze a unique set of archived  samples of Weddell seal
              blood with the aim of elucidating  some of the questions relating to the lipid
              biochemistry of  fasting in seals. These samples, collected for other 
              purposes, became critical through analysis of the  biochemical parameters
              associated with weaning and long  duration fasting in seal pups. Collaboration
              between Drs.  Castellini and Rea and Dr. Rene Groscolas in France will  lead to
              a better understanding of lipid metabolism in these  Antarctic seals.
