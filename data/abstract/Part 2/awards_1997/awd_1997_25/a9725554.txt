Abstract    :
              9725554  Clark    Glacial record are an important and, in many areas, the only
              archive of late-Pleistocene climate variability from the western U.S.  Alpine
              glaciers are sensitive to relatively small climatic perturbations and can
              respond rapidly (on order of 100-101 km within 101-102yr) to relatively small
              climate change (on order of 1(-2( K).  Developing a chronology of alpine
              glaciation thus represents a significant strategy for extracting paleoclimate
              information associated with late-Pleistocene climate change.  Exposure-ages of
              large boulders from moraines using cosmogenic nuclides offer great promise for
              developing such chronologies, but questions remain as to the level of
              resolution that such an exposure-age chronology can achieve.  Our primary
              objective is to directly date a well-preserved moraine sequence in the Wallowa
              Mountains, OR using cosmogenic nuclides in order to develop a numerical
              chronology of mountain glacier fluctuations.  In addition, we will be able to
              address the issue of whether exposure ages of closely spaced; well-preserved
              moraines having similar weathering characteristics can resolve significant
              differences (i.e., 5-10 ka) in the timing of moraine formation.  Regardless of
              the resolution issue, these data will contribute geographic coverage to
              existing glacial records for examining spatial and temporal late-Pleistocene
              mountain glacier variability.  As a further contribution to evaluating an
              exposure-age chronology based on cosmogenic nuclides, we also propose sampling
              moraines deposited by the northern Yellowstone outlet glacier.  The existing
              U-series and radiocarbon chronology indicate that the moraines represent 3
              major advances of the outlet glacier between 14 and 30 ka.  Our Yellowstone
              data thus will compare the age resolution of a cosmogenic chronology with an
              established (U-series) chronology.
