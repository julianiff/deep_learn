Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT        Comparative Ecosystem Management and Local Participation: From
              the Caribbean to the Bearing Sea    This study assesses the effectiveness of
              local participation in the process and institutions of ecosystem management. 
              Comparative methods are employed to examine a variety of successful,
              unsuccessful and developing cases in the Eastern Caribbean and Alaska involving
              multiple jurisdictions, diverse stakeholders, conflicting and uncertain
              property rights, and a variety of international, national and local political
              entities. The research tests the proposition that managing successfully for
              sustainability requires substantive local participation at all stages of the
              process, from the initial gathering of information, top the building of
              institutions, to the assessment of actual practices.  By focusing on the types
              and effectiveness of participation by locally affected groups in cases that
              have already proven successful or unsuccessful, the study will provide valuable
              lessons for currently unfolding Arctic regional project such as the proposed
              Bering Sea region international heritage park.
