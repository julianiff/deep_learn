Abstract    :
              9725974  McGillicuddy      Coupled physical-biogeochemical models provide a
              useful framework  for testing our ideas about the underlying physical,
              biological and  chemical controls on elemental cycling in the ocean.  Up to
              now,  efforts to do so on basin scales have produced mixed results.  In  this
              project, the investigators will construct the first basin  scale eddy-resolving
              biogeochemical simulations of the North  Atlantic to examine the impact of
              mesoscale processes on large  scale elemental budgets.  A suite of experiments
              is planned what  are based on 1' (coarse), 1/3 (eddy-permitting) and 1/6'
              (eddy-  resolving) CME simulations.  The coarse resolution runs will be  used
              to benchmark the Sarmiento and Fasham results, and serve as a  control run for
              the higher resolution calculations.  Although the  eddy-permitting case will
              most likely not be entirely sufficient  for a comprehensive study of mesoscale
              processes, it does represent  a meaningful intermediated step that will provide
              useful  information without incurring the substantial computational cost of 
              the 1/6' runs.  Understanding gained from these experiments will be  used to
              guide the development of parameterizations for mesoscale  biogeochemical
              processes to permit their inclusion in larger scale  (global) models.
