Abstract    :
              9725864  Filloux    The goal of this project is to characterize
              electromagnetically  Archaean cratonic roots, specifically the root of the
              southern and  central portion of the Slave craton in Canada.  The results of
              this  study will be combined with ongoing broadband magnetotelluric, 
              reflection seismic, passive seismic and related geological studies  of the
              Canadian Lithoprobe Transect SNORCLE to help improve  understanding of the
              nature and origin of deep cratonic roots.   Proven oceanic magnetotelluric
              technology installed in  strategically located lakes on the Archaean Slave
              province will be  used to conduct very deep magnetotelluric probing of cratonic
              root  structure.  Information on the depth extent of the root  electrically,
              any lateral variation in its structure, and its deep  electrical anisotropy
              will be obtained.  These results combined  with those from SNORCLE will help
              address questions on the  structure and composition of the deep crust and
              mantle beneath the  oldest craton and are relevant to the understanding of how
              Archaean  cratons have been modified over the past 4 Ga.  In addition,  various
              hypotheses on the formation of continental lithosphere in  general can be
              tested with the data to be collected.  ***
