Abstract    :
              9725220  Polak    This is a collaborative research project between Elijah  Polak
              and his student, Ismail S. Khalil Bustany, at the  University of California,
              Berkeley, and Liqun Qi and Robert  Wormseley and their students, Zenxin Wei
              from China and Quoc-  Thong Le-Gia from Vietnam, at the University of New South
               Wales, Sydney, Australia, aimed at developing efficient  superlinearly
              converging algorithms for the solution of  minimax problems in engineering
              design. A large number of  engineering design problems, such as design of wind
              and  seismic resistant structures, electronic circuit centering,  and robot
              motion planning, can be cast in the form of  minimax problems.  Because of
              their considerable economic  importance, the construction of efficient
              algorithms is an  important problem. This U.S.-Australia collaboration brings 
              together the expertise in engineering optimization, semi-  finite optimization,
              and local algorithm globalization  available at Berkeley, with the expertise in
              the  construction of superlinearly converging generalized Newton  Type methods
              for nonsmooth optimization and numerical  analysis available in Sydney.
