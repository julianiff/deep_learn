Abstract    :
              9725844  Halgedahl    The P.I. proposes experiments that would establish the
              links among  LEM domain states, remanence, and remanent stability in 
              paleomagnetically significant minerals such as magnetite,  titanomagnetite, and
              hematite.  The field of rock magnetism has  entered an invigorating era in
              which magnetic domain experiments  and theories are converging in key areas. 
              An elegant example of  this convergence is the existence of local energy
              minimum, or LEM,  domain states.  LEM domain states immediately suggest a new 
              mechanism for remanence acquisition and stability in fine magnetic  particles,
              such as those carrying the paleomagnetic record in  rocks.  By this mechanism,
              remanence would not just be controlled  by the pinning of magnetic domain walls
              at defects, but also by  the physical evolution of final LEM states.  Likewise,
              magnetic  stability would depend largely on the energies required for 
              transitions to other LEMs.  The proposed work will address the  linages among
              these effects.  ***
