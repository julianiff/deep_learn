Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  9725616  HILTNER    This collaboration project joins two
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers (I/UCRC) together in a "TIE"
              project "Biodegradable Microlayered Polymer Composite Systems."  The two
              Centers involved in this two year study are the University of Massachusetts
              Lowell's I/UCRC for Biodegradable Polymers and the Case Western Reserve
              University's I/UCRC for Applied Polymers.    The I/UCRC for Applied Polymers
              will generate micro- and nano-layered composite structures using its
              co-extrusion technology.  It will also study and characterize the composites
              produced for degradation.  The I/ UCRC for Biodegradable polymers will study
              the degradation of kinetics resulting from its soil and compost respirometry
              tests.  The results obtained at the I/UCRC for Biodegradable Polymers will
              guide the development of composite structures at the I/UCRC for Applied
              Polymers.
