Abstract    :
              Holocene paleo-environments from the southeastern Barents Sea will be studied to
              track past changes in water and sea-ice characteristics on a century to
              interdecadal scale.  Noticeable ongoing changes in the Arctic natural system
              require better understanding of mechanisms controlling this change.  In
              particular, it is critical to assess variations in Arctic-Atlantic climatic
              interactions in a long-term perspective.  The Barents Sea has been identified
              as a key area for investigating these variations.  A distinct atmospheric and
              hydrographic boundary between Arctic and Atlantic domains crosses the Barents
              Sea, and its bottom sediments record fluctuations in the position of this
              boundary.   Selected sediment cores, recently collected in the southeastern
              Barents Sea in areas with elevated sedimentation rates, will be investigated
              for paleobiological, mineralogical, grain-size, and geochemical composition. 
              Obtained proxy data will allow the estimation of Holocene variations in surface
              and bottom water temperatures and salinities, sea-ice conditions, and
              circulation patterns.  Core stratigraphy will be time-constrained by AMS 14C
              dating of selected calcareous faunal remains.  A resolutions of 100-120 yr is
              expected in the open Barents Sea, and up to 30-50 yr in the adjacent Kola Bay. 
              The study results will test the existence of long-term fluctuations in
              Arctic-Atlantic interactions, a cornerstone for understanding modern Arctic
              climatic changes.
