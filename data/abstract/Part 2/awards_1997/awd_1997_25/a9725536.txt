Abstract    :
              9725536  Magistrale    This research involves the construction, in a forward
              sense, of a 3-  D seismic velocity model of the Imperial Valley, California,
              based  on existing geologic and seismic surveys.  Previous inversions for  the
              velocity structure of the Imperial Valley, although done with  extensive data
              sets, were difficult due to the large seismic  velocity variations over short
              length scales, for example between  crystalline rocks surrounding the basin and
              shallow sediments  within the basin, the poor resolution of inversion at
              shallow  depths, and the lack of accounting of model errors during the 
              inversion.  With the geologic information integrated in a forward  model, it
              will be possible to estimate the model uncertainties, and  properly account for
              those uncertainties during inversion.  An  improved model of faulting and
              crustal structure should result.  This research is a component of the National
              Earthquake Hazard  Reduction Program.  ***
