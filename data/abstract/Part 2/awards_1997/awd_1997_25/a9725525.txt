Abstract    :
              9725525  Lee    This research investigates ways to promote scientific inquiry
              with elementary students from three ethnolinguistic backgrounds. The research
              centers on two issues which are investigated with teachers from different
              linguistic backgrounds: (1) alternative instructional approaches for student
              centered, open-ended exploratory approach in which teachers encourage students
              to generate their own questions about natural phenomena and find answers on
              their own and (2) teacher-directed approach in which teachers provide students
              with instruction to develop skills and concepts as building blocks for further
              learning. The study focuses on professional development of teachers through
              meetings, extended interventions, and collaborative efforts of teachers.
              Through this process, teachers will become instructional leaders. The research
              will be a comparative study of 4 intervention conditions. The analysis will
              include statistical and qualitative approaches using observation and
              interviews.  -
