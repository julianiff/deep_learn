Abstract    :
              9725192  Sonder   Deformation within lithospheric plates in less well-understood
              than the deformations accompanying interaction between plates.  Externally
              derived forces due to plate interactions can not be wholly responsible for the
              within-plate deformation, and include a contribution from lithospheric buoyancy
              forces.  This project is aimed at assessing the contribution of lithospheric
              buoyancy forces to past and present deformation in the western United States,
              where an abundance of data may allow the various forces to quantified.  The
              work involves a combination of extensive mathematical models coupled with
              various observational parameters that allow the gravitational potential energy
              to be estimated.  Results should allow the determinations of the sensitivity of
              deformation to different factors such as variation of rheology and boundary
              forces related to plate interaction.  Validation and refinement of this
              relationship between gravitational potential energy and deformation within a
              plate will improve understanding of driving forces and deformation in other
              parts of the world.
