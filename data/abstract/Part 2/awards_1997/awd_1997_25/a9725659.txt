Abstract    :
              9725659  Wadhwa  The main goal of this proposal is to gain better constraints on
              early condensation, accretion and differentiation processes and their
              chronology in the solar system through geochemical and isotopic studies of
              meteorites.  The proposed research has implications not only for the formation
              of planetesimals in the asteroidal belt, but also for the early history of the
              Earth.  The work plan is comprised of two main lines of research on
              undifferentiated and differentiated meteorites and involves isotopic
              measurements of long-lived and short-lived ("extinct") chronometric systems. 
              The first project involves the determination of Al-Mg, Mn-Cr and initial Sr
              isotopic systematics in the refractory calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs)
              from primitive carbonaceous chondrites and has implications for high-resolution
              chronology of the early solar system relative to these earliest formed
              condensates.  The second project involves the determination of Sm-Nd
              systematics of phosphates in pallasites to establish the timing of core-mantle
              segregation on their asteroidal parent body.  The constraints offered by these
              two projects will provide a better resolved picture of the timing and
              geochemical consequences of the early processes operational in the inner solar
              system.
