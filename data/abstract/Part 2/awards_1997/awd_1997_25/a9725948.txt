Abstract    :
              9725948  Balantekin    This award supports the participation of American
              scientists  in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Recent Developments in the  Symmetry
              Aspects of Many-Body Physics, to be held in Hawaii,  in August, 1998.  The
              co-organizers are Professors Akif Baha  Balantekin of the University of
              Wisconsin in Madison and  Professor Takaharu Otsuka of the University of Tokyo
              in  Japan.  The objective of the seminar is to bring together  researchers who
              work in the field of nuclear physics as well  as condensed matter physics to
              discuss implementation of  symmetry principles in many-body phenomena.  The
              focus will  be on symmetries in quantum systems which contain relatively  small
              number of particles.  In these systems it therefore  becomes important to
              consider the symmetries the system  possesses, in order to clarify the
              underlying dynamics of  the system.    The session will focus on six theme
              topics:  (l) dynamical  symmetry and supersymmetry in nuclear collective motion
              as  described by the interacting boson model and its extensions;  (2) symmetry
              in electronic many-body systems including  mesoscopic systems and
              micro-clusters; (3) chaos and broken  symmetries, quantum integrable systems;
              (4) utility of  symmetry concepts in nuclei near the drip lines; (5) 
              symmetries of relativistic problems; and (6) symmetries in  the scattering
              theory.  Results of the seminar should define  new directions in the field,
              start new collaborations  between U.S. and Japanese researchers and reinforce
              the  existing ones.  The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese  experts in
              this field will enable U.S. participants to  advance their own work, and will
              set the stage for future  collaborative projects.  Seminar organizers have made
              a  special effort to involve graduate students and postdoctoral  researchers. 
              The proceedings of the meeting will be made  available on the World Wide Web.
