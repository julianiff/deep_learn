Abstract    :
              9725590  Johnson    The time-dependent behavior of the geomagnetic field is a 
              parameter related to the strength of fluid convection in the outer  core, and
              understanding how this field intensity varies with  polarity reversal rate is
              of fundamental importance.  Compilations  of previous paleointensity studies
              indicate that no  reliable paleointensity data exists from the 30 My-long
              Cretaceous  Normal Superchron (CNS).  This project will sample a large lava 
              field (Spences Bridge/Spius Formation; 104 My) in specifically to  determine
              the field intensity during this CNS period.  In Spring  of 1998, the team will
              construct a new paleointensity oven at the  University of Washington, using the
              design of French collaborators  (Carlo Laj; Gif, France).  They plan to test
              the new UW oven using  samples from historical flows from Hawaii, where the
              field  intensity is known.  The field work to collect the CNS  paleointensity
              samples at Spences Bridge will be completed in Fall  of 1998.  The remainder of
              the grant period will be spent with the  experimental work in the UW
              laboratory, in interpretation of the  data, and in publication of the results
              in the scientific  literature.  ***
