Abstract    :
              9725577  Kirschvink   A coherent, global paleogeography of Cambrian time has
              begun to emerge during the last decade, although numerous questions remain. 
              This project is aimed at resolving one of these-whether the Cambrian rocks from
              the Anti-Atlas Mountains in Morocco, along the northern margin of the west
              African craton, originated on this craton or was not yet a part of the Gondwana
              assembly until after the early Cambrian.  Paleomagnetic poles will be obtained
              and corrected in order to test for Cambrian allochtoneity between these rocks
              and the rest of Gondwana.  Results are expected to considerably clarify the
              timing and geometry of the final assembly of the Gondwana supercontinent.
