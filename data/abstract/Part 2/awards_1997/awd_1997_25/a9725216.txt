Abstract    :
              This award supports Dr. E. James Davis, and a postdoc from the University of  
              Washington in a collaboration with Gustav Schweiger and his group at the
              Department of   Laser Applications Engineering and Measurement Systems at the
              Ruhr University in   Bochum, Germany.  Both groups are working on chemical
              reactions in aerosols which are   associated with atmospheric pollution and
              ozone depletion.  Professor Davis has unique   facilities for aerosol studies
              featuring the coupling of electrodynamic balances with Raman   spectroscopy. 
              Capabilities already include the ability to trap particles over a very wide  
              size range (500-m down to atomic dimensions), which includes respirable
              molecules.  Dr.   Schweiger's laboratory is well positioned to improve the
              Raman measurements using laser   diodes and state-of-the-art detectors. 
              Joining the complementary facilities and expertise of   the two groups will
              benefit both sides of the collaboration and could lead to new, compact  
              instruments for chemical analysis of aerosol particles in the workplace, in the
              atmosphere,   and in the laboratory.
