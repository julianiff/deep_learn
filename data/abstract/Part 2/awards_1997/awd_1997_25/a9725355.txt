This award provides support for an international workshop to
              plan a phased approach for a core and outcrop transect from just south of the
              Triassic Pangea equator to about 30 degrees N Paleolatitude.  The workshop will
              have national and international participation and will result in the planning
              of projects that will result in a synoptic view of Pangea at better than 20ky
              level of resolution for a few million years around the Triassic-Jurassic
              boundary.  There will be a special focus ont he relationship between the giant
              Central Atlantic Margin igneous province, the rift-drift transition and
              Triassic-Jurassic mass extinctions.  The intent is to establish a
              spatio-temporal matrix of climatic, biotic, and tectonic data that will allow a
              substantial portion of Pangea to be known at the same level of resolution that
              we know the Neogene.
