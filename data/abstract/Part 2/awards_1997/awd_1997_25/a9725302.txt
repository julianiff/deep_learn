Abstract    :
              The research will investigate the computing challenges posed by extending
              large-scale  multi-agent computational models to achieve both greater scale and
              more complex and realistic behaviors by individual agents.  Individual agents
              in these models are represented by complex data structures that represent their
              internal states and behavioral repertoires. In agent populations of even modest
              size, the number of interaction histories (which determines the state of a
              model) is huge, so building realistic models poses significant computational
              hurdles. The primary aim of this research is to explore the quantity-complexity
              frontier: point at which there are tradeoffs between models with large numbers
              of simple agents and models with greater numbers of more complex agents. This
              project aims to develop innovative computational techniques to extend both the
              scale and the complexity of models by two to three orders of magnitude. Such
              advances are crucial to understanding whether phase changes occur when scale
              and/or complexity is significantly increased in  multi-agent or social systems.
              It is also critical to future real-world applications of  multi-agent systems
              modeling to problems such as understanding development and migration patterns
              (e.g. China), which pose problems of scale, and understanding peer-group
              effects on crime rates (which pose problems of modeling the complexity of
              individual agent behaviors).
