Abstract    :
              9725528  Schlager    This project will establish an online teacher professional
              development (TPD) research testbed to a) investigate the resources,
              capabilities, and technological support that TPD efforts will need to supply
              useful online activities based on next generation virtual environment
              platforms; b0 develop, implement, and evaluate innovative TPD models that
              integrate face-to-face and asynchronous interaction with collaborative
              synchronous online activities; and technological factors that contribute to (or
              obstruct) the effectiveness, sustainability, and scalability of new concepts
              for online TPD. This study will investigate four categories of
              issues-implementation process, TPD benefits and outcomes, community building,
              and technology use and satisfaction-using a combination of qualitative and
              quantitative methods. The investigators will build on a pilot project that
              developed a virtual community, TAPPED IN, for online TPD.  ***
