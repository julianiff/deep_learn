Abstract    :
              9725756  Logan  This is an award to support conduct of a workshop to consider 
              advances in the knowledge-base needed to support environmental  engineering
              practice.  Emphasis in this workshop will be to  identify the research needed
              to address the engineering component  of the National Research Council's recent
              National Forum on  Science and Technology Goals of its six environmental
              research  and development needs.  Background to conduct of this workshop  will
              include reports from the forum on environmental engineering  research and
              education conducted under NSF 96-26774 in May of  1997 and the conference and
              workshop on environmental problems  characteristic of urban coastal communities
              to be conducted in  October of 1997 under NSF 97-11151.  Workshop participants
              will  include representation from the National Academy of Engineering  and the
              Association of Environmental Engineering Professors.    The product of this
              conference is expected to be used in planning  operation of the Environmental
              Engineering Research program as it  addresses outstanding issues in
              environmental engineering  practice.  Results are also expected to assist in
              advancing the  National Science Foundation's commitment to the core strategy of
               integrating research and education as articulated in its  strategic plan.  ***
