Abstract    :
              Abstract  9725076  Engebretson  Earth's magnetic field undergoes variations on
              many time scales.  The low amplitude fluctuations which occur with periods of a
              few tenths of a second to a few seconds, called micropulsations, are the result
              of motion in the magnetosphere such as waves on surfaces like the magnetopause.
               Since most of the magnetosphere is connected to the surface by magnetic field
              lines which have their footprints at high geomagnetic latitude, the large scale
              dynamics of the space environment can best be studied from the polar regions.  
              There is now an extensive Antarctic array of magnetometers to support research
              in this area.  In particular, this team has installed magnetometers in the
              British Antarctic Survey Automatic Geophysical Observatories (AGO) and has
              access to data from other similar instruments.  This grant continues funding to
              pursue research using the BAS AGO and other magnetometer data.  This research
              will provide additional insight into how solar activity effects Earth's
              environment as well as humanity's technical systems.  The magnetometers will
              also provide data to the world-wide space data pool.  ***
