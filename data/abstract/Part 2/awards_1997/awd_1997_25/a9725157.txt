Abstract    :
              This award will support a marine geological and geophysical  study of exposed
              lower ocean crust in the southwest Indian  Ocean.  Exposed crustal rocks on
              shallow uplifted seafloor  were discovered in this region during Ocean Drilling
               operations.  ODP site 735B sampled a 400 meter vertical  section of gabbros in
              this area providing a detailed record  of crustal formation processes.  To
              date, however, it has  been difficult to place these results into a local
              context  since no data are available on surrounding seafloor geology.  The
              present project will rectify this situation by  undertaking detailed near
              bottom observations and sampling.  Canadian scientists will provide the ROB
              ROPOS as primary  survey vechicle, and rock drill would be modified for 
              deployment on ROPOS to allow direct sampling of observed  rocks.  The primary
              objective is to provide detailed near  bottom examination and sampling of
              seafloor to tie existing  ODP data to local environment and to provide detailed
              site  survey for drilling to be proposed which would sample at  sites
              surrounding existing hole.  Additional work would  include newly developed
              British rock drill to provide deeper  sampling than could be done from ROPOS
              vehicle.  Sample and  data would be used to identify crustal formation process
              at  this unique exposure of lower crustal rocks.
