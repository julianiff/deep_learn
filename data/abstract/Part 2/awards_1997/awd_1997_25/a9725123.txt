Abstract    :
              9725123  Chamberlain   Fluid flow in an active orogen affects many properties of
              the deforming rock mass by mechanically weakening or strengthening material and
              by chemically interacting with the rock thru which they pass.  This part of a
              continuing project to understand the links between tectonism and fluid flow in
              an active collisional setting and utilizes the central southern Alps of New
              Zealand where extremely high uplift rates had produced intense fluid driving
              forces.  Evidence of fluid interactions along and basin ward from the fault
              will be gathered and integrated with other geophysical data sets.  Results are
              expected to provide tests of recent fluid interaction models and to clarify the
              extent and role of fluids in contractional deformation.
