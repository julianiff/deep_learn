Abstract    :
              9725068  Christensen  This is an award to support research on methods for
              relating  organic pollutants in the aquatic environment to their sources 
              considering the effects of fractionation between sources and  their receptors. 
              Emphasis in this project will be on polycyclic  aromatic hydrocarbons
              principally derived from incomplete  combustion of fossil fuels and on
              polychlorinated biphenyls that  are derived from many industrial applications
              in sediments from  lakes and streams.  Sources of sediment cores for
              polychlorinated  biphenyls will be the lower Fox River of Wisconsin and for 
              polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, the Black River of Ohio.  Reference cores
              will be obtained from Lake Michigan and Lake  Erie.  The investigator's
              objectives are to fully develop a  source-receptor chemical mass balance model
              for the target  aquatic contaminants, apply an iterative factor analysis model
              to  analytical profiles of these contaminants and develop an optimal  factor
              analytical model incorporating uncertainties for  apportionment of the
              contaminants to their sources.    Results of this project are expected to
              provide knowledge that is  needed for effective abatement of pollution. 
              Understanding the  transport characteristics and fate of environmental
              contaminants  are important steps in changing the way pollutants of air, land 
              and water are controlled.  Emergence of nonpoint sources of  pollutants from
              urban and agricultural land and atmospheric  deposition has made knowledge to
              be gained from this project  potentially useful in addressing engineering
              approaches to  abatement of pollution by identification of sources as a step 
              toward coping with emissions by either prevention of their  production or
              treatment at the source.  ***
