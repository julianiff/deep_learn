Abstract    :
              9725661  Sisson  This project will address the metamorphic and structural
              processes associated with the development of gneissic banding in the migmatitic
              core of a low-pressure/high-temperature metamorphic belt in the eastern Chugach
              Mountains, southern Alaska. Two processes which may be responsible for
              formation of the gneissic banding are: (1) injection of felsic melts or (2)
              segregation by diffusive mass-transfer. These mechanisms are not mutually
              exclusive and may occur simultaneously. These two mechanisms predict very
              different crustal rheologies for the ductile regions in the middle and lower
              crust. This difference in rheological properties will influence large scale
              mechanics of the lithosphere. This research will  attempt to distinguish
              between the two mechanisms for development of gneissic banding by looking at
              textural and compositional differences throughout the transition zone from
              schistose to gneissic fabrics. The PI will investigate several regions where
              the width of the metamorphic belt changes from 15-25 km. The proposed work
              includes detailed flied work to elucidate kinematics of the gneissic transition
              zone, detailed petrographic studies of both textural and compositional
              difference, and high resolution computed x-ray tomography.
