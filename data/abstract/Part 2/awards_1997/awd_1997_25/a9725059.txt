Abstract    :
              9725059  Cross  This award provides support for the acquisition of a nuclear 
              magnetic resonance (NMR) console and accessories to  complement an existing
              19.6 Tesla (830 Megahertz) magnet  located at the National High Magnetic Field
              Laboratory  (NHMFL) at Florida State University.  The resulting  instrument
              will form part of the National High Field Nuclear  Magnetic Resonance Facility
              at the NHMFL and will be  available to users for a wide variety of experiments.
               The  830-Megahertz (MHz) console is a triple resonance, NMR  instrument that
              can be adapted for high-resolution  capability.  The spectrometer will enable
              investigators to  conduct a wide range of NMR experiments including solution 
              state NMR in magic angle spinning probes at the nanometer  scale, high
              resolution magic angle spinning solid state NMR  of semi-solid samples, and
              solid state NMR of static powder  and oriented samples.  The spectrometer will
              serve as a  staging instrument for a 900 MHz system currently being  developed,
              and the 830 MHz system will also be used to  develop technology for the very
              high fields available in the  resistive and hybrid magnets at the NHMFL.  ***
