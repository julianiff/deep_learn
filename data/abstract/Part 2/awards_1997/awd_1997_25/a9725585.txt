Abstract    :
              9725585  Dixon   Deformation of sedimentary piles in passive margins in
              classical understanding of deformation of sedimentary piles impassive margins
              is based in past on structural relations in the Gulf Coast region.  However,
              the evolution of the structures in this region is rather poorly understood. 
              Fundamental questions that remain are what is the rate of growth of growth
              faults, is motion they continuous or episodic, is salt motion along the Gulf
              Coast kinematically linked to this extension, and how is strain partitioned
              between fault zones and the regions between faults.  Dokka and Dixon will
              combine forces to collect GPS data to address these issues.  Their multi-year
              multi-station campaigned to measure three dimension motion data as a function
              of time with the results integrated with sea level elevation data will address
              all of these issues in the central Gulf Coast region.  Their results will
              provide a bridge between GPS data and tidal data, and differences in motion
              between and across known faults will reveal data on strain partitioning.  The
              results will have generic significance because they will serve as a model for
              deformation of other passive margins where data are much less complete.
