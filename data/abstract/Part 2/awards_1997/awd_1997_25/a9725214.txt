Abstract    :
              9725214  Laffey    This project will study a teacher education program that has
              undergone substantial restructuring, is committed to a vision of developing
              technology-using educators, and has made a substantial investment in an
              innovative technology in a teacher education program, building knowledge about
              1) how technology supports professional development, 2) how and learning, and
              3) how a teacher education program supported by advanced technology influences
              the development and socialization of beginning teachers.  This study is focused
              on two core questions: a) what social and cultural patterns emerge when
              advanced technology is utilized in teacher education, and how do these affect
              the process and outcomes of professional socialization? and b) how does the
              technology infrastructure contribute to the development of technology-using
              teachers>  Data collected will include a longitudinal qualitative study of
              professional socialization: a portfolio review of technology -related products
              from the teacher education program; and pre- and p0ost- instrumentation to
              assess changes in attitudes, expectations, and practices for key learner
              outcomes of inquiry orientation, reflective practice, learner-centered
              instruction, and technology use.  Project outcomes include contributing to the
              formative development of this teacher education program, creating a database
              and methodological framework for the study of technology in teaching and
              teacher development, and articulating a model of technology-based teacher
              preparation from which other programs can learn.
