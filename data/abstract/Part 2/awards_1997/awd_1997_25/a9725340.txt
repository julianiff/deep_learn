              exhibition the topic of human development.  Visitors will be given the
              opportunity to learn about the physical, intellectual, and social/emotional
              changes that are connected with human growth and the branches of science that
              study human development.  Guided by the museum's maxim of exhibit and program
              development that experience should "build on the familiar and be personally
              meaningful to varied audiences" this exhibit will have components and
              activities that highlight similarities and differences between families and
              children of different cultural and economic backgrounds and family life styles.
               The exhibit text material will be bilingual, Spanish and English. 
              Complementary educational material will include teacher orientation materials,
              educator's guide book with pre-and post-visit activities, and various parent
              -child activities.  Museum staff will cooperate with a PBS affiliate and
              various other community organizations in the development of this exhibit.  The
              exhibit will travel to an additional eight to twelve sites around the country
              during a three-year period.  It will open at the Austin Children's Museum in
              the spring of 1999.
