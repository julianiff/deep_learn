Abstract    :
              9725096  Hughes    This grant continues U.S. partial support of the
              International  Seismological Centre (ISC) based in England.  The proportion of 
              the ISC budget provided by this grant is approximately 20  percent.  The role
              of the ISC is to collect some two million  readings each year from over two
              thousand seismic stations and  locate about sixty thousand events.  The data
              are published bi-  monthly in the Bulletin of the ISC and the semi-annual
              Regional  Catalogue of Earthquakes approximately two years after the 
              occurrence of the events.   A thirty-year database has thus been  developed. 
              The data are also made available on CD-ROM, diskette  and magnetic tape.  The
              data published by the ISC are arguably  the most complete earthquake catalog
              source in the world.  The  data are used extensively in research on the
              structure of the  earth, calculation of seismic hazard throughout the world,
              and as  a source of information for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty 
              monitoring organizations.  This research is a component of the  National
              Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
