Abstract    :
                This project is the continuation of an internationally  collaborative
              (U.S.-French-Australian) study of katabatic  winds along the coast of East
              Antarctica.  It is based on two  lines of automatic weather stations, one from
              Dumont  d'Urville, the French station, inland to Dome C at an  altitude of
              greater than 3200 meters, the other along the  coast.  The coastal array
              includes stations at Cape Denison  and Port Martin, which have recorded the
              highest average  surface wind speeds on the globe (a monthly average of 62 
              mph).  One additional automatic weather station will be  installed 15 km inland
              where model results predict even  higher average wind speeds.  These winds
              drive the sea ice  offshore, and are responsible for extremely high heat fluxes
               from the ocean to the atmosphere.  Satellite-based active  microwave imagery
              (Synthetic Aperture Radar) will be combined  with the observed meteorological
              data to analyze the  formation persistence and size of offshore polynyas as a 
              function of wind speed.  The effort to produce a numerical  model of the
              regional atmospheric structure will continue,  with the incorporation of a more
              detailed terrain map, and a  new mesoscale model developed by the principal
              investigator's  French colleagues.  In conjunction with the Australian and 
              Japanese station networks to the west of this study area,  this work will allow
              an assessment of the influence of  cyclonic storm systems on the drainage flow
              along the  antarctic coast.  ***
