Abstract    :
              ***  9725521  Goodman    In response to the low representation of women in
              engineering, federal funding agencies, professional societies, foundations,
              corporations, industries, and universities have made significant investments in
              Women in Engineering (WIE) programs.  These undergraduate intervention programs
              are designed to increase recruitment and retention of women in engineering. 
              Approximately 300 institutions have such programs, yet no systematic effort has
              been made to evaluate he effectiveness of the programs as a class. While
              programs are generally considered "successful," reports of impact are often
              based on internal process evaluations with no controls.   The study combines
              state of art quantitative measures and qualitative case study approach.  At
              each institution three rounds of surveys will be conducted of all women
              majoring or intending to major in engineering.  ***
