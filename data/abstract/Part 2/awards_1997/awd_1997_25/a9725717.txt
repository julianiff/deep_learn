Abstract    :
              9725717  Davis   Strain partitioning at convergent margins is a common feature
              of orogens, yet the various models put forward to explain and predict strain
              partitioning frequently disagree in their predictions.  Part of the difficulty
              stems from the fact that analog models are mostly well coupled to the base
              beneath them, while analytical models frequently assume rheologies and
              decoupled behavior not generally found in laboratory analog models.  This
              project will address this mismatch by attempting to adapt analytical models for
              testing in an experimental apparatus and by making laboratory models that have
              boundary conditions as close as possible to the simple ones required for
              analytical tract ability.  By parallel laboratory and theoretical modeling, it
              is intended to establish a theoretical understanding of how kinematics,
              rheology, and plate geometry affect strain partitioning in laboratory models. 
              Results will be a logical step towards using models as tools in interpreting
              geologic, seismic, and geodetic data that bear upon the physics of strain
              partitioning at convergent margins.
