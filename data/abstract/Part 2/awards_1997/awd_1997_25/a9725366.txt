Abstract    :
              9725366  Hickey-Vargas  The proposed research is a geochemical study of basaltic
              volcanic rocks from small eruptive centers in the central Southern Volcanic
              Zone (CSVZ), Chile.  Together with basalts from composite stratovolcanoes in
              the CSVZ, the fault-aligned small centers define a spatial and geochemical
              pattern suggesting that they were formed by melting with widely, but
              systematically varying amounts of hydrous subduction-related fluids.  The
              objective of the research is to test competing hypotheses for melting and
              ascent of magma from above the subduction plate. Geochemical and isotopic data
              will be used to determine the relationship between the amount of hydrous fluid
              component and extent of melting.  10Be and 238U/230Th activity ratios will be
              determined for selected samples and compared with existing data from the
              composite stratovolcanoes, to determine whether basalts from the small centers
              include smaller amounts of recently extracted lithosphere. Petrography and
              electron microprobe analyses of phenocryst minerals will be used to infer
              liquid compositions.  The results of this research will advance knowledge by
              contributing to our understanding of convergent margin magmatism, specifically,
              by identifying some of the controls on the siting of large and small volcanic
              centers, defining sources of subduction zone magma, and the pathways for
              cycling some elements between mantle and crust.  Further, the research will
              advance education through the training of one Ph. D. student, and promote
              collaboration between U.S. and Chilean scientists.
