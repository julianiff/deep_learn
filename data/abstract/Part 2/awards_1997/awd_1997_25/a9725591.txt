Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9725591  Peter Cummings    This project supports a planning
              meeting for the "Workshop on Future Directions in Molecular Simulations and
              Computational Chemistry: Fundamentals and Applications", at which the Steering
              Committee for the workshop will develop detailed plans (including the invitee
              list, location and schedule of the workshop).  Additionally, as part of its
              deliberations the Steering Committee will produce a short, 2-4 page document
              outlining identifiable trends in molecular simulation and computational
              chemistry, measures of the growing importance of the two years, synergism
              between the two areas, and potential funding directions.  This document will
              serve as a very preliminary version of the more detailed report, which will
              emerge, from the full workshop, as well as providing a focal point for the
              presentations and discussions in the workshop.    The Steering Committee for
              the Workshop on Future Directions in Molecular Simulation and Computational
              Chemistry may consist of Peter T. Cummings (Chair, University of Tennessee and
              Oak Ridge National Laboratory), Keith E. Gubbins or Athanassios Z.
              Panagiotopoulos (Cornell University), Phillip R Westmoreland (University of
              Massachussetts) and Matthew Neurock (University of Virginia).    The funds
              provided in this award would permit these five individuals to meet for a
              1.5-day planning meeting at NSF in Arlington, VA.  A report will be developed
              in draft form over the course of  the meeting and communicated by the principal
              investigator to Dr. Wellek at NSF for expenses.  ***
