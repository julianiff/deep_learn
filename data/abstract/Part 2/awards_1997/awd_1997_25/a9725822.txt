Abstract    :
              9725822  Moskowitz    Marine sediments can provide continous records of
              geomagnetic  field behavior that connot be obtained from continental sediments 
              or volcanic rocks.  Single-magnetic-domain particles of magnetite  produced by
              magnetotactic bacteria have been proposed as  important recorders of 
              magnetization in marine sediments.  Yet, the role of biogenic  magnetite in the
              magnetization process remains poorly understood.  The P. I.s will conduct a
              series of experiments based upon recent  advances in rock-magnetism designed to
              measure the abundance and  orientation-distribution of magnetofossils in marine
              sediments.  These experiments will help to establish the role (or lack 
              thereof) of magnetofossils as remanence carriers, links between  magnetotactic
              bacteria and sediment redox, the degree of  magnetofossil preservation, and the
              inter-relationships between  these factors and the lock-in of magnetic
              remanence in marine  sediments.  ***
