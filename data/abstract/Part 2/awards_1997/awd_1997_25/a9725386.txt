Abstract    :
              9725386  Opdyke  During the late Paleozoic most of the southern hemisphere
              continents were joined into a "supercontinent" called Gondwana , that
              subsequently collided with Europe and Asia to form Pangea, which itself
              dispursed during the Mesozoic.  During the late Carboniferous, Gondwana was
              still a coherent block, therefore all paleomagnetic poles from rocks of this
              age should align if the age and magnetic data are robust and the reconstruction
              of the paleogeography is covert.  Recently determined late Carboniferous poles
              in Australia do not match poles from the same aged sediments in Africa that
              were determined 30 years ago.  This project will restudy these rocks to
              determine if the age and magnetism data re in error, or if the plate
              reconstructions of Gondwana are in error.  Results are expected to clarify and
              resolve this perplexing mis-match in these poles, which will read to a more
              robust reconstruction of Gondwana.
