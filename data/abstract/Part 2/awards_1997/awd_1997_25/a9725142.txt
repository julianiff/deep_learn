              Abstract  ATM 97-25142  Druyan, Leonard M.   Columbia University  TITLE:
              Regional Climate Model Studies of the Sahel Summer Climate    This research is
              a continuation of earlier successful research with a previous NSF grant.   
              This study proposes to investigate Sahel climate processes using models (The
              FSU regional climate Model and the NASA GSFC GCM) and Observations ~CEP
              reanalysis). Areas explored will include African Wave disturbances, their
              synoptic and mesoscale features and their relationship to the Sahel droughts,
              SST anomalies, and landscape heterogeneity.    A successful conclusion of this
              study will help to understand the processes at work for the Sahel climate and
              will assist forecasting of Sahel climate.
