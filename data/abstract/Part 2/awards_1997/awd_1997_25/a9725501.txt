Abstract    :
              9825501  Hoffman    This Americas Program award will fund a collaborative 
              research project between Dr. David Hoffman, Iowa State  University, and Dr.
              Yuri  Dakhnovskii, University of  Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia, on a study of
              electron  tunneling in quantum wells irradiated by light. The proposed  work
              addresses factors that control electron tunneling in  systems where charge
              oscillates coherently in a double  quantum well and far infrared light is
              emitted.   They will  seek a theoretical understanding of electron (exciton) 
              tunnelling in these circumstances by deriving the master  equation describing
              dynamics of an excitation governed by  the spin-boson Hamiltonian in a laser
              field; solving this  equation analytically and numerically; and exploring the 
              dynamics of an exciton interaction with acoustical phonons  under the influence
              of a laser by a direct solution method  based on the Path Integral Approach. 
              The effects of this  quantum coherence can be potentially used as a source of 
              coherent microwave irradiation that can be manipulated by  infrared lasers, and
              a way to control the direction and  magnitude of tunneling photocurrent in
              GaAs/AIGaAs  heterostructures.    This is a new collaboration that brings
              together two  outstanding scientists with established strengths in quantum 
              dynamics, a very active area of research, on a project that  has a potential
              for basic and applied impact.  ***
