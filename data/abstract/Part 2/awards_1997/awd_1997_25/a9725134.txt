Abstract    :
              9725134  Bruckner  The object of the proposed research is to gather additional 
              preliminary data to support the development of computer  models and new
              technological tools for the evaluation,  treatment and prevention of gait
              disorders arising from foot  problems associated with subtalar joint (STJ),
              located  between the talus and the calcaneus in the foot, plays a  significant
              role in both the efficiency of modern human  bipedal locomotion and the
              pathogenesis of injuries in the  foot, knee, pelvic girdle and low back.  The
              PI's  investigations show that some STJ configurations  mechanically restrict
              joint range of motion (ROM) while  other STJ facet configurations do not. 
              Persons with the  more restricted or "rigid" STJ configurations have a 
              statistically significant higher incidence of heel spurs  than people with
              mobile STJ configurations.  Others have  found that osteoarthritis is more
              prevalent in joints with  mobile STJ configurations and conclude that the
              osteophytes  probably form to stabilize a structurally hypermobile  system. 
              This SGER proposal is designed to gather evidence  supporting the hypothesis
              that people with rigid STJ  configurations have a measurable difference in
              their gait  patterns when compared to people with mobile STJ  configurations. 
              This study represents a small-scale,  exploratory investigation in support of a
              long term goal of  uniting bioengineering with physical therapy to address some
               of the biomechanical problems seen in the foot, lower limb  and spine.  The
              results will be new technological tools that  will enable clinicians to
              identify foot deformities with a  high degree of validity and reliability,
              study the gait of  people with foot deformities and fabricate shoes and foot 
              orthoses dynamically to correct and, eventually, prevent  gait problems.  ***
