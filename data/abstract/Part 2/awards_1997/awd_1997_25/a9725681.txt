Abstract    :
              9725681  Goldstein  The PIs are studying the  Grande Comore Island, in the
              western Indian ocean,  to test the importance of shallow level lithospheric
              mantle contributions to oceanic island volcanism. The PIs have shown  that the
              isotopic variations of the shield building lavas reflect plume-lithosphere
              interactions. The PIs will extend their study by analyzing He and Os isotopes 
              and directly  characterize the isotopic composition of the lithospheric mantle
              beneath the Grande Comore, through a geochemical and isotopic study of mantle
              derived xenoliths. They will extend the study to the older islands of the
              Comores Archipelago.
