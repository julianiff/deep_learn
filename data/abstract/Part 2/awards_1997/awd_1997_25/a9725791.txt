Abstract    :
              9725791   Byrd      The Earth & Sky radio series reaches over 2.8 million
              individuals in the United States each week.  This grant, which will diminish
              each year over a four-year period, will enable the project to accomplish the
              following goals:    * Continue production and distribution of the Earth & Sky
              radio series  * Distribute a bi-annual booklet for teachers, Earth In the
              Classroom  * Establish a partnership between the Earth & Sky Young Producers
              Contest and National Science and Technology Week.  * Increase the visual
              content of Earth & Sky Online  * Launch an   * Earth & Sky Classroom Project to
              provide teachers and students with a guided "Internet Experience" simulated on
              a CD and, therefore, not requiring an Internet connection.  * Produce and test
              a 156 segment "trial run" of a Kids' Earth & Sky radio series designed for the
              emerging Radio Disney network.     Earth & Sky is produced and hosted by
              Deborah Byrd and Joel Block.   They work with a team of producer/writers and
              interact on a regular basis with members of a team of over 90 science advisors.
