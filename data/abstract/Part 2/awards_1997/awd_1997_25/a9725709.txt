Abstract    :
              9725709  Archuleta    This research involves the investigation of dynamic
              earthquake  fault rupture by means of state-of-the-art finite element computer 
              codes.  Earthquake fault rupture is a very complex physical  phenomenon that is
              currently an active area of study in the  seismological community.  Ground
              motion recordings during many  recent earthquakes have emphasized that an
              understanding of the  dynamics of earthquake fault rupture is crucial in
              understanding  the observed ground motion, especially on the hanging wall of
              dip  slip faults.  In particular, in the case of non-vertical faulting,  the
              complicated interaction between seismic waves and the rupture  process may lead
              to profound effects in the rupture propagation and  resultant ground motion. 
              Many studies have attempted to create  analytical or numerical models of
              earthquake fault rupture, but  most have required extensive simplifications and
              approximations to  make the dynamic equations solvable.  The finite element
              method  will be used to advance our understanding of strong motion as  affected
              by the free surface for a dipping fault, and as affected  by the particular
              friction law used in the modeling.  This research  is a component of the
              National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.      ***
