Abstract    :
              9725914  Khalil    The University of Miami will organize a workshop to examine
              the industry's demand for education in the Management of Technology (MOT)
              field.  The fast pace of technological change and the globalization of the
              marketplace are forcing industry to change.  These changes require personnel
              who are educated and capable of dealing with the emerging paradigms of
              technology and business.  Educational programs have been slow in their response
              to the need for MOT education.  They continue to compartmentalize education
              into either engineering or business schools, and barriers motivated primarily
              by turf protection continue to exist.  The proposed workshop will identify the
              needs that justify the creation of MOT programs as well as the rationale for
              revamping existing curricula in science, engineering, and business schools. 
              The participants will examine whether there is a demand for MOT education, and
              if so, what its content should be.  They also will examine whether education is
              meeting that demand.  This approach is based on listening to industry. 
              Representatives from major industrial corporations will be invited to the
              workshop.  In preparation for it, they will be asked to attend or to send a
              representative to the Seventh International Conference on Management of
              Technology in Orlando, Florida in February 1998.  Each invitee will be asked to
              prepare a short position paper summarizing his/her industry's demand for
              education and training in MOT.  A follow-up one-day workshop to discuss
              responses and summarize ideas will be held in late March or early April, and a
              report will be published in the summer of 1998.  It is postulated that if there
              is an industrial demand and the demands are clarified, universities are likely
              to respond.
