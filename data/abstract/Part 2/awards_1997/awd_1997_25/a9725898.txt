Abstract    :
              9725898  Jeanloz    This grant provides partial support to upgrade the ruby 
              fluorescence spectrometer at the UC-Berkeley high-pressure  laboratory with a
              charge-coupled device (CCD).  The ruby  fluorescence spectrometer is used to
              rapidly determine pressure  and pressure variations across very small samples
              (50-500  microns) inside diamond anvil cells (DAC).  Accurate  determination of
              the pressure distribution within a DAC allows  calculation of shear stresses
              within the cell and/or viscous  stress relaxation of materials that have been
              laser heated in  conjunction with high pressure DAC experiments.  The current 
              detector for UC-Berkeley ruby fluorescence system is an  antiquated
              photomultiplier tube (PMT) that has exceeded its  estimated 10 yr. life span. 
              New PMT's are currently manufactured  on a made-to-order basis only and have
              therefore increased in  price over the years as digital CCD's have entered the
              market and  become more affordable.  While still less expensive than CCD 
              detectors, PMT's are far less sensitive to emitted EM radiation  and cannot be
              used in experiments requiring pressures exceeding  60-70 GPa where sample sizes
              are necessarily very small and  emitted fluorescence is therefore weak.  PMT
              detectors thus limit  high P-T experiments to upper mantle conditions. 
              Additionally, a  CCD array can later be adapted for use in Raman spectroscopy  
               A ruby fluorescence spectrometer is a required tool in DAC  experimentation
              and the PI's choice of a CCD detector to replace  his PMT is well reasoned and
              forward looking.  This upgrade will  allow this PI, his students and colleagues
              to continue  provocative research aimed at understanding early Earth and 
              planetary differentiation and the structure of high pressure  mantle phases and
              synthetic materials.  ***
