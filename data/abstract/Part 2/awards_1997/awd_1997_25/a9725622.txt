Abstract    :
              9725622  Tullis   Understanding the deformation history and deformation
              mechanisms of rocks is a major goal of structural geology and tectonics.  Some
              studies have focused on experimentally determined conditions under which rocks
              deform, and others have made observations in naturally deformed rocks.  This
              collaborative proposal is unique without it brings together scientists who have
              worked in the laboratory with those who have strong reputations for their work
              in the field.  This collaboration will so far to solve the problem of
              extrapolating from high strain rates of experiments to the slower strain-rates
              of natural samples.  The results of this study will bear directly on
              understanding the natural conditions of deformation, especially those of
              dislocation creep, in quartz and in olivine.  Because these minerals are major
              components of the crust and upper mantle, respectively, we will understand much
              better the processes by which the crust and lithosphere deform.
