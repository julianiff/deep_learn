Abstract    :
              9725708  Alley    This award is for a coordinated program of data analysis, 
              forward and inverse modeling in support of the West  Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS)
              Program.  Central to many  discussions of West Antarctic stability is the
              behavior of  ice stream C, the lower part of which slowed greatly about a 
              century ago.  This has variously been interpreted as  evidence of stabilizing
              feedbacks, or of accidental response  to ongoing ice sheet drawdown possibly
              leading to collapse.  Microearthquake observations on ice stream C provide an 
              especially sensitive probe for ice stream motion and  behavior, allowing
              detection of basal motion,  and  characterization of basal lubrication, flow
              resistance  (sticky spots), flow properties, and response to changing  stresses
              caused by tidal processes or nearby  microearthquakes.  Using an existing data
              set, the size,  spacing and strength of resistive sticky spots, the rheology 
              of the lubricating material between sticky spots, and the  spatial variability
              of these across seven monitoring  stations along still-active and
              nearly-stopped regions of  the ice stream will be determined.  Assimilation of
              these  data will require modeling of the ice stream, its basal  system and its
              coupling to the floating ice shelf down  glacier.  Both forward and inverse
              modeling will be used to  learn more about the ice streams and the parameters
              that  control their behavior.  This work should improve our  knowledge of the
              physics of ice stream basal lubrication and  ice shelf/ice stream coupling.
