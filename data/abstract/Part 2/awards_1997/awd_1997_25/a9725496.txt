Abstract    :
              9725496  Dahlen    This research involves the development, testing, and
              exploitation  of methods of inferring the lateral heterogeneity of the earth at
               intermediate scales, using 3-D Frechet kernels.  Current  instantaneous
              kernels will be extended to higher ray parameters by  allowing for the coupling
              of more surface-wave overtone branches.  Mode-ray duality will be explored by
              comparing coupled surface-wave  kernels with kernels based upon body-wave JWKB
              theory.  Three-  dimensional kernels will be developed for wave-form
              functionals  such as travel-time residuals measured by cross-correlation of 
              observed and spherical-earth synthetic seismograms.  Several other  theoretical
              developments will be undertaken to implement the  development of improved earth
              models from the greatly improved  broad-band data sources such as the Global
              Seismic Network and the  portable PASSCAL array projects.  The improved earth
              models are  essential to investigation of the driving forces of plate 
              tectonics, the energy source for earthquakes.  This research is a  component of
              the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
