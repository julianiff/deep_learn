Abstract    :
              9725025  Tully    During this planning grant, the Film Arts Foundation will
              draft a script and develop prototype examples of animation for a one-hour
              television program that will provide viewers with insight into the large-scale
              organization of the Universe.  These materials will be developed and tested in
              collaboration with advisors.  The program will present, in a manner accessible
              to the lay public, the work that the PI, Brent Tully, and other astronomers
              have done on mapping the universe and will present current knowledge about the
              formation of this structure.    The principals in the planning phase will be
              Brent Tully, scientific director; Thomas Lucas, producer/director; Jonathan
              Grupper, writer; and Edward Shaya, computer animator.   They will work with a
              twelve-member advisory committee of astronomers working at research
              universities, informal educators from four major planetaria, and science
              educators.
