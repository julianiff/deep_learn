Abstract    :
              9725248  Bodnar  The objective of the proposed research is to develop the
              hydrothermal diamond anvil cell (HDAC) for use as a pressurized fluid inclusion
              stage. The HDAC will then be used in conjunction with the synthetic fluid
              inclusion technique to obtain PVTX data for geologically-important system
              H2O-CO2 NaCl at temperatures and pressures beyond the range accessible with
              conventional experimental techniques normally used to determine PVTX properties
              of fluids. Results of a pilot study document the feasibility of using the HDAC
              as a pressurized fluid inclusion stage to prevent non-elastic volume changes
              for such inclusion by heating the gas   salt-bearing inclusions under a high
              hydrostatic confining pressure in the HDAC. In this study, the HDAC will be
              used as a pressurized fluid inclusion stage to determine the P-T location of
              the H2O-CO2solvus and the slopes of isochores at pressures up to approximately
              7-9 kbar. The research will also result in the development of a protocol for
              the most efficient use of the HDAC as a pressurized fluid inclusion stage for
              the study of natural fluid inclusions that currently cannot be studied in the
              conventional one-atmosphere heating stage.
