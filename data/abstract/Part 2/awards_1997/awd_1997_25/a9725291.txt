Abstract    :
              ***  9725291  Cornell  Dr. Eric A. Cornell of the University of Colorado and a 
              Fellow of the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics  (JILA) and at the
              National Institute of Standards and  Technology, is the 22nd recipient of the
              Alan T. Waterman  award.  Dr. Cornell will receive $500,000 in research 
              support over the next three years as part of this award.  The Alan T. Waterman
              Award Committee overviewed the  recommendation process after receiving 84
              nominations.  The  National Science Board unanimously agreed to present the 
              award to this atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO)  physicist.  The National
              Foundation presents this annual  award to this annual award to a promising
              scientist, no more  than 35 years of age or within five years of receiving 
              his/her Ph.D., who is judged to be in the forefront of  his/her field.  The
              committee recognized Dr. Cornell for his demonstration  of Bose-Einstein
              condensation in a gas.  He is an AMO  physicist who noted that Bose-Einstein
              condensate is a new  macroscopic state with unique and fascinating properties. 
              The applications have included the transformation of the  field of atom
              interferometry much as the laser  revolutionized optical interferometry.  This
              work has opened  up a rich and fascinating physical system with a host of 
              further questions to explore.  Dr. Cornell has emerged as a leader among his
              generation as  an AMO physicist.  His creativity, originality, and  leadership
              ability set him apart in this field and have  inspired progress in the AMO
              field.  The award is the most  prestigious honor of the National Science
              Foundation for  young researchers.  ***
