This research involves a deployment of portable PASSCAL
              seismographs across the Alaska Range near Mount McKinley to study the active
              tectonics and generation process of large mountains at subduction zones.  Two
              broad types of processes are usually proposed: horizontal compression, which
              results in crustal thickening and support of mountains by Moho deflections, and
              dynamic uplift mechanisms, which heat the lithosphere or elevate it by
              subduction-induced flow.  The PASSCAL seismic line of stations follows a
              corridor that typifies mountain building over a subducting slab with North
              America's highest topography directly over the 100 km depth contour of the slab
              where arc volcanism might be expected.  Analysis efforts will focus on receiver
              functions, attenuation and travel time studies, and shear-wave splitting. 
              Results will be integrated with topography and gravity observations of mass
              distributions, in order to examine whether these are sufficient to
              isostatically balance topography.  These balances will show for the first time
              the forces that elevate topography here and generate earthquake activity.  This
              research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
              Program.
