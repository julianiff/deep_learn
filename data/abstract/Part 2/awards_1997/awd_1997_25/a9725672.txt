Abstract    :
              9725672  Smyth   This project will investigate the structures and elastic
              constants of H-bearing silicate minerals at high pressure in order to assess
              the possibility that the mantle of Earth may contain a reservoir of H2O as
              hydroxyl equivalent to many times the volume of the hydrosphere. PI will
              measure the compressibilities and determine the structures of several hydrous
              and nominally anhydrous silicate phases, including wadsleyite, majoritic
              garnet, ringwoodite, phengitic muscovite, chlorite  and humites at pressure.
              These minerals are likely H-bearing constituents of subducting slabs, the upper
              mantle and/or the transition zone. The determination of their bulk moduli and
              structures at pressure may allow constraints to be place on the amount of H2O
              that can be transported to and reside in the minerals of the upper mantle and
              transition zone.
