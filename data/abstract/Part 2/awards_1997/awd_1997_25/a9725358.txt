Abstract    :
              9725358  Ben-Zion    This research involves the study of the simultaneous
              evolution of  regional seismicity, aseismic deformation, and the network of
              fault  systems sustaining the deformation in a continuation of prior 3-D 
              simulations.  The goal is to establish a physical basis for  understanding
              spatio-temporal patterns of regional earthquakes, and  the interrelations
              between different modes of deformation,  structural properties of faults, and
              rheological properties of the  brittle crust and its ductile surroundings.  The
              work will employ a  model incorporating deformation- and time-dependent damage
              rheology  in a structure consisting of a layered elastic/viscoelastic half- 
              space.  The work will attempt to map in parameter space the basic  types of
              crustal response that are possible for different  structural and rheological
              properties, understand the essential  characteristics of the different
              responses, and examine the  possibility of earthquake prediction based on
              seismicity patterns.  This research is a component of the National Earthquake
              Hazard  Reduction Program.  ***
