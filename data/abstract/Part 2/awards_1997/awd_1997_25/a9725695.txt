Abstract    :
              In search of Direct Sequence Code Division Multiple Access (DS/CDMA) receiver
              designs with favorable cost versus performance characteristics, we consider
              adaptive linear tap-weight filters. The architecture under consideration is the
              most conventional, but the chosen design optimization criterion is not. Based
              on stochastic approximation concepts, we propose the development of recursive
              algorithms that minimize directly the induced probability of error (average
              Bit-Error-Rate). The novelty of this approach   is the incorporation of the
              performance evaluation measure directly into the design process.    The nature
              of this project involves feasibility studies, development, and theoretical
              analysis of the induced linear filter Bit-Error-Rate surfaces.  We plan to
              focus initially on memoryless, time-invariant DS/CDMA channels and then we aim
              at the development and performance evaluation of pertinent receivers that
              operate successfully in multipath fading channels.     In terms of the impact
              of the proposed work, we recognize that this line of research goes well beyond
              DS/CDMA communications and may lead to studies for non-least squares (possibly
              MBER) optimization of linear and non-linear filters.
