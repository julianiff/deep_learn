Abstract    :
              9725238  Beroza    This research involves the development of an automated
              technique  for obtaining very precise relative earthquake locations. 
              Observational errors will be reduced by measuring relative P and S  wave
              arrival times using waveform cross correlation.  The improved  measurements
              will be used as input to a joint hypocentral  determination.  The key challenge
              will be to automate this process  so that it can be widely applied.  The method
              will be used to study  fault mechanics and the structure of active fault
              systems as  expressed by microearthquake seismicity.  This research is a 
              component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
