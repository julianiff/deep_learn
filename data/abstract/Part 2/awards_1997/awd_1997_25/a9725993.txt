Abstract    :
              9725993  Eggleston    This grant provides partial support of the costs of
              acquiring  components to develop optical second harmonic generation (SHG) 
              instrumentation to study molecular structure of adsorbed organic  molecules on
              mineral surfaces.  Coupled with the existing  scanning probe microscope
              (EAR-9634143) at the University of  Wyoming, this technique could yield
              unprecedented information on  the orientation of adsorbed organics on mineral
              surfaces with  single-crystal face specificity. SHG promises significant 
              advantages over other analytical techniques for the analysis of  molecular
              structure at mineral-fluid interfaces (i.e. X-ray  absorption spectroscopy and
              Fourier transform infrared  spectroscopy), the most important being that is
              useable in situ,  at atmospheric pressure, and on non-powdered samples. 
              Knowledge of the atomic-scale structure of fluid-rock geochemical  interactions
              is fundamental to studies of mineral  dissolution/growth and the fate of
              environmental pollutants.  Therefore, analytical advances in mineral surface
              chemistry are  at the frontier of our understanding of problems of pressing 
              environmental significance.  To that end, development of SHG  should advance
              our knowledge of the pH dependency of surface  electric fields, molecular
              adsorption and orientation, and  fundamental electron transfer properties of
              redox centers at  mineral surfaces.  ***
