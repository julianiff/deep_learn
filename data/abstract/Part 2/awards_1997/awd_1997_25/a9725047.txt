Abstract    :
              9725047  Yund  Fine-grained samples consisting of forsterite and plagioclase
              saturated with impurities such as Rb, Sr and Ba will be hot-pressed. These
              polycrystalline samples will be annealed at T and P (and quenched) in order to
              establish equilibrium between grain boundary region and the bulk crystal.
              Compositional differences between the grain boundary region and adjacent
              regions of the bulk crystal will be determined using SEM. Differences in
              concentrations of solutes equivalent to a tenth of a monolayer on a grain
              boundary can be determined. Grain boundary diffusion experiments will be made
              on the above aggregates. Stable isotope traces will be used at a variety of T
              and P and concentration profiles will be determined via ion probe.
