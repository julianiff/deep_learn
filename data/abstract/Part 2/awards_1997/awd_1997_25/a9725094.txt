Abstract    :
              9725094  Murhammer The overall goal of these collaborative proposals between the
              Principal Investigators (PIs) at Iowa and Wyoming is to develop insect cell
              culture as an alternative to mammalian cell culture by creating a more
              mammalian glycosylation pattern on recombinant proteins.  This will be
              accomplished in the three main aims of the proposal:  Spodoptera frugiperda
              Sf-9 cells will be altered with genes for galactosyl transferase and sialyl
              transferase and the effect on the model protein SEAP (secreted alkaline
              phosphatase) determined.  The effect of bioreactor environment on the SEAP
              glycosylation will be determined, especially carbon dioxide and dissolved
              oxygen concentration.  Similar studies will be conducted on a much more complex
              protein model, C1INH, 3 which normally contains six N-linked and seven O-linked
              glycosylation sites.  ***
