Abstract    :
              9725881  Akay  Virtual reality technologies are appearing in important 
              diagnostic and treatment planning applications in medicine.  With today's image
              processing computer workstations and PCs  equipped with high end graphics
              programs, virtual reality  technologies are capable of producing diagnostic
              quality  images of internal organs such as the colon, and provide a 
              sufficiently accurate depiction of the anatomy of the hip  for the surgeon to
              use in planning a patient-specific total  hip replacement procedure.    The 
              two examples noted above indicate the important  potential for the use of
              virtual reality technologies in  medicine, but additional engineering and
              computer science  research is needed to generate the knowledge required to 
              emulate human anatomical features in high resolution and  rapid 3D image
              reconstruction, full color, user-friendly,  and cost-effective systems.  These
              areas of research were  examined in the Virtual Reality in Medicine Workshop
              held as  a part of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics  Engineers
              (IEEE) Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society  conference October
              30-November 2, 1997.  World class  investigators served as faculty for the
              workshop, presenting  state-of-the-art information about the important 
              technologies involved in virtual reality and indicating  areas where research
              is likely to lead to new performance  capabilities. Importantly, 13 engineering
              students  participated in the workshop and received at first hand  information
              that could influence them to enter this area of  engineering endeavor.    This
              award provides support for partial reimbursement of  travel expenses for the
              faculty.  ***
