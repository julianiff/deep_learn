Abstract    :
              9725161  Salmun    The funding is for a partial support for Hopkins Conference
              in Environmental Fluid Mechanics to be held on April 2-4, 1998 at Johns Hopkins
              University.  The intent of the conference is to assess the present state and
              future development in physical oceanography and many other related fields. 
              Anticipated subject areas include general fluid mechanics, physical
              oceanography, waves, dynamics of the upper ocean, the atmospheric boundary
              layer, turbulence and stratified flows.  The conference will also serve as an
              occasion to honor Professor Owen Phillips for his lifelong contributions to
              fluid mechanics in general and to oceanography in particular.
