Abstract    :
              This is in support of the Sixth International Machine Translation  Summit  to 
              be  held October 29-31 and November 1,  1997  in  San  Diego,  California.  
              This year, the summit celebrates  the  50th  anniversary  of  machine
              translation as an area of  research  and  development.   Given  the  special 
              nature  of  this  celebratory  conference, NSF is assisting in the conference
              support  in  order  to  express  in public the support of the Foundation for 
              machine  translation  as  a  field of study and in order  to  support  the 
              travel  costs  of  5 conference attendees who will  constitute  a  panel  of 
              Pioneering  Researchers in Machine  Translation.   The  chosen panelists will
              provide a retrospective on the history  and  developments  of  machine
              translation in the  late  1940's  until  today.
