Abstract    :
              Professor R. Stephen Berry at the Department of Chemistry, University of  
              Chicago, is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational  
              Chemistry Program at NSF for theoretical studies of atoms and clusters.   The
              work supported by this grant falls into three groups of related    topics: (1)
              second-order phase transitions as modeled by clusters; (2)   the relationship
              between the topography of potential energy surfaces and   the formation of
              special structures, as in protein folding; and (3)   angular electron
              correlation in atoms.  A connecting theme is that the   theoretical studies are
              directly related to experimental studies.  Clusters are special and unique
              forms of matter that lie between isolated   atoms and molecules at one extreme
              and the solid state at the other   extreme. While the properties of clusters
              are important for their own   sake, they are also important because they bridge
              these two extremes. A   long term objective of the cluster work that this grant
              supports is to   understand how cluster properties determine, and ultimately
              merge with,   bulk properties. The supported work integrates analytic theory,  
              computation, and computer simulation into an approach with three primary  
              goals: (1) deepening the understanding of commonplace properties of   matter;
              (2) identifying new properties specific to matter at the scale of   clusters
              and nanoscale particles; and (3) stimulating new experiments.
