Abstract    :
              9725559  Deino  As a result of over 100 years of mining, drilling, and
              exploration, the Bingham porphyry copper-gold-molybdenum deposit in Utah is the
              most well-exposed porphyry copper deposit in the world, in addition to being
              the largest in North America. Our recent work at Bingham has demonstrated that
              unusual primitive alkaline magma (minette) was intermixed with more normal
              latitic magma at the approximate time of ore formation. The minette magma is
              among the most copper- and sulfur-rich magmas of this age in western North
              America and may have contributed metals and sulfur to this world-class deposit.
              We will develop a new model for formation of Bingham-type ore deposits that
              accounts for the role of magmatic sulfides and primitive alkaline magma in ore
              formation. The resulting model could be used to better understand and explore
              for porphyry copper deposits in the United States and throughout the world in
              order to develop adequate supplies of this strategic metal. To accomplish these
              goals, geologic mapping, sampling, and whole-rock analysis, by a wide variety
              of methods, will be used to characterize each volcanic and intrusive lithology.
              Analysis of minerals erupted from this system will be done to determine the
              temperature, pressure, and volatile fugacities of ore-related magmas. Isotopic
              analysis of minerals will be used to determine the age and origin of
              ore-related magmas and possible ore-forming processes.
