Abstract    :
              9725627  Roberts    The recent simulations of the geodynamo by Kuang and
              Bloxham, and  earlier by Glatzmaier and the P.I., Roberts, have been in good 
              agreement with the observed characteristics of the observed  geomagnetic field,
              including polarity reversals.  They have also  provided new targets, as with
              the prediction by Glatzmaier and  Roberts that the inner core should rotate
              eastwards relative to  the mantle, which was subsequently supported by two
              independent  seismological investigations.  In this grant, the PI and 
              collaborator Glatzmaier plan to add further realism to the model  by reducing
              viscous diffusion and by including core turbulence,  and to improve the
              numerical resolution and accuracy of the  computational techniques.  They shall
              also investigate the  geodynamo in past geological epochs, and extend their
              studies to  dynamos operating in Jupiter's Galilean satellites.  ***
