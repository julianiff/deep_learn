Abstract    :
              9725891  Baldwin    This grant provides two years partial salary support for a 
              technician to oversee operation and maintenance and to provide  training to new
              users of the University of Arizona Noble gas mass  spectrometry laboratory. 
              This technical position has been and  will continue to be, shared between
              Suzanne Baldwin (Dept of  Geosciences) and Timothy Swindle (Dept of Planetary
              Sciences).  Given the primary source of research support of the latter, NASA 
              will co-fund a portion of the technician's salary.    The Noble gas group at
              the University of Arizona has  traditionally focused on terrestrial
              geochronology and  thermochronology using the 40-Ar/39-Ar technique for studies
              in  tectonics and cosmochemistry and planetary scale chronology using  the
              129-I/129-Xe system.  More recently, with the addition to the  faculty of Marek
              Zreda, they have expanded into the 3-He/4-He  system and the use of 21Ne as
              both tracers and environmental  proxies of hydrologic systems.  The new arrival
              of a second Noble  gas mass spectrometer in this laboratory (funded through the
              W.  M. Keck Foundation) will add significantly to the research  capabilities of
              this group and to the duties of the technician.  ***
