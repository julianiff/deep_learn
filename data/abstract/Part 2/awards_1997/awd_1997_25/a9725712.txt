Abstract    :
              9725712  Larson    The boundary between the Cocos and North American plates is
              the  locus of numerous subduction earthquakes driven by a convergence  velocity
              of 5-7 cm/yr.  Most of the plate boundary has  experienced ruptures in historic
              time - with the exception of the  Guerrero Coast.  This project hopes to
              improve our understanding  of the subduction process and its potential for 
              rupture by conducting a series of geodetic measurements along the  Guerrero
              Coast.  The P.I. and collaborators will combine GPS,  levelling, and absolute
              gravity data to provide optimal  information on both vertical and horizontal
              crustal deformation.  The geodetic data, along with seismic data, will be used
              to model  the Guerrero dislocation and its defining characteristics.  The 
              scientific team includes active collaboration of the National  Autonomous
              University of Mexico (UNAM), NOAA, and UNAVCO.  ***
