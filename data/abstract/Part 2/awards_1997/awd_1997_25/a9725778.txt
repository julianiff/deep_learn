Abstract    :
                 We propose an integrated approach to minimizing power consumption of
              high-performance wireless communication systems.  Our interdisciplinary
              approach will simultaneously address key levels of system design: 
              minimum-energy communication techniques, energy-efficient signal processing
              electronics, high efficiency RF front-ends, and concurrent optimization
              methods. Our objective will be reached by developing design methodologies in
              the following research areas: (a) Modulation, detection, equalization,
              diversity, and resource allocation techniques for time and code-division
              multiple-access channels, which instead of concentrating on achieving channel
              capacity without regard to complexity, focus on minimum-energy communications
              while accounting for energy consumption for their implementation (b) Low-energy
              mixed-signal electronics to perform baseband functions such as data processing,
              coding, equalization etc. Our approach includes two components: digital logic
              with energy recovery using switch-mode RF circuits, and very low-power analog
              neural hardware. (c) High-efficiency integrated active antenna arrays, with a
              potential for manifold increase in overall DC to radiated carrier power
              efficiency.  Our approach saves space and power by integrating high-efficiency
              switch-mode RF circuits with compact antenna arrays, allowing added
              functionality such as beam forming and (d) Concurrent design optimization over
              stochastic parameters, which can yield significantly lower power consumption in
              existing designs, and can take further advantage of the above methodologies.   
              These savings will yield smaller, lighter, more reliable, and more capable
              wireless, hand-held, lap-top, and vehicular communication devices.  The
              developed technologies and design methodologies will apply to mobile
              communication systems for the more than 25 million U.S. cellular subscribers as
              well as the millions of PCS subscribers over the horizon.
