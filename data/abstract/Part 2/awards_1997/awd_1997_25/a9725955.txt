Abstract    :
                                            ABSTRACT    As  part of the Synthesis and Modeling
              Project of the U.S.  Joint  Global  Ocean  Flux  Study (U.S.JGOFS), this
              research  team  will  compile  data on the global distribution in seawater of
              dissolved  inorganic  carbon  and  the ratio of two carbon  stable  isotopes 
              (13C/12C)  to construct several models of oceanic carbon  cycling  and  sea-air
              exchange of carbon dioxide.  The data will be  drawn  from  the 20-year dataset
              collected by the Scripps Carbon Dioxide  Research Group and from other major
              ocean programs with a  carbon  dioxide  component, especially U.S.JGOFS and 
              WOCE  (World  Ocean  Circulation Experiment).  Such studies will allow
              estimates to be  made  of  the  oceanic  capacity to take up anthropogenic 
              carbon  dioxide  from the atmosphere.  They are expected to  improve  our 
              current ability to project global carbon dioxide trends into  the  next
              century.
