Abstract    :
               9725380  Williams   Crenulation cleavage is the most common type of cleavage in
              multiply deformed rocks, but many questions remain about how it is formed. 
              This project will investigate the Moretown Formation in Western Massachusetts
              where small-scale folding and crenulation cleavage is well-exposed. 
              Additionally, this area also features a gradient between uncrenulated domains,
              to domains with classic crenulation cleavage, to schistose high-strain domains,
              and individual compositional layers can be traced across the fabric
              transitions.  The work will integrate analysis of folds and cleavage,
              geochemistry related to mass balance and possible volume changes and
              compositional imagining to document mass transfer.  Results shoud understanding
              of deformation mechanisms involved in crenulation cleavage.
