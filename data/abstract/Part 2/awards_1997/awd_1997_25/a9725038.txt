Abstract    :
              ***  9725038  Golden     This project is an application of percolation theory, a
              well-developed mathematical concept based on the study of fluid and gaseous
              flow in porous media, to the study of sea ice where interstitial brine pockets
              affect the transport of salt, and heat, as well as nutrients and biomass.  At
              low temperatures and low brine concentrations, brine pockets are separated, and
              sea ice is essentially impermeable, but above a critical brine volume fraction
              of about 5 percent, brine inclusions become connected on a macroscopic scale,
              allowing the circulation or percolation of sea water and the diffusion of sea
              water properties.  The transition at the critical brine volume fraction plays
              an important role in air-sea-ice interactions, in the evolution of the sea ice
              microstructure, and in the life cycles of biological communities inhabiting the
              ice.   Percolation theory, which was developed specifically to model flow in
              materials where connectedness becomes important, is a powerful technique for
              studying why the critical volume fraction is 5 percent, whether this is
              dependent on the specific ice type, what determines the spacing and geometry of
              brine tubes, how the transition affects the electromagnetic characteristics of
              sea ice, and other transition properties of sea ice.  The application of the
              theory will also allow the development of a predictive capability for the
              response of sea ice in the electromagnetic spectrum,  which is particularly
              important in the remote sensing of sea ice with satellite-based synthetic
              aperture radars.  In more general terms, it is an intriguing
              cross-fertilization of ideas from mathematics to the geosciences.  ***
