Abstract    :
              9725406  Peacock  We propose to construct thermal and petrologic models of
              specific convergent plate margins and test these models against geochemical and
              seismological observations in order to better understand subduction-zone
              processes at 50-200 km depth.  Specifically, we will simulate the thermal
              evolution of the Andean, Central American, and Cascadia subduction zones in
              order to test whether gaps in magmatic arcs and variations in the geochemistry
              of arc lavas can be related to differences in the thermal structure of the
              subduction zones.  For each subduction zone we will construct several
              2-dimensional models at different locations in order to generate a
              pseudo-3-dimensional model.  The finite-difference models will incorporate
              changes in the geometry of the subducting slab, radiogenic heating, and slab
              ages that vary with time.  We will also develop more accurate dynamical flow
              models for the mantle wedge that lies above the subducting slab in order to
              test the hypothesis that relatively weak rocks (e.g., sedimentary rocks,
              serpentinite) which may be present within the subduction shear zone will act to
              mechanically decouple the slab from the mantle wedge.  The results of this
              study will increase our understanding of convergent plate margins (subduction
              zones) where most of the Earth's earthquakes and explosive volcanism occurs.
