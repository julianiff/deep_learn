Abstract    :
              9725020  Navrotsky  Metal oxides, oxyhydroxides and hydroxides, particularly
              containing Al, Fe, Mn are important, but complex variables, phases in soils,
              aquifers, sediments, hot springs and vents and in low temperature materials
              processing. Because of complex polymorphism, incorporation of minor elements,
              variable hydration, and small particle size, the separation of thermodynamic
              and kinetic factors I the formation and reactivity of these important
              environmental minerals is difficult. Using modern synthesis and
              characterization methods, a suite of chemically and structurally defined phases
              will be prepared and their energetics determined by high temperature reaction
              calorimetric techniques unique to the PIs laboratory. The influence of crystal
              structure, surface area, oxidation state degree of hydration, and minor element
              content on energetics will be explored. The systematics obtained will be a
              starting point for better kinetic models of dissolution, precipitation and
              pollutant transport and for understanding biologically mediated processing of
              theses phases. Emphasis will be on phases in the Mn-O-H, Fe-O-H, Fe-Al-O-H and
              Co-O-H systems.
