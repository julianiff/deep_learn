Abstract    :
              9725339  Bruhn   A lingering controversy in plate tectonics surrounds the way in
              which continental crusts interact in collision zones.  The arguments center on
              if and how strain is partitioned among or around several possible crustal
              blocks.  In southeast Alaska the St. Elias collision region includes the
              largest concentration of high peaks in North America.  The conventional
              explanation for this region is that a continental microplate (the Yakutat
              block) is converging with the North American plate.  An alternative hypothesis
              holds that slip is partitioned into a strike-slip component and a contractional
              component allowing a transpressional boundary and that microplates are not
              involved.  This Pavlis and Bruhn study will test these hypotheses by looking
              for the predictions of the second.  In particular, field mapping and structural
              analysis will be done to evaluate recent an active motion on the predicted
              strike-slip faults, and examining off-shore seismic reflection data will be
              analyzed to look for deformation in the predicted off shore fold and thrust
              belt.  The results will bear directly on the resolving the controversy here in
              Alaska, but will also reveal generic results that will allow generalizing about
              the behavior of transpressive plate boundaries in general.
