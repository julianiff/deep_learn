Abstract    :
              A conference on Numerical Analysis and Domain Decomposition will  be held on
              January 23-24, 1998, at the Courant Institute of  Mathematical Sciences.   This
              conference will focus on current  advances in numerical analysis and scientific
              computing with  particular emphasis on domain decomposition, and important 
              applications of these techniques to areas such as computational  solid
              mechanics and fluid dynamics.  The conference promises to  bring together a
              very strong international field of senior  scientists with a large number of
              promising young investigators  from the U.S.  The conference provides a great
              opportunity to  promote areas of critical interest, primarily scientific 
              computing, scalable parallel algorithm development (including  domain
              decomposition) and fundamental research in numerical  analysis.  The continued
              national investment currently being made  in high performance computer hardware
              requires a similar  investment in and dissemination of the underlying
              mathematical  tools required to utilize this equipment.  Consequently, the 
              conference will yield strong practical benefits as wells as  theoretical ones.
