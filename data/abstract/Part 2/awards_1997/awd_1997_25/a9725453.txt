Abstract    :
              9725453  Duffy    This grant provides partial support of the costs of acquiring
              a  Brillouin spectroscopy system for direct measurement of the  single-crystal
              elastic moduli of minerals in diamond anvil cells  (DAC) at upper to lower
              mantle pressures and temperatures.  These  measurements are fundamental to
              interpretation of the  composition, thermal structure and rheology of the
              Earth's  mantle.  Additionally, mineral elasticity data are fundamental to 
              problems in mineral physics including understanding the  phenomenon of pressure
              induced amorphization and development of  an absolute pressure scale for high
              pressure experimentation.  The proposed facility will generated new data on the
              elastic  properties of minerals and mineral assemblages at pressure ranges 
              that span an important transition zone in the uppermost lower  mantle of the
              Earth and which are fundamental to our  understanding of mantle dynamics and to
              interpretation of seismic  data.  ***
