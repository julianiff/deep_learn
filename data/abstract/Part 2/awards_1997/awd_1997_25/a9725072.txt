Abstract    :
              9725072  Webster  The proposed study will determine compositions of granitic,
              pegmatitic, and aplitic liquids that generated tin and tungsten mineralization
              in the historic Erzgebirge mountains of southern Germany and will investigate
              the evolution of granitic to pegmatitic and aplitic liquids by analyzing
              silicate melt inclusions in rocks from several mineralized systems in this
              mining district.  Particular attention will be directed at the behavior of the
              volatiles  water, fluorine, chlorine, phosphorus, and boron, because these
              constituents exert strong controls on magmatic processes and concomitant
              processes of hydrothermal alteration and ore formation.  Another goals of the
              study will be to determine the abundances of the ore metals tin and tungsten in
              the silicate melt inclusions.  The melt inclusions will be analyed by electron
              and ion microprobes and infrared spectroscopy.  The behavior of tin in
              mineralizing, magmatic systems will be investigated through experimental study
              of the dissolution of cassiterite (the chief ore mineral of tin) in granitic
              liquids that are variably enriched in fluorine, water, and phosphorus.  The
              results of these investigations are important for understanding how granitic
              liquids evolve, form pegmatite and aplite facies, and generate tin and tungsten
              ore deposits.
