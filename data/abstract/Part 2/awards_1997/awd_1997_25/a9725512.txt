Abstract    :
                9725512  Doerr    Calls for reform in mathematics teaching suggest that
              teacher should reflect on their own practice and guide their students'
              mathematical development by creating lessons sequences that support students'
              efforts to construct increasingly sophisticated understandings over time. 
              However, pre-service teachers in methods courses do not have a practice on
              which to reflect, and have little, if any, first-hand experience observing the
              processes by which students develop mathematical conceptions over time.  As a
              result, this proposal has been written to fill this void by creating,
              implementing, and researching three CD-ROM based case studies centered on
              actual lessons sequences taught in reform-based classrooms at the middle and
              secondary level.  The two goals of this proposed project are (1) to better
              understand how multimedia case studies can be used to support the development
              of effective practice among pre-service mathematics teachers, and (2) to refine
              our design theory to elaborate specific aspects that make cases more effective
              in promoting such reflection.  ***
