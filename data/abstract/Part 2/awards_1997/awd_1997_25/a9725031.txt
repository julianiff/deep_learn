Abstract    :
              PI: Petter Guttorp  Proposal Number: DMS 9725031  Project: International
              Conference on Statistical Climatology    Abstract:     This International
              Conference on Statistical Climatology, the sixth   that has been held since
              1979, will be held from May 25 to 29, 1998,  in British Columbia. This series
              of international conferences has   brought together statisticians and
              climatologists for both formal   and informal discussions of problems and
              statistical methods for  addressing them.  There are two invited lectures per
              day, each   with discussions by both statisticians and climatologists.    This
              format promotes cross-disciplinary interactions and  collaborations.  Many of
              the leading issues in climatology are   related to general circulation models. 
              The major problem of interest  is in comparing model runs to historical data,
              which have varying   spatial and temporal coverage, varying instrumentation,
              and very   different precision.  These models are used to assess the effect of 
              various anthropogenic influences on the climate, such as changing   composition
              of various greenhouse gasses.  Important topics to be  discussed at this
              conference are the statistical techniques such as  hiden Markov models, wavelet
              methods, and neural networks that can   be used in developing useful models.   
              This award is in support of expenses of participants from the United  States. A
              large portion of the grant will go towards expenses of   graduate students, new
              researchers, and members of underrepresented  groups.
