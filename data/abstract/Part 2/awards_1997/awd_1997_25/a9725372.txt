Abstract    :
              9725372  Pollard   Fault segmentation is observed at many scales in normal fault
              systems and mechanical interaction between the segments appears to influence
              the development of the fault system.  Understanding this mechanical interaction
              will improve understanding of the manner in which normal faults grow and link. 
              A systematic study of the strong perturbations around normal faults under
              different tectonic stress regimes will involve use of the numerical code of
              Poly 3D.  Results will include documentation of stress distribution and strain
              around a single normal fault under typical loading conditions and interactions
              between two echelon segments.  These products will be of interest in seismic
              hazard analysis and aspects of resource exploration.
