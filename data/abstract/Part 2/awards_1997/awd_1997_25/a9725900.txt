Abstract    :
              9725900  Presnall  Because partial melting processes in the mantle are generally
              understood to involve a close approach to fractional melting, it is important
              to obtain data on melt compositions at <2% melting. The low melt fraction
              limitation of studies on natural lherzolite can be overcome by using linear
              algebraic methods to extend the classical model system approach to systems of
              more than four components. This project will use this extended classical
              approach to study melting relations of model lherzolite in the
              CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-CO2 system in 3-5 GPa pressure range.  All experiments will
              be done with a multianvil press and phase compositions will be determined with
              an electron microprobe. In this system, compositions of liquids produced by
              large to extremely small (0-2%) degrees of melting of lherzolite can be
              determined right down to the solidus by direct analysis, so that extrapolations
              from larger degrees of melting are unnecessary.
