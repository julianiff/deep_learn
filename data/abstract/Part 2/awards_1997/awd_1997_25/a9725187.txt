Abstract    :
              9725187  Furlong   Transpressional plate boundaries are zones of complicated
              crustal deformation.  Many transpressional boundaries show partitioning of
              strain into concurrent convergent and relatively pure strike-slip deformation. 
              While this strain partitioning is well documented in the crust of some areas,
              the way in which the lower crust and mantle deform is not well known.  This
              collaborative study by Furlong at Penn State and Anderson at IGNS/Otago, New
              Zealand, will address this general question using the Fiordland area of SW New
              Zealand as a testing area.  The specific problems that will be posed arc 1) how
              do the Pacific and Australian lithospheric accommodate shortening, and to what
              extent are the crust and mantel mechanically coupled?  The approach will be
              two-fold.  Furlong will undertake detailed modeling of the thermal,
              rheological, and deformational evolution of the area, and Anderson will
              undertake a seismological analysis of the area.  The result of the analysis
              will reveal to what extent the crust and mantles are mechanically linked at
              this local, but they will also provide a critical context in which to
              generalize to other areas.
