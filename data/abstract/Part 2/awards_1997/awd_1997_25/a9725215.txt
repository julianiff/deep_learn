Abstract    :
              This award supports Dr. Sergei Ostapenko and a graduate student from the
              University of   Southern Florida in a collaboration with J¼rgen Werner of the
              Department of Physical   Electronics at the University of Stuttgart.  The
              collaboration brings together the   complementary capabilities of the German
              and U.S. groups to study the effects of   ultrasound treatment on hot-wire
              hydrogenated polysilicon thin films on glass and   polysilicon solar cells. 
              Defects in the polysilicon determine the electronic quality of the   material
              formed, and one way to improve the quality is to passivate the defects by  
              hydrogenation.  In addition to exploring the effects of ultrasound, the
              research will apply a   combination of traditional and novel characterization
              techniques to monitor those effects.    The research will use experimental
              facilities of both institutions, and the exchange of   personnel and graduate
              students will strongly benefit the transfer of advanced knowledge   and
              capabilities. The results of the research could have an impact on a new
              generation of   low-cost solar cells and high-performance thin-film transistors
              used for active-matrix   liquid-crystal-display technology.
