Abstract    :
              9725882  Raymond  This award is for support for a program of surface-based 
              radio echo sounding to examine the geometry of the internal  layering and the
              presence or absence of thawed zones outside  the margins of active Ice Streams
              B and E and across the  flow band feeding Ice Stream D.  Melting in the
              marginal  shear zone and/or on the bed outside an ice stream relates  to the
              amount of support of the ice stream from the sides  compared to the bed and the
              conditions that limit expansion  of its width.  Radar observations will be
              extended over the  crest of adjacent inter-ice-stream ridges (B/C and D/E) and 
              areas next to the flow band in the onset of D.  The purpose  is to examine
              internal layering indicative of the histories  of these areas adjacent to ice
              streams and to determine  whether ice streams have expanded into these 
              presently  stable areas in the past.  These goals concerning the  physical
              controls and history of ice stream width relate to  how the discharge of ice
              streams has changed in the past and  could change in the future to affect sea
              level.
