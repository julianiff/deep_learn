Abstract    :
              V. Ara Apkarian is suported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational
              Chemistry Program to perform semiclassical molecular   dynamics simulations of
              quantum dynamic effects in extended systems.    This approach has already been
              developed and employed successfully for   gas-phase spectroscopy. The
              methodology is now being applied to the   spectroscopy of cryogenic solids,
              condensed hydrogen, and hydrogen-bonded   networks, as well as room-temperature
              liquid resonance-Raman and   photon-echo spectroscopies.  Quantum effects are
              simulated with a `black   box` dependent only on inputted potential energy
              parameters.  Due to the   many degrees of freedom in these applications, the
              computations are very   intensive.  This is partially remedied by relying on
              short-time   propagation with wavefunction reconstruction through repeated
              Monte Carlo   sampling.   In order to understand quantum dynamics in systems of
              large   dimensionality, such as liquids and solids, new simulation methods are 
               needed.  In condensed phase spectroscopy in particular, connecting  
              observables to the underlying molecular structures and their motions  
              currently relies on approximate techniques.  Theoretical developments   that
              aim toward a microscopic understanding of condensed phase spectra   are
              invaluable tools in the interpretation and design of experiments.
