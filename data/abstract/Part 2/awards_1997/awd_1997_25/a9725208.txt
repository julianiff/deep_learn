Abstract    :
              9725208  Yeats   This action provides support for continued research on the
              earthquake hazzard potential of a portion of the Indian Himalaya.  The work
              involves completion of field studies, including trenching, designed no
              establish recurrence rates and other parameters and to effect technology
              transfer to Indians concurring establishment of a viable earthquake hazzard
              mitigation program.  Results will provide information concerning recurrence
              intervals and various earthquake parameters for the great Himalayan
              earthquakes.  They will also help establish a viable domestic earthquake
              hazzard mitigation capability in India.
