Abstract    :
                Total internal reflection vibrational sum frequency spectroscopy is  used to
              probe the liquid/liquid interface in these studies  supported by the Analytical
              and Surface Chemistry Program.   Professor Richmond and her colleagues at the
              University of Oregon  are probing the hydrogen bonding of water at the
              water/hydrocarbon  interface.  They are also investigating the structure and
              dynamics  of alkyl surfactant molecules at the oil/water interface, providing 
              important information about the changing conformation of these  molecules
              adsorbed at the interface.  This provides the basic  groundwork for
              understanding ion and molecular transport across  membranes and other
              biologically important structures.   Using methods of non-linear spectroscopy
              developed in Professor  Richmond s laboratories, the structure and dynamics of
              molecules at  the oil/water interface form the focus of this research project. 
               Understanding the arrangement and motion of molecules at this  interface is
              important to the operation of many vital biological  processes, including
              respiration and transport of nutrients in the  body.  This research provides
              both the conceptual understanding of  these important processes, as well as the
              tools needed to study  them.
