Abstract    :
              9725629  Gurnis    The PI will develop a new generation of dynamic models with
              the  finite element method and test such models against observations at  both
              intermediate (10-100 km) and large scales (100 -10,000 km).  The principle
              objectives are to place bounds on (1) the effective  viscosity of converging
              plate boundaries, (2) the lateral strength  of slabs, (3) radial variations in
              mantle viscosity, and (4) the  mass flux of slabs into the lower mantle. 
              Bounds on the effective  viscosity of converging margins are essential
              ingredients in  generating plate tectonics from theoretical models of mantle 
              convection.  Constraining mass flux into the lower mantle is a  fundamental
              constraint on geochemical and thermal models of the  mantle.  The main
              components of the proposed work will be (1)  synthesis of a suite of
              geophysical observations, (2) formulation  of regional flow models with actual
              slab and fault geometries, (3)  comprehensive investigation of the dynamics of
              these 3-D models,  and (4) testing with data independent of that used to
              construct  slab geometry and  buoyancy.  ***
