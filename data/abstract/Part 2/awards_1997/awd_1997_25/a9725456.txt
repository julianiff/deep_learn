Abstract    :
              9725456  Williams    This grant provides three-years partial salary support for
              an  electron microprobe (EMP) technician at the University of  Massachusetts. 
              This is a Phase I technician support (TS) request  under the Instrumentation
              and Facilities (IF) Program.  Initially, Dr. Michael Jercinovic will help these
              investigators  establish new analytical procedures on their Cameca SX-50 EMP 
              using a recently acquired automation and imaging package (EAR-  9503054). 
              Salary support will cover a transition period as they  spin up new analytical
              procedures using their newly upgraded EMP  and acquire outside contracts that
              will eventually provide  revenues to replace NSF support.  The facility not
              only supports  the petrologic and materials research programs of faculty within
               the Department of Geology and the College of Engineering, but  also the
              research programs of several other regional faculty and  their undergraduate
              students (i.e. Smith College, Williams  College, Amherst College, Mount Holyoke
              and Colgate University).  Jercinovic will focus on developing new analytical
              procedures  including development of the remote control module that shipped 
              with the new SX-100 software.  This feature allows for some  remote operations
              of the EMP via the internet and can return  backscattered electron images in a
              similar fashion.  Remote  operation offers an important advance for educational
              purposes at  regional colleges that do not have direct access to a functioning 
              analytical grade EMP.  ***
