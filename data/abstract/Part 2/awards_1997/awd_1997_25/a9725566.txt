Abstract    :
              9725566  Zhang  Because the host mineral protects the inclusion, inclusions may
              preserve information about the deeper upper mantle, about crustal rocks
              subducted into the upper mantle, and the environment in the inclusion may be
              different from that outside. Deciphering this information requires
              understanding of the mechanics, thermodynamics, and kinetics of processes
              involving the inclusion and host.  This is a combined theoretical and
              laboratory project to investigate the ability of the host to protect the
              inclusion. At (1200(C for normal mantle minerals, stress relaxation is rapid
              and the host can not protect the inclusion. Regular thermobarometry is
              applicable. At (800(C, most metamorphic rocks including some UHP's stress
              relaxation due to viscous flow is negligible over the age of the earth. The
              host can protect the inclusions. The inclusion P can be very different than the
              host P. Quantitative thermobarometry is possible only after inclusion-host
              equilibrium is understood under such conditions. Due to differences in host and
              inclusion P, there is a stress field in the host adjacent to the inclusion.
              This field may have an effect on equilibrium and may also induce pressure
              diffusion. Demonstrating the presence of pressure diffusion may open an new
              field of study and may lead to better understanding of compositional profiles
              in the host and applicability of such profiles in geospeedometry. Preliminary
              work suggests that early thermobarometry may be wrong. The results of this
              research will correctly interpret inclusion-host information and understand the
              applicability of geothermometry, geobarometry, and geospeedometry.
