Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  NUNAMAKER  EEC-9725079    The use of collaborative computing to
              support meetings and teams can result in higher productivity and more efficient
              use of available time in any organization.  An Industry/ University Cooperative
              Research (I/UCRC) for the Management of Information is being established at the
              University of Arizona to perform research in this area.  Seven memberships have
              been obtained for a total of $350,000.    The initial research agenda of the
              Center will address 1.) Development of Collaborative Tools and Methodology to
              Enhance Business Process Re-engineering, 2.) Software Development Process for
              Group Support, 3.) Group Tools and Methods for Effective System Requirement
              Specifications and 4.)  Processes and Tools for Group Writing.
