Abstract    :
              9725668  Lee    This project makes a permanent record of the history, techniques
              and  regional and temporal variations of Alaskan Eskimo (Yup'ik) coiled 
              basketry.  While often dismissed as "tourist art," and as a consequence 
              ignored, Yup'ik coiled basketry is an important women's art form.  Also, it 
              has been an important component of the mixed cash-and-subsistence economy  of
              modern rural Alaska.  Finally, changes in basketry styles are linked to 
              important historical and economic changes that have affected different  Yup'ik
              societies.  The documentation of Yup'ik coiled basketry is of great  interest
              to scholars of Alaskan Eskimo ethnography and ethnohistory,  researchers in the
              fields of arts acculturation, material culture studies,  and gender studies,
              and researchers with interests in economic  anthropology, diffusion, and
              innovation.  This project produces  photo-documentation of different coiled
              basketry styles that is linked to  different historical and economic events
              affecting regional Yup'ik groups.
