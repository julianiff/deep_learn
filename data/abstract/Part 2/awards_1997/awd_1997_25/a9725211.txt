Abstract    :
              Walsberg  9725211                                                               
                      Despite   the   extraordinary  challenges   presented   by   high 
              temperatures and the absence of water, a large number of  animals  survive  
              without   drinking  while  occupying   extreme   desert  conditions.  The  goal
               of this study is  to  elucidate  how  the  physiology of one important group
              of such animals allows them  to  survive desert conditions. Developing this
              understanding requires  addressing  three  basic questions. (1) What themmal 
              and  hydric  environments do these animals occupy in nature? (2) How do  these 
              animals  thermoregulate under such conditions? (3)  How  do  they  meet  their 
              water  requirements?  This  study  will  focus  upon  kangaroo  rats, which are
              small rodents that are among  the  most  conspicuously  successful groups of
              desert mammals.  The  thermal  and  hydric  conditions  experienced by these 
              small  mammals  in  subtropical  deserts  will be quantified. Physiological 
              analyses  will  focus  upon determining how closely these animals  approach 
              their  limits  of tolerance to dehydration and high environmental  temperatures
               under  naturally prevailing conditions.  This  will  include  analyses of (a)
              short-term effects of high environmental  temperatures upon body temperature,
              (b) intemmediate-term effects  associated with animal dehydration during
              activity, and long-temm  effects  mediated through alterations in the location
              and  timing  of animal activity in nature.
