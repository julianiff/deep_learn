Abstract    :
              9725693  Kellogg    Key Central and South American (CASA) GPS stations will be 
              reoccupied to analyze on-going convergent margin deformation.  The  three major
              goals of this project are: 1) To monitor the strain  accumulation preceding the
              predicted large subduction zone thrust  earthquake in the Ecuador trench.  The
              proposed measurements  together with 3-dimensional elastic half space models
              will map the  rates of elastic strain locking and relate these to the rupture 
              zones for the 1906, 1942, 1958, and 1979 earthquakes, testing  models for the
              mechanics of subduction zone earthquakes.  2)  Resurvey the network in northern
              Colombia to study the kinematics  and mechanics of an active arc -  continent
              collision zone.  3) Reoccupy sites in the South  Caribbean deformed belt to
              study deformation in an accretionary  prism to determine the location of the
              current Caribbean-South  American plate boundary.  This study is jointly funded
              by a large  group of international agencies.  ***
