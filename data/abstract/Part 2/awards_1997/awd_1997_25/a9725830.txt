Abstract    :
                                      Samuel Bowser                           OPP97-25830     
                                    Abstract    A dominant member of cold, deep-sea sediments
              is a group of  giant protozoa, the aggulatinated foraminifera, also known  as
              forams. For protection, these single-celled organisms  encase themselves in
              architecturally-elegant shells that  they construct by collecting, sorting, and
              cementing  together sediment grains. The unique occurrence of these  giant
              cells (greater than one millimeter in size) in the  shallow waters of McMurdo
              Sound, Antarctica allows for the  study of the cellular and molecular aspects
              of shell  constructions. This project will use novel light microscopic  methods
              to examine how agglutinated forams secrete and  sculpt the adhesive matrix that
              binds sediment particular in  their shells. Comparative time-lapse photography
              of  different foram species constructing shells will identify  key steps in the
              processes that lead to the various shell  morphologies. Peptide sequence
              analyses of the elastic  proteins of the shells will provide valuable insight
              into  the chemical nature of foram bioadhesives. From a practical  standpoint,
              these cements have important biotechnological  and medical applications. This
              project will also continue a  study of the effects of collection activities, as
              well as  natural physical disturbances, in this unique environment.  This
              interdisciplinary project has implications in a number  of fields, including
              cellular development, evolution,  paleontology, marine products chemistry, and
              ecosystem  management.
