Abstract    :
              9725413  Henyey    This research involves the completion of a regional seismic
              profile  from Santa Catalina Island in the southern California Continental 
              Borderland to the western Mojave Desert that began as part of LARSE  I (Los
              Angeles Region Seismic Experiment) in 1994.  This will fund    of the cost of
              the experiment with the remainder to come from the  Southern California
              Earthquake Center and U.S. Geological Survey.  The new profile, LARSE II,
              crosses the inner continental  borderland, Santa Monica Mountains, Northridge
              earthquake  epicentral region, Santa Susana Mountains, and the San Andreas 
              fault.  The survey parameters will allow the determination of both  the upper
              mantle and lower crustal structure, as well as the  structure and velocities of
              the mountains and basins.  In the first  case, the relationship between the
              subcrustal lithosphere and upper  mantle high-velocity anomaly detected by
              earthquake tomography is  of particular interest.  The primary crustal targets
              include the  buried Northridge earthquake fault, and the thrust faults beneath 
              the Santa Monica and Santa Susana Mountains, as well as the  velocity structure
              of the San Fernando basin.  This research is a  component of the National
              Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
