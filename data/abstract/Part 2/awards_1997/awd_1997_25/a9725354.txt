Abstract    :
              9725354  Finger         This grant provides partial support of the costs of
              acquiring  a new four-circle single-crystal X-ray diffractometer with a CCD 
              detector.  This area detector has much higher sensitivity than  previous
              models, and collects two-dimensional sections of the  diffracted intensity that
              can be combined to construct a full  three-dimensional view of reciprocal
              space.  With such information,  it is possible to study very small or twinned
              crystals, and to  study diffuse scattering arising from various sources of
              disorder.   The X-ray group at the Geophysical Laboratory, consisting of Larry 
              Finger,  Charles Prewitt, Robert Hazen, and Hexiong Yang, will  develop the
              necessary techniques to use the CCD detector system  with the diamond-anvil
              cell.  With the new instrument, it will be  possible to measure lattice
              constants and perform a crystal-  structure refinement in less time than
              currently used for a  lattice-constant determination.  High-pressure
              crystallography is  an essential component in understanding phase relations in
              the deep  earth.    Once this instrument is installed, 25% of the operating
              time will  be available as a regional resource, with emphasis on the earth 
              science community.  It will also be used as a resource in the  Laboratory's
              summer intern program, which is funded a by a REU  grant.  ***
