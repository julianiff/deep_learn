Abstract    :
              9725244  Raimi    A mathematician at the University of Rochester is
              investigating the history of the mathematics education reform efforts during
              the period 1958-1974,  which are known as "The New Math".  The research
              addresses a number of questions, including: What were the intentions of the
              reformers, i.e. what sorts of classrooms, curricula, teachers, and teaching
              methods did they envision?  To what degree did the intentions of the reformers
              succeed and which failed?   To what degree could their intentions have better
              succeeded had they used different strategies and to what degree was their
              project hopeless?  What residue was left after the reform effort ended?  Does
              the "New Math" experience have useful implications for current and future
              efforts at reform in mathematics education?
