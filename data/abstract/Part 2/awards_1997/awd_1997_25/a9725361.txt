Abstract    :
              9725361  Bursik  Pyroclastic flows or  nuees ardentes are perhaps the most
              destructive, yet most poorly understood  of  volcanic phenomena.  Because of
              their destructiveness, they are virtually impossible  to observe directly; yet
              they leave deposits that have proven extremely difficult to interpret.  The
              primary objective of the proposed research is to determine in specific,
              well-constrained situations the link between active flow conditions in
              pyroclastic flows and the resulting deposits.    Because we may be able to
              determine what is happening within the flows, the results could have important
              ramifications for  the simulation of flows in hazards analysis, and for
              volcanic hazards assessment.  The proposed  work will  procede with
              experimental, theoretical and fieldwork phases.  The work will begin by
              carefully making deposits in the laboratory  under well-constrained flow
              conditions, using special facilities designed only for the purpose of these
              studies.   Theoretical modeling will  extend the range of applicability of the 
              experiments by generalizing the observed flow mechanics.  Laboratory and
              theoretical results will be tested by careful sedimentological analysis of 
              certain diagnostic portions of pyroclastic flow deposits, especially modern
              deposits for which there is some information on active flow conditions.
