Abstract    :
              9725518  Chapin    This research project will develop a plan to analyze data
              collected in an urban school system over a six-year period for teachers of
              kindergarten through eighth grade students.  This school system has been the
              site of systemic change efforts over the entire period in which this
              information was collected.  Sources of data included interviews; classroom
              observations; teachers' responses to surveys on their beliefs, attitudes, and
              content and pedagogical knowledge; teachers' written reflections; and field
              notes on all professional development activities.  Both quantitative and
              qualitative methods to analyze this data will be developed.  The project will
              advance knowledge about the evolution of teachers' beliefs, knowledge, and
              practices while engaged in a process of systemic reform and will cast light on
              how various professional development activities influence that evolution.
