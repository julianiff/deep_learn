Abstract    :
              9725394  Meurer  Crystals that nucleate and grow in magma chambers can separate
              from the liquid and accumulate on the chamber floor.  This process, termed
              fractional crystallization, is of fundamental importance in the study of
              igneous rocks.  Rocks formed by the accumulation of crystals are called
              cumulates and provide a record of how fractional crystallization proceeds. 
              Cumulates host significant economic minerals deposits including platinum group
              metals, chromium ore, and copper-and nickel-sulfides.  The bulk of  the ocean
              crust and most of the moon are also made of cumulates.  During slow cooling,
              accumulated crystals can undergo compaction driven by the density contrast
              between the crystals and interstitial liquid.  Compaction can expel liquid from
              the crystal pile or simply redistribute it within it.  During compaction,
              recrystallization may take place changing the shape of grains and allowing them
              to pack more efficiently.  Modern computer technology now allows quantitative
              textural study of cumulates.  This study will provide the first large scale
              analysis that combines both chemical and textural data.  By documenting the
              consequences of compaction we will further our understanding of fractional
              crystallization and hence the formation of cumulates and the mineral resources
              they host on the Earth and moon.
