Abstract    :
                Schloerb  AST-9725951    Funds will be used for the continued support of the
              astronomical research, technological development, and development of human
              resources at the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory (FCRAO) of the
              University Of Massachusetts.  The research program includes studies of external
              galaxies, astrochemistry and planetary science.  FCRAO operates the largest
              heterodyne focal plane array in the world and plays a major role in
              astronomical education.  ***
