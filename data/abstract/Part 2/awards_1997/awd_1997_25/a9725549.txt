Abstract    :
              9725549  Vaida      The hydoxyl radical (OH) is the primary means by which
              hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide are oxidized in the atmosphere.  There is a
              discrepancy between model calculations of the time dependence of the OH
              increase following sunrise and observations, particularly in the lower
              stratosphere.  At dawn, the models consistently underestimate the measured OH
              concentration; in particular, at daybreak there is a sudden increase in the
              measured OH concentration, amounting to close to 20 percent of the maximum
              amount (occurring at noon), which is not predicted by models.    In response to
              these uncertainties, the project links theory and laboratory experiments to
              study the detailed dynamics of atmospheric photoreactions. Specifically, two
              areas of inquiry are outlined as potentially providing atmospheric free
              radicals with solar photons of much lower energy than assumed in standard
              models. These areas involve: 1) investigation of a general mechanism involving
              visible excitation of overtone transitions of the OH stretching vibrations in
              key atmospheric chemical species (nitric acid, pernitric acid, hydrogen
              peroxide, water) using a combination of experimental and theoretical
              techniques; and 2) examination of the vibrational and electronic spectra of
              molecular complexes through laboratory investigations.  The outcome of this
              work is expected to be the improved parameterizations of small molecule
              photoreactions and molecular cluster dynamics for inclusion in chemical models
              of the atmosphere.
