Abstract    :
              9725191  Lvov         This award provides funding for the development of an 
              electrochemical system for accurate pH measurements in hydrothermal  solutions
              at temperatures over the range 100-450oC and at pressures  of up to a kilobar. 
              The development of an accurate pH measurement  system for use at such high
              temperatures and pressures is expected  to advance our fundamental
              understanding of chemical processes in  natural environments such as ocean
              ridge hydrothermal vents and  other volcanic areas where both the generation of
              life and the  formation of mineral deposits are of great interest.  This 
              development project is to be accomplished as collaboration between  principal
              investigator teams at the Pennsylvania State University  (this award), Temple
              University and Princeton University (through  a companion award).  ***
