Abstract    :
              9725175  Ruff    This research is a continuation of the routine cataloging of 
              large-earthquake source time functions, and the  investigation into the
              application of this catalog to study  of tectonic regions of the earth.  The
              cataloging of source  time functions is an addition to traditional on-going 
              cataloging of earthquake parameters including the time,  location, magnitude,
              first-motion focal mechanism, and the  moment tensor.  The source time function
              is the history of  the moment release during the earthquake that, depending on 
              the frequency-content of the energy, is spatially averaged  over the faulted
              region.  Shorter-period energy gives more  detail of the earthquake rupture
              process.  Further  investigation involves the search for systematics of 
              parameters of the source time function that can give insight  into earthquakes
              as a function of their tectonic setting.  This research is a component of the
              National Earthquake  Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
