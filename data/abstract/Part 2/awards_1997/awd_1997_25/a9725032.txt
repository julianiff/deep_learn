Abstract    :
              EEC-9725032  Goldsman, Neil    ABSTRACT    This award provides funding for a
              project entitled GEMSTONE: An Interdisciplinary Undergraduate Program Focusing
              on the Implications of Technology, administered by the Institute for Systems
              Research (an NSF Engineering Research Center) at the University of Maryland. 
              The goal of the Gemstone program is to give undergraduate students the
              opportunity to take part in multi-year, inter-disciplinary research projects in
              some of the most important issues affecting society today--issues that are
              driven by technological change but with ramifications that go far beyond
              technology.  These research projects in such diverse areas as the environment,
              medicine, telecommunications, and manufacturing will be part of an academic
              structure that educates the participants about the issues linking technology to
              business, law, politics, and social structures, while simultaneously giving the
              students a chance to apply their new insight to important contemporary
              problems, challenges, and opportunities.
