              Travel grants for graduate students and new researchers to attend the 24th IEEE
              International Conference on Plasma Science on May 19-22, 19997    Under this
              grant, support is provided for graduate students to attend the 24th IEEE
              International Conference on Plasma Science on May 19-22, 1997. Topics under
              discussion at this conference include advanced processing of materials and flat
              panel displays; vacuum electronics and microelectronics; new computational
              methods in simulations of plasma and electron beams; and industrial
              electronics. Support is provided at a level which corresponds to travel grants
              and per diem for five students.
