Abstract    :
              9725887  McLean    PROJECT: Seeing: The Interaction of Physiology, Culture, and 
               The Exploratorium  will develop a 6000 sq. f.t exhibit Seeing: The Interaction
              of Physiology, Culture, and Technology .  As the first exhibit and program
              development project of their multiyear initiative "Refocusing on the Floor,"
              this permanent exhibit will consist of approximately 60 new and redesigned
              exhibits organized into six sections: Seeing Central, Light and Images, Process
              of Seeing, Seeing Things Differently, Extending Our Vision, and Deconstructing
              What We See.  Visitors will develop their skills at seeing, noticing, and
              visual thinking, will become more conscious of visual information in daily
              life, be exposed to current research on vision and visual cognition, be given
              opportunities to investigate the social and cultural influences on seeing, and
              be lead to the realization that seeing, interpreting, and understanding visual
              information are basic to the conduct of science.  New partnerships will be
              developed with community-based organizations that will promote new audiences
              for the Exploratorium as well as enhance the viewpoints of the participating
              staff members.  The activities will address the National Science Standards in
              terms of the process skills that are identified and will reintroduce visual
              thinking skills into the activities linking the exhibit with the formal
              education's curriculum.  Additional workshops and professional dissemination
              activities will be included in the overall project.
