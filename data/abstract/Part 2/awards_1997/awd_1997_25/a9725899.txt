Abstract    :
              9725899  Brown  This is a continuation of the PI's work on the following:  (1)
              photoemission and x-ray standing wave studies of the interaction of water with
              the (-Al2O3  (0001) and (1-102) surfaces, the (-SiO2 (0001) surface TiO2 (110)
              surface, and the PbS (001) surface and (2) x-ray adsorption fine structure
              (XAFS) spectroscopy study of the local coordination environment of Ni and Mo in
              silicate glasses and melts as a function of temperature and composition.  In
              addition, the PI will initiate a new study of the structure of the electrical
              double layer in aqueous solution adjacent to a metal oxide surface (a-Al2O3)
              using long-period x-ray standing waves.  The PI will also initiate a crystal
              truncation rod study of the surfaces of (-Al2O3 (0001) and (1-102) at the
              Advanced Photon Source on the GSECARS sector.
