Abstract    :
              9725395  Duffy    The elastic properties of minerals at high pressures and 
              temperatures are of fundamental significance for a range of  problems in solid
              Earth geophysics and mineralogy.  The P. I.  will determine single-crystal
              elastic properties in minerals to  35 GPa and 1000 degrees C using Brillioun
              scattering in the  diamond anvil cell.  New synchrotron x-ray diffraction 
              experiments will also be conducted to constrain strength and  elasticity of
              Earth materials.  External and laser heating  experiments will be conducted to
              determine crystal structures and  phase diagrams.  The results will be  used to
              develop improved models of deep Earth composition and  structure.  ***
