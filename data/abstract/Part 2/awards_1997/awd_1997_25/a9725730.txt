Abstract    :
              9725730  Bromwich    This award is for support for a study of accumulation rate 
              variations over the Antarctic ice sheet for the last two decades,  the period
              for which reliable atmospheric analyses are available.  The twice-daily
              precipitation rate will  be calculated for the 21  years on a 50-km grid using
              a diagnostic model developed for  similar studies over Greenland.  Estimates of
              the sublimation  rate will be developed from the best available sources
              including  the atmospheric analyses.  The impact of drift snow  redistribution
              on the precipitated snow will be evaluated by  combining simulations of the
              Antarctic surface winds with  formulas relating drift snow transport to surface
              wind speed.  The precipitation, sublimation, and drift snow transport 
              divergence estimates will be merged to depict the estimated  accumulation rate.
               The derived accumulation variations will be  examined in relation to a wide
              range of atmospheric and oceanic  phenomena to uncover the governing
              mechanisms. The results will  be relevant to studies of Antarctic mass balance
              and the ice  sheet contribution to present global sea level rise, and the 
              interpretation of ice core records covering recent to paleo  environments.
