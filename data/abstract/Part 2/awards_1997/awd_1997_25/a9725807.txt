Abstract    :
              9725807  Molnar    Normal faulting and horizontal crustal extension, not just 
              erosion, ultimately destroy most major mountain belts.  Because  most such
              belts have been built by crustal shortening and  thickening, some change in the
              regional geodynamics must occur to  cause such a change from horizontal
              compression to extension.  One  possibility is that the lower part of the
              mantle lithosphere,  thickened during the phase of compression, becomes
              unstable and  sinks into the mantle beneath the range.  When this happens,  the
              range rises, giving it potential energy to drive normal  faulting.  To test
              such an idea requires that paleo-altitudes are  measured before and after the
              normal faulting begins.  The P.I.s  plan to make such measurements using fossil
              leaf morphology, which  has been calibrated to modern climates (and hence
              altitudes) with  an extensive collection of such leaf morphology from modern 
              forests.  The Pacific Northwest is an ideal locality for such  analysis because
              the region underwent crustal shortening in  Mesozoic time and crustal extension
              in Cenozoic time and because  there are numerous fossil leaf localities, both 
              near sea level and inland where a high mountain belt once lay.  ***
