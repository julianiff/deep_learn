Abstract    :
              9725239  Spetzler  The elastic properties of single crystal olivine samples with
              different Fe contents will be measured in a simultaneous high P and high T
              environment to 5 GPa and 1, 000 K.  The new data will provide knowledge of the
              elastic anisotropy as functions of composition at P-T conditions appropriate
              for interpreting the seismic anisotropy of Earth's upper mantle.  The data will
              be the first to accurately address the issue of how much olivine is needed or
              how thick the anisotropy zone in the upper mantle is in order to explain the
              observed seismic anisotropy.  The new data will also yield information on the
              bulk properties of olivine as a function of its Fe content and the cross
              pressure and temperature effect on the elasticity of this mantle silicate.
              These data will be used to establish better mineralogical models to interpret
              the seismic velocity variation at depths of the upper mantle, taking into
              account the petrological observations of the varying Fe contents of olivine
              samples originating from the upper mantle.
