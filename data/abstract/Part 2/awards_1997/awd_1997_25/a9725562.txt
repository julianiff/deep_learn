Abstract    :
              9725562  Tullis    The P.I.s propose an experimental program focussed on 
              understanding fundamental processes that may be responsible for  causing
              earthquakes to occur.  Crustal earthquakes occur due to  rapid sliding on
              faults, and they occur suddenly because it is  harder for the sliding to begin
              than for it to continue once it  has started.  The experiments proposed will
              aim at trying to  understand why  sliding is easier when it occurs faster, and
              why faults grow  stronger as they sit quietly between earthquakes. Several 
              fundamental explanations have been offered, and these laboratory  experiments
              on friction of rock will be testing some of the  predominant hypotheses. 
              Ultimately it is hoped that improving  understanding of fundamental earthquake
              processes might show ways  of predicting earthquakes and understanding the
              origin of the  damaging strong ground motions.  ***
