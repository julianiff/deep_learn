Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  REC 972552    The University of Texas at Austin will accomplish the
              preliminary planning for a new educational center, called the Center for the
              Improvement of Science, Technology, and Mathematics Education.  The Center,
              when established, will develop the national infrastructure for research on
              systemic improvement of science, mathematics and technology instruction.  The
              primary discipline focus would be on the implementation of standards-based
              instruction, with supporting policy and technology.    The planning phase will
              establish the infrastructure necessary to support the Center.  The activities
              undertaken will include:  forging partnerships, within the University and with
              the state; developing organizational and managerial strategies; establishing
              sites for implementation activities; and developing a corresponding graduate
              program.    Much of the planning will be accomplished through a series of small
              conferences, each with a focus on a particular aspect of the Center
              infrastructure.
