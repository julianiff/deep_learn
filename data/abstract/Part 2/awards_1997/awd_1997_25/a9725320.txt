Abstract    :
              ***  9725320  Lynch     This project will apply a high resolution integrated
              numerical model that represents atmospheric, oceanic and sea ice processes to
              the maintenance of an antarctic coastal polynya.  Polynyas are large recurrent
              areas of open water or reduced ice concentration within the winter sea ice
              cover.  This project's study site is in the Cosmonaut Sea off East Antarctica,
              facing the Indian Ocean.   It is conjectured that this polynya is maintained
              primarily by the upwelling of heat from the oceans rather than removal of ice
              by advection, and is formed as the result of a confluence of atmospheric
              preconditioning, deep ocean convection, modulated by local topographic
              interactions.   Regularly occurring polynyas have importance in the antarctic
              climate system by influencing the surface exchange of heat, moisture, and
              momentum between the atmosphere and ocean, as well as affecting the chemical
              and biological composition of the ocean and sea ice.  This project  uses a
              combination of high resolution modeling and analysis of remotely sensed
              imagery, station observations, and experimental data to determine the
              mechanisms responsible for the formation of this polynya.  The scale of the
              polynya requires the use of a high resolution limited area model, since global
              climate system models  have neither the resolution nor  the sophisticated
              parameterizations necessary to accurately model many of the important processes
              and feedbacks involved in polynya processes.  This study can serve as a
              conceptual model for other antarctic deep water polynyas, such as the Weddell
              Sea polynya.  ***
