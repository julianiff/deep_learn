Abstract    :
              Elser    9725878    Ecologists have been increasingly aware of the fundamental
              importance of differences in the elemental composition of organisms that
              comprise the food webs of ecosystems.  Elser, the PI on this proposal, has been
              one of the leaders in developing this field termed ecological stoichiometry. 
              The work supported by this project will combine modeling investigations with
              experiments in field and artificial enclosures to examine the joint effects of
              light and nutrient availability on the organization of aquatic communities in
              pelagic habitats.  Specifically it will test whether different light and
              nutrient conditions can shift pelagic communities into fundamentally different
              states by altering the ecological stoichiometry of dominant interactions.   
              Modeling studies will evaluate the potential for alternate states in which one
              is dominated by quantity effects such as where low algal biomass limits growth
              by grazers and the alternate is driven by nutritional effects where poor algal
              food quality can limit grazer growth.  Modeling results will be tested in field
              manipulations conducted at the Experimental Lakes Area in Canada and in
              artificial mesocosms at new, state-of-the-art facility at Kyoto University in
              Japan.  Experiments will involve manipulations of light and starting grazer
              conditions to test predictions from the model on these alternate ecosystem
              states.  This work will contribute to the understanding of the interface
              between population dynamics and ecosystem function.  It has substantial
              theoretical and practical implications.
