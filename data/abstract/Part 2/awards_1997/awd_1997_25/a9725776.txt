Abstract    :
              9725776  Street    This research involves the use of high-resolution seismic 
              reflection profiling to determine if the southern end of the  Sikeston Ridge in
              the New Madrid seismic zone of southeastern  Missouri is a tectonic or an
              erosional feature; and, if it is a  tectonic feature, to determine if the
              eastern edge of the Sikeston  ridge is linked to the Reelfoot Scarp in
              northwestern Tennessee.  Evidence of recent fault movement will be sought in a
              basal  Quaternary gravel unit that occurs throughout the area at a depth  of 40
              to 60 m.  Areas of possible faulting will be further  investigated with
              high-resolution P-wave seismic reflection  profiling to trace deformation to
              Paleozoic bedrock near 550 m  depth.  Given the close association of the
              Sikeston ridge with the  most active segment of the New Madrid seismic zone and
              Lake County  Uplift, it is important that the origin of the ridge and its 
              association with other tectonic features in the area be ascertained  in order
              to fully understand the potential earthquake activity in  the area.  This
              research is a component of the National Earthquake  Hazard Reduction Program.
