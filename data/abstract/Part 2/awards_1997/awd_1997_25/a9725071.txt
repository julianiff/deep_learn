Abstract    :
                    This project is a component of the international team of scientists that
              have been assembled to investigate the North Water polynya (NOW) ecosystem. 
              The proposed study will test the hypothesis that spatial heterogeneity in the
              species composition of seabirds breeding in the vicinity of the NOW ecosystem
              is determined by spatial heterogeneity in physical mechanisms that structure
              NOW.  The proposed research is designed to determine the influence of marine
              birds on the fate of particulate carbon in this High Arctic polynya.  Three
              questions will be addressed: (1) What is the spatial heterogeneity in the
              distribtuion of foraging seabird species and prey use within the polynya and is
              this variability related to water masses or other hydrographic features? (2)
              What is the carbon flux to birds and what are the trophic pathways (food webs)
              on which the birds depend? (3) Is there seasonal variation in the trophic role
              of birds and are these the result of changes in the food webs used, or the size
              classes and species of prey available?  To answer these questions, the species
              composition, abundance, distribution, and diets of marine birds foraging in the
              NOW will be quantified.  These data will be used in conjunction with published
              models of energy consumption as function of body mas to calculate the daily and
              annual consumption of energy, prey, and carbon by marine birds in the NOW. 
              Additional data on hydrography and prey fields, which will aid in addressing
              questions concerning the spatial organization of physical and biological
              processes in the NOW, will be available from other participating scientists.
