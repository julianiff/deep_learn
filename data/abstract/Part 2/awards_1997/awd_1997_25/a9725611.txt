                    ABSTRACT    PROPOSAL # : DEB-9725611    INVESTIGATOR(S) : WALLBRIDGE   
              INSTITUTION: GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY      The aims of this research are to
              develop and test a new method for determination of soil P mineralization, based
              on natural isotopic fractionation of the associated O that occurs as part of
              enzyme-catalyzed phosphate ester hydrolysis in soils. Initial experiments are
              to be done in the laboratory, followed by field tests in a well-studied
              chronosequence of sites in Hawaii, where soil P chemistry is known to vary with
              soil age.  The research is high-risk but potentially very useful.  Lack of an
              appropriate method for estimation of P mineralization in the field is widely
              recognised as limiting to progress in understanding of nutrient limitation and
              nutrient interactions in ecosystems.  If successful, this method is certain to
              be widely used and to lead to important new insights on the cycling of P in
              terrestrial ecosystems.
