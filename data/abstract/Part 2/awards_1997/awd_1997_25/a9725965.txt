Abstract    :
              Donald Truhlar is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational
              Chemistry Program to continue his work on chemical dynamics   and energetics. 
              Three areas of research are proposed: 1) development of   an improved
              theoretical framework for the analysis and prediction of   photochemical
              reactions; 2) development of improved methods for treating   quantum dynamical
              effects in condensed-phase chemical reactions; and 3)   improved methods for
              the quantum mechanical treatment of the properties   and dynamics of small
              clusters.  Major objectives of the research   include: 1) To analyze the
              accuracy of trajectory surface hopping   algorithms for electronically
              nonadiabatic chemical reactions by testing   them against converged quantum
              dynamical results to be produced by his   new linear algebraic variational
              methods; 2) To pinpoint the specific   features of trajectory surface hopping
              methods that are most responsible   for any observed inaccuracies and to use
              this knowledge to focus future   efforts to improve the methods; 3) To develop
              a   transition-state-theory-like approximation for overall quenching rate  
              constants; 4) To better understand the physical effects that determine  
              branching ratios for decomposition of exciplexes through funnels; 5) To  
              incorporate quantum mechanical effects into practical variational   transition
              state theory calculations; 6) To further develop the   stabilization method as
              a practical tool for multi-dimensional   resonances; 7) To exploit parallel
              computers for efficient quantum   mechanical calculations on four-body systems;
              and 8) To use the accurate   quantum dynamical calculations on hydrogen
              fluoride dimer as a means of   improving the potential energy surface for this
              system.  Truhlar's research is aimed at a basic molecular level understanding
              of   chemical dynamics and solvation. This research has important strategic  
              implications in areas of atmospheric and environmental chemistry.
