Abstract    :
              9725829  Farmer   The precambrian and lower paleozoic continental crust of
              southwestern United States has been involved in extensive paleozoic, Mesozoic
              and Cenozoic deformation caused by a variety of plate interactions.  Many
              large-transport faults have been proposed for these younger events, but
              attempts to prove or quantify them is hampered by the lack of knowledge of the
              original spatial distribution of the older rocks.  This project will utilize a
              new approach to establish paleo-proximity of now separated terranes.  Recent
              studies have identified a 1.1 by granite with a very unique Nd isotopic
              signature, erosion products of which can be identified in sediments deposited
              in the suspect terranes.  Proximity to this unique source can be estimated by
              looking for l.1 by zircon detritus and the Nd spike in candidate sediments. 
              Such data from several key terranes will help establish their original spatial
              relationship thus allowing the subsequent translations to be determined. 
              Results are expected to assist in resolving several regional problems in the
              reconstruction of the southwest US craton.
