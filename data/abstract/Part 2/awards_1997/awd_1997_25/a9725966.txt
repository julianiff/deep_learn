Abstract    :
                This research will develop a simple ecosystem model which will account for
              observed f ratios in pelagic marine ecosystems during both steady state and non
              steady state conditions. The central hypotheses of the model are as follows:
              (1) Production is controlled by a single nutrient, the identity of which is
              determined by the nutritional requirements of the phytoplankton community and
              the ratio of allochthonous nutrient inputs to the system. (2) The size spectrum
              of the phytoplankton community is a critical determinant of the f ratio. Large
              cells are associated with a high f ratio, and small cells are associated with a
              low f ratio. (3) Marine pelagic ecosystems naturally evolve toward a condition
              in which stability is maximized. Work carried out to date indicates that
              maximum stability is associated with low f ratios, i.e. in the range 0.05 0.1.
              Nutrient pulses are expected to shift the f ratio to larger values because
              under steady state conditions the large celled phytoplankton are always growing
              at a low relative growth rate, and the small celled phytoplankton are growing
              at a high relative growth rate. The principal long term goal of this research
              is the development of a simple model of the f ratio which can be embedded into
              much larger ocean-atmosphere models to explain the production and export of
              organic carbon from the euphotic zone. A secondary goal of this work is the
              development of a theoretical framework with which to reconcile various measures
              of the productivity and turnover of pelagic marine ecosystems, i.e.,
              differences between gross photosynthesis and net photosynthetic production of
              particulate carbon.
