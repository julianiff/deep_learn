Abstract    :
              9725017  Yang    This award supports a U.S.-China workshop on computational 
              mechanics in structural engineering. The U.S. organizer is  Jann Yang,
              University of California at Irvine; the Chinese  organizers are Gu Yuanxian and
              Zhong Wanxie, Dalian  University of Technology. This workshop will focus on
              recent  advances in structural engineering and identify possible  joint
              research efforts.    In the past two decades, the field of structural mechanics
               has made important contributions to the practice of  structural engineering. 
              Computational mechanics, failure  and fracture mechanics, structural control
              and monitoring  have all made dramatic contributions to the improvement of 
              construction and maintenance of structural systems. The  development of a
              systems approach to civil infrastructure  has dramatically changed the research
              agenda in countries  worldwide. Given China's susceptibility to events such as 
              strong earthquakes, China has also emphasized research in  these areas, and has
              developed techniques and technologies  that are very competitive. This
              symposium will allow  exchange of current information and definition of
              mutually  advantageous joint research projects.  Participation will  include
              senior and junior researchers on both sides.  Support on the Chinese side will
              be provided by the National  Natural Science Foundation of  China and by the
              State  Education Commission.
