Abstract    :
              9725405  Buffler   The southern Red Sea-northern Danakil region of Eritrea is
              located at the northern apex of the Afar depression, which represents a major
              plate boundary triple junction underlain by an upwelling mantle plume.  Here
              three active continental rifts converge and three major plates are separating
              with the formation of oceanic crust.  Recent circumstances have allowed
              research efforts in this active area to address several tectonic rift
              processes, tectonic inversion, and controls on rift sedimentation and hominid
              paleontology.  Results are expected to provide tectonic and geologic framework
              data in support of hominid studies as well as providing insight into
              near-triple point rift processes.
