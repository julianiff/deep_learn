Abstract    :
              9725675  Bloxham    The P.I. proposes to continue investigations of the
              geodynamo,  building on his  3-dimensional, dynamically self-consistent dynamo
              code and  furthering use of observations to place constraints on the dynamo 
              process.  The current geodynamo model operates in the same  dynamical regime as
              the Earth at leading order, but at higher  order the scaling of the model to
              the Earth is imperfect because  of unavoidable computational constraints.  In
              addition to tackling  this problem, the P.I. also plans a number of
              developments of the  model aimed both at further improvements to the
              computational  aspects of the model and at including additional geophysical 
              effects, especially the effects of lateral heterogeneity at the  core-mantle
              boundary.  A parameterized version of the model for  studying long-term field
              evolution will also be developed.  Using  observations, a number of studies
              centered on the exchange of  angular momentum between the core and the rest of
              the Earth will  be undertaken.  This is an area where observations have a 
              particularly important role to play in constraining the geodynamo.  Finally,
              the dynamo model will be used to examine the underlying  assumptions that are
              adopted in analyzing the geomagnetic secular  variation.  ***
