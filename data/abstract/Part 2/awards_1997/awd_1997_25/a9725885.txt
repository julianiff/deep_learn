This research involves an integrative approach to the study of
              the age, formation and evolution of diamonds and their host xenoliths form
              Yakutia, Siberia. Three carefully chosen diamond-bearing eclogite xenoliths and
              two large diamonds (cut into <10 carat plates) will be used as recorders of the
              evolution of the Earth's mantle. Mineral inclusions within diamonds are
              considered reliable indicators of mantle conditions during diamond formation
              because these inclusions were isolated from post-diamond formation mantle
              processes. Since mineral inclusions within a single diamond can be variable it
              is important to document how the inclusions fit within the growth history of
              the diamond. This research will provide the first comprehensive geochemical and
              petrologic study of inclusions within diamonds that links the chemical
              characteristics to the diamond growth history. This will involve
              cathodoluminescence and C and N isotopic analyses of the diamonds prior to the
              study of the xenoliths and inclusions. The xenoliths will be imaged by X-ray
              computed tomography, prior to disaggregation, to examine the diamond-host
              textural relationships. Mineral inclusions and host xenolith minerals will be
              studied by a variety of techniques: major and trace element and O isotopic
              analyses of silicates; and Re-Os and S isotopic analyses of sulfides. This
              integrated study of diamonds, inclusion minerals and host xenoliths will make a
              significant contribution to the knowledge of mantle conditions necessary for
              diamond formation, and the evolution of the mantle beneath the Siberian
              Platform.
