Abstract    :
              9725780  Arrowsmith    The Altyn Tagh fault in northern Tibet has unique
              characteristics  that make establishing its kinematic history pivotal to 
              understanding the evolution of the Indo-Asian collision.  This  feature,
              arguably the largest active intracontinental strike-slip  fault system on
              Earth, is a focal point in both end-member models  that have been proposed to
              describe the mechanical behavior of  continental deformation:  distributed
              shortening and lateral  extrusion.    This project involves a four year,
              integrated geological,  geochronological and geophysical investigation that
              will focus on  the determination of the magnitude, rate, and distribution of
              slip  on the Altyn Tagh fault at time scales between 10,000,000 years to  4
              years.  The principal investigators will utilize geologic mapping  and
              geochronology to establish piercing points, use paleomagnetic  analysis to
              investigate several possible oroclinal folds along the  fault, undertake a GPS
              survey to establish the slip rate, slip  distribution and locking depth along
              the fault zone, and use  mapping and cosmogenic dating of geomorphological
              features to  establish Quaternary slip rates.  ***
