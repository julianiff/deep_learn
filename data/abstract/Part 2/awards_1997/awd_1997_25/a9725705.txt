Abstract    :
              9725705  Norton    High rates of atmospheric deposition of beryllium are toxic
              biologically and are exacerbated by synergistic interaction with aluminum.  The
              Czech Republic is experiencing growing problems, and similar consequences may
              well soon be experienced in Maine.  An expert international research team would
              pursue parallel pilot studies into the biogeochemical controls on Be fate and
              transport by examining beryllium biogeochemistry in forested ecosystems.  This
              project funds the work in Maine and travel for international collaboration; the
              Czechs are supporting the work in their country.  The plan for the pilot study
              is to develop chemical time series for beryllium fluxes into, through, and out
              of watersheds in a paired study in the Bear Brook Watershed where one
              watersheds is being artificially acidified with ammonium sulfate.  The study
              evaluates the fluxes of total BE and  7Be at the forest floor, leaving the
              watersheds, and in litter fall.  Be in stream vegetation and sediment is being
              evaluated before and after acidic discharge events to assess temporary
              exchangeable pools.
