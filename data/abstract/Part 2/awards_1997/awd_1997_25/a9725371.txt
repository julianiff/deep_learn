Abstract    :
              9725371  Miller   The basin and range province of western North America, is
              produced by major coastal extension in which generally E-dipping historic
              faulting rotates crustal blocks with a top to the west reuse of motion.  Miller
              and Dumitru in the proposal not that there is an increase in fault block
              rotation and in faulting complexity from west to east.  They have also found
              evidence that this faulting youngs from east to west toward the relatively
              large and stable Sierra Nevada crustal block.  However, the timing and
              mechanisms by which the Sierra Nevada block is being eroded is not well known. 
              This study will use fission track data and detailed mapping to determine the
              timing and magnitude of exhumation by fault slip, and to help constrain pre-and
              syn-extensional temperatures and geothermal gradients within the crust.  The
              results of this study will address the fundamental question of how crust
              extends and to what extent temperature or thermal structure of the crust
              controls the distribution of faults or their displacements.
