Abstract    :
              Although netlib has been highly successful in making mathematical software
              easily available to the numerical research community, the research
              infrastructure of this community and of the broader scientific community
              (researchers and educators who are not experts in numerical analysis but who
              have a need to use numerical scientific software) could benefit from an
              expansion of netlib services.  This award will address the needs and tools to
              be developed in the following areas:  1.  Use Notification; 2.  Reconfigurable
              Repository Views;  3.  Resolution of User Interest Profiles with Software
              Classification;  4.  Incorporation of Developing Web Technologies; and 5. 
              Tools and Procedures for Submission Evaluation.  Netlib continues to be a
              valuable resource for the timely dissemination of software to the research
              community.  The large body of users of netlib and other software repositories
              provides a ready-made environment for getting rapid feedback on new services. 
              Although the proposed tasks can be accomplished with current technologies and
              tools, Web technologies currently being developed look promising not only for
              improving our basic service of distributing software but also for enhancing
              netlib's services.
