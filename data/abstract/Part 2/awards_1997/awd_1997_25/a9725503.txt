Abstract    :
              The American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE), in cooperation with the
              Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), will hold a two-day
              national conference to promote progress in understanding and implementing
              outcomes assessment for accreditation in engineering education.  The meeting,
              which will take place September 19-20, 1997, in Washington, D.C., will bring
              together representatives of higher education institutions, industry,
              government, professional associations and accrediting agencies to accomplish
              six things:  increase understanding of national trends in higher education
              assessment;                                                                    
                               examine progress in assessment in other disciplines such as
              dentistry and mathematics to understand what may be relevant to engineering;   
              review assessment practices in industry that may be relevant to educational
              assessment;    increase understanding of the goals of outcomes assessment in
              accreditation;    promote dissemination and sharing of best assessment
              practices; and     lay the groundwork for a continuing forum on outcomes
              assessment in engineering education.    ASEE requests $49,500.00 from the
              National Science Foundation to enable this review of progress in engineering
              education assessment that will also provide information on a variety of
              assessment strategies to a broad engineering education audience.  NSF funding
              for this conference will provide for set-up costs, travel costs of the
              speakers, dissemination of prepared papers and materials, and a summary report
              and proceedings.
