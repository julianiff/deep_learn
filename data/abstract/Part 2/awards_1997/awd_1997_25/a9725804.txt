Abstract    :
              9725804  Thompson   Avalon is a composite terrane that formed along the margin
              of Gondwana and crossed the ancient ocean Iapetus to collide with Laurentia by
              mid-Paleozoic time, thus is an important element in global plate reconstruction
              subsequently, fragments of Avalon drifted during younger orogenics and now
              present on both sides of the Atlantic.  Along the east coast of North America,
              fragments of Avalon occur in Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick,
              southeastern New England in the coastal mid-Atlantic states.  In order to
              accurately re-position these fragments to reconstruct the original composite
              terrane age and spatial information from each is required.   This project will
              gather age and paleomagnetically determined paleopole data for Avalon in the
              Boston Basin portion of the Southwestern New England Avalon Zone.  Results when
              combined with similar data from other Avalon terranes, will allow
              reconstructions for the original terrane or superterrane and illuminate its
              relationship to the Gondwana supercontinent.
