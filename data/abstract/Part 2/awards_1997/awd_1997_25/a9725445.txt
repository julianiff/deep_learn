Abstract    :
              9725445   Metzner      Jim Metzner Productions is producing a national radio
              designed to reach a diverse audience with compelling, current information about
              our environment, the science which underlies it, and the people who explore and
              explain it.  The short-format series consists of 780 daily, 2-minute programs
              designed for commercial and public radio stations and delivers timely
              information on a full spectrum of seasonal natural phenomena, drawing
              supportive scientific background from biology, earth science, astronomy, and
              cultural anthropology.  The series will make extensive use of ambient sound and
              interviews with scientists and knowledgeable spokespersons to present a "daily
              almanac" of events taking place on the day of broadcast.     The series will be
              developed and produced by Jim with additional production support from the
              American Museum of Natural History.  The Science content Director will be
              Michael Templeton and an advisory committee of eleven scientists and educators
              will assist in selecting specific topics for the daily programs and assure the
              scientific accuracy of program content.
