Despite long and intense scrutiny some of the most basic
              questions concerning ore deposits, such as age, duration and source, remain
              poorly constrained for many deposit types. This collaborative research effort
              between Washington State University and the University of Arizona is designed
              to investigate the age, duration and evolution of a large copper deposit in
              Canada. The evolution of the GaspÚ hydrothermal system in both space and time
              will be determined utilizing primarily three isotopic systems: [1] Sm-Nd in
              garnet, pyroxene, scheelite and fluorite; [2] Re-Os in molybdenite,
              chalcopyrite and pyrite; and [3] U-Pb in titanite, allanite, zircon and garnet.
              The compositional contrasts among magma, skarn and wall rocks combined with
              multiple minerals which can be analyzed with these systems, provide an
              unparalleled opportunity for investigating the age and duration of
              mineralization, the age of individual mineralization/alteration episodes/zones,
              the sources of metals, and the behavior of different isotopic systems in a
              complex hydrothermal environment. The insights gained from this research will
              be applicable to a wide variety of ore deposits.
