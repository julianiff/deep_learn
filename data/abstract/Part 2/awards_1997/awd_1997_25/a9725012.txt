Abstract    :
               This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) is to investigate and develop
              flexible fixtures with electrorheological (ER) and magnetorheological (MR)
              phase-change materials.  The basic concept is rooted in the ability of certain
              classes of materials to change from a fluid to a solid and back to a fluid
              again.  The research plan includes (1)  material properties and synthesis and
              (2) methods of flexible fixture design with good locating accuracy.   The use
              of ER and MR materials for fixturing of parts is a novel concept. Potential
              applications include fixturing of complex parts for machining operations.
