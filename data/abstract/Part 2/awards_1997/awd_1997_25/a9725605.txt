              National Science Foundation  Informal Science Education Program  Abstract     
              9725605  Sciencenter  Tech City Exhibition    The Sciencenter will develop Tech
              City Exhibition, a 2500 sq. ft. traveling exhibit that will promote awareness
              of engineering as a process and a career.  The exhibit will consist of a set of
              twelve interactive exhibit stations presenting design tasks from various fields
              of engineering related to the human needs of a hypothetical community called
              "Tech City."  The tasks will use engineering as an iterative process to meet
              design goals (e.g. building a structure strong enough to withstand an
              earthquake) while faced with constraints (e.g. a limited budget.)  The primary
              audience will be youth in their late elementary and middle school years with a
              specific emphasis on women and other groups traditionally underrepresented in
              engineering.  A broad menu of complementary activities will be developed that
              includes a hands-on program for visiting school groups, a teacher training
              technology unit, career speakers' bureau, "Engineering Day at the Mall"
              program, and activities especially created for families.  The Association of
              Science and Technology Centers will manage the national tour of the exhibit. 
              It is schedule to circulate for three years and reach an estimated one million
              individuals.
