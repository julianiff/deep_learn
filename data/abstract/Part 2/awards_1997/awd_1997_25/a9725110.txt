Abstract    :
              With communication technology and the use of mentors, the   Disabilities,
              Opportunities, Inter-networking, and Technology   (DO-IT) program builds a
              communication network for disabled high  school students who would otherwise
              remain isolated and   segregated.  The network opens these students to new
              possibilities  in science, mathematics, and engineering and helps sustain them 
              through their high school and college academic experiences.   Another strength
              is the program's emphasis on developing college  faculty awareness of how the
              barriers and challenges for the  disabled can be overcome, contributing to a
              more positive and  diverse learning environment.  DO-IT has positively altered
              the  educational infrastructure by creating a self-sustaining community,  free
              from spatial constraints and creatively links new isolated   populations such
              as the Seattle Children's Hospital to its   communication network.  The
              strengths of the nominee include:        .  Innovative, strong and working.   
              .  Ninety percent of the participants have graduated from high       school and
              are pursuing post-secondary degrees.    .  Showcased in President's Summit for
              America's Future.      In summary, this nomination for the Presidential Awards
              for   Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring is 
              outstanding.  The program is innovative and timely.  The total  number of
              participants is not large but the level of quality is  high.
