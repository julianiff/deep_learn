Abstract    :
              9725311  Flower    We propose to develop the first astronomically tuned stable
              isotope time series for the late Oligocene to early Miocene (21-27.5 Ma) with
              cores collected during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 154 to Ceara Rise,
              western Equatorial Atlantic.  This time series will be a composite record,
              constructed with the carbon and oxygen isotope records of benthic foraminifers
              from three Holes on Ceara Rise (Sites 926, 928, and 929).  Through splicing,
              the composite will be stratigraphically continuous over a 6.5 m.y long
              interval.  As such, it will be one of the single longest high-resolution
              isotope time series ever assembled.  Preliminary work has demonstrated the
              feasibility of the proposed approach.  In fact, efforts are now underway to
              tune the magnetic susceptibility and existing stable isotope records to orbital
              spectra for this interval (in collaboration with N.J. Shackleton).    With the
              astronomically tuned isotope record we will be able to (1) estimate the
              relative ages of the Oligocene/Miocene boundary, (18O maxima Oi2a, Mi1, Mi1a
              (as well as all minor events), and (2) characterize in unprecedented detail the
              evolution of late Oligocene/early Miocene climate variability
              (ice-volume/temperature).  Several important benefits will be derived from the
              results of this investigation.  For one, the proposed astronomically tuned
              isotope time series will serve as a global standard reference section by which
              all other late Oligocene-early Miocene marine sequences are compared.  It will
              be possible, using stable isotope stratigraphies, to correlate and calibrate
              either long or short segments of sedimentary sections to this record, thereby
              significantly improving the accuracy of age models.  More importantly, by
              providing the framework for reconstructing changes in climate, deep ocean
              circulation and chemistry, the tuned Ceara Rise isotope records should greatly
              enhance paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic research on this interval.  In sum,
              the proposed Milankovitch-scale records will rep resent a significant advance
              in Cenozoic stratigraphy and Earth history.
