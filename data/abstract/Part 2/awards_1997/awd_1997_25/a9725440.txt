Abstract    :
              9725440  Johnson  This project focuses on the exhumation history of the
              Grenville-aged Adirondack basement. Recent studies pint to the importance of
              shear zones in the exhumation of the Grenville-province. This project is to
              study the field relationships, mineral assemblages, mineral and bulk-rock
              chemistries, fluid inclusions, 40Ar/39Ar cooling ages and U/Pb ages from
              discrete shear zones within the Dana Hill Metagabbro and adjacent Diana Syenite
              Complex in the Carthage-Colton Mylonite Zone in the Northwestern Adirondack
              Mountains. The goals of the proposed research are to determine the
              pressure-temperature conditions of a number of temporally distinct
              deformational events. These data will be used to evaluate the late to
              post-Grenville uplift/exhumation path for the region and to provide a better
              understanding of the role of the Carthage Colton Mylonite Zone in this
              exhumation history.
