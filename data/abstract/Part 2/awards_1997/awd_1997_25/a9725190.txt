Abstract    :
              9725190  Pati(o Douce  The research to be performed consists of determination of
              the melting relations, melt fractions, and melt and restite compositions of
              crustal rocks at conditions characteristic of ultra-high pressure metamorphism.
              The bulk of the experimental work will be conducted at pressures of 30 and 40
              kbar which is the most relevant pressure range for UHPM. A few experiments at
              20 kbar will also be performed, with the objective of tying the 30 and 40 kbar
              results to lower pressure ((15 kbar) experiments on the same starting materials
              already completed by the PI in previous projects. The starting materials to be
              investigated are the felsic metapelite from the Himalayas and the calc-alkaline
              tonalite from the Sierra Nevada. These two starting materials are suitable
              models for the most abundant sedimentary and igneous rocks in continental
              crust, respectively. Experiments will be performed both without added H2O
              (dehydration melting) and with small amounts of added H2O.
