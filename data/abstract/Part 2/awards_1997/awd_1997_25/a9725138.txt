Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9725138  BOSE    This is a planning grant to hold a planning
              meeting a Washington State University to become a research site of the
              multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Power
              Systems Engineering.  The Washington State University research site would be
              added to those research site would be added to those of Cornell University, The
              University of California Berkeley and Howard University.    The research
              projects proposed for addition to the Center's established research agenda are,
              1.  Corona Streamer Onset as an Optimization Criterion for Design of High
              Voltage Hardware on Transmission Lines, 2. Stability Analysis of WSCC Western
              Inter-Tie, 3. Unite Commitment in a Competitive Environment and 4. On-Line
              Dynamic Security Assessment.
