Abstract    :
                9725421  FAZIO    This proposed investigation will examine the use of
              relational terms in children's mathematical performance.  Young children in
              poverty are at risk for academic failure in mathematics.  One neglected area of
              research has been children's understanding of mathematical vocabulary. 
              Differences in life experiences between children from poverty and their middle
              class peers may lead to differences in the development of mathematical
              vocabulary.  This exploratory research would study the relationships among
              young children's understanding of relational terms, their ability to use
              context in judging the meaning or works, and mathematics achievement. 
              Low-Income children's basic knowledge of relational and mathematical vocabulary
              will be compared to classmates from middle -class homes.  In addition, the
              research will investigate how young children from different backgrounds come to
              understand that some words have a dominant meaning and an alternate
              mathematical meaning.
