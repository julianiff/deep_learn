Abstract    :
              9725431  Smith    This project is a collaborative, integrated study of the 
              Yellowstone hotspot and it's interaction with the continental  lithosphere and
              how it's processes effect active tectonism and  volcanism.  This study will
              provide resolved images of the  lithosphere-asthenosphere structure and the
              deformation field  (using seismic and GPS imaging and kinematic modelling) from
              which  a dynamic model of the asthnosphere-lithosphere interaction will be 
              made as well as understanding the relationship between the  intraplate
              deformation of the Yellowstone-Snake River Plain with  the overall North
              American plate motion dynamics.                   ***
