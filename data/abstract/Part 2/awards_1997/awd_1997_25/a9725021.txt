Abstract    :
              Biomolecular Computation (BMC) is an area of great potential  due to the massive
              parallelism available at the molecular  scale.  However, a realistic assessment
              must also take into  account that research in this area possesses considerable 
              risk, due to its lack of maturity.  This is a multi-group  effort encompassing
              several groups within the United States  working on BMC.  The goal of this
              project is to organize the  energies of these groups so as to harness a
              collective  accomplishments that may exceed the individual efforts. This 
              project will emphasize collaborative development of the  infrastructure in
              support of BMC, to further develop and  test its basic capabilities.  The
              groups will investigate  key aspects of BMC.  These will include:
              Demonstrations of  BMC.  The key subtakes are: word design; register design for
               storage and retrieval of logical and numeric information;  execution of basic
              operations such as logical and  arithmetric operations, and the sequential
              chaining of these  operations; input of data and readout of results and 
              interfacing with silicon-based computers; and methods to  improve error
              resiliency. Nano-construction of New 3D  Structures. Applications of BMC.  This
              will include:  biological applications exploration and demonstrations of 
              intractable NP search problems solution of analog problems  Software Tools. 
              For simulation, design and associated  mathematical models.
