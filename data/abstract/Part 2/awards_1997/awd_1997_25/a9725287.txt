Abstract    :
              9725287  Feeley  This is a proposal designed to carry out a geological and
              geochemical transect across the northern part of the Absaroka volcanic field,
              Wyoming.  Because the Absaroka volcanic rocks record one of the most voluminous
              and compositionally diverse magmatic episodes to affect the Cordillera during
              the Eocene, the results obtained from this study will significantly improve our
              knowledge of the ages, compositions, and petrogenesis of Tertiary magmatism in
              the northern Rocky Mountains.  This, in turn, will provide insight into the
              fundamental problem of how rock suites with potentially arc-like calc-alkaline
              affinities and across-strike geochemical trends can form in such different
              tectonic environments, and possibly in the absence of contemporaneous
              subduction.  The analytical work will include analysis of major and trace
              elements by XRF and ICP-MS, analysis of Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic ratios by TIMS,
              and mineral analysis by electron microprobe. Overall, this study represents a
              realistic first approach towards providing a modern petrologic perspective on
              one of the outstanding unresolved issues in deciphering the Cenozoic geological
              history of the northwestern United States: namely, the origin of the Absaroka
              magmatic rocks.
