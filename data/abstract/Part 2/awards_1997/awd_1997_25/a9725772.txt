Abstract    :
              9725772  Ward    This research involves the use of computer simulations of fault
               system ruptures incorporating the physics of earthquake stress  transfer and
              constrained by excellent, but limited, bodies of  geological and seismological
              data.  By this means, the  observational catalog of earthquakes can be extended
              with a deeper  perspective on the distribution of earthquakes and seismicity
              and  their relationships to fault segmentation and geometry, static  strength
              and pre-stress, and friction law parameters.  Products  from this research
              should be of value in addressing questions that  are both fundamental, related
              to characterization of the earthquake  source, and practical, related to the
              understanding of geological  field data and in the quantification of earthquake
              recurrence  statistics.  This research is a component of the National 
              Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
