Abstract    :
              9725735  Owens    This grant provides partial support of the costs of upgrading
              the  University of South Carolina geophysics computer network.  Eight  existing
              Sun workstations (SUN SPARC 1's, SLC and LX's) purchased  between 1990 and 1994
              will be upgraded to Ultra 1 configurations  and two existing servers to Ultra 2
              configurations. Increased  computational speed and disk storage capacity will
              benefit  presently funded and planned computationally intensive research 
              programs in lithospheric seismology, GPS geodesy and  seismotectonics. 
              Additionally, increased disk storage capacity  will serve as archival support
              for the South Carolina Seismic  Network funded by the USGS and the DOE-Savannah
              River Site but  maintained by South Carolina geophysics faculty.  Recently
              funded  research (EAR-9706663) will require state-of-the-art processing  power
              and massive data storage for development of seismic models  of the lower mantle
              based on data collected from temporary  broadband regional networks.  Powerful
              graphics capabilities will  allow visualization of 3-D seismic models of the
              deep continental  structure of cratonic lithosphere in Tanzania inferred from 
              PASSCAL data and real-time visualization of geological time-scale  tectonic
              motions at convergent margins in Central and South  America calculated from
              campaign and permanent GPS data.  ***
