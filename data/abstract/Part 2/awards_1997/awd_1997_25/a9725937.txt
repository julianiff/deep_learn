Abstract    :
              9725937  Levin    Support for this project will enable American researchers to 
              collaborate with and benefit from researchers and facilities  at the Center for
              Ecological Research at Kyoto University in  Japan and the Center for Population
              Biology at the Imperial  College in the United Kingdom.  The impact of
              environmental  variability and competitive exclusion on the number of  species
              required to maintain a certain level of function in  communities will be
              determined mathematically.  Those  relationships will then be tested in a
              series of experiments  in which species numbers and environments are
              manipulated.  The U.S. team will be primarily responsible for the  derivation
              of the theoretical diversity-function  relationships, and will, in cooperation
              with the U.K. team,  conduct field experiments in which species number, 
              precipitation, and herbivory are manipulated.  The Japanese  team will perform
              growth-chamber experiments on communities  subjected to different levels of
              predation or parasitism.    Many current analyses of ecological
              diversity-function  relationships ignore variations in the performance of 
              individual species with varying environmental conditions,  and ignore the
              impacts of competitive exclusion on multi-  year measures of community
              function.  This project will  combine the expertise and facilities of American,
              Japanese  and British research groups to investigate the level of  biodiversity
              preservation required to maintain essential  ecosystem services and functions.
