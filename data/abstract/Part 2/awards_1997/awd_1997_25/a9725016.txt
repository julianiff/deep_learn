Abstract    :
              ECS-9725016  Michel    This project seeks to sponsor engineering students an
              IEEE Control Systems Society Meeting, the 1997 IEEE Conference on Decision and
              Control (CDC'97).  The goal is to develop an opportunity for students to be
              informed about the most recent advances in Control Systems.  Opportunities for
              student attendance will be advertised nationwide and women, minorities and
              disabled students will be especially encouraged to apply for sponsorship.
