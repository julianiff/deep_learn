Abstract    :
              In mammals a key hormone involved in reproduction is follicle-stimulating
              hormone, FSH.  This hormone is released by the pituitary gland, which is
              connected to part of the brain called the hypothalamus.  The mechanisms that
              regulate the timed release of this hormone are largely unknown.  Recently it
              has been shown that the blood circulating to the pituitary from the brain can
              include an unknown compound that stimulates FSH release (FSH-releasing factor,
              or FSH-RF) in a pulsatile fashion.  This action seems to be independent from
              the release regulated by the known contribution of the compound activin, or of
              another releasing hormone called GnRH.  This project utilizes biochemical,
              pharmacological and anatomical techniques, with a novel model system to
              separate the neural supply from the blood supply to the pituitary, to localize
              the timing and source of this novel releasing factor as a step towards
              identifying it.
    Results will be very important for neuroendocrinology by
              clarifying release mechanisms for a major hormone involved in puberty as well
              as reproduction, and will have a likely impact also in veterinary and
              agricultural fields.
