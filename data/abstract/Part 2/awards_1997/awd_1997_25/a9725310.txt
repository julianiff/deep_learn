Abstract    :
              9725310  McNutt  Volcanic earthquakes and tremor commonly precede volcanic
              eruptions. However, these special signals are poorly understood. To improve our
              understanding, an international team of 25 scientists and technicians from the
              United States, Japan, and Italy joined the staff of the U.S.G.S. Hawaiian
              Volcano Observatory in January 1996 and February 1997 to make the most detailed
              seismic recordings on Kilauea Volcano ever, using the largest total number of
              seismic instruments ever installed on a volcano. One hundred-sixteen portable
              seismographs were installed beginning January 11, 1996 in and near Kilauea
              Crater in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park as a joint Japan-United States
              research project to record volcanic earthquakes and tremor. On February 1,
              1996, a swarm of over 500 earthquakes was recorded by the dense network,
              providing the best recording of an earthquake swarm at Kilauea. In February
              1997, a second intrusion of molten rock was recorded by the networks in place
              for Phase II of the experiment. The data collected offer an unprecedented
              opportunity to understand earthquakes associated with magma transport. Similar
              events occur at many volcanoes and they will be useful to forecast eruptions.
              We will study: 1) P- and S-wave tomography to learn about the structure of the
              volcano, 2) array sufficiency to find the best places to locate instruments,
              and 3) site response and signal variability to understand volcanic complexity.
              These were chosen for initial analyses because of our interest and expertise
              and because of the broad applicability of the expected results.
