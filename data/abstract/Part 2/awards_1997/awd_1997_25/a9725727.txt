Abstract    :
              9725607  Quade    The Himalayas stand at the center of the debate on how
              mountain building can alter climate.  One of the clearest proxies of the global
              effects of Himalayan uplift is the marine 87Sr/86Sr record.  Yet the specific
              contribution that past and present Himalayan rivers make to the marine
              87Sr/86Sr record, and how this contribution translates quantitatively into
              silicate weathering rates and therefore consumption of atmospheric CO2 is
              unclear.  Our recent research demonstrates that the 87Sr/86Sr ratios of
              Himalayan paleorivers can be reconstructed from carbonates preserved in the
              Siwalik Group foreland basin deposits in the frontal part of the Himalayan
              fold-thrust belt.  These data show 87Sr/86Sr ratios have increased markedly in
              the late Neogene, probably in response to unroofing of high 87Sr/86Sr
              (0.720-0.729) marble and dolostone in the Lesser Himalayan and frontal
              Himalayan nappes.  We propose to (1) expand our Himalayan river 87Sr/86Sr
              record into easternmost Nepal, and back to the beginning of the Miocene,
              thereby completing the isotopic history for the paleo-Ganges river system, (2)
              quantify the contribution of carbonate versus silicate weathering in a modern
              Nepali river, and (3) combine the isotopic data with sedimentological,
              structural, and provenance data from the foreland basin deposits in order to
              document the entire record of erosional unroofing of the Nepal Himalayas since
              the beginning of the Miocene.  The results of the proposed research will have
              major implications for our understanding of the relationships between
              collisional orogenesis, climate, and ocean water chemistry.
