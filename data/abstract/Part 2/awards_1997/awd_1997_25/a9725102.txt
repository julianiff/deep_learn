Abstract    :
                                      ABSTRACT       This proposal is to fund innovative
              exploratory research on the general link between heat transfer, dynamic
              characteristics, and failure modes of mechanical components.  The work is
              related to frictional heating in sliding solid surfaces with deforming
              contacts.  A thermohydrodynamic analysis will be carried out to establish the
              relevant heat transfer mechanisms.  The effects of separation of the friction
              material will be determined.  The proposed work could lead to enhanced
              understanding of the fundamental issues relevant to problems that occur at the
              interface of heat transfer and tribology.
