Abstract    :
              9725719      This conference will bring together social scientists, Alaska
              Natives,   and others from Alaska and Russia to examine Alaska Native  
              communities, their participation and role in social and economic   development,
              their governance and organizational structures, and their   relationship to
              other institutions. Alaska's experience will be   assessed for applicability to
              Native communities in the Russian   Northeast and North.
