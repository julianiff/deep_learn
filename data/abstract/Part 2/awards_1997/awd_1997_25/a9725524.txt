Abstract    :
              9725524  Horwitz    Over the past several years, with support form the
              Applications of Advanced Technology Program of NSF, we have developed and
              evaluated a series of computer applications that offer a new paradigm for
              educational software, the computer-based manipulative (CBM). The CBM is an
              open-ended environment consisting of linked representations and affordances
              that reify an underlying model and enable students to investigate scientific
              and mathematical concepts via direct manipulation and experimentation.  One of
              our most successful CBMs has been GenScope, which helps students reason about
              genetics at multiple levels.  We propose to broaden the scope of this
              technology by creating three additional CBMs dealing with tissues, cells, and
              molecules.  These new applications will interact with each other and with
              GenScope, to form a seamless exploratory environment within which students can
              investigate phenomena spanning subdisciplines that are taught separately in the
              traditional biology curriculum.  To achieve such interoperability will involve
              advanced research in component software technology.  We will design and publish
              protocols and standards for inter-component communication that will make it
              possible for future developers to create CBMs of their own and link them to
              ours. Working in urban and suburban schools, we will conduct formative research
              to determine the optimum use and educational effectiveness of this new
              technology.
