Abstract    :
              ***  9725263  Parish     This project is a study of how the cold and intense
              surface winds that flow down from the antarctic continental ice sheet (the
              so-called katabatic winds) interact with the larger scale pressure gradients
              that result from the passage of synoptic weather systems around the antarctic
              perimeter.  Recent research has shown that while katabatic winds play an
              important role in the atmospheric mass, heat, and momentum budgets at high
              southern latitudes, their interaction with synoptic weather systems is complex
              and unclear, with different studies leading to different conclusions.   This
              study will make use of a series of observations on the structure of the
              antarctic troposphere that resulted from an international effort to assemble
              the most complete, detailed, and accurate data set possible for several
              prescribed observation periods in 1994 and 1995 - the First Regional Observing
              Study of the Troposphere (FROST).  State-of-the-art numerical models will
              complement these observations: the National Center for Atmospheric
              Research/Pennsylvania State University MM5 model, the Colorado State University
              RAMS model, and the University of Wisconsin NMS model.  Preliminary work has
              indicated that these models will be capable of realistically resolving the
              antarctic environment.    Numerical simulations of cyclonic systems along the
              coast of East Antarctica will be conducted to resolve the response of the
              katabatic wind regime.  Extensive evaluation of model results will take place
              in order to determine the magnitude of individual terms in the equations of
              motion that are affected by the synoptic systems, the katabatic winds, and the
              underlying terrain.  It is expected that this work will provide new information
              and a greater understanding of the connections of antarctic weather systems to
              the circulation of the free atmosphere both at higher altitudes and lower
              latitudes, and to global atmospheric processes.  ***
