Abstract    :
              9725360  Iverson  This award supports a program to conduct experiments with a 
              ring-shear device that deforms a large water-saturated till  specimen to high
              strains, for studies of till comminution,  rheology, and fabric development. 
              Despite the widespread  realization that subglacial sediment affects the
              dynamics of  ice sheets, the factors that control the sediment mass  balance
              remain obscure.  Direct measurements beneath a  handful of glaciers seem to
              indicate a wide range of  behavior, varying from pervasive deformation of the
              bed to  motion that is focused at the glacier sole.  The  interpretation of
              these measurements and the accurate  modeling of basal sediment transport
              requires laboratory  studies aimed at revealing the fundamental factors that 
              control the distribution of motion at the glacier bed.
