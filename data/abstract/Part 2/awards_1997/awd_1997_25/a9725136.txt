                                   OPP97-25136     Viruses in Pack Ice Communities of the
              Ross Sea, Antarctica    Primary productivity of sea ice algal communities in
              the  Southern Ocean is significant.  In lower latitudes,  processes such as
              grazing and lysis by viruses are thought  to control algal populations, but
              there are few data on  grazing within ice communities and no data on viruses of
              ice  algae.  Ice communities should be excellent sites for  studying viral
              control of populations of eukaryotic algae  and protozoans because populations
              can reach high densitites  and many habitats are nearly closed for parts of the
              year.  This study will use transmission electron microscopy (TEM)  of
              individual eukaryotic algal and protozoan cells and light  microscopy and TEM
              of water samples to assess viral  infections and viral populations in a variety
              of pack ice  communities from the Ross Sea.  The objectives are (1) to 
              determine the extent of the occurrence of viruses within  cells of algae and
              protozoans in ice communities and to  estimate the percentage of infected
              cells, (2) to relate the  extent of the occurrence of viruses within cells to
              the  stages of succession of sea ice communities (3) to assess  the potential
              for ice communities to seed viruses to the  pelagial, (4) to determine the
              extent of ingestion of virus-  like particles by sea ice protozooplankton, (5)
              to compare  these features of ice communities to those of phytoplankton  and
              protozooplankton assemblages in the seawater directly  under the ice and (6) to
              describe and quantify the size  structure of the free virus-like particles in
              the  intersitital water of ice communities and in the seawater  directly under
              the ice.  Thus study will contribute to the  understanding of sea ice community
              ecology and will allow  incorporation of viruses of eukaryotic algae and
              protozoans  into models of carbon flow for the Antarctic.
