Abstract    :
                This study proposes to study the diversity, abundance, and structure of the
              salmonid fish community of the high altitude headwaters of a critical arctic
              watershed (Katun-Ob' River) in the Altai Republic of the Russian Federation of
              States.  No comprehensive ichthyological surveys have been ever been conducted
              in this region, and this study will represent one of the first to document the
              aquatic fauna, and the hydrographic and limnological correlates, of upstream
              habitats of arctic rivers.  The proposed research will provide critical data
              that will be used to test the generality of ecological hypotheses developed
              through research at the Toolik Lake, Alaska LTER site.  The PI is able to
              undertake this research in the Altai Republic, Central Siberia, because of a
              unique opportunity afforded by collaboration with researchers at the Russian
              Academy of Sciences.   Because the logistical demands are extreme and the
              window for opportunity is time-sensitive, the PIs have chosen to submit a
              proposal of limited scope under the guidelines of the Small Grants for
              Exploratory Research (SGER) program.
