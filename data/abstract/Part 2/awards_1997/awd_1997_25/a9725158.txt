Abstract    :
              9725158  Marsh  It has long been a mystery why some large bodies of igneous rock
              are nearly uniform and other outwardly similar bodies are not.  There are two
              groups, those initially containing large crystals (phenocrysts) and those
              initially free of phenocrysts.  The former tend toward compositional and
              textural uniformity.  Crystal nucleation and growth seem to be controlled by
              upper and lower inward propagating solidification fronts (SF) that stifle
              crystal fractionation.  The Null Hypothesis says that sheet-like magmas
              initially free of phenocrysts undergo little differentiation. We have tested
              this hypothesis on a thick (330 m) diabase sill and find it holds.  To be a
              general, fundamental concept it must be tested on a large body.  The Sudbury
              Igneous Complex (SIC) is an ideal large body to both test the Null Hypothesis
              and also to gain insight into the solidification dynamics of phenocryst free
              systems.  The history of solidification will be tracked by making a
              comprehensive study doing Crystal Size Distributions (CSDs) of the SIC using a
              series of drill cores through the entire body.  For this purpose, Falconbridge
              Limited has allowed unlimited access to their vast holdings of core from the
              SIC. This work will contribute substantially to and complement other studies of
              Sudbury, and will contribute fundamentally to the understanding of large
              magmatic systems.
