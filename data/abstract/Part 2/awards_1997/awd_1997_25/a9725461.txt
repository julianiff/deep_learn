Abstract    :
              9725461  Stolper  The goals of this project are: (1) refining a new experimental
              approach for determining the partial molar volumes of oxide components in
              silicate liquids as a function of P and T; (2) applying this approach to
              determine the partial molar volumes of SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2 and Fe2O3 in silicate
              liquids at mantle pressures; (3) determining the 1 bar activities of SiO2,
              Al2O3 and TiO2 in silicate liquid compositions corresponding to those produced
              in the PIs elevated pressure experiments using the Pd-oxide equilibration
              technique and the 1 bar activity of Fe2O3 using Pt-oxide equilibration; and (4)
               possibly identifying pressure-induced coordination changes for SiO2, Al2O3,
              TiO2, and Fe2O3 in silicate liquids at mantle conditions. The data to be
              collected will provide an important complement to 1 bar determinations of
              partial molar volumes and compressibilities. The 1 bar activity determinations
              for SiO2, Al2O3, and TiO2 and Fe2O3 will provide data that can be used to (1)
              improve the accuracy of our partial molar volume determinations, and (2)
              improve the calibration of solution models for silicate liquids.
