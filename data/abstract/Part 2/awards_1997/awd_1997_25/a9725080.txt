Abstract    :
              9725080  Nightingale  This senior PI is well recognized for his highly
              innovative  numerical work in a wide variety of problems in statistical 
              mechanics.  In this renewal grant, he is being supported to  devise
              sophisticated algorithms and to calculate eigenvalues  using quantum Monte
              Carlo methods.  The specific  applications of these calculations, in
              statistical mechanics  are in the general area of dynamic critical phenomena, 
              especially the universal properties.  In quantum mechanics,  the applications
              are to a calculation of properties of  ground state and also excited states of
              both bosonic and  fermionic  van der Waals  clusters.  %%%  This renewal grant
              supports the work of a senior PI well  known for his innovative numerical work
              on a large number of  problems in statistical mechanics and in quantum
              mechanics.  The work here contains solutions to specific problems in  both
              statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics, as well as  development of
              sophisticated and complex computational  algorithms.  ***
