              ABSTRACT  CMS-9725010  Schiffries  "Partial Support of the U.S. National
              Committee  for Rock Mechanics"    This award to the National Academy of
              Sciences is for  support of the activities of the U.S. National Committee for 
              Rock Mechanics (USNC/RM), operating under the Board on Earth  Sciences and
              Resources, National Research Council, during  the one-year period from
              September 1, 1997 through August  31, 1998.  The USNC/RM represents the United
              States in the  International Society for Rock Mechanics, and supports  symposia
              and workshops in the U.S. and North America to  offer a venue for researchers
              in the national groups from  the U.S., Canada, and Mexico to present and
              discuss their  work.  The USNC/RM also provides a forum for meetings with 
              federal agencies and other organizations to keep abreast of  developments in
              the field and to identify issues of national  significance that may merit
              independent inquiry to serve the  needs of the government.  ***
