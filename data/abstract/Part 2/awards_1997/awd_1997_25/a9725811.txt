Abstract    :
              9725811  Taylor  This proposal is part of a continuing effort to understand
              water-rock interactions in the Earth's crust and the mechanisms of 18O/16O
              exchange between minerals and fluids.  Recently, the PI and coworkers have
              discovered a new type of 18O/16O signature was discovered in the welded
              ash-flow tuffs, namely the coexistence of  18O-depleted volcanic glass with
              feldspar and quartz phenocrysts that have preserved their primary magmatic
              18O/16O values.  This implied that large amounts of low-18O meteoric
              groundwater had tocirculate through the tuff at high temperatures (500(-650(C),
              on a short enough time scale ((25 years) that the feldspar (18O values were
              undisturbed, suggesting an analog to the spectacular fumarolic activity that
              occurred in 1912-1924 at the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, Mt. Katmai National
              Park, Alaska.  The present proposal aims to test these concepts on an
              outflow-tuff sheet; such a study would be more directly analogous to the
              activity seen on the surface at Katmai.  The 760,000 year old, 200-m thick
              Bishop Tuff in California appears to be an ideal field area, because of good
              zones of shallow-dipping columnar joints.  The amounts of magmatic H2O in these
              systems and the mechanisms of hydrologic recharge for these fossil fumaroles
              will be investigated by making detailed 18O/16O studies, as well as making a
              regional 18O/16O map and comparing it to what is known about the pre-eruptive
              surface topography of the BishopTuff.  This will allow a test as to whether
              these fossil fumaroles were fed by groundwater flow from the newly-formed Long
              Valley Lake down through the upper zone of permeable, partially welded ash-flow
              tuff.  The role of columnar jointing in fumarolic meteoric-hydrothermal
              circulation will also be studied.
