Abstract    :
              9725531  Berger    Quantitative measurements of thermoluminescence (TL) of
              minerals in  unheated sediments provide a dating technique useful in a variety 
              of applications in paleoclimate, paleoseismic, volcano, and  stratigraphic
              research. The TL method is especially useful for  age-dating extending to ages
              beyond the practical application of  the radiocarbon technique (ca. 40 to 50
              thousand years). This award  provides fifty percent of the funds required to
              purchase  instrumentation for the upgrade of a TL dating laboratory at the 
              Desert Research Institute of the University of Nevada. The  institution is
              committed to providing the remaining funds necessary  for the purchase of the
              equipment.  ***
