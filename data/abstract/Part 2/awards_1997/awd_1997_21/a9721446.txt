Abstract    :
              Proposal No.: 9721446  PI:  Auner  University: Wayne St. U        ABSTRACT   
              The students will be trained in sensor design, fabrication, and VLSI
              integration.  The project is a collaboration between personnel in the
              Electrical and Computer Engineering Department and the Physics Department at
              Wayne State University.  The project will involve research in the technology of
              electronic and photonic materials, devices and associated interactive
              electronics.  The students will be exposed to a variety of hands-on experiments
              involving the development of prototype sensors for use with VLSI integration in
              the Center for Smart Sensors and Integrated Devices at the Wayne State
              University Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.  The work
              performed by the students will be used to enhance the curriculum being
              developed in the area of microelectronics materials integration and smart
              devices.  The objective of the proposed REU Site is to provide students with a
              comprehensive research experience in smart sensors and integrated devices-
              providing them with unique opportunities that they ordinarily would not have. 
              Particular emphasis will be placed on increasing the number of female and
              minority students in the program and to encourage an increase in
              under-represented students in our graduate program.
