Abstract    :
              Of importance to geotechnical and structural engineers,  and 
              for
nondestructive  evaluation in general, is the ability to estimate
soil
              properties and structural properties, respectively,  without
intruding  into 
              the  medium.   This  project involves using time
series analysis on data that
              has traveled through  the  earth  or
through  a  structure  to  determine 
              physical  properties of the
medium.  System identification techniques will be
              used  to  model
the system. The main research effort will be the mapping from
              the
system identification coefficients to the physical parameters  of
a  
              more  realistic  physical  model  than  has  been  previously
employed. A
              model that takes into account distributed mass  on  a
discrete level (not just
              lumped mass) and damping due to friction
(not just viscous damping) will be
              employed. Plane wave solutions
will   be  considered  to  determine  the 
              mapping  from  the  SI
coefficients to the physical parameters.  There  are 
              interesting
mathematical questions in determining the existence of plane
              wave
solutions,  the  numerical  computation  of   such   plane  
              wave
solutions,  the  effects of lattice induced anisotropy due to
              the
discrete nature of the distributed mass, and alternatives to  the
ARMA 
              model  for  system identification.  The PI will work at the
Department  of 
              Civil  and  Environmental  Engineering   at   the
University  of California,
              Berkeley, collaborating with Professor
Steven D. Glaser.
