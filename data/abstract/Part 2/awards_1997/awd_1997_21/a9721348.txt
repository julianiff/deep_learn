Abstract    :
              The objectives of this project are to develop practical tools for online
              analysis and visualization of experimental video data that should be applicable
              in both research and teaching laboratories.  The system will have a familiar
              web-based interface, promote collaborative visualization and remote access and
              take advantage of distributed computing resources to attain near-realtime
              performance.  The system will be particularly oriented towards the seamless
              acquisition and analysis of video data in order to detech transitions during
              the running of experiments.  Fast display techniques and spatial Karhunen-Loeve
              reconstructions will be among the techniques implemented to allow
              experimentalists to map out bifurcation structure as experimental parameters
              are changed.
