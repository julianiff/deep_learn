Abstract    :
              The bandwidth required  for accessing over the internet 3D models  that support
              interactive graphic applications in manufacturing,  scientific, commercial, and
              entertainment areas exceeds the  capabilities of current personal computers and
              phone connections  by several orders of magnitude. Anticipated technology 
              improvements are offset by the growing need for more detailed  models of
              oceans, cities, factories, aircrafts, virtual malls,  appliances, molecules, or
              atomic reactions. This project will  investigate new theories, architectures,
              datastructures,  and  algorithms for a 3D geometry server that will
              significantly  reduce the delays experienced by internet client-users when
              first  accessing complex 3D databases, when interactively navigating  through
              the model, and when inspecting specific details. The  project will explore the
              acceptable visual error limits in common  applications and will exploit these
              tolerances to significantly  improve on existing techniques for 3D
              simplification, geometric  compression, and progressive transmission of 3D
              models. The  project will develop new compact multi-resolution datastructures 
              and new algorithms that combine 3D simplification and  compression. 
              Anticipated results may impact software products and standards  for the
              internet exploitation of the broadly available  interactive 3D graphics
              technology.
