Abstract    :
              The objective of this research activity is to explore and further advance the
              use of multiresolution algorithms for modeling, simulation, and visualization
              in the semi-immersive 3D stereoscopic display environment provided by the
              Responsive Workbench.  This large scale (1.8 by 1.35m) horizontal display
              allows users to interact naturally with virtual objects and datasets.  It also
              places heavy demands on rapid display and manipulation algorithms, requiring
              new methodologies, which will be developed for 1)  construction of subdivision
              representations, 2) their compression for progressive transmission over
              networks, 3) adaptive, level-of-detail display and 4) advanced manipulation
              tools.  This research will be able to leverage a strong ongoing program in
              multiresolution modeling which has already demonstrated the power of the basic
              multiresolution algorithms for geometric modeling tasks.
