Abstract    :
              The project builds on work on algorithms, tools, and applications  for
              parallel/distributed Symbolic and Algebraic Computation  (SAC).  Existing tools
              for parallel SAC will be refined.  Additional tools will be built and
              applications to the  algorithmic solution of specific problems in computer
              algebra  will be made.  The project also investigates the design of a  system
              to make mathematical computations easily accessible and  conveniently
              interoperable on the Internet. The research also  involves design and
              implementation of experimental software that  can become very useful for
              scientific research and mathematics  education.  The research focuses on the
              following specific areas:    I.   Parallel computation of GCD, factors, Grobner
              Basis,       and Characteristic Sets of polynomials.    2.   Building and
              refining PVM (MPI) based tools for       parallel/distributed SAC.    3.  
              Initial Design of a distributed system for Internet       Accessible
              Mathematical Computing (IAMC).
