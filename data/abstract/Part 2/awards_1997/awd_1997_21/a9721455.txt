Abstract    :
              9721455  Alyssa Goodman    Dr. Alyssa Goodman will carry out a project that will
              offer quantitative new measures of how the material between the stars, known as
              the interstellar medium, is distributed.  She will develop new quantitative
              methods for analyzing both numerical simulations and observed data sets, and to
              use these methods to bridge the gap in our understanding of the relationship
              between numerical simulations and the interstellar medium.  Upon completion,
              the project should provide the astronomical community with an optimized set of
              physically-motivated statistical diagnostics that best capture the properties
              of a three-dimensional map of interstellar material, either simulated or
              observed.  Such statistical diagnostics will become invaluable probes of the
              physical properties of star forming regions, supernova remnants, large galactic
              clouds, and diffuse clouds in our Galaxy.   ***
