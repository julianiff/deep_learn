Abstract    :
              ***  97321397  Turley  Brigham Young University will establish a Research 
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site Physics.  Special  efforts will be
              made to recruit students from  underrepresented groups in physics and those
              from two year  and four year colleges in our geographical region.  The 
              participating students will participate in a ten week summer  physics research
              program in computational plasma physics,  optics, microfabrication technology,
              solar power,  sonoluminescence, or advanced physical methods applied to 
              archeology.  The students will receive instruction in  experimental and
              computational techniques, participate in an  ongoing research project, and
              present oral and written  reports of their research activities.  ***
