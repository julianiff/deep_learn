Abstract    :
                   Quantum mechanics is a theory of microscopic physics  that underlies many
              of the technological advances of the  century.  Nevertheless, there continue to
              be puzzles  connected with its interface with the macroscopic world. The 
              systematic study of that interface, within statistical  mechanics, has puzzles
              of its own connected to the origins  of irreversibility.  The Investigator has
              suggested an  intertwining of these problems with a common resolution, and  has
              summarized his previous publications in a recent book,  `Time's Arrows and
              Quantum Measurement` (Cambridge Univ.  Press, 1997).  Continued research in
              this area will consist  mainly in the sharpening of experimental tests proposed
              in  the book.  An encouraging aspect of this project is that the  experimental
              techniques involved are similar to those  presently being developed for quantum
              computing and quantum  cryptography (especially some of the EPR pair work). 
              Other  research by the Investigator will concern developments in  the Feynman
              path integral, especially its application to  Lagrangian-only theories.
              Finally, collaborative work in  statistical mechanics will involve abstract
              studies on non-  equilibrium systems as well as practical applications to 
              zeolites and other problems in photochemistry.
