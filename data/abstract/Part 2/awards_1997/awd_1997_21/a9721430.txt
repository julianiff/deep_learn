Abstract    :
              The PI, whose main area of research has been analytical and computational fluid
              dynamics, has recently started working with experimental neuroscientists. 
              These neuroscientists are studying the question of orientation tuning in the
              mammalian visual cortex, a problem of long-standing neurobiological interest. 
              In this collaboration, the PI has proposed mathematical models for the problem
              and has obtained both analytical and numerical results for the models.  These
              results are then compared to the experimental results.  By
making such a
              comparison, they find what aspects of the model produce what types of behavior.
               This then suggests what types of mechanisms might be present or absent at
              various levels of the visual cortex.  The funds from this interdisciplinary
              grant will help the PI continue the present collaboration, start new
              collaborations, and broaden and deepen her background in the neurosciences. 
              The PI will spend the year at New York University's Center for Neural
              Science.
