Abstract    :
              This project enables the PI, an applied mathematician and numerical analyst, to
              spend a year in the Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) department at Penn
              State, immerse himself in the full research and educational activities of the
              MSE department, and conduct a joint research with his hosts on numerical
              simulation of materials microstructural evolution.

The microstructural
              evolution will be modeled by using a continuum field approach which results in
              a set of well-posed partial differential equations that can be rigorously
              analyzed.  Efficient and accurate numerical schemes/software for solving these
              equations will be developed, validated and applied to a number of challenging
              problems of current interest.

This project will not only expand the
              awareness and use of important mathematical advances and state-of-the-art
              numerical methods/software which have the potential to make significant impact
              on the materials science, result in improved models and numerical schemes which
              will contribute to a better understanding of the complex process of
              microstructural evolution, and provide new fundamental, practical insights
              which can provide US industry with a competitive edge, but also set up the
              stage for a lasting
collaboration in a broader scale between the Math and MSE
              departments.

This IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of 
              Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences
              (DMS).
