Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    OPP-9721347  ROMANOVSKY  UNIV. ALASKA    This project is designed to
              gather and synthesize currently available environmental data (landscape
              characteristics, meteorology, active layer and permafrost characteristics)
              along the East Siberian transect through the Sakha Republic, Russia, in a GIS
              with the same format as being planned in Alaska.  The data will be used to
              calibrate currently available numerical and analytical models at 15 to 20 sites
              and be used to investigate current active layer and permafrost conditions, to
              scale up the results, to investigate past active layer and permafrost
              conditions using the meteorological record and temperatures in permafrost
              boreholes, and to predict future (50 to 100 years) active layer and permafrost
              conditions using available climatic scenarios for the region.  Information on
              past and future variations in the active layer and permafrost is important in
              assessing past and future changes in the decomposition and storage of carbon in
              arctic soils which governs the release of trace gases to the atmosphere. 
              Thawing of permafrost will allow plants to tap more nutrients leading to
              changes in the arctic ecosystems.  The proposed study is designed to integrate
              with existing and future research projects in the program by providing data for
              use in model parameterization and validating other model predictions.
