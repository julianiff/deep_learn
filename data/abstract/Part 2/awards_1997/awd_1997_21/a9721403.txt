Abstract    :
              This project consists of a set of experiments in atoms that will provide
              information critical to atomic-physics-based tests of parity nonconservation. 
              Precise measurements of absorption and optical rotation of laser light by
              thallium atoms will be carried out to test the results of theoretical
              calculations.  A new optical rotation scheme will also be explored as a
              possible means of enhancing the accuracy of PNC measurements.  The program
              includes a strong undergraduate involvement at this undergraduate institution.
