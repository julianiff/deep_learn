Abstract    :
              This research program focuses on the experimental study of the dynamic evolution
              of prepared quantum states, the transition between the semiclassical and
              quantal regimes, and the response of a quantum system to non-classical
              excitation.  The experiments will be conducted in a cavity QED apparatus, where
              optically pumped atoms interact with a single mode of a driven high finesse
              optical cavity.  The investigations will probe dissipative quantum processes
              and will help elucidate questions of continuous quantum measurement for open
              systems.
