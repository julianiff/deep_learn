Abstract    :
              Proposal No.:  9721370  PI:    Winter  University: SD School of  Mines and
              Technology      ABSTRACT      This REU site has several goals: 1) to provide
              eight undergraduates of Chemical Engineering or allied fields, with unique and
              exciting research opportunities in the area of molecular level surface
              modification; 2) to enhance the students' critical thinking skills and
              communication skills (including written, oral, listening, and audio/visual
              presentations); 3) to increase the students' interest in graduate studies (with
              a target of 25% of the participants pursuing graduate degrees) by igniting that
              spark of interest through hands on experiences in a research laboratory working
              in their field of interest; 4) to introduce the students to the 'beyond the
              classroom' experience in a research setting; and 5) to enhance the students'
              ability to think independently.  The students will gain hands on experience
              utilizing state of the art surface characterization instrumentation and
              experimental facilities while participating in meaningful research activities. 
              Equally important, the undergraduate researchers will enjoy a close mentoring
              relationship with the faculty mentors.  Through this program students will gain
              significant research experience and develop critical thinking skills,
              communication skills, and instrumentation skills, and will also be exposed to
              professional ethics and other activities to promote life-long learning.  At
              least 50% of the students will be recruited from Tribal, four-year, and
              community colleges and universities from the four surrounding EPSCOR states,
              Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, and Wyoming where research opportunities have
              been historically lacking.  The recruitment of Native Americans is a particular
              focus of this REU Site, building upon opportunities that have been developed in
              recent years by the project's Principal Investigator.  In addition other
              underrepresented minorities, women, and disabled will be encouraged to
              participate.
