Abstract    :
              9721374  Weidner         This project establishes a summer program which will
              allow  undergraduates the opportunity to participate in the excitement of 
              working in a premier science laboratory.  The goal of the program  is to
              recruit students from the physical sciences with the hope  that they will be
              stimulated to the point of pursuing a research  career in the Earth Sciences. 
              Students in this program will work  with faculty members of the Mineral Physics
              Institute on projects  which probe the physical and chemical properties of
              materials with  a particular emphasis on the use of high pressure.  Working
              closely  with members of the MPI, students will pursue their own projects  and
              discuss their progress during weekly seminar sessions.  During  the program,
              students will visit other laboratories and  institutions affiliated with the
              Mineral Physics Institute.  ***
