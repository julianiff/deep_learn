Abstract    :
              This project will develop computational and manufacturing techniques that will
              allow molecules to be mass produced in moderate volumes by molding processes. 
              This research will develop high performance computing algorithms to determine
              the optimal part orientation and parting surface location for the easiest
              production. It will refine the parameters in the algorithms on actual molecule
              production tests.

The molding of these complex molecules, however, goes
              beyond what is typically undertaken in engineering manufacturing, because these
              molecules are highly concave.  They do not lend themselves well to standard
              injection and separation techniques.  Mold material can get into and harden in
              some very deep places, and will thus serve as a latch that keeps the outside of
              the mold from being separated.  To make this work correctly, we need to develop
              some semiautomatic algorithms and tricks.
