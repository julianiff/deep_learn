Abstract    :
              This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  
              Program and the Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry  
              (GOALI) program, addresses the molecular level mechanisms of the direct  
              synthesis of silicone precursors from silicon using copper catalysts, the  
              Muller-Rochow process.  The research combines UHV adsorption studies   carried
              out at Temple University under the direction of Professor   Strongin, with STM
              measurements of the reactant surface carried out by   Professor Hinch and
              coworkers at Rutgers University.  Scientists at Dow   Corning Corporation are
              involved in the evaluation of reaction kinetics   and selectivity of the
              catalysts designed by the group based on the   results of the molecular level
              investigations of reaction mechanism.    Understanding gained from these
              studies is applied directly in the   predictive design of catalysts for the
              Muller-Rochow process.  The   information gained from this work will have a
              direct impact on the   commercially important silicones industry.     The
              investigation of the molecular level mechanism of the direct   synthesis of
              silicone precursors on Cu/Si surfaces is the focus of this   research project. 
              A combination of basic studies of copper catalyzed    adsorption, morphological
              studies of the reacting silicon surface, and   kinetic studies of operating
              catalysts will provide information about   this technologically important
              process.  Researchers at Temple   University, Rutgers University, and the Dow
              Corning Corporation all   contribute to this research project.
