Abstract    :
              Abstract  Koranyi    Koranyi will continue his investigations of harmonic
              analysis on Riemannian symmetric spaces with an emphasis on harmonic functions
              and relations with complex analysis.  Of particular interest will be solving
              the long-standing problem of a local Fatou theorem for harmonic functions on
              symmetric spaces.  This will be approached through the theory of discrete
              buildings.  A second direction of research will be the use of quasiconformal
              maps in several complex variables.  A primary concern here is the extension of
              quasiconformal maps of the boundary of a strictly pseudoconvex domain to the
              interior as symplectic quasiconformal maps with respect to the Bergman metric. 
                The analysis involved in this research rests on the theory of Lie groups,
              named in honor of the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, which has beenone of
              the major themes in twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle
              for exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the representation theory
              of Lie groups has had a profound impact upon mathematics itself, particularly
              in analysis and number theory, and upon theoretical physics especially quantum
              mechanics and elementary particle physics.
