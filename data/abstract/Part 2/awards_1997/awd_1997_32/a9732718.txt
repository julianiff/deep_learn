Abstract    :
              Donald Marshall    This proposal requests support for a conference that will be
              held at the University of Washington-Seattle from March 27-29, 1998. The
              objective of the conference is to give needed exposure to a number of important
              topics in the theory of Several Complex Variables that have been relatively
              overlooked on the programs of recent national and international meetings in
              that field. Specifically, the conference targets the large research area
              associated with the analysis and geometry of Cauchy-Riemann manifolds and also
              seeks to focus attention upon emerging connections of SCV to such subjects as
              symplectic geometry, PDE and global analysis.
