Abstract    :
              9732706  Walden    This award to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in 
              Massachusetts will provide instrumentation for oceanographic  research for use
              on R/V Atlantis, R/V Knorr and R/V Oceanus,  the three research vessels
              operated by Woods Hole  Oceanographic Institution as part of the
              University-National  Oceanographic laboratory System research fleet. Specific 
              instruments to acquired include a CTD (conductivity-  temperature-depth) system
              plus a suite of sensors for use  with it (altimeters, transmissometer, spare
              temperature and  conductivity sensors, PAR sensors and personal computer for 
              data acquisition), a laptop computer plus  CD-ROM burners  for data transfer
              for scientists, tube holders for a multi-  corer sampling system, a non-metal
              metering block for  uncontaminated water sampling, a portable van for use on 
              board ship as a cold laboratory, and three pumps for  sampling uncontaminated
              seawater. The shared-use  instrumentation supported here will assist marine
              scientists  conduct studies from the WHOI vessels throughout the world  ocean
              in 1998 and in future years.
