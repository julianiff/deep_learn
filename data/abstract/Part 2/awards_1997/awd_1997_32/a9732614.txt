Multi-electron processes in slow, highly charged, ion-atom
              collisions using time of flight, triple-coincidence measurements of Auger
              electrons, scattered particles and target recoil ions are investigated.  In
              addition, Q-values and angular distributions will be measured using recoil ion
              momentum spectroscopy.
