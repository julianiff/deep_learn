Abstract    :
              This research concerns the development and analysis of numerical  algorithms for
              the solution of eigenvalue and singular value  problems, with applications to
              least squares and total least  squares problems.    Much of the work grows out
              of perturbation theory for generalized  singular value problems. This theory is
              also applicable to  certain generalized eigenvalue problems. The theory will
              thus be  applied to algorithm development for various singular value and  least
              squares problems.    Specific problems to be addressed are    1. Development
              and analysis of methods for computing the sparse  generalized singular value
              decomposition.    2. A more accurate procedure for computing a bidiagonal
              reduction  of a matrix. This is the first step in the most efficient stable 
              methods for computing the singular value decomposition.    3. An algorithm for
              the eigenvectors of symmetric arrow matrices  that requires less communication
              on distributed architectures.    4. An algorithm for the solution of recursive
              total least squares  problems using rank--revealing decompositions.
