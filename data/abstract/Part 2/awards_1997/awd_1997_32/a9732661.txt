Abstract    :
              9732661  Wagner    The University of North Dakota will establish a Research 
              Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in its Physics  department.
              Undergraduate students will be recruited from the  northwestern-plain states,
              with a recruitment focus on tribal  colleges and Native American students. The
              students will be  involved in physics research with emphasis in materials
              physics  and condensed matter physics.  %%%  The REU site, with a regional
              focus whereby high quality  undergraduates will be recruited from the
              northwestern-plain  states, and with an emphasis on Native American students,
              has  potential impact on underrepresented sectors of the undergraduate  student
              population in physics.  ***
