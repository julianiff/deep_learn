Abstract    :
              Vladimir Krasnopolsky  Catholic University    Study of X-Ray and Extreme
              Ultraviolet Emissions in Comets.    Dr. Vladimir Krasnopolsky will carry out a
              mixture of observational and modeling investigations to determine the relative
              importance of various X-ray and extreme ultraviolet emission production
              mechanisms in comets.  The recent discovery of X-ray production by comets is a
              poorly understood phenomenon.  In particular, Dr. Krasnopolsky will concentrate
              on the spectrum of soft cometary X-rays, which is the subject of some
              controversy.  The line spectrum predicted by several authors seems to be
              confirmed by some observations, while other observations do not support this
              idea.
