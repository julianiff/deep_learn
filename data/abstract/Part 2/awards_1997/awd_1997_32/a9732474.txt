The Keck Geology Consortium combines the resource of twelve
              predominately undergraduate colleges and universities to offer high quality
              projects that engage students and faculty in collaborative research.  This
              program will allow six students and two faculty members, who do not currently
              have access to the Keck Consortium research program, to participate in any of
              six projects, any associated workshops, and to present their results at the
              annual Keck Research Symposium in Geology.  Each student will have a sponsor at
              their home institution who will supervise research during the academic year. 
              These sponsors may visit the summer research sight and participate in the
              research symposium.  Students and faculty will be recruited nationally from all
              types of institutions, particularly those that do not have established
              undergraduate research programs.  This program will provide research
              opportunities for students in a highly successful program and a faculty
              enrichment experience that combines research and education.  Both students and
              faculty will benefit from becoming part of a community that supports
              undergraduate research.
