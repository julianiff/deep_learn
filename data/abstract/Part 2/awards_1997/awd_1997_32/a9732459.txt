This experiment completes an exact realization of Bohm's version
              of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen thought experiment.  Correlations will be
              measured between nuclear spin components of the nuclei of two Hg-199 atoms
              created by the photodissociation of a mercury dimer with total nuclear spin
              zero.  A novel circular polarized laser excitation-ionization technique, using
              a detector with near unit efficiency, will be used to observe the two atoms.
