Abstract    :
              9732519    This REU Site will provide an exciting and engaging  introduction to
              research for 10 undergraduates each summer.  These experiences will take place
              at the University of  Colorado's Mountain Research Station and will focus on
              the  behavior, ecology, and evolution of subalpine and alpine  organisms.  The
              program, which has been shaped through  experiences gained in previous REU Site
              grants, has three  components.  The first is a week-long intensive introduction
               to research, built around a series of field problems that  are conducted with
              increasing levels of independence.  The  second is a summer-long course that
              deals with the  practicalities of research and of going to graduate school. 
              This course operates in parallel with 9-week student  projects done in
              association with faculty mentors.  The  summer culminates in project
              presentations that are given in  a scientific-meeting format.  Evaluations of
              prior REU  grants show that this program has been successful in  encouraging
              students to go to graduate school and in  generating a summer experience that
              has a profound effect on  the development of the participants' scientific
              careers.
