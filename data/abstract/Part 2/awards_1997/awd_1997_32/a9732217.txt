Abstract    :
                  9732217  Findley    This award to University of Miami in the state of
              Florida  will provide instrumentation for oceanographic research on  R/V
              Johnson, R/V Link, R/V Sea Diver (all operated by Harbor  Branch Oceanographic
              Institute) and R/V Calanus (operated by  University of Miami), the four
              research vessels for which  Rosentiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences
              provides  technical support as part of the University-National  Oceanographic
              Laboratory System research fleet.  Specific  instruments to be acquired include
              a scintillation counter,  shipboard computers and peripherals, environmental
              sensor  interfaces, CTD systems for measuring salinity and  temperature in
              coastal waters, a  salinometer, an upgrade to  the existing subbottom sounder,
              an upgrade to the existing  containerized shipboard hydrographic lab, a 
              thermosalinograph and radiation sensors. The shared-use  instrumentation
              supported here will assist marine scientists  conduct studies from the RSMAS
              and HBOI vessels, primarily  in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, in 1998
              and in  future years.
