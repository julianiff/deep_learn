This work is a continuation of investigations of quantum
              degenerate trapped gases of lithium-7 atoms.  It expands upon the previous
              observation of the PI that condensation is possible in this
              negative-scattering-length system, although with a limited number of atoms in
              the condensate.  It focus on a series of experiments to explore the mechanisms
              by which this limit is enforced and to examine the dynamical behavior of the
              system.  A second effort will focus on looking for a possible BCS-type
              transition in a cooled sample of lithium-6 atoms.
