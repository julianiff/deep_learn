Abstract    :
              This program focuses on low temperature pressure broadening studies of three
              molecules of astrophysical interest, ammonia, formaldehyde, and methanol.  
              Both helium and molecular hydrogen will be used as broadening agents, and
              comparison will be made between the experimental results and those of
              theoretical calculations also performed in the context of this project. 
              Emphasis will be placed on confirming the accuracy of the potential curves for
              use in interpreting data from interstellar clouds.
