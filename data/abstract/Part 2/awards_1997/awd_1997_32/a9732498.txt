This project uses laser light forces to directly focus gallium and
              indium atoms.  It is proposed to demonstrate that light forces can modulate the
              atomic density and provide a controlled growth of quantum wire and quantum dot
              structures in molecular beam epitaxy.  The work will have significant impact on
              the field of optoelectronics and on the physics of heterostructures.
