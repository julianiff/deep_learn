Abstract    :
              This project studies approximation algorithms for NP-Hard  optimization
              problems.  Many of these are important, real-world  problems.  Because for
              these problems there probably are no  efficient, exact algorithms, the project
              studies approximation  algorithms.  These algorithms are guaranteed to be fast
              and to  return a near-optimal answer.  Either this near-optimal solution  can
              be used directly, or it can be used as a starting point for a  heuristic which
              attempts to improve the solution.  Among the  problems studied are MAX SAT, the
              problem of satisfying as many  disjunctions as possible in a given set of
              disjunctions of  Boolean literals, variants of MULTICUT, which involve finding,
              in  a graph, a smallest set of edges whose removal disconnects given  vertices;
              and STEINER TREE, the problem, given a graph, of  finding a cheap subgraph
              which connects a given set of terminals.
