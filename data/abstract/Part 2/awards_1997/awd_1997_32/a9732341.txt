Abstract    :
              9732341  Gramila    Penn State University will establish a Research Experience
              for  Undergraduates (REU) site in its Physics department.  Undergraduate
              students will be recruited from the mid-atlantic  states, with a recruitment
              focus on Historically Black Colleges  and Universities (HBCUs). The students
              will be involved in a wide  range of physics research with emphasis in
              materials physics and  condensed matter physics. In addition, REU participants
              will be  offered a machine shop course and a computer simulation and data 
              acquisition course.  %%%  The REU site, with a regional focus whereby high
              quality  undergraduates will be recruited from the mid-atlantic states,  and
              with an emphasis on minority institutions, has potential  impact on
              underrepresented sectors of the undergraduate student  population in physics.
