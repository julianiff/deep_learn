Abstract    :
              9732098  Vanderah    The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST.)
              will  establish a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in  its
              Materials Science and Engineering Laboratory.  Students will  be recruited from
              across the country, a special target will be  members of underrepresented
              groups in science and engineering.  Students will participate in a wide range
              of research in the  areas of ceramics, solid state chemistry, metallurgy,
              polymers,  neutron condensed matter science, and materials reliability.  In 
              addition, students will attend a weekly seminar by scientists and  by previous
              REU participants, and a number of social activities.  %%%  The REU students
              will have access to exceptional instrumentation  and facilities at NIST.  The
              experience also includes an early  and valuable exposure to the
              interdisciplinary research  environment of a national laboratory.  ***
