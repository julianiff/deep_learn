This is a project to develop methods for quantum state control
              and to study macroscopic quantum coherence in neutral atoms trapped in a
              far-detuned optical lattice.  The primary goals of the project are to:  (1)
              develop tools for coherent control and quantum state preparation in optical
              potential wells; (2) explore the possibility of preparing few-atom quantum
              states in large optical potential wells; (3) study quantum tunneling in
              double-well optical potentials; and (4) study decoherence in quantum tunneling
              in double-well optical potentials..
