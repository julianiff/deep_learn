Abstract    :
              Proposal No.: 9732322  PI:  Kennedy  University: Clemson U        ABSTRACT   
              The proposed Research Experiences for Undergraduates site in the Department of
              Mechanical Engineering at Clemson University will involve students from Clemson
              and other institutions in a ten-week program of research, seminars, and
              workshops.  The REU site will compliment the department's Senior Departmental
              Honors Program, which requires seniors to complete a research project and write
              a senior thesis.  All of the activities will focus on the various aspects of
              research: problem formulation, experimentation, analysis, publication and
              presentation.  The participants will be challenged intellectually and will
              learn to work independently.  The one-on-one contact with faculty and
              interaction with graduate students will also introduce these students to the
              opportunities in graduate education and the career options in research and
              academia.    The research projects will span the areas of thermal and fluid
              science, mechanical and manufacturing systems, engineering mechanics, and
              materials.  Students will work intensively on a prearranged research project
              which matches their interests with that of a departmental faculty member.  In
              addition, they will attend lectures on research ethics, graduate education,
              teaching as a profession, and professionalism.  Workshops will be conducted on
              written and oral presentation.  The program will culminate in the preparation
              of a written report, by each student, of their work and a poster session in
              which they will describe their work to interested parties from the university
              and regional engineering community.
