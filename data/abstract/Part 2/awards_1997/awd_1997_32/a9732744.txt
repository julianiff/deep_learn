Abstract    :
                This  project is applying  ideas developed in recent research into action
              languages, on the logic of causal explanation, and on satisfiability planning
              to the formalization and automation of reasoning tasks in a ide  range of
              action domains.  The new formalizations must take into account the possibility
              of complex interactions between cuncurrent actions, the role of the exact
              duration of an action, the role of knowledge as a prerequisite for executing an
              action, and the possibility of creating and destroying objects in the process
              of executing actions.  Some of the action domains being investigated include
              realistic representations of the physical space in which agents move around and
              are significantly larger than the typical "toy worlds" that research on actions
              has concentrated on in the past.  The result will be another step toward
              achieving the goals of a theory of commonsense knowledge and reasoning - the
              reasoning processes used by humans in everyday life, rather than just the
              reasoning used in mathematical theorems.    http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/vl/
