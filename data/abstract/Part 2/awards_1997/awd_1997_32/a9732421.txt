              Proposal No.: 9732421  PI:  Ataai  University: U of Pittsburgh        ABSTRACT  
               As the result of NSF support of our REU site in the last four years, we have
              built and sustained a high-quality program that has attracted many capable and
              highly motivated students from primarily undergraduate colleges as well as
              research universities, into an active research environment.  Most of the REU
              interns of our program, who have completed their undergraduate degree, have
              entered various graduate programs (88% of African Americans, and 79% of
              students from the primarily undergraduate institutions).  We are requesting 3
              years of support to continue our NSF-Supported REU site (15 summer interns) in
              the Department of Chemical and Petroleum Engineering at the University of
              Pittsburgh.  Our goal is to introduce undergraduates from engineering and the
              sciences, especially undergraduates majoring in chemical engineering,
              chemistry, and biology at small colleges and universities to research
              activities.  Our educational philosophy upon which our program is based
              includes hands-on laboratory experimentation with advice and guidance supplied
              by a faculty mentor, and enriched by seminars and visits to industrial
              laboratories, as well as extracurricular social interactions.  We plan to
              continue recruiting from a great number of colleges and universities in and
              around the Western Pennsylvania region, Historically Black Colleges and
              Universities (HBCUs), and to enroll a large number of students from the
              primarily undergraduate institutions (at least 50%) and the balance from
              research universities.
