Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for an REU Site in Physical Anthropology hosted by the
              University of North Carolina at Greensboro.  Undergraduate students will
              develop original research projects in human osteology as a vehicle for
              fostering their growth as researchers, scientists and leaders.  Each year for
              three years, 10 students will participate in all phases of the analysis and
              documentation of over 440 human skeletons from the Late Archaic period Barrett
              site.  The students' research projects will be aimed at (1) developing new
              applications of scientific visualization toward the inventory, analysis and
              recordation of human skeletal material, and (2) contributing to our
              understanding of biocultural adaptation of these Late Archaic hunters and
              gatherers.  Activities will include work in the laboratory, two courses each
              semester, professional and career development, and excursions to museums and
              archaeological sites.  This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing
              efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active
              undergraduate research experiences.
