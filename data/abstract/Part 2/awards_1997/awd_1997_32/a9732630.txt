Abstract    :
              9732630  Boothby    This grant provides partial support for the PI to visit
              India to meet with Dr. Abhijit Mukherjee, of the Department of Chemical
              Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology in Bombay, for the purpose of
              finalizing plans for a cooperative research project on the use of Fiber
              Reinforced Polymer (FRP) materials for the repair of deteriorated concrete and
              masonry structures and historic buildings.  FRP materials were originally
              developed for the aerospace industry, and they are now starting to be
              considered for the repair of many deteriorating concrete and masonry structures
              throughout the world. but little information exists on their behavior or
              durability when used in such repair work.      Boothby and Mukherjee will visit
              several sites to inspect damaged structures and discuss with other
              professionals the extent of the repairs to be made in order to determine which
              structures to include in their cooperative research project.
