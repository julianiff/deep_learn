Abstract    :
                  ABSTRACT    OPP-9732747      JACOBSON, RANDALL  OFFICE OF NAVAL RESEARCH    
                  Through this award the Office of Naval Research provides building space at
              Thule Air Base that is used by the National Science Foundation to store Arctic
              field equipment and to stage field programs that require heavy airlift services
              of the New York Air National Guard to the ice cap.  Field work in northern
              Greenland and on the Arctic Ocean ice pack is better facilitated by access to
              Thule Air Base because its northern location shortens the distance over which
              logistics operations must be conducted.  In addition to use of the building
              space for logistics staging, the building is also used to house a large
              equipment pool of Arctic field gear that should be stored and maintained as
              closely as possible to potential research sites in order to provide ready
              access in case of emergency requirements.
