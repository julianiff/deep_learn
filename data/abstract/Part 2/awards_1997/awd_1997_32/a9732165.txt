Abstract    :
              9731265  Smith    Anchorage Museum of History and Art will used this planning
              award to develop the script, identify artifacts, and do other preliminary
              planning activities for and exhibit "Lifting the Fog: Exploration of the North
              Pacific, 1728 - 1867."  The exhibit will be a 5000 to 6000 sq. ft. presentation
              that will give visitors insights into the scientific discoveries made in the
              North Pacific during the Russian era of dominance of this area.  These Russian
              lead voyages, which included individuals from a number of European countries,
              made major findings in biology, hydrography, marine science and technology,
              geography and cartography, and ethnography.  With this planning grant, they
              will bring together a group of museum professionals representing a diversity of
              approaches including hands-on science museums, scientists, and historian of
              science, formal educators, native Alaskans, and an evaluator to refine the
              plans.  Project staff will draft the concept design, draft the label text,
              develop the specifications for the exhibit design, and develop the catalogue,
              among other activities.  At the end of the twelve month planing period they
              will have refined their exhibit theme, developed their floor plan and concept
              design, developed plans for the interactive and hands-on activities, developed
              the interpretative labels and laid plans for the complementary activities
              including the catalogue, a curriculum plan, and other adjunct activities such
              as workshops demonstrating how scientific investigation was carried out in the
              19th century.
