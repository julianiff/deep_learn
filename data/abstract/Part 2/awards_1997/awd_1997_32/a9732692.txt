Abstract    :
              The models used in inductive inference have their roots in the  models used by
              the philosophers of science who were discussing the  scientific method. The
              goal there, and in prior work in learning  theory, was to come up with an
              explanation of the phenomenon under  consideration. However, scientists rarely
              work directly for the  grand goal of a complete explanation, seeking rather the
              more  modest goal of finding features and facts about the observed data.  In
              like manner, this project pursues several modifications to the  traditional
              models used in inductive inference so as to study the  pursuit of more modest
              scientific goals.  This study is  particularly relevant to contemporary science
              as automated data  generation techniques produce sufficient volumes of data to 
              overwhelm the analysis abilities of humans. The goal of our work  is to
              illuminate precisely what can and cannot be accomplished by  automatic data
              analysis algorithms.
