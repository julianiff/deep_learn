Abstract    :
              9732138  The Savannah River Ecology Laboratory's (SREL) goal for its  Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates program is to  provide research experience,
              training, and career  perspective for undergraduate students through the use of
               SREL's unique field sites and laboratory facilities, and  through the
              association and active involvement in research  with full-time research
              ecologists.  Project participants  examine the influence of by-products from
              nuclear and fossil-  fuel energy production on selected biological and chemical
               properties in southeastern ecosystems.  SREL faculty  members, all actively
              engaged in research and publication,  are paired with students having
              compatible research  interests.  Student projects, while distinct and 
              independent, are portions of ongoing research programs of  SREL.  The student
              experience is enhanced by interaction  with a programmatic team comprising
              individuals with a  diversity of ecological backgrounds, interest, and ideas. 
              Applicants from minority schools and regional institutions  with limited
              research programs are actively sought and  encouraged, as in previous years.
              Participant selection is  based upon the quality of an application, letters of 
              recommendation, and academic record.  Through the research  training of more
              than 500 undergraduate participants over  the past 29 years, SREL has created a
              highly successful  program of student/advisor interaction.  Scientific 
              publication and career development of former participants  attest to the
              success of the program.
