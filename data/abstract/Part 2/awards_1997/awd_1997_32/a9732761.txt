Abstract    :
              9732761  Heyliger  An experimental device is acquired to detect resonant modes 
              of unrestrained free vibration of solid objects with  anisotropic properties
              using impulse excitation.Such modes  are difficult to detect using more
              traditional acoustic  spectroscopy techniques, particulary for specific
              geometries  of the solid. Combining the measurements with numerical 
              calculations and an inverse scheme, a powerful method is  developed to
              determine material properties of materials with  unknown constitution. The
              apparatus is also used for  nondestructive evaluation of transportation
              structures and  classroom demonstration of  principles in dynamics and 
              vibration.  ***
