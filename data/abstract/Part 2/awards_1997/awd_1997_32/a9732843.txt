Abstract    :
              The proposed research involves the synthesis of novel `orthogonal` solid   phase
              supports. These will be used for the preparation of protected  
              oligonucleotides, and oligonucleotide conjugates with functional groups   or
              peptides attached at defined positions.  Related oligoribonucleotides   will
              also be prepared.  The research  will extend the types of reactions   that can
              be used to cleave the oligonucleotides from the solid support to   include
              reductive and enzymatic reactions, and extend the scope of   chemistry
              available for conjugating protected oligonucleotides.  With this renewal award,
              the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program   supports the research of Dr.
              Marc M. Greenberg of the Department of   Chemistry at Colorado State
              University.  The research focuses on   developing solid phase supports from
              which protected fragments of DNA and   RNA can be cleaved under mild
              conditions, and on expanding the repertoire   of reactions available for
              extending the number of nucleotides linked  to   form the oligomers.  The work
              will provide useful approaches to others   attempting to synthesize
              oligonucleotides, and will have practical   biomedical applications.  Graduate
              students and post-doctoral fellows   will receive training in the synthesis of
              small molecules and   biopolymers, and get the kind of training needed in the
              growing   biotechnology area.
