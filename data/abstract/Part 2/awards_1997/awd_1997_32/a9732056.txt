Abstract    :
              9732056  Leslie-Pelecky    The University of Nebraska will continue a Research
              Experience  for Undergraduates (REU) site on the interdisciplinary theme of 
              nanostructured materials.  It proposes to target underrepresented  groups in
              the sciences and engineering, with the Midwest as the  base of recruiting.
              Students will participate in research  projects on the synthesis and optical,
              electronic, structural and  magnetic properties of nanostructured materials. 
              In addition,  REU participants will be offered several workshops on 
              experimental techniques and will attend weekly seminars.  %%%  The REU site,
              with a regional focus whereby high quality  undergraduates will be recruited
              from the Midwest, will provide  an interdisciplinary research experience to
              students who would  not normally have access to a research environment.  ***
