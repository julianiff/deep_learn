Abstract    :
              9732595  Johnson         The goal of the 1998 REU project at Gustavus Adolphus
              college  is to nurture the development of underrepresented individuals in  the
              geological sciences.  Eight undergraduate women will conduct  field and
              laboratory research to determine the character, origin,  and history of
              Pleistocene deposits in south-central Minnesota.   Four of the women will be
              selected from Gustavus students; the  other four from outside the institution. 
                     The individual research projects are concerned with till  stratigraphy
              of south-central Minnesota, genesis of late-Wisconsin  till (possible
              deforming-bed till) and its underlying boulder  pavement, geomorphology and
              origin of surface features of the Des  Moines Lobe, and character and
              sedimentology of tributary outwash  streams compared to deposits of River
              Warren (outlet to Lake  Agassiz).  These projects will require the participants
              to learn  and apply various geologic research techniques including outcrop 
              description, laboratory analysis, map analysis, and statistical  analysis on
              the computer.  ***
