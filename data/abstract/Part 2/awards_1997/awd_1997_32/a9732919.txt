Abstract    :
              Bill Reinhardt is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational
              Chemistry Program to study many-body processes in chemical   physics.  The
              major portion of this effort is aimed at condensed-phase   simulations, with
              emphasis on sampling improvement and the controlled   calculation of entropy
              and free-energy differences. As the methodology is   developed, it will be
              embedded into widespread simulation packages.  A   secondary effort concerns
              large amplitude dynamics in Bose-Einstein   condensates.  This work will
              involve semiclassical modeling of dark   solitons in multiple dimensions for
              both attractive and repulsive   condensates, employing the nonlinear
              Schrodinger equation.  Knowledge of free energies and free energy differences
              are of central   importance in chemistry and biophysical chemistry, yet
              progress toward   their efficient computation has been slow.  Algorithmic
              developments that   allow for rapid free energy computations will have a major
              impact on   theoretical simulations of protein folding and enzyme-substrate
              binding.    The recent experimental realization of Bose condensation opens a
              new   window into the behavior of macroscopic quantum systems, which in turn  
              inspires new efforts into theoretical underpinnings of this phenomenon.
