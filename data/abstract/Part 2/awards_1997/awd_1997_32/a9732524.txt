Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award provides continued support for a Research  
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in the Chemistry Department,  
              University of Wyoming, directed by Dr. Robert C. Corcoran.  Ten students   will
              participate each year over the next three years in a ten-week summer   program.
               The students will be selected from non-Ph. D. granting colleges   and
              universities in the West with emphasis on recruiting Native American  
              students.  Participants will be able to choose from a variety of research  
              topics across the fields of modern chemistry.  Research-oriented   instruction
              will include training in topics such as safety, library   search methods,
              report preparation, and techniques for effective public   presentation of
              research results.  Other aspects of the program include   career-oriented
              instruction and a field trip to a chemical company.    Students will be
              required to report research results in both written   reports and an oral
              presentation at an Undergraduate Research Symposium   to which a mentor from
              each student's parent institution will be invited
