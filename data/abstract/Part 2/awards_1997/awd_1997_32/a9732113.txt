Abstract    :
              A datacube is a multidimensional structure that contains at each point an
              aggregate value, i.e., the result of applying an aggregate function to an
              dataset of records. The purpose of this project is to develop, implement and
              experimentally evaluate techniques to reduce the storage needs in a
              multidimensional cube by substituting some of the data by more succinct models
              that characterize it. By doing this, errors are introduced when the data is
              reconstructed. The tradeoffs between space savings and reconstruction errors
              are studied, along with tradeoffs between response time to queries and
              reconstruction errors. Understanding these tradeoffs makes it possible to
              efficiently design and implement multiresolution systems where query answers
              can be incrementally refined as the user looks at them. Finally, the models are
              a good starting point to mine the cube data since they show valuable patterns
              and associations among the different dimensions. The results of this project
              will provide valuable techniques and software to efficiently store and analyze
              large multidimensional data sets, such as those that are common in health,
              financial and scientific applications.
