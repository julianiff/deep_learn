Abstract    :
              This work continues recent advances in atomic physics experiments designed to
              find and measure violations of parity and time-reversal symmetries.  A new
              laser source and other improvements to the measurement of the electron dipole
              moment in mercury should make an exacting test of low energy supersymmetry and
              other models in which T-violation should occur naturally.  An improvement of
              the measurement of parity violation in thallium, as observed through optical
              rotation, from a 1% to a 0.3% accuracy is sought.  Finally, the first steps in
              a PNC measurement in the barium plus ion are being undertaken, with the
              long-term goal being a decisive atomic test of electroweak physics
              complementary to the best high energy accelerator tests.
