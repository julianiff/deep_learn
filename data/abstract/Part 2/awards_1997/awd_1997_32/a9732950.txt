Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of methods for the assembly   of
              porphyrin building blocks into multi-component arrays and materials.   
              Discrete, ordered arrays of five to ten porphyrins will be self-assembled   and
              characterized using coordination of exocyclic ligands on the   macrocycle to
              metal centers with appropriate coordination geometry,   complimentary hydrogen
              bond molecular recognition groups and a hybrid   metal ion and hydrogen bond
              mediated approach.  One- two- and   three-dimensional porphyrin films, polymers
              and crystals will be prepared   and new methods developed for the
              characterization of these materials.    Also, new photonic materials will be
              prepared via self-assembly.  The   focus of the educational activities will be
              the development of a course   in supramolecular chemistry and efforts geared to
              high school science   outreach.  With this Faculty Early Development (CAREER)
              award, the   Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the
              research   and educational activities of Dr. Charles M. Drain of the Department
              of   Chemistry at CUNY Hunter College.   Professor Drain will focus his  
              research efforts on the synthesis and characterization of new materials.   
              Arrays of five to ten porphyrins will be self-assembled to evaluate the  
              possible formation of these materials, the mechanism of electron and   energy
              transfer via non-covalent interactions and the process of   self-assembly.  The
              overall hypothesis to be evaluated is that highly   ordered photo-active films,
              polymers and crystals may be systematically   engineered by programming the
              correct bonding code into self-assembling   monomers.  The educational
              activities in the project include course   development  and out reach to high
              school students.
