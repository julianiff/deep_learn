Abstract    :
              This project involves the development of interactive visualization and data
              management techniques for the exploration of very large multivariate data sets.
              The approach consists of extending several multivariate data visualization
              techniques currently implemented in an existing visualization tool (XmdvTool,
              developed at WPI) to support hierarchical views of the data, with support for
              focusing and drill-down using N-dimensional brushes. The stages of the project
              are as follows: (1) identify, design, and implement algorithms for hierarchical
              partitioning and/or clustering large multivariate data sets; (2) design and
              implement extended versions of existing multivariate visualization techniques
              to convey statistical summarizations of selected subtrees; (3) design and
              implement strategies for managing and querying large, hierarchical, dynamic
              data sets and efficiently computing summarizations of subtrees of the
              hierarchy; (4) design and implement interactive tools to allow focus,
              drill-down, consolidation, and other exploratory operations through direct and
              indirect manipulation; (5) evaluate and refine the visualization, data
              management, and interactive exploration tools using both real and synthetic
              data sets; and (6) assess system performance in terms of functionality,
              usability, and limitations on data which can be effectively explored. This
              project will result in the development of techniques for the qualitative mining
              of multivariate data sets one or two orders of magnitude larger than possible
              with existing visual exploration tools, providing application domains such as
              global change studies, space science, and decision support systems the
              technology to uncover trends, patterns, and anomalies within their data sets.
