              Polytechnic Institute    This grant is awarded through the Separations and
              Purification Program sub-element of the Interfacial, Transport and Separations
              Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division. The principal
              investigator is Dr. Yi Hua Ma at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. The
              conference is the Fifth International Conference on Inorganic Membranes,
              Nagoya, Japan, June 22-26, 1998. A This is a topical area fully relevant to the
              Interfacial, Transport and Separation Processes Program. The objective of the  
              conference is to bring together international researchers and  industrial
              practitioners to present and   discuss their results on inorganic membranes,
              which is a   relatively new technology for high temperature separations. The
              conference will provide and for the U.S. participants to gain an understanding
              of the inorganic membrane activities relating to separations technology in the
              Pacific Rim. ~        The conference will cover both theoretical and
              experimental aspects of inorganic membranes with topics encompassing membrane
              preparation, membrane transport phenomena, characterization, membrane reactors
              and process systems. The conference will include plenary  lectures, and oral
              and poster   presentations.      ~ '          it
