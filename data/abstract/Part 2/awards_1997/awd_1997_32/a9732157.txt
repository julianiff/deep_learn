Abstract    :
              ***  9732157  Heller  Undergraduate students studying physics will participate
              in  a 10 week summer research experience in the School of  Physics and
              Astronomy of the University of Minnesota.  Applications will be solicited
              through colleges and  universities throughout the country, with special
              attention  given to schools with large minority enrollment.  The  program
              coordinators will work with each participant to  select an appropriate research
              mentor and research project,  and will monitor the participants' progress
              throughout the  program period.  Participants will live together in a campus 
              dormitory.  They will take part in seminars about  opportunities in the field
              and in round-table discussions of  their research.  Several social activities
              will be  organized, giving the participants an opportunity to get to  know one
              another better, and to meet others from the other  undergraduate summer
              research programs at the University of  Minnesota.  ***
