Abstract    :
              9732555  Ibeh    Pittsburg State University will establish a Research Experience
               for Undergraduates (REU) Site in interdisciplinary materials  research. The
              site includes faculty form the departments of  Engineering Technology,
              Chemistry, Physics, Biology and the  Business and Technology Institute.  The
              site has an undergraduate  student recruitment focus on community colleges of
              the "Four  State Region" (SE Kansas, SW Missouri, NW Arkansas and NE 
              Oklahoma). Students will be involved in materials research with  technological
              applications that includes polyolefin binders for  fuel cells, non-linear
              optical polyurethanes, textured metal  electrodes for ultracapacitors, strain
              gage technology for  battery charge determination, thermoplastics and foams. 
              %%%  The REU site will provide students at community colleges in the  region an
              opportunity to participate in an interdisciplinary  research experience.  ***
