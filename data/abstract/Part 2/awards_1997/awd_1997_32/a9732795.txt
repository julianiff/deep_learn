     This grant provides funding for the analysis of large
              scale logistics systems. In such systems, finished products, which are
              assembled from a set of components, may be produced and stored in various
              locations prior to their distribution to retail outlets. Thus, the logistics
              system includes suppliers, manufacturers, warehouses and retail outlets as well
              as raw materials, work-in-process inventory and finished products that flow
              between the facilities. The objective is to coordinate production, routing and
              timing of shipment so as to minimize system-wide cost, including manufacturing,
              inventory  and transportation, while satisfying all demands.  The focus in this
              research is on logistics systems that employ two types of transportation modes;
              a private fleet, or Less Than Truck Load carriers. In both cases, the goal of
              the research  is to understand the underlying theoretical structure  of optimal
              solutions and utilize it in the development of practical and efficient
              algorithms.
     If successful, the results of this research will lead to the
              development of new algorithms that are effective,
independent of the specific
              environment and the variability of the data. That is, these algorithms are
              robust; they are designed to handle a general setting rather than a set of
              library problems.  These algorithms make it possible to implement optimization
              based decision support systems that take into account the interaction between
              the various levels of the logistics network, and utilize the wealth of
              available information in the supply chain.
