Abstract    :
              9732685  Dash      Description:  This award supports the US-India  Cooperative 
              Research: The Effects of Realistic  Eurasian Snow Cover on the Indian Summer 
              Monsoon-- A Numerical Experiment with a  Regional Model.  The collaborators are
              US PI  Anandu D. Vernekar, Department of Meteorology,  University of Maryland
              and Indian PI S.K. Dash,  Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, Indian  Institute of
              Technology, New Delhi.  This  research examines the effect of the Eurasian 
              snow cover on the interannual variability of  the Indian monsoon.  The
              hypothesis that  excessive winter Eurasian snow cover has  adverse effect on
              the subsequent summer monsoon  rainfall over India will be studied through 
              numerical experiments on a high resolution  regional model linked to a global
              general  circulation model.  The results will have  important predictive value
              about the onset and  strength of the Indian monsoon.   Scope:  This is a new
              collaboration linking the  Department of Meteorology, University of  Maryland
              and the Center for Atmospheric  Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology, 
              Delhi.  This project combines the pioneering  expertise of Vernekar's group at
              Maryland in  numerical experiments with general and regional  models with the
              capability of the Delhi group  in modeling atmospheric and ocean processes.  
              The National Center for Atmospheric Research  (NCAR) will provided Cray
              supercomputer  facilities to support this research.    ***
