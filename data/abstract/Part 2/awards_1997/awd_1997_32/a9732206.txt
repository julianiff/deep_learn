Abstract    :
              This project investigates the synthesis of effective algebraic  and numerical
              algorithms and on their practical and theoretical  improvement.  This includes
              the comprehensive study of practical  numerical algorithms for polynomial
              rootfinding, which is a  central subject of algebraic computing.  The study
              should include  many technical novelties.  Another fundamental subject covered
              by  the project and having ubiquitous applications to many areas of  scientific
              and engineering computing and signal processing is the  computations with
              structured matrices.  The project also includes  various extensions and
              applications of polynomial rootfinding and  structured matrices, in particular
              to approximating polynomial  gcd, to polynomial interpolation and multipoint
              evaluation, and  to solving polynomial systems of equations.  The work also 
              applies to sign determination and modular reduction, which is a  central
              subject of algebraic and  geometric computations, and on decoding the BCH
              error-correcting  codes, in particular Reed-Solomon codes most important in 
              practice.
