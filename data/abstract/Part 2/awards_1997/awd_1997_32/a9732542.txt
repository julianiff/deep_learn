	Satellite records of total ozone indicate a systematic
              decline at midlatitudes after 1980.  A clue to the origin of these changes
              comes from their strong seasonal and geographical dependence which mirror the
              seasonality and structure of total ozone itself.  Numerical models
              underestimate the observed trend in midlatitude total ozone, with models
              predicting only half of the observed decrease.  Dr. Salby and his colleagues
              believe the discrepancy may stem from sources of interannual variability not
              currently accounted for in model simulations.

	Accordingly, Dr. Salby and
              colleagues will explore interannual variations of ozone in relation to
              variations of tropospheric structure.  Following preliminary results from a
              pilot study, they will composite interannual variations of stratospheric
              chemical and dynamical structure.  Interannual variations of tropospheric
              structure composited in a similar fashion will then be used to drive numerical
              integrations in an investigation of how stratospheric changes depend on changes
              in planetary wave activity and other tropospheric features influencing ozone.
