This work is a continuation of a series of ultra-precise
              measurements of masses of atomic ions.  One new goal of the research is to
              develop an ion source that would allow determination of masses of ions such as
              germanium and selenium that are not easily generated in a vapor phase.  A
              second goal is to improve the accuracy of the spectrometer to levels that would
              allow such measurements as the "weight" of a chemical bond as well as refine
              existing measurements of masses of elements such as tritium and helium-3.
