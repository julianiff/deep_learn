Abstract    :
              ***  9732035  Dynes  This grant will continue the support of an REU Site in the 
              Department of Physics at the University of California, San  Diego. 
              Applications will be considered from students from  colleges and universities
              nationwide.  Students will  participate in an individual research project
              supervised by  a Physics Department faculty member.  Students will be 
              integrated into research groups of their supervisors, giving  them a first-hand
              view of research in an academic setting.  Student projects will include
              experimental, theoretical and  computational research in high energy physics,
              condensed  matter physics, biophysics, plasma physics, astrophysics,  and
              nonlinear physics.  The research projects will be  designed to lead students
              from a dependent research status  to one which will allow each student to
              become as  independent as their research skills and abilities permit.  This
              activity is supported jointly by the NSF Division of  Physics and the Division
              of Materials Research.  ***
