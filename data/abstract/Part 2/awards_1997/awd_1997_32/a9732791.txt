Abstract    :
              The research program consists of six thrusts: (1) Based on the theory of
              multiphase composite materials, a strain-softening constitutive model for the
              tangential stiffness tensor of an elastic material with families of random
              microcracks of different orientations is developed. (2) By considering the
              crack growth rate to be a function of the stress intensity factor, the model is
              then generalized to rate dependence and viscoelasticity (creep) in the matrix. 
              (3) The model is further extended for plastic yielding at the fronts of
              microcracks.  (4) A computational algorithm borrowing same advantageous
              features of the microplane model is formulated, and nonlocal characteristics
              with a material length are incorporated to capture fracture behavior and size
              effect.  Also (5) an alternative model based on the microplane model enhanced
              by a softening law based on application of composite material theory to the
              growth of random crack families is developed and compared to the first outlined
              basic model, Finally (6) the model is verified and calibrated by least-square
              fitting of extensive test data from uniaxial, biaxial and triaxial tests,
              fracture tests and size effect tests, and is implemented in a dynamic finite
              element program.  The model will also allow easy generalization to isotropic
              and anisotropic rocks.
