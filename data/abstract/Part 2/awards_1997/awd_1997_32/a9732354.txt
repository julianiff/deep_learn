Abstract    :
               The primary goal of this project is to build knowledge about how to maximize
              the effectiveness of different modes of use of multi-media, anytime/anyplace
              group support systems. The project will experiment with "combination" or "mix
              and match" modes used by the same group over a period of time. These are the
              types of systems and patterns of use which are likely to be most prevalent over
              the next decade, yet there are no other experiments on such a phenomenon in 212
              studies published to date on group decision support systems. The research will
              integrate theory development, empirical research, and technology innovations,
              and may include controlled experiments. Other aspects to be studied may include
              the interaction of task and technology, the use of more sophisticated
              multi-criteria decision analysis tools, and the interaction of cultural
              characteristics with technology. The research will help to develop and
              integrate theories of effective computer support for collaborative work, and
              improve the process and outcomes of distributed collaborative work, such as
              software engineering work. http://eies.njit.edu/~hiltz
