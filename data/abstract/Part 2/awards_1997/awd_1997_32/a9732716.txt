Abstract    :
              9732716  Crow  In this project, a plan is outlined to continue the efforts of
              the Student Meeting Activities Subcommittee of the Power Engineering Education
              Committee of the IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) to promote student
              interest in the power engineering field by sponsoring electrical engineering
              students to attend the IEEE PES annual Winter Meeting.  The goal of this
              project is to provide an opportunity for US students to be exposed to the most
              recent developments in operation, constructions, and research in the power
              engineering field.  This is a particularly critical time for power engineering
              as the industry undergoes significant change due to the restructuring of the
              traditional utility structure.  The career opportunities for students
              interested in power engineering are many and varied; opportunities exist within
              utilities, vendors, manufacturers, and consulting firms.    The impact of this
              program is significant and far reaching.  This is an exciting time to be
              involved in power engineering.  The power industry is currently undergoing
              major changes, and young engineers entering the marketplace need to be exposed
              to the challenges and issues these changes are causing.  This program will
              allow students the opportunities to experience first-hand the energy and
              vitality of the power area.  This will hopefully encourage students to pursue a
              life-long career in the power engineering field.  ***
