Abstract    :
              Self-adjusting data structures have considerable practical  importance; they
              offer efficient performance and they are easy to  code since they are not
              required to enforce structural  constraints.  This same lack of structural
              constraints, however,  makes it difficult to predict the behavior of these data
               structures over a lengthy sequence of operations.  Recently, and  contrary to
              expectation, the widely used and highly practical  pairing heaps data structure
              has been shown to require more than  constant amortized time for the decrease
              key operation, thus  underscoring the need to have better methods for
              anticipating  behavior of self-adjusting data structures.  The major focus of 
              this project is the development of such methods.  Goals for this  project
              include (i) reaching a definitive understanding of the  pairing heap data
              structure, utilizing both analytical and  experimental methods; (ii) the
              development of a formal theory of  self-adjusting data structures, placing them
              at one end of the  spectrum of graded structure with emphasis on obtaining an 
              understanding of the performance limitations that are incurred as  structure is
              diminished; and (iii) an exploration of non-linear  amortized analysis for the
              purpose of predicting the frequency  and severity with which time consuming
              operations can take place.
