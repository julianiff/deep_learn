Abstract    :
              This experimental program focuses on the investigation of coherent interactions
              of atoms with a laser field and the interference that can occur when two
              interactions are driven simultaneously.  Three projects will be undertaken: 
              (a) the study of interference between two direct two-photon ionization
              processes, which is insensitive to the laser phase; (b) the study of the role
              of autoionizing resonances in coherent control processes; and (c) studies of
              even-odd interference as a form of coherent control which allows one to
              determine the phase differences between wavefunctions of continuum states.
