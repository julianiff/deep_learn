Abstract    :
              ***   9732533  Shleser    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase
              II project focuses on genetic improvement of the Black Tiger shrimp, Penaeus
              monodon.  This species represents 75% of world production of farmed shrimp
              valued at more than 3 billion dollars annually.  The overall objective is
              selective breeding of this shrimp for performance in a farming environment. 
              Specific pathogen free stocks will be genetically identified for selective
              breeding.  The ability to identify members of full-sibling families to
              establish and maintain pedigree records over several generations is essential
              to a selective breeding program.  Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification
              of introns in conserved nuclear genes will be used to identify alleles that can
              be used to manage the breeding program.  Phase II will identify specific
              pathogen free stocks; identify alleles that can be used to direct the selection
              process; develop cost effective methods to monitor populations; and develop
              additional markers to monitor heterogeneity and reduce inbreeding.   
              Commercial application is expected in genetically improved broodstock for
              export and post larvae producion in Hawaii to shrimp producers worldwide.  ***
