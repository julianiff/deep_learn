Abstract    :
              ***  9732276  Stwalley  The summer undergraduate research program (an NSF REU
              Site)  will continue in the Department of Physics at the University  of
              Connecticut.  This summer program will expose a diverse  group of talented
              undergraduates to an exciting research  environment and inform them in weekly
              seminars about the  frontiers of physics and about careers in physics. 
              Departmental social gatherings, a final poster session for  presentation of
              research results, and assignment of a  graduate student mentor as well as a
              faculty advisor are  included to enhance the participants' sense of community 
              with the other members of the department.  We plan to focus  on a balanced
              program attracting on a nationwide basis  talented women and both
              underrepresented and other minority  undergraduates, especially from primarily
              undergraduate  institutions with less access to a comprehensive research 
              environment.  ***
