Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Northern Arizona  University
              will offer a summer research program for six students  recruited nationwide. 
              Minority students and students from  colleges and universities without doctoral
              programs are  especially encouraged to apply.  Application materials are 
              available from Terence.Blows@nau.edu    the program will run for eight weeks in
              the summer, with each  student working on an individual project tailored to
              their own  mathematical background.  The subject areas, which are to be  widely
              interpreted are Applied Mathematics, Combinatorics and  Statistics. 
              Descriptions of projects available for the coming  summer appear on the
              department's homepage at  http://odin.math.nau.edu/    As well as carrying out
              their research, students will participate  in seminar series and will each give
              a fifty minute presentation.   Also, at the end of the program, each student
              will write up their  work in a form suitable for publication.
