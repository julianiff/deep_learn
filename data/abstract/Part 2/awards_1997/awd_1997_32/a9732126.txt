              Abstract    OPP-9732126, 9732461  CHAPIN, LYNCH  UNIV. ALASKA, UNIV. COLORADO   
              This project is designed to test the primary hypothesis that the surface energy
              and moisture exchange between atmosphere, ecosystem, snow, permafrost, and soil
              is the principal mechanism for coupling the land surface to the climate on
              seasonal to decadal timescales.  Understanding the characteristics, mechanisms
              and feedback processes of this exchange is necessary to incorporate their
              effects into predictive tools for pan-Arctic climate change.  This proposal
              will take a comprehensive view of the study of the land surface energy and
              moisture budgets, involving collection of field data, detailed data analysis,
              model development, and spatial and temporal extrapolation.  The PIs plan to
              integrate the field work closely with the simulation work, and investigations
              of ecosystems and physical climate systems are undertaken together.
