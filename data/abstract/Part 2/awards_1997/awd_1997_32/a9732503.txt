Abstract    :
              This award supports projects encompassing experiments in two different broad
              research areas. The first research focus emphasizes precision measurements in
              fundamental systems, notably simple objects such as atomic helium and molecular
              hydrogen.  A new project will test the antisymmetrization postulate in quantum
              mechanics by measurements in molecular oxygen.  The second research focus is on
              the study of molecular dynamics in highly excited Rydberg atoms.  A new
              direction for the group in molecular dynamics will concentrate on the
              utilization of coherent excitation and control to achieve selective branching
              ratios for photogenerated processes.
