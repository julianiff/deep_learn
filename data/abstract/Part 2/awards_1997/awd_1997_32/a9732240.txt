Abstract    :
              Three-dimensional "alpha shapes" will be explored and evaluated  as a technique
              for describing and recognizing objects.  This  problem has important
              applications in biomedical research  and instruction, clinical practice, and
              scientific visualization.  Alpha-shapes have a well developed theory and appear
              promising.  The first task is to complete a global correspondence scheme. 
              Next, a pose-determination algorithm will be developed, based on  matching
              Delaunay graphs.  Initially, scenes to be described and  recognized will
              consist of single, isolated objects.  Eventually,  methods will be developed to
              decompose complex scenes into  subparts.
