Abstract    :
                        Zeilberger  9732602      Zeilberger plans to develop algorithms for
              automatic discovery and proof of results in combinatorics and related areas. In
              particular, he plans to mechanize Dodgson's method evaluating hypergeometric
              determinants, to use techniques from computational linguistics to empirically
              discover  and then rigorously prove `grammars' of combinatorial families,  and
              to develop a computational Ansatz for multi-variate rational generating
              functions. He also proposes to investigate combinatorial analogs of techniques
              from computational chemistry and to try to prove Haiman's Diagonal Harmonics
              conjecure.      This research is in the general area of Combinatorics. One of
              the goals of Combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how
              discrete collections  of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete
              systems is extremely  important to modern communications. For example, the
              design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the
              design of algorithms in  computer science deal with discrete sets of objects,
              and this makes use of  combinatorial research.   This research is also in the
              general area of Symbolic Computation, that attempts to teach computers to
              perform research that previously required extensive human resources. Progress
              in this area promises to have important ramifications to science and
              technology.
