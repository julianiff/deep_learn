Abstract    :
              9732162  Clearfield    Research in solid state and materials chemistry is
              undergoing  tremendous growth while at the same time the character of the 
              research is changing due in large part from the need to explore  new classes of
              technologically important materials made possible  by the advent of new solid
              state synthetic strategies. This  meeting will bring together experts in the
              field of structure  determination by diffraction and related techniques to
              inform a  broad range of inorganic, solid state and materials chemists  about
              the latest advances in these fields.  %%%  New materials classes of high
              technological importance are  emerging at a rapid rate due in large part to the
              development of  new solid state synthetic strategies. These include synthesis
              at  low temperatures, "chemie douce" or soft chemistry,  supramolecular
              assembly, crystal engineering, and new routes to  hybrid inorganic-organic
              materials. These approaches have  recently been used by industrial firms
              searching for new  catalysts, semiconductors and superconductors. Complementary
              to  these synthetic efforts, and an integral part of solid state  chemistry is
              the development of powerful structure determining  tools for the
              characterization of these new classes of  materials.  ***
