Abstract    :
              While spoken language systems are now used for many applications,  language 
              engineering technology is still not  adequate  for  all  important  tasks. For
              instance, automatic recognition of  natural  conversational speech results in
              incorrect transcription of  one-  third  of  the  words spoken.  Parsing
              sentences  from  newspaper  articles   leads  to  faulty  automatic  analysis 
              of  half   the  sentences.  The need to make progress in this important  area 
              is  obvious.  The number of available language engineering  personnel  is 
              small  and  relatively  few  universities  presently  educate  students 
              capable of performing the required tasks.   The  Center  for   Language  and 
              Speech  Processing  at  the  Johns   Hopkins  University  is  organizing  a 
              six  week  workshop  on   Language  Engineering  from July 13 to August 24,
              1998, in which  teams  of  professionals  and  students will work together  to 
              advance  the  state  of the art.  Three topics will be addressed:  (1)  Dynamic
               Segmental  Models  of Speech Coarticulation;   (2)  Rapid  Speech  Recognizer
              Adaptation to New Speakers;  (3) Core Natural Language  Processing   Technology
                Applicable   to   Multiple   Languages.  University   professors,   leading 
              industrial   and   government  researchers  presently  working in  widely 
              dispersed  locations,  graduate   students,  and  six  or  more  undergraduate 
              students  selected  through  a nationwide search will participate  in  this 
              workshop.   Significant  technological innovations,  training  of  students, 
              cross-fertilization of ideas from various disciplines,  initiation  of
              collaborative research, and creation  of  valuable  training  and  test 
              corpora are expected  to  result  from  this  endeavor.
