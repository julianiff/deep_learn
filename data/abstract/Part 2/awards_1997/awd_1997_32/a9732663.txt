The Semiconducting Research Corporation (SRC) has
              identified noise modeling of sub-micron Metal Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect
              Transistors (MOSFETs) as one of most  urgent short term research  needs for
              1997-98.  As devices shrink, frequencies increase, and voltages reduce, the
              need  to understand the noise sources in new generation MOSFETs  becomes more
              and more important in order  to design and gavricate devices with acceptable
              performance characteristics.  Noise models developed for large area devices
              based on the large-number-the device, beyond a certain limit of scaling down,
              with existing models, it becomes impossible to predict the noise performance of
              an individual transistor, specifically a MOSFET.  The lack of accurate models
              leads the process and to significant waste of valuable time.  There is a need
              to measure and understand the sources of noise(all kinds and wide frequency
              range) exhibited by deep-submicron MOSFETs.
