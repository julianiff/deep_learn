Abstract    :
              This project concerns the design and implementation of symbolic,  numeric and
              geometric algorithms for the creation, manipulation  and visualization of
              polynomial (algebraic) curves, surfaces and  splines. Such algorithms form the
              science base for diverse  applications ranging from computer graphics game
              environments to  computer aided geometric design for simulation based design 
              prototyping.  The project has an abstract data type orientation.  In this
              framework, the choice of which representation of the  polynomial curve or
              surface patch to use is determined by the  desired optimality of the algorithms
              for the operations. Research  will therefore be done on different
              representations of algebraic  curve and surface splines for specific operations
              of display,  finite element mesh generation and polynomial spline model 
              construction.    Piecewise polynomial or rational functions or surfaces of some
               fixed degree d and continuously differentiable up to some order r  are known
              as algebraic splines or finite elements.  While it is  possible to model a
              general closed surface of arbitrary genus as  a single algebraic surface patch,
              the geometry of such a global  surface is difficult to specify, interactively
              control, and  display.  This research will covers both implicit and parametric 
              algebraic surface splines (algebraic patches and non-uniform  rational B-spline
              patches).
