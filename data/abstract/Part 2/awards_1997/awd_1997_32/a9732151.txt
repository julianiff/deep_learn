Abstract    :
              9732151    The Whitney Laboratory is an Institute of the University of  Florida.
               It was established in 1974 as a center for basic  biological research,
              particularly in those areas in which  marine organisms serve as experimental
              models.  Marine model  systems have had a long and successful history of use in
               fundamental research, and their value remains undiminished.  However, fewer
              and fewer scientists are likely to exploit  the research potential of marine
              animals, because costs have  limited the laboratory experience with these
              animals  provided by most universities to their undergraduate  students, who
              have not been encouraged to explore the  biological diversity of marine models.
                 In response to these problems, the Whitney Laboratory began,  in 1985, to
              offer undergraduates the opportunity to become  full participants in
              experiments on the physiology, anatomy,  biochemistry, and molecular biology of
              marine animals.  This  REU Site enables 10 students each summer to select and
              carry  out research projects in consultation with faculty mentors.  The
              academic experience of the students is further enriched  by participation in
              the seminar programs of the Laboratory  and by informal interaction with
              undergraduate and graduate  students, postdoctoral fellows, and established
              scientists  who visit from the United States and other countries.
