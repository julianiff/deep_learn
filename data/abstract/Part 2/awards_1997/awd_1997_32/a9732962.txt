Abstract    :
              In this project we investigate the design and performance of advanced digital
              receivers for use in multiple access communications networks, where a
              potentially large number of simultaneous users share a common   transmission
              environment. The receivers we study apply iterative soft information
              processing, which has proven very effective and efficient in the decoding of
              so-called "turbo" codes.   Our receivers integrate error control decoding and
              multiple access interference resolution to achieve maximum performance.    We
              study the fundamental theoretical limits of various multiple access 
              strategies, including code-division multiple access (CDMA), and design
              receivers aimed at approaching these limits as closely as possible under a
              given computational complexity constraint. The theoretical as well as the
              implementation complexity of these receivers is studied carefully, and hardware
              implementations are proposed and evaluated. The goal is to design and verify
              efficient joint receivers for multiple access systems.   We also study the
              interaction of the proposed receivers with higher level communication protocol
              layers, particularly the operation of these receivers in packet oriented
              networks with their unique requirements
