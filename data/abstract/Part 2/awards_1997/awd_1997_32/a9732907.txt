Abstract    :
              Basic research in theoretical computer science is studied.  Fundamental
              questions, about the analysis of algorithms and  complexity theory are
              researched. This seminar series focuses on  inviting distinguished outside
              speakers who are able to give an  overview of a research area to first and
              second year graduate  students. It is hoped that the interaction between
              graduate  students, researchers in the DC metropolitan area, and outside 
              visitors will be very productive and useful in stimulating new  research and
              facilitating new collaborations. Students will also  get an opportunity to
              present their work to the faculty. A  special effort will be made to involve
              honors undergraduate  students in this endeavor.
