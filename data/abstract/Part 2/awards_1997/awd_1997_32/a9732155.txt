Abstract    :
              9732155       The Mountain Lake Biological Station (MLBS) was founded  in 1929
              as a teaching and research facility of the Biology  Department of the
              University of Virginia.  It is located on  a mountain top in the Allegheny
              Mountains of southwestern  Virginia.  For almost twenty years MLBS has been
              developing  a theme of experimental studies in ecology and evolutionary 
              biology that has attracted a vigorous group of researchers  from major colleges
              and universities nationwide.       This REU Site continues a highly successful
              program  that has provided opportunities for ten students to spend  ten weeks
              each summer at MLBS conducting their own  independent research projects in the
              area of population  biology.  Student projects are overseen by field biologists
               who return to MLBS year after year because of its biological  diversity and
              range of research opportunities and resources.  REU participants are selected
              for their enthusiasm for field  research, scientific sophistication, and
              interest in  pursuing the sciences of ecology or evolution as a career  path. 
              Admission is highly competitive; less than 10% of  applicants are accepted.
              Participants design, execute,  interpret, and present their own studies.  Many
              projects are  published in peer-reviewed journals.  Not including 1997 
              participants, 42% of REU students have gone on to pursue  graduate degrees in
              biology.  Students also have the chance  to interact closely with other
              undergraduate and graduate  students, postdoctoral and faculty researchers, and
              teaching  faculty.  REU participants attend weekly seminars on the  conduct of
              scientific research and life as an academic.  The  meetings allow regular
              periods for students to share  questions, concerns and discoveries. 
              Participation in the  program is open to any undergraduate conducting
              independent  research at MLBS, whether they are supported by the NSF/REU  Site
              grant or not.  This serves to foster a greater sense of  collaboration and
              interaction among research groups at the  station.
