Abstract    :
              9732887  Sankar  Numerical and analytical models, guided by the understanding 
              of the physics, are developed to predict the effects of  translaminar
              reinforcements (TLR) on the fracture toughness  of composite laminates. The
              effectiveness of the  reinforcements is characterized both at material scale
              and  structural scale.These studies aid in the design of  laminated structures
              including the selection of TLR  materials and their areal fraction.  ***
