Abstract    :
              The investigators are exposing university faculty and students to the
              interdisciplinary nature of interactions among the geosphere, hydrosphere,
              cyrosphere, and biosphere, and their policy impact.  This Earth System Science
              Program will provide a Research Experiences for Undergraduates site, selecting
              10 undergraduate students each summer.  Summer activities, which complement the
              existing ESS Program, involve data analysis and modeling activities focusing on
              the effect of atmospheric aerosols and trace gases on solar radiation at or
              near Earth's surface.  Students will attend a series of ESS lectures, discuss
              critical thinking across scientific disciplines, train in scientific writing,
              and develop oral presentations.
