Abstract    :
                 Prof. Peter C. Searson will develop an experimental and theoretical framework
              to describe the electrochemical deposition of copper and gold on silicon, and
              to characterize the microstructure and electrical properties of the junctions.
              A combination of techniques will be used, primarily electrochemical analysis,
              electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, in situ microwave reflectivity,
              scanning probe microscopy, electron microscopy, and x-ray diffraction. The
              project will result in the determination of the mechanism of the charge
              transfer at the electrolyte-semiconductor interface and of the metal
              deposition; the kinetics of the ion reduction at the doped semiconductor
              surface, and of the metal nucleation and growth. Insight will be gained on the
              relationship between interfacial chemistry and materials properties
              (microstructure, morphology, and electrical properties). A scientific basis
              will be provided for the deposition of high quality, uniform metal films on
              semiconductor surfaces, with controlled Schottky or ohmic characteristics.
