Abstract    :
              This project investigates three distinct areas.  (1) Average case  complexity. 
              The major goal is to enable one to prove the average  case hardness of
              real-life decision and search problems.  The  research involves reexaming the
              basic definition of average-case  reduction and average-case polynomial-time. 
              (2) Finite model  theory.  The most challenging question is whether there
              exists a  logic that captures the notion of polynomial-time on arbitrary  (not
              necessarily ordered) structures.  The PI has conjecture a  few year ago that
              the answer is negative.  The thrust of the  research is the question what parts
              of polynomial time can be  captured by logics.  Another direction is extension
              of the  methods of finite model theory to the study of finite structures  with
              weights in infinite domains.  (3) Abstract state machines.  Abstract state
              machines is a new model of computation which has  been successfully used to
              specify and verify real-life  algorithms.  Here this model is applied to
              complexity theory and  finite model theory.
