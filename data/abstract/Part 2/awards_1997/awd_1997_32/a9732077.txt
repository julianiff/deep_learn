Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    OPP-9732077, 9732733   STURM, OLSSON  CRREL, UNIV. ALASKA    This
              project addresses the role of snow cover in the Arctic system, particularly on
              how Arctic snow characteristics arise from key meteorological events, and how
              these snow characteristics are modified by the snow-holding capacity of shrubs.
               By understanding these two processes, one regional, one local, the PIs expect
              to link snow cover to the general atmospheric circulation and large scale
              climate, yet still understand its impact on the arctic landscape and ecosystem
              at the local scale.  The research program will combine field observations and
              physically-based numerical modeling to do two specific tasks: 1) understand,
              measure, and predict the depth distribution of the snow cover at a range of
              scales, and 2) understand, measure, and predit the variation in physical
              properties of the snow pack at the same scales.  The measurements will allow
              the PIs to establish relationships between snow properties and weather, to
              investigate the interaction of snow and shrubs, and to test models.  The
              predictions will require development and integration of snow distribution and
              atmospheric models, which in turn will be tested against measurements.  These
              models can be used subsequently to investigate how the Arctic might respond to
              changes in climate.
