Abstract    :
              9732404  Garfield    Statistics reform is a major undergraduate innovation, but
              has not been evaluated to this point.  This study will examine the nature of
              statistics reform and the extent of its implementation, both within Mathematics
              and Statistics Departments as well as other Department that offer statistics
              courses.  All Mathematics and Statistics Departments and a sample of other
              Physical and Social Science will be surveyed to determine whether they have
              implemented statistics reform, and the types of reform included.  Based on
              these findings, a set of case studies will be carried out in Departments that
              have made a strong commitment to statistics reform to analyze the impact that
              the reform is having.
