Abstract    :
              9732062  Antonio Arroyo  University of Florida    REU:  Undergraduate Research
              Experience in Design and Construction of Autonomous Robots and Machine Learning
                 This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project supports
              eleven students per year in programs carried out during the summers and
              academic years, for three years.  The students will work on projects involving
              the design and construction of autonomous robots and machine learning.  After
              building their own robot, the students will study, develop, and test machine
              learning algorithms by implementing them in their own enhanced autonomous
              agent.  Student participants are recruited from institutions throughout the
              Southeast and Southwest with particular effort directed at students from
              several of the HBCUs in the area.  REU participants will be able to maintain a
              web page on the project web site for a period of two years on which to post new
              developments on their platforms, after the actual REU session is over.
