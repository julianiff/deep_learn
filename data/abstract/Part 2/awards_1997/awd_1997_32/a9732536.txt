Abstract    :
              9732536  Baskaran  This award to Texas A&M University will provide a new
              high-resolution gamma ray detector for use in the existing radioactive counting
              laboratory in Galveston.  It will provide needed additional capability for
              studies of marine processes, particularly in the area of colloidal chemistry of
              the waters of the Gulf of Mexico.  ***
