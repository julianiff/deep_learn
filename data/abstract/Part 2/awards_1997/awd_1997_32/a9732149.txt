Abstract    :
              DBI-9732149                                   Abstract           The
              Undergraduate Neurosciences Program at Duke University will    give
              undergraduates the opportunity to become involved in    neuroscience research
              at a major research university. Research and    training experiences will be
              organized around the theme of    "Mechanisms of Behavior."  The emphasis on
              integrative systems and    behavioral neuroscience that unifies faculty
              research interests    within this interdisciplinary field at Duke serves as the
              common    theme for the individual projects available to student participants  
               in the program.         The focus of the 10-week summer program for each
              student will be    a research mentorship with a participating faculty member.
              Two    weekly seminar series - "Research in the Neurosciences" and    "Science
              Basics"- will be included in the summer schedule.    "Research in the
              Neurosciences" will focus on ongoing faculty    research so that students in
              the program gain exposure to the field    of neuroscience research beyond their
              mentor's specific interests.    "Science Basics" will address practical matters
              pertaining to    science careers. The summer program will begin with a two-day 
                familiarization retreat and will close with a research forum during    which
              students will make formal presentations of their research    projects.        
              Applications to participate in "Mechanisms in Behavior" will be    accepted
              from sophomore undergraduates. The Program is especially    interested in
              receiving applications from women and minorities as    well as undergraduates
              at liberal-arts colleges.
