Abstract    :
              The project provides a small amount of funding for the writing of a monograph
              which analyzes the results of transport measurements in the Q-machine at
              Irvine.  The information in the monograph, which summarizes the research on
              this experimental device over the past thirty years, will be extremely useful
              to other plasma physicists engaged in the physics of transport in plasmas.
