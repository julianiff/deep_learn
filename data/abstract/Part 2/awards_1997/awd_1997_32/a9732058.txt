Abstract    :
              We propose to engage 12 undergraduates in research during the  three summers
              98-00.  The research will be focused in the areas  of differential geometry and
              geometric topology. There will also  be a component of some parts of
              mathematical physics, especially  general relatively, related to differential
              geometry.    There will be five Tulane University faculty members involved 
              with the project:  Morris Kalka (Coordinator), Slawomir Kwasik, James Rogers,
              Frank  Tipler and Dagang Yang.  Each faculty will supervise the research  of 2
              undergraduates, who will work on a joint project. The  undergraduate
              participants will be chosen from a pool which will  be gathered from nationwide
              advertising.
