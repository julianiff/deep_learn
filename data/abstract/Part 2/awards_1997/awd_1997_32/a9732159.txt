This research is a joint experimental and theoretical effort
              whose primary objectives are the testing and elucidation of the details of
              single and multiple ionization, of electron transfer, and of atomic
              interactions at surfaces.  Both electromagnetic radiation and charged particles
              will be used as collision partners, and comparisons will be made of the
              similarities and differences induced by the two types of collision.
