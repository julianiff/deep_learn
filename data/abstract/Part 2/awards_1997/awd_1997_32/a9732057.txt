              UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA     The project will examine the role of northward
              movement of boreal forests in response to warmer climates under a global change
              scenario.  The expansion of forests into areas currently covered by tundra will
              cause climate feedbacks due to the greater uptake of carbon, water, and energy
              by trees compared to tundra.  Therefore a climate shift to warmer temperatures
              resulting from an increased concentration of carbon dioxide could result in an
              expansion of forests that mitigate the increase by absorbing a greater amount
              of the carbon dioxide than the tundra replaced by the forest.  The
              investigators will examine the ecological response of treeline to the
              post-glacial warming as an example of a warming response.  They also will
              examine the ecological response time of forestation following forest fires in
              order to determine the pace of forest regeneration as a proxy for treeline
              movement.
