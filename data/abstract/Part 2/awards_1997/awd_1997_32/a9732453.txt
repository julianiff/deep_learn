This project is a study of the photon statistics of pulsed
              vertical-cavity, surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs).  Low-noise, high-efficiency
              detection will be used to characterize the noise behavior of pulsed VCSLELs in
              detail.  The measurements will lead to improved understanding of the physics of
              microcavity lasers as well as be of benefit to the lightwave communications
              industry.
