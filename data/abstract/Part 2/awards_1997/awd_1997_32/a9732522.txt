              Experiences for Undergraduates in Computer Vision    This Research Experiences
              for Undergraduates (REU) Site project supports ten students per year in
              programs carried out during the full calendar year, for three years.  The
              students work on projects involving computer vision, including such subareas as
              visual lip-reading, human face processing, and color image processing.  With
              the full calendar year experience, the students have time to follow a
              substantial project through to completion.  The students meet with their
              faculty advisor once each week, they participate in the weekly research group
              meetings and write a technical report on their project.  The project has a
              target of having 50% of the participants being from underrepresented groups.
