Abstract    :
              9732502  Yeh    This U.S.-Brazil award will support a research collaboration 
              between Dr. William W-G. Yeh of the University of  California, Los Angeles and
              Dr. Benedito P. F. Braga, Jr. at  the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil.   
              They propose to develop a model for the optimal management  and operation of a
              large-scale hydropower system.  Brazil is  home to the world's largest
              hydropower system, located in  southeast Brazil.  The investigators intend to
              develop a  model for this system and apply the model to the study of  capacity
              expansion to determine the optimal timing, sizing  and sequencing of new
              projects.        This project provides a unique opportunity to develop and 
              test new optimization methodologies.  The research could  contribute
              significantly to both countries' knowledge of  large-scale hydropower system
              optimization.        ***
