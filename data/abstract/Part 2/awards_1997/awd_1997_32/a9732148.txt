Abstract    :
              9732148    This REU Site will provide research experience for students  who
              would otherwise not have the opportunity.  In addition,  it will attract large
              numbers of highly qualified graduate  students to the University of Kentucky. 
              The program will  provide an interactive environment for faculty and graduate 
              students to expose undergraduate students to the many facets  of a graduate
              career.  It will inform undergraduate students  about career opportunities
              available in the field of  neuroscience over the wide spectrum of industry,
              academia,  medicine, and public service.  Students will be given an  intensive
              short course on neuroscience, covering basic  anatomical, physiological,
              developmental, and behavioral  aspects.  Later in the summer, a mini-symposium
              on a  selected research area will bring leading national  researchers to UK for
              seminars and informal discussions with  students.  Students will be immersed in
              a research project  of their own choosing, working in the lab of a faculty 
              member who acts as mentor. The goal is production of  publishable data, and to
              this end all students will present  the results of their research in a setting
              resembling a  regional or national professional meeting.  This program  should
              give students an appreciation for the nature of  biomedical research and the
              various opportunities for  careers in this field.
