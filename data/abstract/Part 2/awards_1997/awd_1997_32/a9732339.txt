              Experience for Undergraduates    This Research Experiences for Undergraduates
              (REU) Site project supports eight students per year in programs carried out
              during the summers, for three years.  Five of the students are from other than
              the home institution and significant effort is directed at recruiting women and
              minority students.  Areas of research in which the students will be involved
              include parallel algorithms, system development environments, human-machine
              interfaces, algorithm animation, and programming languages.  The student will
              perform independent research, give oral presentations on their work, prepare
              scientific papers, and present their work at seminars at their home
              institutions and national and regional meetings.
