Abstract    :
                ***  9732565  Ruetzler    This small award will allow the Caribbean Coral Reef
               Ecosystems Program and its lab in Belize to acquire a small  research boat to
              accommodate visiting scientists working in  the coral reef, seagrass and
              mangrove systems of the  Belizean barrier reef complex. This will allow
              scientists at  the lab to optimize their investigations of coral bleaching  in
              the Belize barrier reef complex as well as to accommodate  studies of the
              possible responses to ENSO perturbations. The  NSF supports many scientists
              using the CCRE lab for short-  term experimental studies and excellent field
              access. The  new vessel will improve the capability of the lab and will 
              facilitate many research projects.  ***
