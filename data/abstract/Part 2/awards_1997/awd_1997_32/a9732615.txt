This proposal ("Numerical Modeling of Motional Induction in
              the Ocean") supports a collaboration between the PI, Thomas Sanford and a
              postdoc, Robert Tyler, from the University of Washington in a cooperative
              research project with Josef Oberhuber at the Center for Climate Research in
              Hamburg, Germany.  The research will create the first general three-dimensional
              time-dependent model capable of calculating the general global ocean-generated
              electromagnetic fields.  The model will be developed by extending a
              sophisticated model already developed by Oberhuber's group.  Simulations will
              study the non-local and transient ocean-generated electromagnetic fields, which
              will help with interpreting current data on ocean flows; study the global
              electromagnetic fields generated by ocean tides; use the model to describe the
              variability and distribution of magnetic fields generated by low-frequency
              ocean variability; and use the model to assess the potential for using
              satellite magnetic surveys to monitor ocean variability.
