Abstract    :
              Mark Nanny  9732969  This is an award to support a project proposed in accord
              with the  Guidelines for Submission of Proposals to the Faculty Early  Career
              Development (CAREER) Program, NSF 97-87.  As such, it has  both a research and
              educational component.  The investigator's  research objectives are to conduct
              work that characterizes non-  covalent reactions of dissolved organic carbon
              with water  pollutants that affects their bioavailability, transferability in 
              aquifers and other factors that can be applied to engineering  design of
              systems to reduce the pollutional impact of leachate  from landfills.  The
              dissolved organic compounds he plans on  using have been isolated from the
              Norman Landfill leachate and  include humic acid, fulvic acid and hydrophilic
              organic matter.  The investigator plans on using deuterium-labeled aromatic 
              compounds such as toluene, ethylbenzene, nitrobenzene, phenol,  aniline,
              benzoic acid and methoxybenzene derivatives in addition  to pyridine and
              quinoline in the characterization of their  reactions with natural organic
              carbonaceous substances.    The Principal Investigator's educational component
              has an  outreach component aspect for involving secondary school  teachers,
              their students and undergraduates in environmental  research focussed on an
              actual problem such as those associated  with management of the leachate from a
              local landfill.  This  problem addresses environmental issues that are expected
              to  motivate students because of their immediate importance,  scientific and
              technological complexity.  The investigator plans  on inaugurating a summer
              program for high school students who  will assist in designing a research
              project to be conducted by  them during the succeeding academic year.  The
              investigator also  plans on implementation of the use of advanced analytical 
              instrumentation in undergraduate classes and integrating the  results of his
              research in the engineering design and  implementation of systems for solving
              hazardous waste management  problem s.  ***
