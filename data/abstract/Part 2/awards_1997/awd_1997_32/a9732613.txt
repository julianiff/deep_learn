Abstract    :
              ***  9732613  Ross  The University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) will 
              continue to offer an NSF-sponsored REU Site Program for the  summers of
              1998-2000.  The focus of this program is the  neutron science that can be
              achieved at a 10MV nuclear  research reactor center on a college campus.  The
              program  will include eleven undergraduate science students and three  students
              having backgrounds in Journalism/Media.  Each  student develops a research plan
              with a dedicated mentor and  spends his/her summer pursuing this plan and
              participating  in our REU Group activities.  This program will involve  eight
              weeks of intensive training and research at MURR  followed by two weeks of data
              analysis and report writing at  an appropriate location.  ***
