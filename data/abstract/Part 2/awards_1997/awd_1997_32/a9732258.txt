Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the study of collisions of polarized electrons with
              chiral molecules, metastable states of noble gas targets, and ground-state
              targets of the same atom.  The experiments address basic physics questions
              about the dynamics of electron-molecule and electron-atom scattering,
              particularly with regard to electron-spin-dependent effects.   A strong effort
              in the development of improved sources of polarized electrons and electron
              polarimeters accompanies the basic research component.
