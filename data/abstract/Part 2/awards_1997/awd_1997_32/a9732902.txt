Abstract    :
              Yngve Ohrn and Erik Deumens are supported by a grant from the Theoretical   and
              Computational Chemistry Program to develop electron nuclear dynamics,   a
              general approach to find approximate solutions to the time-dependent  
              Schrodinger equation.  By solving this equation in a non-Born-Oppenheimer   
              way, that is, by placing the nuclei and the electrons on an equal   footing,
              their method avoids the extensive computation of potential   energy surface
              points and nonadiabatic coupling terms required by   traditional approaches. 
              The trade-off is an increase in the number of   particles to be treated, but
              due to advances in computational power, this   method is economically
              competitive.  Applications include hydrogen   abstraction reactions and
              dissociative recombinations of polyatomic   molecular cations.  Elementary
              chemical reations are dynamical events involving the   participating electrons
              and atomic nuclei.  Such dynamics are described   at the most fundamental level
              by the time-dependent Schrodinger equation.    A general approach to solving
              this equation will yield reaction rates   for elementary chemical reactions
              which are difficult to obtain   experimentally.
