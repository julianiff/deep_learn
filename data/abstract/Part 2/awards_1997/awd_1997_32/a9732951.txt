Abstract    :
                      9732951    Bush    This Career Proposal combines an exciting field
              research program and innovative educational program focused on lowland tropical
              forests of Amazonia. These ecosystems have long been of interest to ecologists
              and conservation biologists but relatively little information is available on
              the temporal patterns of biodiversity. Recent evidence suggests profound
              changes have taken place in these lowland forests during the last 7,000 years
              and Dr. Bush will focus on this problem.  Using cores from mid-Holocene-aged
              lakes in Amazonia, he will record changes over the last 7,000 years in forest
              diversity, as evidenced through pollen composition at different strata in the
              cores.  Using other characteristics of these cores such as charcoal,
              paleomagnetic, and bulk density he will attempt to reconstruct paleoclimate
              histories for this region.  Based on the careful selection of sites, it is
              anticipated that this research will be able to evaluate the impact of human
              populations  over the past 7,000 years on biodiversity of lowland tropical
              forests of Amazonia. Professor Bush has already demonstrated a marked
              commitment to undergraduate education by his recently published textbook
              "Ecology of a Changing Planet." Through this Career Proposal he will expand on
              the ideas in that book, integrating real-life experiences from his research
              program into courses currently being designed. In particular his plans include
              use of geographic information systems to allow students a closer look at
              landscape level changes and their impact on biodiversity.
