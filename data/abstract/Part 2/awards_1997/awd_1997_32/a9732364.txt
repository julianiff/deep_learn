Abstract    :
              9732364  Frodeman         This proposal responds to the changing demands being
              placed  upon science by offering an expanded type of research experience  for
              undergraduates.  The Southwest Earth Studies Program is an 8  week summer
              research program for 10 students, half from the  sciences, half from the
              humanities.  It combines research on  scientific issues surrounding acid mine
              drainage in southwest  Colorado with research into the relationship between
              science and  public policy.  The goal of this program is for students to see 
              that scientific research today operates within a social and  political context
              that must be acknowledged if they are to be  successful scientists and
              citizens.  Students will gather and  evaluate data; discuss the philosophical
              issues surrounding the  interpretation and use of this data; and combine this
              data with  political perspectives for the devising of realistic public policy 
              alternatives.  ***
