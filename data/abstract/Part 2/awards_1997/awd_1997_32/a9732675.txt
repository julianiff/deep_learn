Abstract    :
              The primary objective of this proposal is for the Principal
Investigator to
              acquire a thorough background in the techniques
of molecular biology, both
              theoretical and experimental, and
exposure to contemporary research in the
              modeling of long-strand
biological molecules from chemical, physical, and
              mathematical
perspectives, in order to bring to fruition a research
              program
that will develop and apply techniques of knot theory to obtain
new
              understanding of the dynamics of DNA, RNA and polymeric
proteins.  In
              addition, this proposal will lead to the
development and implementation of
              model graduate programs in
biomathematics.

The principal investigator will
              serve as a visiting faculty
member in the Department of Biomathematics at
              Mount Sinai School
of Medicine from July 1, 1998 to June 30, 1999.  This
              experience
will shape the PI's research program in mathematics and
              its
applications during the grant period and in subsequent years. 
The
              modeling of the relationship between the structure and
function in DNA and
              other biological molecules is an area of
increasing importance and one that
              has many unexplored facets. 
The vast storehouse of DNA sequence data
              currently being
generated will only become useful when the dynamics of
              its
molecular function are understood.  Knot theory has already
emerged as an
              important descriptive and foundational language for
developing models of
              molecular function.  The application to
these problems of new techniques of
              knot theory has the potential
to revolutionize our understanding of molecular
              biology by
enabling the development of the kind of valid and
              complete
descriptions of molecular dynamics that are required for
              the
accurate prediction of structure and function.

The expertise that the
              PI will obtain will also enrich the
educational experiences and broaden the
              career options for
students in his subsequent academic endeavors.  The PI
              will
engage in interdisciplinary interactions with students and
faculty in
              the biological sciences and will work to implement
graduate programs in
              biomathematics.  Graduates of such programs,
both at the master's and doctoral
              levels will enjoy excellent
employment opportunities in the pharmaceutical
              industry.

              Sciences (DMS).
