Abstract    :
              This project studies how caches affect the performance of  algorithms.  There
              are two component problems to study:  (i) the  problem of how to analyze the
              cache performance of algorithms,  and (ii) the problem of how to design
              algorithms with good cache  performance and good overall performance. In order
              to analyze  cache performance, an algorithm is modeled by its pattern of 
              memory accesses.  Models that approximate patterns of memory  accesses will be
              investigated and analyzed to approximate the  number of cache misses.  The
              validity of the approximation is  determined empirically using trace-driven
              cache simulation.  With  a better understanding of the cache performance of
              algorithms,  algorithms that are optimized to improve cache performance, will 
              be designed, implemented and evaluated.
