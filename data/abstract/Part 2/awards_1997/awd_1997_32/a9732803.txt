              Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) is acquired for use in
              combustion research.  Studies include turbulent, partially premixed flames,
              pulverized coal flames, gas turbine spray combustion and heat transfer, porous
              radiant burners, and droplet-based manufacturing processes.  Both line-of-sight
              and tomographic reconstruction measurements are performed.
