Abstract    :
                Visualizing microtubules and other cytoskeletal structures  in most types of
              living cells has been a difficult problem.  A new type of microscopy, called
              modulated polarization  microscopy, which can routinely image individual 
              microtubules and other cytoskeletal structures as well as  vesicle movements
              along cytoskeletal tracks will be  developed. Modulated polarization microscopy
              images  cytoskeletal structures based on their birefringence but  takes
              advantage of the fact that birefringence is sensitive  to polarization angle.
              When birefringent structures are  illuminated with plane polarized light of
              varying angle and  viewed between crossed polarizers they oscillate in 
              intensity. This behavior is not seen with structures that  are not birefringent
              and provides a means for separating  weakly birefringent elements from the
              cytoplasmic  background.    A prototype instrument has been built using Faraday
              rotators  to modulate the plane of polarized light presented to the  specimen.
              Images obtained using this microscope demonstrate  its potential for imaging
              the cytoskeleton.    An advanced version of the moldulated polarization 
              microscope with greatly improved sensitivity, contrast,  image quality, and
              resolution will be built.  Improvements  in the new microscope will be based on
              analysis of problems  with the original prototype.
