Abstract    :
              This award is recommended by the Advanced Materials Program in the   Chemistry
              Division in support of the research of Dr. Michael Wasielewski   at
              Northwestern University. The theme of the research is the design,   synthesis
              and function of ultrafast molecular switches based on ultrafast   optical
              gating of electron transfer in extended arrays of organic and   organometallic
              donor-acceptor molecules. These switches will make use of   high quantum yield
              and picosecond electron transfer processes to control   the movement of
              electrons within the molecules. Three approaches to a   molecular switch will
              be explored; first, the use of photogenerated   electric fields to control
              electron transfer rates, second, the use of   two sequential light pulses to
              generate radical anions or cations and   then transfer them to an adjacent
              acceptor or donor, and third,   excitation of bridging chromophores to control
              the lifetimes of   photogenerated charge-separated states.  The successful
              development of of new molecule-sized electronics promises   to yield dramatic
              improvements in component density, response speed and   energy efficiency. The
              impact of the research is broad and includes   potential applications such as
              information storage, solar energy   conversion and optical signal processing.
