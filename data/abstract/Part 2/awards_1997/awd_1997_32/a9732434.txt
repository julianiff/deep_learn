This award will support Michael ConlonI and two graduate
              students from Creighton University in cooperative research with Suzanne
              Holmgren and J÷rgen Jensen of the Department of Zoophysiology at the University
              of G÷teborg, Sweden.  The research will identify an antagonist to the peptide
              bradykinin, which is produced in teleost fish such as the rainbow trout and
              Atlantic cod.  The results will shed light on the evolution of the peptide
              system, and will also further understanding of the action of pharmacological
              substances associated with bradykinin effects in mammalian systems.
