              Submillimeter Polarimetery at the CalTech Submillimeter Observatory.    Dr.
              Hildebrand will carry out an observational program at sub-mm wavelengths of the
              polarization that is produced by grains aligned by magnetic fields in the
              interstellar medium.  By observing sources at a large range of length scales, 
              he hopes to characterize the orientation, percentage polarization, and overall
              systematic order in the magnetic field geometry of the source.  The
              observations will be carried out using the California Institute of Technology
              Submillimeter Observatory on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.  ***
