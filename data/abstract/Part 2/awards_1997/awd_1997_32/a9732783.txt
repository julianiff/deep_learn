Abstract    :
              Abstract  CTS-9732783  L.-S. Fan, Ohio State Univ.  This award will provide
              partial travel support for academic speakers at the 9th International
              Fluidization Conference in Durango, Colorado, May 17-22, 1998.  This conference
              is the leading international forum in the field of fluidization, and takes
              place each three year in a different country.  The Conference is co-chaired by
              Prof. L.S. Fan and Dr. T. Knowlton, and it is organized by the Engineering
              Foundation.   The focus of the conference will be on emerging technologies
              involving fluidization, and international participation.  Papers from over 28
              countries representing almost all the important fluidization research groups
              worldwide will be highlighted by several invited lectures of Prof. R. Jackson,
              Prof. W.P.M. van Swaaij, Prof. S. Mori and Dr. W.C. Yang.  The conference
              covers a variety of subjects, from fundamental multiphase flow to applied
              topics in chemical, petrochemical, mining and mineral processing.  Free-forum
              poster sessions will allow the presentation of most recent research work.  A
              special session will be dedicated to video presentations.  The refereed
              proceedings will be prepared in advance and distributed at the conference.  ***
