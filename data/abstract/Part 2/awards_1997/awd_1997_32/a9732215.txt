Abstract    :
              Proposal No.: 9732215  PI:  LaFave  University: U of Massachusetts-Amherst      
               ABSTRACT    The proposed project provides stipends and associated support for
              seven undergraduate students to be involved in ongoing research projects in the
              Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of
              Massachusetts/Amherst.  The intent is to recruit students who: (1) are
              underrepresented in the field (women and minorities), (2) are undergraduates at
              other institutions, and (3) may not have the opportunity to conduct research at
              their undergraduate institutions.  The students will participate in the summer
              between their junior and senior years, and the intent is to instill in the
              students the desire to pursue a graduate education.  The program will include:
              (1) a self contained research project for each student that is aligned with a
              larger funded project, (2) individual direction by graduate students and
              faculty members, (3) regular research project meetings, (4) a final oral
              presentation and written report by the undergraduate researchers, (5) weekly
              meeting/seminars with other undergraduate researchers, including a series of
              outside speakers.  Research will be in the areas of Environmental,
              Geotechnical, Structural, and Transportation Engineering.  Faculty and students
              will be matched according to applicability of projects, desires of faculty and
              students, the needs of faculty, and the abilities of students.
