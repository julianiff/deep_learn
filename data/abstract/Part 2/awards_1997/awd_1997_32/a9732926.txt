Abstract    :
              This is a 12 month field study focusing on the dynamic relations between adult
              males and immature white-faced capuchin monkeys living in highly seasonal,
              tropical dry forests of Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica. The objectives
              are to explore the range of affiliative behaviors that take place between adult
              males and immatures, to identify the morphological and behavioral factors that
              draw the attention of young to the adult males and vice versa, and to determine
              the effects immatures have on the social interactions with adult males. In
              addition to the observational behavioral data, fecal samples will be collected
              from known individuals for subsequent DNA analysis to determine paternal
              relations. Studies of the genesis and nature of social relations between
              immature and adult male nonhuman primates are important for the development of
              theories regarding male parental care, social development, and affiliative
              interactions that serve to bond group members.
