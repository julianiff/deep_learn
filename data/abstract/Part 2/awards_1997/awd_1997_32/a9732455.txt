Abstract    :
              This research program focuses on the measurement of differential s-wave
              scattering phase shifts to determine cold collision cross-sections for the
              cesium atom.  The measurement relies on the technique of juggling atoms in a
              laser-cooled fountain clock to avoid the necessity of determining atom
              densities.   Accuracies better than 10 mrad are anticipated.
