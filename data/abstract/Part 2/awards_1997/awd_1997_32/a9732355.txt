Abstract    :
              Numerous applications in sciences, engineering and  mathematics give rise to
              problems involving structured  matrices such as Toeplitz, Hankel,  Vandermonde,
               controllability, observability, Cauchy, Bezoutians, along  with  many other
              patterns of structure. In many of these  applications the use of standard 
              mathematical software  tools (such as MATLAB, Mathematica, Maple, LAPACK, etc.)
              is  not appropriate, because their ignoring of structure  requires unnecessary
              storage as well as an extremely large  amount of CPU time. Secondly, many
              structured matrices,  e.g., Hankel, Pick, Hilbert, Vandermonde, are extremely
              ill-  conditioned, so that all available standard methods often  fail to
              produce even one correct digit in the computed  solution.  The objective of
              this project is the study of theoretical  and computational problems related to
              structured matrices  which arise in several applied areas, including signal and
               image processing, system theory, and control theory. New  accurate fast and
              superfast algorithms will be developed for  several new classes of structured
              matrices, arising in  rational matrix interpolation and approximation problems 
              with norm constraints, in Gaussian quadrature as well as in  signal and image
              processing. Along with these direct  methods, the approach will be used to
              design new classes of  preconditioners based on discrete real transforms to
              speed-  up the convergence of the conjugate gradient method for  block
              Toeplitz-plus-Hankel matrices.
