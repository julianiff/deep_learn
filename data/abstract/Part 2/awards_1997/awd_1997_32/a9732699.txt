Abstract    :
              Crystal  plasticity  based models and simulation  tools  are  developed  for 
              bulk deformation processes  involving  large  deformations  in  both low
              stacking fault energy  (SFE)  fcc  metals  as  well  as  in  hcp metals  with 
              good  predictive  capabilities for both the anisotropic stress-strain response 
              as well as the averaged crystallographic texture. a-brass (a  low  SFE  fcc 
              metal)  and commercially pure  titanium  (hcp  metal) are used as model
              materials for the study. The  study  has  a  strong  impact on the metal
              working industry  as  it  provides  predictive  tools that yield  a  large 
              amount  of  quantitative information on microstructure evolution  during 
              deformation.  The  microstructural state of  a  material  is  important  as  it
              plays a governing role in shape  and  size  control  during deformation
              processing, structural integrity  of    the    produced   component,   and  
              its   performance  characteristics in service.
