Abstract    :
              9732277  This REU Site at the University of Puerto Rico's Rio Piedras  Campus
              aims to motivate talented Hispanic undergraduate  students into research
              careers in the cellular and molecular  fields of biology. Ten students will be
              selected each year  based on their GPAs, research interests, motivation and 
              potential for graduate careers. Students from small colleges  and universities
              with little access to laboratory research  will be preferentially selected. The
              10-week summer program  includes an intensive research experience in one of the
               laboratories of the faculty of the biology department.  Students will be
              exposed to a wide range of research topics  using cellular and molecular
              techniques to address a  biological problem. Each student will be assigned a
              research  project under the supervision of a mentor. A series of  complementary
              activities including seminars, workshops, an  ethics component, colloquia and
              social activities are  included.
