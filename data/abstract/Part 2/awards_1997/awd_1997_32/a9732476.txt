Abstract    :
              The extent to which partners in a relationship are able to accurately infer each
              other's private thoughts and feelings during a discussion is known as empathic
              accuracy. Previous research on empathic accuracy has revealed a major paradox:
              Although most studies find that greater empathic understanding tends to be good
              for relationships, some studies have found that greater empathic accuracy can
              harm relationships in certain situations. To reconcile these contrasting
              findings, researchers have proposed that empathic accuracy should be good for
              relationships when routine and non-threatening issues are being discussed by
              partners, but it should be bad for relationships when relationship-threatening
              issues are discussed. Understanding when empathic accuracy is good or bad for
              relationships is important for advancing knowledge about basic social
              interaction processes in close relationships. This project develops and tests a
              theory that specifies when higher versus lower levels of empathic accuracy are
              likely to occur in interactions. The theory will be tested in four studies
              involving large samples of long-term dating couples and married couples.
