This U.S.-Czech research project between David Jiles of
              Iowa State University and partners, Ladislav Pust and Ivan Tomas of the Czech
              Institute of Physics, Prague, will examine the relationship between structure
              and properties of magnetic materials by developing computer based models of
              relevant magnetization processes.  These efforts will feature energy
              dissipation as a result of magnetization where Bloch walls interact with
              regions that have different magnetic properties from the matrix.  The
              researchers intend to emphasize pinning of magnetic domain walls on larger
              voids, non-magnetic inclusions, and regions of high localized stress.

This
              cooperative work will involve comparing theoretical model calculations with
              experimental data measured on iron and nickel based alloys.  Results should
              provide a more complete theoretical framework for the description of magnetic
              properties of materials, i.e., hysteresis curve modeling, thereby improving our
              understanding of microstructural effects on magnetic properties.  If
              successful, findings may be applied in magnetic nondestructive evaluation
              methods, an area of broad interest in materials research and
              engineering.

This project in theoretical materials research fulfills the
              program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the
              United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share
              research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
