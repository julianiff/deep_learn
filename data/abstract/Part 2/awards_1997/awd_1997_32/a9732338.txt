Abstract    :
              The REU in Industrial Mathematics and Statistics at WPI focuses  on mathematics
              and statistics applied to industrial problems.   Teams of 2 - 4 students will
              work for eight weeks on problems  that come from businesses and industries that
              have collaborated  in the past years with the Center for Industrial Mathematics
              and  Statistics (see the Center's web page http://www.wpt.edu/~cims).    The
              students will work closely with a company representative who  will introduce
              the problem and help guide their work toward a  solution that the company can
              really use.  They will also work  closely with a faculty advisor to maintain a
              focus on the  mathematical issues at the core of the problem.  Organized visits
               to each of the sponsoring companies will give the students the  dimension of
              the importance of their project by learning more  about the range of problems
              facing the companies.  In addition  there will be presentations and discussion
              sessions with  mathematicians working in industry.    The whole experience is
              designed to provide the students with a  glimpse of the ways that advanced
              mathematics is used to solve  real-world problems.  The projects will help
              develop some of the  skills in communication and teamwork that are crucial for
              success  in a nonacademic environment.    Each participant will receive a
              stipend of $ 2400 and university  housing.  A travel stipend of up to $ 400
              will be available as  needed.
