Abstract    :
              ***  9732622  Bartlett  The JILA (formerly Joint Institute of Laboratory 
              Astrophysics) and the Department of Physics will conduct a  summer "Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates" program  introducing 14 undergraduates to
              active, on-going research.  The 19 participating faculty are well-recognized 
              contributors to the fields of Atomic, Molecular and Optical  Physics,
              Gravitational and Geophysics, Condensed Matter  Physics, Elementary Particle
              Physics, and Nuclear Physics.  Approximately 60% of the students will be
              selected from  colleges and universities in Colorado and the contiguous 
              states; 40% will come from the University of Colorado.  Special efforts will be
              made to solicit applications from  minorities.  ***
