Abstract    :
                9732152    This REU Site at the Medical University of South Carolina  provides
              opportunities for undergraduate students to become  involved in research on
              cellular signal transduction.  Students will have opportunities to use a
              variety of  biological, chemical and biophysical approaches to study  cell
              signaling events including signaling molecules and  their receptors functions,
              of surface receptors, signal  transduction pathways, and signaling in
              development and cell  differentiation. The approaches and structural tools used
              in  the research projects of the mentor faculty include DNA and  protein
              sequencing, peptide synthesis and purification,  oligonucleotide synthesis,
              molecular imaging, mass  spectrometry, NMR spectrometry, light spectroscopies, 
              bimolecular computing and organic synthesis. In addition to  the 10-week
              research projects, activities including  seminars, a journal club and social
              functions are designed  to stimulate student-faculty interaction and student 
              communication. The REU Site builds upon MUSC's strong  continued commitment to
              research training, demonstrated by  provision of supplies, personnel costs, and
              two additional  student stipends to the program.
