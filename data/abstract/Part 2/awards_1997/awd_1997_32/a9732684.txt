Abstract    :
              This request for a Small Grant for Exploratory Research  proposes an initial
              series of studies for the development of  an implicit solvent model (ISM) for
              use with molecular  dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations on large molecular 
              systems.  The objective of the proposed ISM is to  incorporate the description
              of bulk solvent effects and an  accounting of the macromolecule's
              microenvironment into the  empirical potential function describing the system. 
              With  the increase in compute-power and the availability of many  different
              simulation algorithms, it becomes possible to  attempt simulations on
              biological systems of the realistic  size.  However, these simulations must
              include satisfactory  consideration of the solvent environment in practicable 
              computing times.  The proposed ISM should achieve this goal  by eliminating the
              need to include a large number of  explicit solvent molecules in the simulated
              system.
