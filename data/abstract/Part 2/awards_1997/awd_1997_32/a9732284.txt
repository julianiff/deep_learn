Abstract    :
                  9732284  Irlandi      The  University of Miami, Rosenstiel School  of 
              Marine  and  Atmospheric   Science  (RSMAS),  Center   for   Marine   and 
              Environmental  Analyses  (CMEA) is establishing  a  Research  Experiences  for
              Undergraduates Site focused on  science  in  support  of  management of south
              Florida coastal  resources.  This  project will develop a three-year program 
              (1998-2000)  of summer research experiences involving eight undergraduate 
              interns  per year, with emphasis on (but not restricted  to)  recruitment   of 
               students  from  Historially   Black   and  Historically Minority Colleges and
              Universities  (HBCUs  and  HMCUs).  Participants will assist research mentors
              from CMEA  in laboratory and field work, as well as develop and execute  an 
              independent  research project  with  the  direction  and  guidance  of their
              mentor. Participants will be involved  in  projects ranging from the effects of
              anthropogenic stressors  on   the   status  and  health  of  coral  reefs,  
              seagrass  ecosystems,  and  fishery resources to  the  integration  of  science
               and management.   On-site field trips to management  agencies will also be
              made to heighten the awareness of  the  type  of research needed for effective
              management of coastal  resources,  as  well  as to introduce participants  to 
              non-  academic career options.
