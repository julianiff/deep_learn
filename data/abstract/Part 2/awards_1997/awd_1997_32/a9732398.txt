Abstract    :
              For the past several decades, the United States and Japan have been sharing
              information and technologies on ways to mitigate the effects of earthquakes on
              a variety of facilities.  One group of facilities which has received
              considerable attention in recent years has been lifelines.  Both governments
              recognize the importance of these systems after earthquakes and also
              acknowledge their extreme vulnerability to earthquakes.  As a result,
              researchers have been encouraged to identify new and better approaches for
              seismic evaluation, design and construction.  Special attention has been given
              to existing lifeline facilities.  This project is to organize and hold the
              Seventh U.S.-Japan Workshop on Earthquake Disaster Prevention for Lifeline
              Systems.  In continuing the previous tradition of alternating the location of
              the workshop site, this seventh workshop will beheld in Seattle, Washington in
              November of 1997.  This workshop is significant that will enable researchers to
              present detailed study findings from the January 17, 1994 Northridge, and
              January 17, 1995, Kobe earthquakes.  This project is an activity under the
              amspices of U.S.-Japan Natural Resources (UJNR) Program.  The National
              Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) costs share 50% of funds required
              for this workshop.
