Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    OPP-9732051  HINKEL, KENNETH  UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI    The
              project will gather, organize, and make available to a wide research community
              an international set of data on the thickness of the seasonal active thaw layer
              of the permafrost zone throughout the Arctic.  The project is part of a
              multidisciplinary project that addresses the impact of global change on
              land-atmosphere-ice interactions (LAII) in the Arctic.  The dynamics of the
              circumarctic thaw layer is partly a function of the air temperature and,
              therefore, may serve as a harbinger of global change as temperatures rise in
              response to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide.  The full circumarctic
              dataset will provide the wide coverage necessary to resolve small-scale
              anomalies and regional variability that, if studied alone, would yield
              incorrect interpretations of temporal trends in thaw depth due to regional
              climatic trends.  The results of this project will be used in combination with
              those of other LAII projects to determine the regional impacts of global change
              on terrestrial systems throughout the Arctic.
