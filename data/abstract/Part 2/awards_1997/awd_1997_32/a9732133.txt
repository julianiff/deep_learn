This work consists of a series of experimental studies to
              determine both energy positions and transition matrix elements for alkali
              atoms.   Energy values will be determined from the locations of the scattering
              resonances and matrix elements from the locations of the zeros in the
              weak-field amplitude for scattering of light from the atoms.
