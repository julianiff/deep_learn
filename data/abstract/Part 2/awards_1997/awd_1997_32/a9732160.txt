Using two new, unique experimental techniques developed at
              JPL/Caltech, low-energy and ultra-low energy electron attachment will be
              studied in several atomic and molecular systems.  The aim of this project is to
              explore the threshold behavior of dissociative attachment and to examine
              resonance structure very close to vibrational thresholds.
