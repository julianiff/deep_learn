Abstract    :
                      9732233  Birkland  This research seeks to understand through empirical
              study the  factors that contribute to variation in state roles in mitigating 
              losses from and preparing for disasters.  Particular attention  will be paid to
              the diffusion of lessons among states that have  been learned about the
              effective action in the aftermath of  recent major disasters.  These concern
              the adoption of land-use  planning, building practices, and preparedness
              legislation that  stem from major disasters.  The research is both quantitative
              and  qualitative, with a 50-state data set to be constructed to  isolate
              determinants of improved policy, followed by a more  detailed qualitative study
              of disaster policy making in a sample  of states.  ***
