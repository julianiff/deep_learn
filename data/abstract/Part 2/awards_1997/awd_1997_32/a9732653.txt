Abstract    :
                9732653  Hsaio    The main objective of the proposed research is to explore
              several  fundamental issues of polymer melt crystallization, which include 
              early stages of phase transformation, secondary crystallization  and
              deformation-induced crystallization.  The rationale for the  proposed study is
              as follows.  It is now firmly established that,  in polymer melt, long-chain
              molecules can crystallize into a two-  phase structure with periodic
              arrangement of lamellae and  amorphous interlayers under quiescent and flow
              conditions.  Although the kinetics of the process can be understood with 
              nucleation and growth theories, the mechanism of forming a two-  phase
              structure at short and long time scales under these  conditions, requires
              further clarification.  The proposed  research is intended to systematically
              study the fundamental  behavior of melt crystallization in polymers with
              different  molecular architecture, chain stiffness, molecular weight and  chain
              branching using several advanced characterization  techniques including
              time-resolved simultaneous synchrotron  SAXS/WAXD, microscopy, light scattering
              and thermal analysis.  %%%  The significance of this work lies in the probable
              universal  behavior of the phase transformation during melt crystallization, 
              in the enormous multiplicity of macromolecules, that is yet to be  completely
              understood.  With the proposed study, an in-depth  understanding about the
              subject may be obtained.  This can  significantly improve the ability to
              correlate the structure,  morphology, process and property relationships in the
               applications of crystalline polymers.  ***
