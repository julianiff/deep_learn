              Proposal Number:  ECS-9732958  Principle Investigator: Donnell Walton    Title:
              CAREER: Novel diode-pumped fiber laser    Abstract         The proposed
              research will investigate a double-cladding ytterbium-doped silicate fiber
              lasers at 980 nm wavelength and an upconversion-pumped thulium-doped fluoride
              fiber laser near 800 nm. The former fiber laser is an alternative laser source
              for pump the Pr:doped fiber amplifiers at 1300 nm whereas the latter
              upconversion-pumped laser can cover a wide range of wavelength from UV to IR.  
               This proposal is recommended for an CAREER award of $200,000 over 48 months.
