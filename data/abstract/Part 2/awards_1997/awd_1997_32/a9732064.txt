Abstract    :
              9732064  Christensen         This Research Experience for Undergraduataes (REU)
              Site grant  will support a minimum of eight undergraduate research assistants 
              in Solid Earth Geophysics for each of the next three summers.  The  program
              will give undergraduates majoring in geology, geophysics,  physics, and closely
              related disciplines, experience in the types  of research conducted at the
              Geophysical Institute.  The program  objective is to acquaint undergraduates
              with the exciting research  opportunities in the various fields of geophysics
              concentrating on  seismology, volcanology, geochronology, geochemistry, 
              paleomagnetics, geodesy, tectonics, glaciers and sea ice, and  remote sensing,
              and encouraging the undergraduates to go on to  graduate school in these or
              other scientific areas.  Women and  minorities will be particularly encouraged
              to apply.  ***
