The main aim of this project is to develop a rigorous
              approach to inhomogeneous cosmology on a wide variety of possible spacetime
              manifolds and with a variety of physically interesting matter sources and to
              investigate potential applications of this theory.  As a first step Vincent
              Moncrief plans to complete his investigations of the long-time existence of
              large families of inhomogeneous, non-symmetric, vacuum spacetimes which explode
              from a big bang singularity in the past and expand to infinite volume in the
              future.  These spacetimes, though representing certain sufficiently small
              (though fully non-linear) perturbations of known reference solutions, can have
              arbitrarily large spacetime curvatures in the early stages of expansion.  The
              next step will be to include a variety of interesting matter sources in the
              analysis and attempt to extend the long-time-existence results to non-vacuum
              solutions containing, e.g., electromagnetic and Yang-Mills fields, perfect and
              Vlasov fluids and perhaps imperfect fluids of stable-causal type.

This
              research will clarify the foundations of modern gravitation theory and
              cosmology.
