Abstract    :
              HRD-9732790  Kress    The Smithsonian Institution proposal is designed to
              prepared talented undergraduate  students for research careers in the natural
              history sciences.  The primary strategy is  via an intensive summer experience
              entitled  National Museum of Natural History  Research Training Program , which
              is centered on guided research in systematic  biology and natural history., 
              The standard summer ten-week program focuses on a  research project guided by a
              research advisor who is one of over 100 Ph.D. level  scientists on staff at the
              Smithsonian.  Specifically, the student participant in  conjunction with the
              research advisor, develops and tests a scientific hypothesis  employing
              appropriate techniques, and communicates the results in written  manuscripts
              and oral presentations.  Field trips, discussions, lectures, demonstration  and
              tours provide a broad and balanced view of natural history careers in the
              program  protocol.   In addition, while in residence, all participants are
              fully integrated into the  Smithsonian, including interaction with their peers,
              research advisors, and staff  scientists.    The Smithsonian has a very
              successful track record in operating a summer program in  natural history and
              systematic biology.  Therefore, it is expected to be successful in  encouraging
              underrepresented minorities to pursue careers in these life science fields.
