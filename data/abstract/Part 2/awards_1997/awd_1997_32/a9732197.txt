Abstract    :
                    This proposal is a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site. 
              Undergraduate students will conduct research for six weeks on the Matanuska
              Glacier, a large valley glacier in south central Alaska.  The glacier's
              terminus is easily accessible from the Glenn Highway.  Students will stay at
              the Matanuska Glacier Research Camp, about two kilometers from the glacier's
              terminus.  The Camp is maintained by the Cold Regions Research and Engineering
              Laboratory which also sponsors some of the ongoing research.  Students will
              participate in field work that will involve collecting water samples,
              maintaining equipment, downloading data, filtering water for suspended
              sediment, and tabulating data.  Each student will identify a research project
              to which he/she will devote several hours a day.  Directed research projects
              may be in subdisciplines of glacial geology, sedimentology, glaciohydrology, or
              hydrogeology.  The faculty associates will supervise the students' research to
              ensure appropriate projects are defined and that the students are able to
              collect the necessary information.  Students will be expected to complete their
              undergraduate thesis projects at the respective home institutions during the
              subsequent school year and will be encouraged to present the results at a
              national meeting.
