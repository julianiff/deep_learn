  We plan to study some problems in (a)
              dynamical systems,(b) geometry,and
(c) partial differential equations.For
              (a),building on some recent 
research,we are using variational methods to
              construct a variety of 
homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits for Hamiltonian
              systems on the 
2-torus and also on the n-torus when an additional symmetry is
              present.
Some analogous questions are being pursued for (b) when minimal
              geodesics 
heteroclinic to a pair of periodic geodesics on the n-torus are
              being 
sought.Another problem of interest for (a) is the existence of
              homoclinic 
solutions for Hamiltonian systems which possess singular
              potentials, 
especially when the dimension of the configuration space is
              greater
than two.Lastly for (c),there has been some recent progress by Craig
              
and Wayne and by Bourgain on the existence of small amplitude periodic
              
solutions for nonlinear wave equations.We are interested in whether
              
variational tools can be employed to obtain large amplitude solutions 
in
              such settings.

  Dynamical systems and partial differential equations are
              used to model 
continuous phenonena arising in science,engineering,economics
              and many 
other fields.Of considerable interest are solutions of such
              equations that 
exist for all values of the time variable.Aside from
              equilibria,i.e. time 
independent solutions,the simplest solutions of this
              type are periodic 
ones.Periodic solutions return to their original state
              after one time 
period.The next simplest class of global in time solutions are
              so-called 
heteroclinic solutions which in the simplest cases will approach a
              pair of 
different equilibria or time periodic solutions as time goes forward
              or 
backward to infinity.(When the limit states are the same,the solutions are
              
called homoclinics).Our research involves developing methods to find
              
heteroclinic and homoclinic solutions for dynamical systems and finding
              
periodic solutions for some special classes of partial differential
              
equations.
