Abstract    :
                This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry
              Program, focuses on the study of fundamentals of reactive  collisions and
              soft-landing of polyatomic ions at surfaces.   Professor Cooks and his students
              at Purdue University will contrast  soft-landed ions at self-assembled
              monolayers with landing into  vacuum-compatible liquid films.  The functional
              groups available  for reaction with impinging polyatomic ions at both of these 
              surfaces will be varied to control the properties of the reaction  products
              produced by these collisions.  New multi-quadrupole  instrumentation will be
              built and used in conjunction with existing  multi-sector mass spectrometry
              instrumentation in pursuing this  work.  This project will provide a strong
              educational experience  for students in the areas of mass spectrometry and
              surface science.  The nature of chemical reactions that occur at surfaces
              involving  projected polyatomic ion reactants remains poorly understood.  
              Professor Cooks and his students at Purdue University will study  the chemical
              reactions occurring between these polyatomic ions and  a range of surfaces that
              exhibit diverse chemical properties.  The  long-term objective of this work is
              to develop new methods for the  characterization of chemical reactions that
              occur at surfaces and  to produce surfaces that have desired chemical features.
               The  results of this work will have technological value in applications  that
              depend on having surfaces with controlled chemical and  physical properties.
