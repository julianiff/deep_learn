Abstract    :
              Arun Yethirraj is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational
              Chemistry Program to continue his research on static and   dynamic properties
              of polyelectrolyte solutions.  A combination of liquid   state theory and
              computer simulations will be used to investigate the   conformational
              properties, static structure, self diffusion, and   viscosity of
              polyelectrolyte solutions.  Monte Carlo simulations will be   used to
              investigate the effect of solvent, chain branching, and charge   sequence
              distribution on the polymer properties and to analyze neutron   scattering data
              on DNA and sodium polystyrene sulphonate.  Brownian   dynamics will be used to
              study the kinetics of the collapse transition in   polyelectrolyte chains, and
              to test various models for the dynamic form   factors used in the analysis of
              experimental neutron diffraction data.    Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics
              simulations will also be used to   investigate the anomalous behavior of
              intrinsic viscosity.  Polyelectrolytes have a wide range of technological uses:
              as processing   aids such as flocculants, dewatering agents, demulsifiers, and
              drag   reduction agents; as additives in detergents and cosmetics; and in the  
              manufacture of membranes, ion-exchange resins, gels, and modified   plastics. 
              The study of polyelectrolytes therefore spans diverse areas   such as
              biomedicine, wastewater treatment, separations, colloid science,   and
              petroleum recovery.  The behavior of polyelectrolytes, however, is   far from
              well understood, and Yethiraj's research will help in obtaining   a molecular
              level understanding of these systems.
