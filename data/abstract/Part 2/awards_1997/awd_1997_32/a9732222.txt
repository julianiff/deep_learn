Abstract    :
              9732222  Jiracek         The SAGE (Summer of Applied Geophysical Experience)
              program  gives upper class undergraduate and graduate students an intensive 
              field-based geophysical research experience using modern  geophysical
              techniques to study significant geophysical problems.   Since the beginning in
              1983, 370 undergraduate and graduate  students have participated in hands-on
              geophysical research into  the tectonics of the Rio Grande rift using the
              methods of seismic  reflection and refraction, gravity, magnetics, electrical 
              resistivity, and electromagnetics.  Recently students have also  engaged in the
              geophysical characterization of material disposal  sites at Los Alamos National
              Laboratory (LANL) and of a groundwater  basin in New Mexico.  NSF-supported
              Research Experience for  Undergraduates (REU) students from large and small
              schools alike  share the excitement of SAGE.  Students participate in every
              phase  of the field program:  they collect data with the most advanced 
              equipment, they process and interpret the data with work stations  and PCs, and
              they present their results in both oral and written  form.  The interaction
              between the students and faculty at SAGE is  especially close in an environment
              approaching that of co-workers.  ***
