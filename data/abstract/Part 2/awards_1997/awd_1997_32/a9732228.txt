Abstract    :
              We will continue to operate a research site for undergraduates at  Mount Holyoke
              College. Each summer for the years 1998 through  2000 we will engage ten
              students drawn from U.S. colleges and  universities in mathematical research.
              The students will work in  groups of five, each group carrying out a different
              project under  the supervision of a faculty member.  The projects will involve 
              extensive computer experimentation and be directed at mainstream  areas of
              mathematical research in which experimental evidence  promises to illuminate,
              and possibly even overcome, current  impasses in purely theoretical attacks.
              The groups will meet  separately several times a day but ample opportunity will
              be  provided for students in different groups to exchange ideas. The  projects
              for 1998 are codes and Kloosterman sums (Davidoff) and  polynomial
              representations of knots (Durfee).
