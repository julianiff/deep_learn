Abstract    :
              Abstract  9505823  Rosenberg  The University of Maryland will continue their
              studies of the high magnetic latitude ionosphere and magnetosphere using
              galactic radio noise absorption techniques (riometry).  Several years ago, they
              developed a new imaging riometer (IRIS) which allows the study of auroral
              morphology during daylight and through clouds.  These imaging riometers are now
              being operated at Iqaluit, Canada; Sondestromfjord, Greenland; South Pole,
              McMurdo and in all six of the Automatic Geophysical Observatories (AGO)
              operated by NSF in Antarctica.  Additionally, they are operating broad beam
              riometers at Iqaluit, McMurdo and South Pole as well as auroral photometers at
              McMurdo and South Pole.  They have also provided imaging riometers for the
              British Halley Bay and the Australian Davis stations, both in Antarctica, thus
              considerably extending coverage.  In the next few years they will also build
              imaging riometers systems for some of the British AGOs.  The instruments work
              synergistically with a number of other instruments which are operated at all of
              these sites by other investigators.    ***
