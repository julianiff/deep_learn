Abstract    :
              9732601  Murphy, Robin  Core, Karen  Colorado School of Mines    REU:  Multiple
              Autonomous Robots for Search and Rescue Applications    This Research
              Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site project supports eight students per
              year in programs carried out during the summers, for two years.  The students
              will work on projects involving coordination and control of multiple
              heterogeneous robots for urban search and rescue applications.  Activities
              include development of technical skills, development of interdisciplinary
              problem solving skills, and on professional and personal development.  The
              project targets women and minority students at bot CSM and at traditional
              minority institutions.    The participants work both individually and in
              groups.  The results will include construction and programming of eight small
              robots operating under central control and then modification and programming of
              two existing robots for the rapid deployment of a small inspection robot by the
              larger robot at the scene of a disaster, and subsequent intelligent control and
              observation by the larger robot.
