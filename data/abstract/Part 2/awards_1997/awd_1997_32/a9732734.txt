Abstract    :
              Gromov  9732734    The investigator organizes an international conference  at
              Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques to study  pattern formation in
              biology, mathematics, and computer graphics.    Collaborations will lead to new
              tools for analyzing,  computing, and visualizing patterns.      Symmetry and
              structure arise often in nature,  and their presence is often betrayed by
              patterns.    Mathematicians, biologists, and computer scientists  approach
              these common problems from different perspectives.    One goal of the
              conference is to stimulate synergistic interchanges  about these problems 
              between these different disciplines.    The conference aims to foster a greater
              understanding of  patterns, their significance in biological areas, and  how
              they can be handled mathematically and computationally.
