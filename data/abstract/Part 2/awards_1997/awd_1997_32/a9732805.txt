Abstract    :
              9732805  Lusztig    This award supports the continued study of periodic W-graphs
              attached to affine Hecke algebras and the investigation of their possible
              connections with unrestricted representations of semisimple Lie algebras in
              positive characteristic.  The principal investigator will also study canonical
              bases of quantized enveloping algebras from the point of view of perverse
              sheaves.  He will continue the study of unipotent representations of semisimple
              p-adic groups, as well as character sheaves on (possibly disconnected)
              reductive groups.    Representation theory of Lie algebras and Lie groups,
              initially developed at the turn of the century, studies the structure of
              symmetries and their realizations.  This theory encompasses many areas in
              mathematics and has fundamental applications to theoretical physics.  In the
              past twenty years, the study of representation theory of a special class of
              affine Lie algebras and Lie groups led to many new unexpected discoveries in
              mathematics and theoretical physics, as well as to a synthesis of many
              established areas in both disciplines.  In particular, it yielded a pure
              mathematical description of a simplest quantum field theory -- a prototype
              theory of fundamental interactions.  It is expected that representation theory
              of new classes of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and groups might
              substantially deepen our understanding of mathematics and theoretical physics
              during the next decade.
