Abstract    :
                                                    9732316  Cuhel    The  Research 
              Experience for Undergraduates (REU)  Site  at  the  University  of 
              Wisconsin-Milwaukee's  Center  For  Great   Lakes  Studies  (CGLS)  provides
              environmental aquatic science  research  training    for   10   students   per 
               year   in   a   cohesive,  multidisciplinary environment.  Students interested
              in chemistry,  geology,  and biology of lake and ocean settings are paired 
              with  mentors supervising active research laboratories.  Together  they  will 
              develop  a program of study compatible with  the  advisor's  interests  and 
              capabilities within one of the  interdisciplinary  research programs active at
              CGLS.  After an introduction to  CGLS  and  a  day of open Lake Michigan
              sampling experience aboard  the  research  vessel  R/V NEESKAY, they will begin
              a combined  field,  laboratory,  and  library investigation with  increasing 
              student  self-reliance.   Teams  of students working  within  an  umbrella 
              project  will learn the essential nature of collaborative  effort  and  the
              reward of applying their individual skills to accomplish  collective  goals.  
              Regularly  scheduled  student  and   faculty  interactions  at  both  formal 
              and  informal  levels   will   be  available.   Workshops on instrumentation, 
              graduate  school  and  career opportunities, writing and public presentation of
              results,  and  related topics will be offered.  At the close of the 10-week 
              session,  each of the students will present a poster,  a5  minute  oral talk
              describing their work to a public audience, and a short  but detailed paper in
              the format of a typical journal article.
