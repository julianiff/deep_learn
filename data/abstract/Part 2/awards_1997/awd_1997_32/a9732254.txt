Abstract    :
              This REU Site, operated by the Graduate Program in Nutrition, offers
              undergraduate students research experience in the biology and chemistry of
              nutritional processes.  This experiential-learning program builds on the
              commitment and capabilities of 15 faculty members who will serve as mentors for
              the students.  A 10-week summer program aims to immerse students in the
              excitement of scientific inquiry and to provide knowledge of approaches,
              techniques and critical thinking skills used in research; practice and
              improvement in communication skills; and guidance in planning graduate programs
              and careers.  Participants will include minority students and students from
              institutions without broad research activities, as well as students from Penn
              State.  Communications between each student, his or her mentor, and the program
              director will be established before the student arrives at the University Park
              campus and will continue after the student returns to his or her home campus. 
              Working with a team including a faculty mentor and a graduate student or other
              staff member, each undergraduate student will design a research project that
              can be completed successfully within the summer time period.  Students also
              will attend special seminars on improving scientific-communication skills, both
              written and oral.  Social events will complement the scientific community
              developed within the mentors' laboratories.  All students will participate in a
              Career Opportunities Workshop that explores the merits and means of obtaining a
              M.S. and/or Ph.D. degree.  The summer will culminate in a research symposium
              attended by faculty, staff, and students.
