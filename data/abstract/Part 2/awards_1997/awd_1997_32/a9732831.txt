Abstract    :
              9732831  English       This grant provides funding for the development of an
              effective and efficient framework for the quality monitoring and control of
              processes generating time dependent data common to the process industries
              (i.e., chemical processes). First, the empirical covariation chart will be
              analytically developed, and its performance potential will be evaluated.
              Second, the interface between statistical process control (SPC) and automatic
              process control will be further exploited beyond what is found in the
              literature.  Third, other new and existing SPC approaches will be evaluated in
              the context of a new process disturbance paradigm unique to time dependent
              data.  Fourth, the recursive discrete time Kalman filter (RDTKF) will be
              modified and evaluated for application in this scenario.       If successful,
              this project will provide a cohesive design of tools for quality monitoring and
              control for the process industries.  The resulting framework should be suitable
              for application in many manufacturing processes and will be well tested based
              upon analytical and simulation results.  Scenario specific strengths and
              weaknesses will be documented within the tasks of the research agenda.  The
              impact of the research will be realized through the dissemination of findings
              in scholarly journals and applications within various industries.
