Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT    Hendrik Lenstra  Berkeley  9732709     Professor Lenstra will
              study a collection of problems in algorithmetic number theory, algebraic number
              theory, and algebraic geometry. Topics to be studied include smooth numbers,
              Mersenne primes, Galois groups of local fields, Belyi functions, Lacunary
              polynomials, and polynomials over finite fields.     Number theory is one of
              the oldest branches of mathematics.  It is the study of the natural numbers,
              the basic numbers of counting.  From the very beginning of the area, there has
              been a gap between what was known to be possible for all numbers, and what
              could actually be done for a specific one.  For example, it is known that any
              natural number can be factored in only one way as the product of smaller
              unfactorable numbers.  Yet given a carefully chosen large number, it can be so
              difficult to factor into parts that scientists have developed secure codes
              based on factorization.  This project is devoted to improving the methods we
              have for actually computing some of the most important mathematical properties
              of particular numbers.  In the computer age, the potential applications for
              improved methods of computation go well beyond mathematics and science and into
              everyday life.
