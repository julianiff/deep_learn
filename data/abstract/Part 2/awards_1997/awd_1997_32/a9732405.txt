Abstract    :
              9732405  Datye    The University of New Mexico will continue a Research
              Experience  for Undergraduates (REU) site in its Center for Microengineered 
              Materials. Undergraduate students will be recruited from colleges  and
              universities that offer degrees in chemistry, chemical  engineering, materials
              science and ceramics.  Students will  participate in interdisciplinary research
              projects on advanced  materials, including sol-gel synthesis, thin films, 
              microfabrication of electronic materials, catalysts and  adsorbents, and vapor
              phase synthesis.  In addition, REU  participants will give presentations on
              their work and will visit  the national labs and nearby industries that are
              partners with  the Center.  %%%  The interdisciplinary nature of the research
              projects and close  liaison with industry and national laboratory associates
              will  provide a valuable experience to the undergraduate students 
              participating in the program.  ***
