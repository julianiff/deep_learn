Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    OPP-9732281  HOBBIE, JOHN  MARINE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY    The
              project will investigate the relationship between global change induced by
              increased atmospheric carbon dioxide and tundra ecology as part of a
              multidisciplinary project that addresses the impact of global change on
              land-atmosphere-ice interactions (LAII) in the Arctic.  The role of ecosystems
              in affecting changes in the atmospheric and terrestrial carbon budgets will be
              examined in order to understand the processes responsible for carbon release or
              storage by tundra and cold biogenic-rich soils.  The information learned about
              carbon storage and release will be used in models that simulate ecosystem
              processes so that future carbon budgets in the Arctic under increased
              atmospheric carbon dioxide budget conditions may be estimated.  The results of
              this project will be used in combination with those of other LAII projects,
              especially regional and global scale model simulations, to determine regional
              impacts of global change on terrestrial ecosystems throughout the Arctic.
