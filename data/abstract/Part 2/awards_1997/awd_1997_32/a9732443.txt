Abstract    :
              This study focuses on the behavior of simple quantal systems whose classical
              counterparts are chaotic.  Further experiments on the sharp, strong-field
              resonances between adjacent Stark substates of excited hydrogen atoms driven by
              a superimposed linearly polarized microwave field and a static electric field
              will be pursued.  Basic knowledge from spectroscopy measurements on these
              states will be used to develop an n-tomograph for measuring the n-distribution
              of atoms having an unknown mixture of n-levels.   Finally, comparison will be
              made between two-dimensional electromagnetic cavities and of quantal billiards
              having the same shape.
