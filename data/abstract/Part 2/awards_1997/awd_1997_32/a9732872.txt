Abstract    :
              This research focuses on a computational analysis of the barrierless   reactions
              of transient carbenes and biradicals.   Computational   approaches to tunneling
              and entropy controlled reactions will be examined   with a specific emphasis on
              developing the theoretical underpinning   needed to predict product ratios.  
              Undergraduate students involved in   the research will be introduced to modern
              computational approaches to   chemical dynamics and semi-empirical electronic
              structure theory.  With this Standard Grant, the Organic and Macromolecular
              Chemistry   Program supports the research and educational activities of Dr.
              Charles   Doubleday of the Department of Chemistry at Columbia University.  
              Dr.   Doubleday will focus his research efforts on the theoretical analysis of 
               the reaction dynamics of carbenes and biradicals.   Although implicated   as
              intermediates in a number of organic transformations, in most cases   these
              species can not be observed experimentally because of their short   lifetimes. 
                Computational methods capable of treating these barrierless   organic
              reactions will be developed and tested through the prediction of   reaction
              product ratios.   Dr. Doubleday's educational activities will   include
              introducing undergraduates to the development and testing of   modern
              computational approaches to chemical dynamics.
