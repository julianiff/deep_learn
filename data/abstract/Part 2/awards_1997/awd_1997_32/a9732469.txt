Abstract    :
                This agenda-setting workshop responds to recent renewed interest in the
              geographies of children and youth.  This interest stems from a more critical
              perspective on what constitutes childhood and youth, with specific focus on how
              the production of space disenfranchises and marginalizes children and youth in
              contemporary urban society.  Additional concerns to be addressed by the
              workshop include how children embrace identity politics and create space, how
              childhood is commodified and exploited, and how symbols between adults and
              youths are being homogenized.  The workshop will bring together international
              scholars from a broad range of disciplines to discuss and probe this topic with
              the intent of identifying a focused research agenda for the near (ca. 5-10 yrs)
              future.  This is an exciting, emerging, and potentially important area of
              research in Geography, and it shares similarities with other investigations
              focusing on the importance of spatiality to issues of race, class, ethnicity,
              gender, diversity, and physical disability.  This workshop on Young People's
              Geographies will explore these commonalities and thereby may yield added
              insight into a broad range of theoretical and empirical concerns within the
              discipline.  Moreover, the specific research area will undoubtedly lead to a
              deeper and nuanced appreciation for childhood and youth within modern urban
              environments, and this would be an essential contribution to contemporary
              political debates on public policy directed toward concerns of crime,
              parenthood, and the overall moral fiber of society
