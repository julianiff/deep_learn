              Title: Variability of Tropical Circulation and Climate    The study purposes to
              continue the research aimed at understanding  by empirical diagnostics the
              circulation mechanisms that are  operative in annual cycle, interannual
              variability, and decadal-  scale evolutions.  This work aims at the development
              of data sets  as OLR and CODS data sets and the 40 years NCEP/NCAR reanalysis 
              data.  The results from this research will provide valuable climate  prediction
              capabilities which will be of great use for many  countries critically
              dependent on climate.
