Abstract    :
              ***  9732626  Merritt  The University of Chicago Department of Physics will 
              continue to administer an REU site project, targeted  especially for women and
              minorities.  The overriding  objective of this project has been and continues
              to be to  encourage members of under-represented minority groups and  women to
              pursue careers in physics.  Applications are  solicited nationally from
              undergraduate programs in physics  and engineering with particular emphasis on
              historically  black colleges and traditional women's colleges and local 
              Chicago area and Midwestern colleges and universities.  The  core of the
              program for each student participant is a  research project under supervision
              of an individual faculty  member.  Each student is given specific, well defined
               research task that can be completed within the ten-week  duration of the
              program.  The research groups in which  projects are conducted are experimental
              for the most part,  but have included quite a few theoretical projects. 
              Typical  projects are distributed among the areas of high energy  physics,
              cosmic ray and space physics, astronomy and  astrophysics, general relativity,
              condensed matter physics,  optics and solar energy, and electron and ion
              microscopy.  ***
