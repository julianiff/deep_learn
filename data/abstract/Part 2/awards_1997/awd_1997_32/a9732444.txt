This work consists of a set of experiments that seek to
              approach the fundamental limits of resolution and accuracy in optical
              spectroscopy by making use of individually confined ions in purely electric rf
              traps.  Efforts will include improving ion trapping systems, developing better
              trapping technology, and exploring new ion candidates.  Results will have
              impact on applications in modern navigation and communication as well as on
              fundamental physical measurements.
