Abstract    :
              Proposal Number: ECS-9732940                                 Principal
              Investigator: Yang Zhao    Title: Development of Diode-Pumped Tunable
              Mid-Infrared Laser Using Co-Doped II-VI Crystals    This proposal describes a
              one-year activity in which the PI will conduct a preliminary investigation of a
              Co-doped ZnTe laser pumped by a low cost and reliable AlGaAs laser. The
              emission wavelength will be in the 3 to 4 micron range in the infrared region.
              The major advantage of this approach is the utilization of the high power and
              relatively low-cost AlGaAs pump laser.  If successful, this system will provide
              a compact, tunable source with good reliability. Potential applications include
              bio-sensing and pollution control.   It also has the potential to open up a new
              field of transition metal doped II-VI semiconductors as lasing media.
