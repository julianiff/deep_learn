Abstract    :
              ***  9732634  Halderson  Projects are proposed in two areas of nuclear theory. 
              The  first area concerns the interaction of nuclei with medium  energy
              electrons, mesons, and nucleons.  This investigation  provides information on
              the interaction mechanism between  these probes and the constituent nucleons,
              the behavior and  decay processes of nuclei at high excitation energy, and the 
              distribution of nucleons within nuclei.  The second area of research is
              hypernuclear physics.  Hypernuclei contain at least one baryon with non-zero 
              strangeness or charm.  Although their lifetimes are very  short, hypernuclei
              provide a laboratory for determining the  interaction of strange or charmed
              baryons with nucleons and  with each other.  These investigations will provide
              basic  information on the strong interaction at low energies.  In  addition, an
              understanding of these interactions will  provide predictions on the existence
              of exotic nuclei with  few or no protons and the strangeness content of neutron
               stars.  ***
