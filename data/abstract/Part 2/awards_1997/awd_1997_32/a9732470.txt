Abstract    :
              9732470  Ramesh    Risk is inevitable in management of technological
              innovations.  However, little information exists on the adoption of financial
              risk management techniques (such as valuation of "real options") to reflect
              managerial flexibility in R&D projects.  In the proposed research, the
              applicability of option pricing theory to real-world project management in the
              (recently deregulated) electric utility industry will be tested.  In
              particular, the real options methodologies developed by Dixit & Pindyck,
              Grenadier & Weiss and by Mitchell & Hamilton will be used to analyze selected
              electric utility industry innovation management problems.  A new real options
              methodology for evaluating R&D investment alternatives in the utility industry
              is proposed.  This proposed methodology consider factors unique to utility
              industry including the new competitive environment; the matured nature of
              technological and the danger of employee resistance to changes in work
              practices, which may be necessary for adoption of new technology.    A software
              package that implements this methodology will be developed.  Graduate courses
              and seminars based on this work for the interdisciplinary industry-oriented
              "energy markets" program will be introduced.  The findings and the methodology
              will also be adapted to other management of innovation situations.
