Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    OPP-9732105  OECHEL, WALTER  SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY    The
              project will utilize satellite, aircraft and ground-based measurements to
              examine gas and energy fluxes resulting from the interaction of global climate
              and arctic tundra systems.  The contribution of arctic tundra to global
              atmospheric carbon dioxide gas concentration will be determined in order to
              understand the role of arctic regions in global change.  Previous studies have
              shown that tundra can be either a source or sink of carbon dioxide in different
              seasons and different years.  This study will expand the earlier results from a
              single watershed to a circumpolar scale in order to understand the large-scale
              processes controlling carbon dioxide emission or uptake in the Arctic. 
              Knowledge of the processes is crucial to predicting whether the Arctic tundra
              regions will release more greenhouse gases if climate warms or if more carbon
              will be sequestered.  The field measurements and modeling results of this
              project will be used in combination with other land-atmosphere-ice interaction
              projects to determine the regional impacts of global change on or by
              terrestrial systems in the Arctic.
