Abstract    :
                SGER:  Supplementary monitoring of ENSO signals in the Eastern North Pacific 
              Robert Smith  To understand the effects of climate variability on marine life
              in the eastern North Pacific requires that we know what the oceanic environment
              is, how it is changing, and what the oceanic environment was in the past.  In
              recent weeks and months there has been mounting evidence of the onset of a
              major El Ni¹o in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean.  The relatively scarce
              observations from past El Ni¹o episodes show that the coastal ocean along the
              west coast of North America can be significantly affected, manifesting higher
              sea surface temperatures and coastal sea levels, lower primary and secondary
              productivity, a deeper thermocline, and enhanced poleward flow over the shelf. 
              However, the scant evidence, from different locations at different times, also
              suggests that the extent, intensity and nature of the effects may differ among
              different episodes.  The present onset of El Ni¹o, combined with the beginning
              of the GLOBEC Northeast Pacific Pilot Monitoring effort, provides a unique
              opportunity to gather a more complete data set.  We are currently funded as
              part of the GLOBEC pilot monitoring program.  This proposal seeks to initiate
              the GLOBEC pilot monitoring program along two transects off the central Oregon
              coast (44.6Ý and 43.2ÝN) in November 1997 several months earlier than planned,
              and to extend the monitoring in November 1977, February and August 1998 to
              include northern California sections (41.9ÝN and 38.7Ý N) where regular
              hydrographic sampling programs have existed in the past two decades.  This
              would augment five cruises in 1998 that will monitor the hydrography,
              subsurface currents derived from ADCP measurements, nutrients, chlorophyll, and
              zooplankton species composition and abundance.  If the present ENSO event
              becomes a full El Nino, occupations of these lines in November 1997, February
              and August 1998 would help determine the extent, duration, and evolution of the
              anomalous conditions.
