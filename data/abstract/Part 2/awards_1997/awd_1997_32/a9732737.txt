Abstract    :
              Abstract  9732737  Greene    This award to San Jose State University Foundation
              will provide instrumentation for Oceanographic Research for use on R/V Point
              Sur, a research vessel operated by Moss Landing Marine Labs as part of the
              University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.  Specific
              instruments to be acquired include a computer and computer components, a
              deionized water filtration system for scientific use, a portable liquid
              scintillation counter, and a bottom finding pinger.  The shared-use
              instrumentation supported here will assist marine scientists in conducting
              studies from R/V Point Sur in the eastern Pacific Ocean, in 1998 and in future
              years.
