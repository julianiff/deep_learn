This work consists of a set of theoretical and experimental
              investigations in the application of atomic coherence to quantum optics.  Three
              different areas will be explored, precision spectroscopy based on phase
              coherent media, an extension of lasing without inversion into the
              frequency-upconversion regime, and new studies of enhanced index of
              refraction.
