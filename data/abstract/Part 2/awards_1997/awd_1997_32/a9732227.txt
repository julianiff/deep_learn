The University of South Carolina will establish a
              Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in its Department of Chemical
              Engineering.  Undergraduate students will be recruited from universities and
              colleges in the Southeast, including minority institutions.  Students will
              participate in research on the theme of "Novel Materials for Power Sources", 
              including fuel cells, supercapacitors and electrode materials.  In addition,
              students  will attend weekly seminars and tours, and workshops on ethics in
              science and engineering and on graduate studies in chemical
              engineering.

The REU site, with a regional focus whereby high quality
              undergraduates will be recruited from the Southeast, and with and emphasis on
              underrepresented minorities in science and engineering, will provide a research
              experience on an emerging technology to students who would not normally have
              access to a research environment.
