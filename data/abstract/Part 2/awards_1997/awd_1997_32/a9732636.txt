This project investigates a number of issues and problems
              in classical and quantum relativity and, in particular, Einstein's theory of
              gravitation.  The following topics are addressed:

	Construction of a general
              theory of symmetry reduction in relativistic field theories.

	Investigation
              of the status of unitary dynamical evolution of quantum fields along arbitrary
              foliations of a fixed spacetime.

	Completion of a general theory of local
              cohomology (p-form conservation laws) which is tailored to relativistic field
              theory, including development of computational tools and detailed applications
              to the Einstein equations.

	Investigation of the status of curvature scalars
              as privileged canonical variables representing "many-fingered time" in the
              Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity.

	Further development and
              applications of a new approach to asymptotic conversation laws in gravitational
              field theory.

	Further development and applications of a parametrization of
              the jet space of vacuum metrics.

	Rigorous treatment of Dirac constraint
              quantization of spacetimes admitting two commuting Killing vector fields using
              the techniques of parametrized field theory.

	Development of a theory of
              path integrals in quantum gravity based upon results obtained using Ashtekar
              variables and canonical quantization.

The goal of work on these topics is to
              improve the state of knowledge regarding general relativity, gravitation, and
              quantum mechanics as well as the interaction of these branches of
              physics.
