Abstract    :
              9732302  Bachas    The University of Kentucky will continue a Research
              Experience  for Undergraduates (REU) site in its Center for Membrane  Sciences.
              Undergraduate students will be recruited from Kentucky  colleges and
              universities that serve the economically  underprivileged Appalachian regions
              of the state. Students will  participate in research addressing various aspects
              of polymeric  membrane materials and thin films. In addition, REU participants 
              will attend weekly seminars and will participate in regional  undergraduate
              research conferences.  %%%  The REU site, with a regional focus whereby
              undergraduates will  be recruited from the state of Kentucky, will provide a
              research  experience on an emerging technology to students who would not 
              normally have access to a research environment.  ***
