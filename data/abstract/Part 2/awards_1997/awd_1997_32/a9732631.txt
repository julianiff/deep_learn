This two-year award supports US-France cooperative research on
              the use of approximation theory and function theory for linear system
              identification and control.  It involves Edward Saff and Vilmos Totik at the
              University of South Florida and Laurent Baratchart at INRIA (French National
              Institute for Research in Informatics and Mathematics) in Sophia-Antipolis. 
              The researchers will collaborate on a newly proposed method for solving certain
              inverse problems for convolutions, namely singularity detection for two
              dimensional hybrid systems.  

The US researchers bring to this collaboration
              expertise in utilizing potential theoretical methods in application of
              problems.  This is complemented by French expertise in numerical approaches
              applied to theoretical problems.  The problems under investigation have a wide
              range of potential applications to fault detection and safety analysis, mine
              detection, echography and tomography.
