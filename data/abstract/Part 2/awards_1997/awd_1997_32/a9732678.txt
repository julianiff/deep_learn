Abstract    :
              9732678  Montgomery     In addition to being of basic fluid dynamical interest,
              the hurricane is a high impact weather phenomenon that continues to be a
              priority for basic meteorological research.  While considerable insight into
              the physics of tropical cyclones has been realized using axisymmetric theory
              and models, fundamental questions remain concerning the role of convective
              asymmetries in the tropical cyclone lifecycle and in other geophysical vortices
              as well.  Perhaps the most fundamental question is whether convective
              asymmetries enhance or hinder the vortex.  Under this award, the principal
              investigator will take a two-pronged approach in investigating the nonlinear
              dynamics of convective asymmetries in the near-core region of hurricanes.  The
              first thrust involves a theoretical investigation of the dynamical impact of
              outbreaks of cumulus convection on the larger-scale vortex circulation. 
              Determining the role that vortex Rossby wave and gravity-inertia waves play in
              modulating the mixing of convectively generated potential vorticity near the
              center of the vortex is the principal objective.  The second task involves an
              observational study using existing radar data to examine the kinematics and
              dynamics of vortex Rossby waves in hurricanes.  This part of the research will
              be done in collaboration with Dr. Marks of NOAA's Hurricane Research Division.
