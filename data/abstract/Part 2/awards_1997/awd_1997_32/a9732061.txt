Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at Iowa State University is hosting  a summer
              NSF-REU program which has scientific computing as it's  theme.  Scientific
              computing has become a powerful and essential  tool in conducting research in
              science and engineering.  The goal  of this program is to expose a small group
              of undergraduates to  research in an application area which uses scientific
              computing.   The program will be conducted for eight weeks during the summer 
              months.  To be eligible for participation in the program the  applicant must be
              a citizen or permanent resident of the United  States.  The participants should
              have at least the equivalent of  two years of calculus and come computing
              background.    Each participant will be involved in an ongoing research project
               which will include at least one faculty mentor, a graduate  student and two to
              three participants.  The research topics that  are proposed cover a wide range
              of aspects of scientific  computing such as modeling, grid generation,
              numerical  simulations, and visualization of simulations.  The projects will 
              give the participants an introduction to applications areas such  as
              computational biology, fluid dynamics, porous media flow,  modeling of chemical
              reactions, and superconductivity.  In  addition to the research project,
              participants will attend  workshops on the computational tools that will be
              needed to  complete their project as well as some topics in mathematics that 
              are not usually covered at the undergraduate level.  At the end  of the eight
              week period the students will write a paper which  will appear in the
              Department's preprint series and the students  will also give a multi-media
              presentation on their research  project.
