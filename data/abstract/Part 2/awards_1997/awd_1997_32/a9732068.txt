Abstract    :
              Computer programs to perform symbolic calculations to solve  mathematical,
              scientific, and engineering problems have become  popular and highly useful in
              the last decade.  However, systems  for symbolic computation in noncommutative
              algebras have not  attained the generality of systems for commutative algebra. 
              This  project develops a system for symbolic computation in Hopf  algebras, and
              supports algebras and Hopf algebras. The project  relies on multidisciplinary
              interaction between algebraists and  computer scientists. The Hopf system uses
              the GAP system as a  foundation upon which to build more advanced functions. 
              GAP is  freely distributed over the Internet, as is the Hopf system.  The  Hopf
              system is able to support advanced research in  noncommutative algebras and
              their applications to science,  especially mathematics and physics.
