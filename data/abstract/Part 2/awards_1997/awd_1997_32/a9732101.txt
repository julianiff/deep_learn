Abstract    :
              This project will mainly investigate arrangements of curves and surfaces. 
              Specifically, it will study
 Combinatorial and algorithmic problems related to
              substructures (lower envelopes, single cells, zones, levels, vertical
              decompositions, etc.) in arrangements of surfaces in higher
              dimensions.
Related algorithms in real algebraic geometry for computing
              connected components, stratifications and the dimension of real semi-algebraic
              sets.
Applications of these results to motion planning in robotics, to various
              visibility and intersection problems in computer graphics, to generalized
              Voronoi diagrams in higher dimensions, and to many geometric problems at
              large.
Combinatorial and algorithmic problems involving planar arrangements of
              segments or curves (also known as geometric graphs.)
