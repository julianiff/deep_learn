Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    OPP-9732076  WALKER, DONALD  UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO    The project
              will investigate the relationship between climate change, tundra ecosystem, and
              soil type as part of a multidisciplinary project that addresses the impact of
              global change on land-atmosphere-ice interactions (LAII) in the Arctic. 
              Regional scale variations in climate gradient and vegetation will be compared
              to soil type by producing circumarctic maps of vegetation from satellite
              imagery in combination with field work to verify vegetation and soil
              classifications.  The regional maps and climate models will be used to project
              the effects of a warming climate on the carbon cycle, exchanges of trace gas
              fluxes, water and energy, permafrost, and the hydrological cycle.  The results
              of this project will be used in combination with other LAII projects to
              determine the regional impacts of global change on terrestrial systems in the
              Arctic.
