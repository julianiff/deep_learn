This U.S.-Czech research project between Dr. Alexei
              Maradudin of the University of California-Irvine and Dr. Vladimir Kuzmiak of
              the Czech Institute of Radio Engineering and Electronics will examine: 1) the
              propagation of electromagnetic waves in dispersive and adsorptive periodic and
              randomly disordered systems and 2) magnetic field effects on photonic band
              structures of two- and three-dimensional periodic systems.  The researchers
              also intend to determine the properties of localized electromagnetic modes
              introduced by embedded defects characterized by frequency-dependent dielectric
              functions.  An additional component of their cooperative effort will feature
              the Anderson localization of electromagnetic waves in two-dimensional systems
              characterized by a randomly disordered dielectric function in the presence of
              dissipation.  Results are expected to reveal new features that expand potential
              applications for photonic crystals and build upon our fundamental knowledge of
              the nature of electromagnetic fields inside more complex structures.

This
              materials research project fulfills the program objective of advancing
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and
              Central Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in
              areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
