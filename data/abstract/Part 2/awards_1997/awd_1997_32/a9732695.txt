Abstract    :
              John Dickey  University of Minnesota    Dr. John Dickey will carry out a
              spectral line survey of the atomic hydrogen line near 21-cm wavelength from the
              4th quadrant of the Galaxy.  The survey will be conducted using radio astronomy
              facilities in Australia, and colleagues in Australia will collaborate with Dr.
              Dickey. This survey represents a great advance in angular resolution and
              sensitivity over existing data sets.  The observations should dramatically
              improve our understanding of the distribution and kinematics of the atomic gas
              component of our Galaxy.  Accompanying observations of the radio continuum
              emission should significantly advance our understanding of the detected ionized
              hydrogen regions, supernova remnants, and the Galactic magnetic field
              structure.
