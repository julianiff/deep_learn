Abstract    :
              9732416  McCoy         The goal of the National Museum of Natural History
              research  Training Program at the Smithsonian Institution is to prepare 
              talented undergraduates for research careers in natural history.   This is
              accomplished by means of an intensive summer program  centered on guided
              research experiences in natural history.  The  Research Training Program has
              developed a highly regarded and  innovative program that introduces
              undergraduates to the diversity  of scientific disciplines, research
              techniques, and career choices  available in the field of modern natural
              history.  The ten-week  program focuses on a research project guided by a
              research advisor  who is one of the over 100 Ph.D.'s on our scientific staff. 
              The  participant, in conjunction with the research advisor, develops and  tests
              a scientific hypothesis using appropriate techniques, and  communicates the
              results in written manuscripts and oral  presentations.  The research project
              is supplemented with a  schedule of activities including lectures, discussions,
               demonstrations, field trips, and tours to provide a broad and  balanced view
              of natural history careers.  While in residence at  the National Museum of
              Natural History, the participants are fully  integrated into the Museum
              community.  This award supports 5  program positions dedicated to
              geoscience-based research topics.   Cooperative funding of the Research
              Training Program between the  Biological Sciences and Geosciences Directorates
              will also  encourage, through both formal research projects and informal 
              discussions, the type of cross-disciplinary research which occur  frequently
              within a large natural history museum.  ***
