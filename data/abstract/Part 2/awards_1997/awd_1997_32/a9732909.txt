Abstract    :
              This project supports measurements of halogen oxides (ClO and BrO) in the lower
              stratosphere from balloon platforms. Four balloons per year will be launched
              near Laramie, WY. A new lightweight instrument will be deployed together with
              light scattering instruments (built by Prof. Deshler, U. Wyoming) that measure
              particle size distributions and number densities of atmospheric aerosols. Ozone
              will be also measured using electrochemical cells. Once per year, measurements
              of carbon dioxide and particle mass and composition will be added. 
	The
              objectives of this work are to characterize the seasonal variability of the
              halogen oxides, species that respond to changes in solar illumination,
              temperature, trace gas distributions, and aerosol concentrations, and address
              the following outstanding issues: (1) How variable, seasonally and
              interannually, are abundances of ClO and BrO in the lower stratosphere today?
              (2) How much of this variability can be attributed to heterogeneous chemistry
              and to changes in aerosol surface area? (3) What are the relative contributions
              of particle size, surface area, and temperature to heterogeneous chemistry and
              halogen activation? (5) Do cirrus clouds activate chlorine in the lower
              stratosphere and upper troposphere?
