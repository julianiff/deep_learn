Abstract    :
              Dr. John A.Gladysz, Chemistry Department, University of Utah, is   supported by
              the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program, to
              investigate complexes in which chains of sp hybridized carbon   atoms span two
              transition metals. The objective of the project is to   synthesize complexes in
              which wire-like sp hybridized carbon chains   connect two transition metal end
              groups. After deprotonation of M(CC)nH   the reaction with metal halides will
              link the two metals through an even   number carbon chain, while reaction with
              coordinated carbon monoxide   followed by deoxygenation of the carbonyl will
              yield a link with an odd   number of carbon atoms. A series of preparations
              will be designed to   produce the requisite metalla-poly-ynyl starting
              materials with a variety   of carbon chain lengths. The charge transfer and
              redox chemistry of the   dimetalla species will be determined to define the
              effect of chain length   on the structure and electronic properties of the
              complexes.   The compounds targeted in this investigation contain two metals
              that are   linked through a long chain that consists solely of carbon atoms.
              These   chains can serve as 'wires' through which electrons or magnetic  
              information can be transferred from one metal to the other. As such they   can
              form the basis for micro-electronic devices and for the basic   understanding
              of how well separated metals can influence one another   through extended
              linking units.
