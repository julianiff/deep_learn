Abstract    :
                9732353  Smith    Scripps Institution of Oceanography will continue
              development of   a deep sea autonomous vehicle (AUV) capability that will
              provide   a platform for a variety of sensors of interest to the ocean  
              science community.  This proposal builds on the work and   experience gained
              during development of the ROVER vehicle.     The project involves development
              of an advanced ROVER II, with   major modifications in the instrument assembly
              and payload   configuration to accommodate an optical acoustic imaging system  
              and a sequential multiple coring system. These new sensing and   sampling
              systems also will require modification of the central   controller package.
              ROVER II is envisioned to be an autonomous   bottom-transecting instrument for
              making time-series measurements   of phytopigmnet fluorescence and acoustically
              detectable sediment   structure.  This vehicle addresses questions of
              significant   interest and concern to a broad spectrum of marine biogeochemists
                and benthic biologists.  Time-series measurements of the   responses of
              benthic communities to pulsed Particulate Organic   Matter (POM) delivery, and
              the resultant distribution and fate of   organic matter within  surface
              sediments, is critical to our   understanding of the role of benthic-pelagic
              coupling in basin-  wide chemical cycling budgets.
