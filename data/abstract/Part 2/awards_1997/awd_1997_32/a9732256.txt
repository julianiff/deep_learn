Abstract    :
                9732256    This REU program will provide a rich research experience to 
              undergraduate students who will be recruited primarily from  small colleges in
              the midwest and historically black land-  grant universities, where research
              opportunities for  students are rare. Formal communication and personal 
              networking will be used to attract students from these  institutions. Iowa
              State University has an active group of  researchers who perform
              state-of-the-art research in  molecular biotechnology. For eight weeks during
              the summer,  they will guide ten students to participate in research  projects
              involving molecular techniques. Projects will  include generation of
              recombinant DNA, genome analysis,  overexpression of foreign genes in bacteria
              and plants,  molecular genetics, and transgenic animals. The students' 
              experiences will be enriched by several activities outside  the laboratory
              setting. These structured interactions will  include discussion sessions on
              bioethics and different  aspects of biotechnology research and careers. The
              students  will also visit biotechnology facilities on campus and in an 
              industrial environment. In addition, several social  functions with mentors,
              graduate students, postdoctoral  associates and other biotechnology researchers
              will  encourage informal interactions. The impact of summer  research training
              will be assessed through formal  evaluations immediately after the training.
              Informal  contacts with the students and their parents will be used to  monitor
              progress and career decisions of the students. This  program should excite the
              students about research and foster  interest in research careers.
