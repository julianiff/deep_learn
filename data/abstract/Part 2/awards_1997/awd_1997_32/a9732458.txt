This experimental program investigates Rydberg atoms and
              molecules in an electric field using scaled-energy spectroscopy.  Combined with
              closed orbit theory, the experiments permit a semi-classical parameterization
              of photoabsorption which leads to a new way to examine Rydberg Stark states of
              atoms and molecules in terms of classical closed orbits.  Initial results on
              the helium atom will be extended to other atomic and molecular sytems.
