This project focuses on the utilization of atomic coherence
              effects and quantum interference between energy levels in an approach to the
              design of an improved atomic clock.   Experiments include studying the noise
              properties of the interaction between electromagnetic fields with different
              photon statistics and multi-level media and control of the statistical
              properties of a strong light beam with weak light using
              electromagnetic-induced-transparency effects.
