Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is on developing efficient  combinatorial algorithms
              for key problems in Artificial  Intelligence and Optimization, as well as
              providing an improved  understanding of the inherent nature of these problems. 
              This  project involves three areas in particular:  machine learning, on-  line
              decision-making, and the study of algorithms for  computationally hard
              problems.  In the area of machine learning,  one main component of this work is
              the design of better  algorithms for learning  in large feature spaces.  This
              includes  questions of how to best combine a large number of low-quality 
              sources of advice that may be available (e.g., via the internet),  as well as a
              number of questions with close relations to  crytography.  In the area of
              on-line algorithms and on-line  decision making, this research will investigate
              new approaches  for the Weighted-Caching problem, as well as the potential for 
              using methods from machine learning (for instance, algorithms for  combining
              sources of advice) to produce improved solutions to a  number of problems in
              this area.  In the study of methods for  solving computationally hard problems,
              this project will continue  exploration of approximation algorithms, as well as
              a new  approach to general purpose planning based on representing  planning
              problems in a compact graph structure, and then bringing  in tools and ideas
              from graph algorithms.  This planning method  was first demonstrated in the
              Graphplan planner, and empirically  appears to be substantially faster than
              more traditional planning  algorithms in a wide variety of settings.
