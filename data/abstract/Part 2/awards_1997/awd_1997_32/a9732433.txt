Abstract    :
              This project is a continuation of an experimental investigation of long-range
              forces between neutral atoms and condensed matter surfaces.  Attention will be
              directed toward (a) trying to resolve a discrepancy between theory and
              experiment on the strength of the van der Waals force between ground state
              neutral atoms and conducting surfaces and (b) examining major features in the
              current theory of atom-surface forces.
