Abstract    :
              973227O  The Undergraduate Summer Research program at Michigan State  University
              will support 9 students for each summer. During  the 12-week program each
              participant will work on a research  project supervised by one of the faculty
              in the Department  of Biochemistry. Applicants will be recruited from colleges 
              and universities across the country with a concentration on  schools in the
              Midwest. Special emphasis will be placed on  recruiting from undergraduate
              institutions and from colleges  and universities with a high minority
              enrollment.  Each  student will select a research mentor. All students will 
              participate in an orientation program and a workshop on  chemical and biology
              safety and blood-borne pathogens.  During the program the students will
              participate in a weekly  faculty research seminar series, and in weekly
              research  meetings of graduate students, undergraduate students and 
              postdoctoral fellows with their research mentors. Students  will be trained in
              the use of computers for preparation of  research documents, publication
              quality figures and slides,  and in the use of computer programs for protein
              and DNA  modeling and sequence analysis. A presentation will be  organized for
              participants to discuss career opportunities  in biochemistry including an
              orientation concerning Ph.D.  program applications presented by the Graduate
              Programs  Admission Director. At the conclusion of the program, the  students
              will prepare posters and brief talks on their  research for presentation to
              faculty, graduate students, and  peers in the Department of Biochemistry.
              Abstracts of these  presentations will be published in booklet form.
