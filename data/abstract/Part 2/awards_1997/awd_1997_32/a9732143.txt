Abstract    :
              This grant will continue support for the Research  Experiences for
              Undergraduates physics program at the  University of Washington.  The program
              offers prospective  students a wide variety of research opportunities: 
              astrophysics and cosmology, atomic physics, nuclear physics,  condensed matter
              physics, particle physics, and physics  education.  Each student is paired with
              a faculty advisor,  who often is supported by interested postdocs and advanced 
              graduate students.  The program lasts 10 weeks and includes  a machine shop
              course, a faculty lecture series on research  opportunities in physics, and
              informal Monday gatherings.  Special efforts are made to encourage women and
              minority  group members to apply and participate.  As the new UW 
              physics/astronomy building meets or exceeds the latest ADA  standards, we also
              emphasize our ability to accommodate the  needs of physically challenged
              students.  As typically one  student in 10 works with the UW Physics Education
              Group, our  project also has an impact on the training of in-service 
              elementary and secondary teachers.
