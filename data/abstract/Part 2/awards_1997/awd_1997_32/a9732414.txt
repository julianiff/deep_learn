Abstract    :
              9732414    Undergraduate students will participate in a summer research  program
              in the Department of Biological Sciences at  Wellesley College, an
              undergraduate college for women.  Applications will be actively encouraged from
              Wellesley  College Biology, Psychobiology, Biological Chemistry and 
              Environmental Sciences majors, as well as students from  regional liberal-arts
              colleges and universities.  These  students will have a serious interest in
              gaining research  experience to add to their demonstrated academic talent. 
              They will already have shown an ability to think  independently and
              imaginatively,  and will have strong  recommendations from knowledgeable
              faculty at their own  institutions.  Participants will be selected by the
