This three-year award supports US-Spain cooperative research
              on dynamic control and parametric excitations in hydrodynamic systems between
              John Lopez and Jie Shen at The Pennsylvania State University and Francisco
              Marques at the Polytechnic University of Catalunya in Barcelona, Spain.  The
              objective of the research is to refine the analysis and control implementation.
              

The research utilizes the complementary strengths of the two institutions. 
              The US side will focus on developing dynamic control of hydrodynamic flows and
              the Spanish side will emphasize the dynamics of fluid flows and combined
              theoretical, computational, and experimental study of hydrodynamic systems. 
              The research will result in a deeper understanding of the complex
              spatio-temporal dynamics of hydrodynamic systems.
