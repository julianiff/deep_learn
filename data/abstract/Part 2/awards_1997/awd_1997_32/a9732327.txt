Abstract    :
              This project is directed at basic research for the development of  data
              structures and algorithms for performing computations  involving collections of
              geometric objects, such as lines,  planes, polygons, curves, and spheres. 
              These topics have  applications in computer-aided design, physical modeling, 
              software engineering, information visualization, and robotics.  Specific focus
              in this project is given to:  1) algorithms for performing geometric shape
              analysis and  tolerancing,  2) data structures for efficient geometric data
              organization,  3) the combinatorial and algorithmic complexity of graph 
              visualization,  4) numerical stability and software reliability for geometric 
              computing,  5) object-oriented design patterns for geometric algorithm 
              implementation.  The main objective of this work is the development of general 
              methodologies for the design of geometric data structures and  algorithms, as
              well as their incorporation into object-oriented  geometric software libraries.
               This work has potential impacts in  enabling new capabilities in areas of
              science and engineering  that model physical objects or that use geometry for
              information  visualization.  In addition, a key component of this work 
              involves the development of geometric software and Internet  technology for use
              in computer science education.
