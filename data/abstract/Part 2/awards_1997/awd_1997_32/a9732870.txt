Abstract    :
              Abstract  Stephenson    This award is to partially support a workshop to be held
              in Knoxville, Tennessee, June 8 thought June 12, 1998.  It will bring together
              a group of researchers and students in what can loosely be characterized as
              discrete conformal geometry - a mixture of topology, analysis, and
              combinatorics.
