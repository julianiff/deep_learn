Abstract    :
                   This project involves the development and enhancement of  scanning force
              microscopy (SFM) for imaging of biological  specimens. New technical
              capabilities for SFM will be  explored to improve methods to investigate
              multi-protein-DNA  complexes by SFM in air, including a novel method to label 
              these complexes for SFM studies and a method to determine  protein-induced DNA
              bending. In addition, an SFM-based  nanomanipulator instrument will be
              developed and methods for  the production of sharper probes will be explored to
              improve  the spatial resolution of the SFM. The combination of these 
              enhancements should greatly expand the applicability of SFM  to biological
              systems.
