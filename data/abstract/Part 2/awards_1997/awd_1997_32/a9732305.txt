Abstract    :
              9732305  Collins    Fisk University will continue a Research Experience for 
              Undergraduates (REU) site in its Physics department.  Undergraduate students
              will be recruited from regional  institutions, Historically Black Colleges and
              Universities  (HBCUs) and major institutions with physics programs, with a 
              recruitment focus on African-Americans.  Students will  participate in research
              projects on the theme of "Materials  Characterization Techniques", including
              surface studies of  compound semiconductors, plasma modification of materials
              and non-  linear optical glasses.  In addition, REU participants will  attend
              the National Conference of Undergraduate Research to  present the results of
              their work  %%%  The REU site, with an emphasis on minority institutions, has 
              potential impact on underrepresented sectors of the undergraduate  student
              population in the sciences.  ***
