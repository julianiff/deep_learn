This research focuses on three projects that utilize light to
              manipulate particles.  The first uses spatially dependent optical pumping to
              create nanostructures on surfaces.  The second uses a series of nanowires
              created by lithography to deflect the motion of helium atoms.  The third uses
              optical tweezers in the analysis of adhesion properties of biological
              systems.
