Abstract    :
              9732170  Miller  This project requests funds for the support of the design  and
              conduct of a national study of public understanding of  and attitudes toward
              biotechnology in the United States,  coordinated with the work in the European
              Union, Japan, and  Canada.  Various governmental bodies in Europe, Japan, and 
              Canada have funded the basic field work in these countries.  All of these data
              are available for comparative analyses if  the United States has a comparable
              data set to make  available to the other cooperating nation.  ***
