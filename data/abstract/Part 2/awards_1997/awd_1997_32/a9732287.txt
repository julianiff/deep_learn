Abstract    :
              Motivated by problems in several applied areas, such as computer  graphics,
              robotics, computer vision, computer aided design, image  processing, and
              geographic information systems,  computational  geometry emerged as a
              discipline about twenty years ago. Numerous  efficient geometric algorithms and
              sophisticated algorithmic  paradigms have been developed, and computational
              geometry is by  now a rich and mature discipline.  The link between
              computational geometry and application areas  is, however, still not as strong
              as one would have hoped for.  The purpose of this project is to narrow the gap
              between geometry  and the related applied areas. The project will address the 
              issues beyond the traditional framework of algorithmic design,  and simple
              algorithms will be developed and implemented that work  well in practice.
              Geometric problems motivated by various  application areas, including
              visualization, robotics, data  mining, and metrology will be studied.  The
              algorithms will be developed and analyzed in a more realistic  model of
              computation and will be implemented and tested on  ``real'' inputs.
