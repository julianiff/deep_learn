Abstract    :
              Variational problems arise as a natural consequence of modeling  the physical
              world.  Stretching an elastic membrane or bending a  piece of metal can be
              mathematically described as a minimization  problem.  Perhaps the simplest
              example of this idea is the  "spline."  Originally, a spline was a drafting
              tool consisting of  a long, thin piece of wood that could be clamped to
              drafting  table at certain fixed points.  Since the deformed wood naturally 
              assumed a minimum energy state, tracing its length produced a  smooth curve.   
              In the 1950's, mathematicians redefined a spline as the  mathematical solution
              to the following problem: Find a smooth  function F(t) such that the "bending
              energy" of F(t) is minimized  subject to the constraint that F(t) interpolates
              user-specified  values at the integers (the spline's knots).   The space of 
              functions that minimizes this problem is the natural cubic  splines.    In the
              1970's, Lane and Riesenfeld discovered that cubic splines  can also be
              expressed as the limit of a sequence of functions,  each related by a simple
              averaging rule. This averaging process,  known as subdivision, is an
              increasingly popular modeling  technique in geometric design.  In recent work,
              the PI has shown  that the solution process to a wide range of variational
              problems  can be expressed concisely as a subdivision scheme.  This project 
              investigates application of this approach to three important  topics:    -
              Subdivision rules for thin-plate splines  - Fast numerical solution of
              variational problems  - Creation of splines with local knot insertion rules
