Abstract    :
              The goals of this project are:  (a) application of computational  group theory
              to related areas, and (b) scalability of  applications through parallelism. 
              This is expected to be useful  in areas of application including aspects of
              linear numerical  analysis, search (especially in the presence of symmetry) and
               algorithmic parallelization.  This work will take advantage of a  sizable body
              of more mature and stable algorithms of  computational group theory that has
              evolved in recent years.  As  an example, the techniques for finding invariant
              subspaces of  matrices over finite fields (the meataxe and condensation) have 
              matured in recent years, while invariant subspace techniques are  of current
              interest for iterative techniques in numerical  analysis.    The relevant
              algorithms will be adapted to larger scale  applications through the use of
              parallelism and of data  structures adapted toward that parallelism.  The TOP-C
              parallel  methodology will be used to identify central, repetitive tasks.  The
              portability of this methodology across C, LISP, GAP and  other languages helps
              eliminate the continuing barriers to  extensive use of parallelization.
