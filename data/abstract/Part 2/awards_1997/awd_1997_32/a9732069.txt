Abstract    :
              This REU program in the Department of Mathematical and
Computer Sciences (MCS)
              at the Colorado School of Mines (CSM)
is modeled after the department's
              successful Field Session
program.  The REU summer program will involve 6
              students
including 2 CSM students and 4 students from other universities.
The
              students will work on projects of interest in the department
and the
              university. The projects involve not only technical
mathematical and/or
              computer science skills, but also
communication and management skills.

The
              projects serve as an introduction to some of the research
that is being
              conducted in the department. We hope that some of
the student participants
              will be sufficiently intrigued so that
they will seriously consider at least a
              Master's degree in our
department.  The projects are in the areas of numerical
              analysis,
applied mathematics, software development, wavelets, fuzzy
methods,
              pattern recognition, visual perception, inverse
problems, stochastic methods,
              approximation theory, linear
algebra, noise reduction, data compression, and
              dynamical
systems. Some local companies have expressed interest in
              the
proposed research projects.  We will solicit the opinions of
              the
companies in defining the projects more precisely.
