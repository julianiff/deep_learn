                ABSTRACT      Proposal Number: CTS 9732223    Principal Investigator:  M.
              Modest    LCE: Numerical Study of Turbulence-Radiation Interactions  In
              Reactive Flows    Radiative heat transfer plays an important role in most fires
              as well as in commercial combustion applications, with its effects usually
              being of the same order of magnitude as those of convective heat transfer, and
              sometimes dominating the overall heat transfer rates. In much the same way as
              convection is aided by turbulence, so is radiation, which in the presence of
              chemical reactions may increase several fold due to turbulence interactions.
              However, the calculation of such turbulence-radiation interactions is extremely
              difficult and has to date been neglected in all popular CFD solvers or is
              treated empirically by arbitrarily lowering the predicted flame temperatures to
              account for the turbulence-radiation interactions.    A promising method for
              accounting for these interactions is the probability  density function (PDF)
              approach. Unfortunately, the PDF method in its present state of development has
              a number of shortcomings, which preclude its use in reactive flows. The purpose
              of this research is to further develop the PDF method to resolve the sharp
              gradients, which exist in reacting flows, and to model the scalar equations for
              the interactions. The extension of the PDF method will permit it to be included
              in established CFD codes. The accuracy of the new method will be verified by
              comparison with DNS calculations and experimental data.    This work is funded
              as part of the joint NSF/Sandia initiative in Life Cycle Engineering.
