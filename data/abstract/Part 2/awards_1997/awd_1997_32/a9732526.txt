Abstract    :
              This project involves research in the area of computability theory, both
              classical computability theory on the set of integers, and applications to
              other fields of mathematics, in particular algebra and logic. The focus is on
              questions of decidability of the first-order theory of structures; the
              characterization of finite substructures; the existence of nontrivial
              automorphisms versus definable properties; and the classification of
              undecidable problems in algebra.    Computability theory predates the existence
              of modern computers, starting with the ground-breaking work of Goedel in the
              1930's. It investigates the theoretical bounds of computation (neglecting
              restrictions on memory space and run time), thus providing the theoretical
              framework for many applications in computer science. Classical computability
              theory focuses on the integers (thought of as coding natural problems from many
              areas of mathematics) and tries to classify sets of integers by their
              complexity. Applied computability theory tries to apply these methods to
              natural problems in many areas of mathematics and computer science.
