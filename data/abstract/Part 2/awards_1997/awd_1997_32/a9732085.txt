Abstract    :
              Explosive growth of the internet and intranets is leading to explosive growth of
              electronic transactions and electronic collaboration. In the future, we will
              see vastly more need, and opportunity, for technology assisted collaboration on
              a very large scale. The goal of this research is to help create a solid and
              positive foundation for the development of future VLSC (Very Large Scale
              Collaboration) systems. VLSC examples include enterprise wide workflows (e.g.
              merged state and federal government procedures); electronic town meetings
              (massive real time multimedia conferences); and on-line democracies (national
              discussions and electronic elections). The approach consists of conceptual
              modeling, architectural design, mathematical analyses, simulations, and
              implementation of small scale prototypes. This allows us to pursue important
              issues of architecture, high level design, and low level design, all in
              concert. The results of this research will provide architectural principles and
              building blocks for the creation of flexible evolutionary workflow systems in
              which people can freely interact synchronously as well as asynchronously within
              structured as well as unstructured environments.
