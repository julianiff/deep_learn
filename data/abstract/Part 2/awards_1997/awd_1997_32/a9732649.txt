Abstract: In
              this project, Ross plans to investigate the shift operator (i.e.,
              multiplication by the independent variable) on various spaces of analytic and
              harmonic functions. Specifically, he plans to look at the lattice of invariant
              subspaces of the shift operator on the Hardy space of a "slit domain" in the
              complex plane. Invariant subspaces of Hardy spaces on other types of domains
              such as the disk, the annulus, and "crescent" domains  were examined by
              Beurling, Sarason, Hitt, Aleman, Richter, Olin, and Yakubovich. Ross also plans
              to look at the 1 and 2 invariant subspaces of the (formal) shift operator on
              spaces of harmonic functions on the disk (e.g., the Bergman and Dirichlet
              spaces) and, in particular, to examine (via duality) how complications in one
              space are realized in the other. 

This work combines two fields of
              mathematics, harmonic function theory and operator theory, both of which stem
              from classical problems in physics (such as heat diffusion and electrostatics)
              which are still active areas of research today.  It is the hope that a better
              mathematical understanding of the functions and operators involved will shed
              new light on the physical processes themselves. Investigations of the
              mathematics generated by the above physics problems goes back to 18th and 19th
              century mathematicians such as Fourier, Dirichlet, Kelvin, Weierstrass, and von
              Neumann and continues today with ground breaking work of mathematicians from
              all over the world.
