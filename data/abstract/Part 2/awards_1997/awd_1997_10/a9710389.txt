Abstract    :
              This research will measure (1) high-resolution, high- and room-temperature
              photoabsorption cross sections of molecular nitrogen and oxygen in the extreme
              ultraviolet region, and (2) temperature-dependent fluorescence cross sections
              for producing (a) neutral nitrogen emissions through photodissociative
              excitation of molecular nitrogen, and (b) ionized nitrogen 1085 and 916
              angstrom emissions through dissociative photoionization excitation of molecular
              nitrogen.  This work will utilize existing instrumentation, including
              windowless high temperature absorption cells and a high temperature effusive
              gas cell.
