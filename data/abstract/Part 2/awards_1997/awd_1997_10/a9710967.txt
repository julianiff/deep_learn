Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project addresses an
              innovative method for safely removing lead-based paints from structural
              materials.  Removal of paint from structures is a national problem, affecting
              hundreds of thousands of structures.  More than half the nation's 208,505 steel
              bridges carrying public roads require immediate repairs totaling more than $5
              billion.  This represents about 5 billion square feet of surface area from
              which lead-based paint should be removed.  In Phase I, a theoretical evaluation
              of a process to rapidly remove thin layers of coatings through a repetitive
              vaporization process with pulsed plasma was conducted and successfully
              demonstrated in a single-shot mode.  The Phase II research objective is to
              build and test a complete engineering prototype and conduct a small-scale field
              demonstration.  Phase II research will determine the optimal operating
              parameters of the prototype.  The anticipated result is a successful field
              demonstration on several girders of a bridge in Virginia.   The potential
              commercial applications for this technology is large, and includes paint
              removal from bridges, residential and industrial structures, ships, railroad
              cars, tank farms, and vehicles of all types.  This technology is directly
              applicable to the removal of other kinds of surface coatings (besides paints). 
              Of special interest is the experimentally demonstrated ability to remove top
              coats of paint without damaging or removing the primer or undercoat.  This will
              have applications for the commercial aircraft industry.
