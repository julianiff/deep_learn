Abstract    :
              9710301  Jaffe  This is an award to support research on and relating to the 
              effects that surfactants have on enhancing the movement of  bacteria suspended
              in water through porous media.  Experimental  investigations are planned to
              relate the molecular structure of  surfactants and concentration in water to
              their effects on  bacterial cell surface charge and hydrophobicity.  Additional
               experiments will be conducted to relate movement of bacteria  through sand
              columns for determination of the effect that  surfactants have on the collision
              efficiency factor in applying  colloid filtration theory to movement of
              bacteria through soil.  This experimental work will provide the framework for a
               mathematical formulation that may be used in engineering design  of systems
              for decontamination of soil and for introduction of  appropriately acclimated
              microorganisms into a plume of  contaminated water for its decontamination.   
              The introduction of surfactants to groundwater has the potential  for
              significantly affecting the transport of bacteria in soil.  Results of this
              project are expected to provide a means for  predicting characteristics of
              bacterial transport in soil as they  are influenced by surfactants.  This
              knowledge may be applied in  assessment of policies for intentional and
              unintentional  introduction of surfactants to groundwater, design of systems to
               cope with contaminated plumes of groundwater such as wastewater  streams from
              septic tanks and for design of systems to  decontaminate soil using
              appropriately acclimated bacteria.  ***
