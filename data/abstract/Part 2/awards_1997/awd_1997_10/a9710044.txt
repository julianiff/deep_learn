Abstract    :
              9710044  McCorkle    This project will analyze stable isotopes in live and
              core-top  (dead) benthic foraminifera, bottom waters, and interstitial waters 
              from material to be collected on cruises to the southeast Pacific  (Chilean
              margin), southeast Atlantic (Brazilian margin) and North  Atlantic.  Data from
              these regions of varying productivity, bottom  water chemistry and sedimentary
              environment will permit the PI to  examine factors which may control isotopic
              variability of the  shells, including organic flux, sediment oxidation state,
              and  calcite saturation state.
