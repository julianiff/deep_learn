Abstract    :
              This research is on test methods for finding process parameter faults in
              memories  embedded in advanced technology chips. The effect of threshold
              voltage variation  and noise (e.g., leakage, charge sharing, crosstalk, etc.)
              on the functionality  of a memory cell is modeled (using circuit simulation and
              analysis) in terms of  read/write error margins and variance of access delays.
              Algorithms for failure  modes in memories, based on fault models generated from
              process and circuit  studies, are being developed. Tools based on them allow
              functional and parametric  testing of static RAMs. The issues of testing
              gigabit stretchable DRAMs with  multi-valued address decoding schemes are being
              analyzed from an algorithmic  standpoint. Fault models, pertaining to these
              analog-like components, and memory  testing algorithms are being explored. One
              methodology for testing high-density  SRAMs and multivalued stretchable DRAMs
              with mixed-mode circuits, uses the  measure of the harmonic distortion of a
              pure sinusoidal input signal in order to  extract detection and diagnosis
              information for various technology, parametric  and layout-related faults in
              the memory chip.
