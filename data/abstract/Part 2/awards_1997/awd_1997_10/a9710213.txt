Abstract    :
                This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry
              Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities,  focuses on three areas
              involving selective extractions and  potentiometric sensors based on molecular
              recognition.  Professor  Weber and his students at the University Pittsburgh
              will use a  combinatorial approach to find mixtures of medium molecular weight 
              polyfunctional phosphate triesters that selectively extract target  analytes. 
              Novel artificial receptors for anionic dicarboxylates  will be developed for
              application in potentiometric sensors and the  further development of a
              capillary electrophoresis device for  micro-extraction will be pursued.  This
              work will find use in  industrial chemistry, medicine, environmental chemistry,
              and  agricultural and food science.  There are few practical sensors for anions
              which are negatively  charged species. The need for such sensors spans
              applications in  many areas of science including the environment, agriculture, 
              medicine, and chemical industry.  This project aims to develop  several
              strategies for directly  quantifying and for extracting  such species from real
              sample matrices by developing new compounds  and mixtures of compounds that
              selectively bind to anions via  molecular recognition.  Direct sensors that
              function by measuring  potentials that are related to analyte concentration and
              extraction  procedures that can be implemented for very small sample volumes 
              will be developed.
