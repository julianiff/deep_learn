Abstract    :
              9710608  Browne  This grant is a renewal of this mid-career PI's research 
              program.  Coming from an EPSCOR state, this theorist has  emerged as an
              ambidextrous expert in both numerical and  analytical techniques, ranging from
              kinetic Monte Carlo to  real space renormalization group and finite size
              scaling  etc.  He studies the role of spatial correlations and  fluctuations in
              nonequilibrium phase transitions.  These  phase transitions can be between
              different steady states in  heterogeneous catalysis or in various states of
              traffic flow  on highways or data network flow.  These problems are 
              mathematically related as belonging to the paradigm of  nonlinear systems
              driven by external forces.  They can  exhibit transitions to steady states, to
              periodic temporal  or spatial oscillations and even chaotic behavior.  %%% 
              What is common between oscillating chemical reactions, stop  and go traffic on
              highways and similar phenomena in network  data flow?  They are all
              mathematically related as problems  involving nonlinear systems subject to
              external driving  forces.  There are different patterns of behavior and the 
              transitions between different patterns are the subject of  study in this
              renewal grant.  This mid-career PI from an  EPSCOR state is emerging as a
              leader in sophisticated  mathematical analysis of these problems using cutting
              edge  tools.  ***
