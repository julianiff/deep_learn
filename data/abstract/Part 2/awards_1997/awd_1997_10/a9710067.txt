Abstract    :
              This project is a continuation of work which investigates the wave  and particle
              dynamical properties associated with ULF magnetic  waves in the Earth's
              magnetospheric and magnetopause plasmas.   Objectives of the proposed work are
              to (1) develop a gyrokinetic-  MHD hybrid code to simulate excitations of ULF
              waves by energetic  ring current protons; and (2) perform extensive simulations
              using  realistic magnetic field geometries and plasma parameters to  develop
              new theoretical insights and unerstandings on the ULF wave  and instability
              properties; (3) derive quasilinear equations due to  ULF/MHD waves including
              effects associated with realistic magnetic  field geometries, plasma
              equilibria, and finite ion Larmor radii;  and (4) investigate the implications
              of quasilinear diffusion on  instability saturations and wave-induced transport
              on the dayside  magnetopause.
