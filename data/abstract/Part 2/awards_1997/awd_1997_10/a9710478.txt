Abstract    :
              9710478  Christensen    This grant provides partial support of a technician's
              salary for  a three year period.  The technician will be responsible for the 
              operation and maintenance of a newly established high pressure-  high
              temperature facility at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  This facility
              incorporates the rock physics laboratories of Nik  Christensen (just starting
              at Wisconsin after 13 years at Purdue  University) and Herb Wang and the
              hydrothermal labs of Lukas  Baumgartner and Reid Cooper.  The research foci of
              these PI's  includes studies of the seismic properties of geologic materials 
              at lower crustal and upper mantle pressures and temperatures,  investigations
              of the poroelastic properties of rocks in the  upper crust, studies of the
              solubilities and thermodynamics of  solid solutions and the behavior of
              synthetic materials at  elevated temperatures and pressures.  More
              specifically, the  technician will directly support these PI's in a diverse
              array of  research projects including laboratory studies of the seismic 
              properties of lower crustal rocks from the Sierra Nevada and  Basin and Range
              provinces, measurement of the solubility of  synthetic pelites and studies of
              the thermodynamics of olivine  solid solutions.  ***
