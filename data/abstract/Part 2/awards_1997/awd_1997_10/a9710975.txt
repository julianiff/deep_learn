Abstract    :
              The STW Project is a three-year career information project having  the goal of
              familiarizing teachers, counselors, and STW coordinators in North Carolina and
              Arizona with practical strategies known to engage young women's interest in
              science, engineering and mathematics.  The project will use a systems approach
              to saturate the two states education systems via Internet, television,
              workshops and other activities supported by the State Departments of Public
              Instruction Offices of Equity and STW.  Project activities will emphasis skills
              necessary for  trade and technical occupations as well as occupations requiring
              college degrees.  A one - hour training video on SEM: STW and gender equity,
              along with a trainers guide and participation manual will be project products.
