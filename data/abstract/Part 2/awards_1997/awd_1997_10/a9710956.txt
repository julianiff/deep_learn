Abstract    :
                      CTS-9710956  John J. McGrath  Michigan State University        ABSTRACT 
                   This is a GOALI proposal for collaborative research between the Principal
              Investigator (PI) and Ford Motor Company.  The theme of the proposed work
              centers on developing a capability to analyze fogging and defogging problems. 
              The PI plans to spend the fall semester of his upcoming sabbatical leave to
              conduct a coordinated numerical and experimental program at Ford and at
              Michigan State University (MSU).  Experiments performed at MSU will provide
              data for examining and improving Ford's in-house computer software for
              simulating forced convection with condensation.  Ford and MSU have committed
              resources to develop the experimental facility at MSU.
