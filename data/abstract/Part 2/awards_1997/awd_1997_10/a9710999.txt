Abstract    :
              This research project traces development of engineering education for women from
              the 19th century to the present, concentrating on how institutions and
              individuals related to the complex and changing relationship between gender and
              technical expertise.  The project takes a multidisciplinary approach to
              science, technology and society, combining history of engineering and
              professionalization with related issues in social history, history of
              education, women's studies, and current policy.  The first objective is to
              explore historical patterns in the relationship between women and the
              professionalization of engineering, looking at how different decades brought
              new questions about the role and importance of technical professionals in
              American life.  The second issue is to look at how the engineering profession
              itself addressed the issue of technical education for women.  The third
              question asks how different universities addressed the question of opening the
              engineering curriculum to women.  The final question takes the students'
              perspective, asking how women viewed the profession and the changing
              opportunities and obstacles it presented.  The project will blend oral history
              interviews with extensive work in engineering and university archives.
