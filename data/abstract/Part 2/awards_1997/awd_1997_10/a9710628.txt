Abstract    :
              ***  9710628  Namavar     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              Project is to improve the quality of GaN layers by carbonizing the entire top
              layer of SIMOX, and to grow GaN by MOCVD on SiC-on-insulator (SiCOI)
              structures.  Phase II will also fabricate extremely high-temperature (HT)
              n-GaN/p-beta-SiD/n-beta-SiC and n-GaN/p-beta-SiC/n-FaN heterojunction bipolar
              transistors (HBT's) on large-area compliant SIMOX structures.  GaN/beta-SiC/GaN
              HBT structures will be made by etching the samples from the back and
              selectively depositing GaN.  Phase I results for partially carbonized Si on
              SIMOX clearly demonstrated the advantage of an SOI structure for growth of
              beta-SiC.  A much narrower rocking curve specta was obtained from SiC grown on
              SIMOX as compared to that grown on Si..  Rocking curve data, unlike
              Bragg-Brentano data, are sensitive to the mosaic structure of heteroepitaxial
              growt, and thus measure crystalline quality.  Photoluminescence of MOCVD-grown
              GaN on SiC/SIMOX shows much stronger purple and weaker yellow emission than GaN
              on SiC/Si or on sapphire.  Also demonstrated was the possibility of selective
              epitaxial growth of SiC and GaN.   HT HBT's are useful for under-the-hood
              automotive electronics and electronic replacement of avionic hydraulic systems.
