Abstract    :
              Research in Generative Lexicon Theory: The Semantics of  Complex Types    The
              goal of this research is to study the role of the mental  dictionary within the
              cognitive apparatus underlying  language use, from the dual perspective of
              formal  linguistics and computational modeling. Our investigation  focuses on
              the complex nature of words by addressing the  problem of the  "multiplicity of
              meaning", namely the way in  which humans combine words in a creative way to
              generate an  infinite number of senses out of a finite vocabulary of  semantic
              types. The consequences of this research  are  cross-disciplinary, since a
              linguistic account of the formal  properties of language meaning has
              implications for the  psychological modeling of the activities responsible for 
              production, generation, and categorization. Contrasting a  generative view of
              word meaning to a static sense-  enumeration approach, we are interested in
              identifying the  nature of the universal components of the lexicon and their 
              role in elucidating the compositional processes involved in  language use.
