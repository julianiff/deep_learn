Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's 
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides partial 
              support for two years for a DS-3 connection from the main campus at College 
              Station to the university's Institute of Biosciences and Technology in the 
              Texas Medical Center in Houston, and an OC-3 ATM connection from there to  the
              vBNS.  Applications include the Advanced Research and Industry  Enterprise
              Study (ARIES), comprising projects in telemedicine,  visualization,
              computational chemistry and structural biology, meteorology,  digital
              libraries, distance learning and teleconferencing; long distance  collaboration
              with the National Library of Medicine and the Smithsonian  Institution;
              collaborative projects in teleradiology with other  institutions at the Texas
              Medical Center; and the Partners in Computational  Sciences (PICS) project for
              modelling groundwater remediation strategies in  conjunction with Brookhaven
              National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National  Laboratory, University of Texas at
              Austin, SUNY at Stony Brook, University  of South Carolina and Princeton
              University.
