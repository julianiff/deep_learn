Abstract    :
              ***  9710602  Ohara    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project
              is for the development of a high precision position measurement system.  Such
              systems are used to measure and control the highly-precise motion of
              manufacturing equipment.  The system utilizes Scanning Probe Microscope (SPM)
              technology, MEMS (or micro machines), and a high precision holographic grating
              together with synchronous signal detection.  The simple structure of the device
              and ease of the use suggest significant cost savings to the end user.  The
              focus of the Phase I project has been to investigate the means of providing a
              reliable and high speed position measurement system based on the proposed
              method.  During Phase II, Phase I results will be further developed toward a
              product level prototyping.  The new prototype design will aim to demonstrate
              better than 0.1nm resolution and to detect faster than 10mm/sec motion over 2"
              range with increased reliability and stability.  An optimization procedure for
              mechanical and controller design will be developed and tested along with
              prototype development, with the expectation of significant contribution to
              overall development time and cost savings.     The demand for ultra-precision
              position measurement and control systems worldwide has grown rapidly in such
              key industries as 1) semiconductor manufacturing equipment; 2) servo-writers
              for hard disk writing; 3) optical disk mastering equipment, and 4)
              high-precision machining of aspheric lenses and mirrors.  ***
