Abstract    :
              This research will investigate how labor demand and supply shocks affect wage
              inequality and employment patterns.  Specifically, external shocks manifested
              in trade and migration, regional shocks from changing of political structure,
              and localized shocks from government employment programs will be investigated
              in order to address the following questions.  First, how do changes in trade
              and migration flows affect the returns to skill?  Second, how do changes in
              political structure affect the regional distribution of employment?  Finally,
              can a government employment program mitigate the effects of external shocks and
              reduce wage inequality?  In order to address these questions, this research
              will use household labor force surveys from the West Bank and Gaza Strip from
              1981-1996 and a variety of supplemental data sources in order to estimate the
              effects of these changes in labor demand and supply on the returns to different
              types of workers.  The variety and severity of the shocks to the economies in
              the West Bank and Gaza Strip will allow this research to investigate these
              issues in ways not possible when using data from the US or other countries. 
              Because of the uniqueness of these data, this research will be able to
              simultaneously test competing theories of the source of wage inequality, which
              has not yet been done using US data.
