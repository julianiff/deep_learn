              Title: Predictability of the Atmosphere and Other Systems at Longer  Ranges   
              This proposal is to continue investigations into the fundamental  aspects of
              predictability of the atmosphere and other complex non-  linear dynamical
              systems at longer ranges.  This will be done by  taking recourse to simple
              forced, non-linear, dissipative,  dynamical system equations as before.  Some
              of the scales are  undoubtedly more predictable than the others in some systems
              and  the PI will examine this property and the conditions under which  such
              predictability exists at longer ranges.  This research will  certainly shed new
              light on predictability problem and may  reinvigorate national effort in
              exploiting the predictability of  certain features in the highly complex
              climate system.
