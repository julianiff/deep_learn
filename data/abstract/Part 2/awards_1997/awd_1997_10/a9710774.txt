Abstract    :
              Divine Word College will use this grant to connect its Epworth  campus to the
              Internet using a Dubuque, Iowa based ISP called  Midwest Communications. 
              Divine Word College is a four-year  college and seminary wholly owned and
              operated by the Society of  Divine Word, a Roman Catholic missionary order. 
              There are  approximately 125 full-time students from countries around the 
              world.    The college needs the Internet connection to be able to access 
              information resources throughout the state, the nation and the  world.  The
              connection will benefit the faculty, staff students  of this institution as
              well as the community in general.  The  award provides partial support of the
              project for two years.
