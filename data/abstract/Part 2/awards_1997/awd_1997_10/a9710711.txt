Abstract    :
              This project is in the area of computational topology, which  is the application
              of topological algorithms to problems  traditionally in the domain of
              computational geometry.  The  project will employ topological methods to
              develop and  implement algorithms for various applications in the areas  of 1)
              geometric modeling, 2) robot motion planning, and 3)  computer graphics. 
              Algorithms will be coded on graphics workstations.  Particular effort will be
              put on algorithms for geometric  objects that are modeled as simplicial
              complexes in low-  dimensional Euclidean space.  Further, the underlying theory
               of computational topology will be systematically  investigated in the context
              of applications.
