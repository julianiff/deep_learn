Abstract    :
              Even apparently simple tasks like reaching for an object involve the
              simultaneous graded activation of a large number of joints and muscles.  This
              project investigates the principles that underlie the generation of such
              multi-joint movements, and how perceptual information guides these actions. 
              Whereas many of the current theoretical approaches are limited to either
              rhythmic or discrete movements, this project will develop an integrated
              framework that encompasses both movement types and therefore can be applied to
              complex movements.  The investigation will proceed in three interrelated
              directions.  First, theoretical work will develop a model for movement
              generation on the basis of a network of coupled dynamic systems.  Second,
              experiments with human subjects will study the specific features of movement
              trajectories in tasks involving multi-joint arm movements.  Third, the model
              will be used to synthesize movements of a human-like robot arm in order to
              compare these model-driven movements with the movements of the human
              participants.  In this way the model's validity and robustness will be tested
              in a real physical environment.  In addition to increasing our basic
              understanding of complex movement generation the results should be applicable
              to the control of artificial devices such as robotic systems or limb
              prostheses, and may also contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of movement
              disorders.
