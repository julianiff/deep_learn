Abstract    :
              The discovery that human activities may affect global climate could turn out to
              have major economic, political and social implications.  Policy makers and the
              public are rightly concerned about how scientific agreement has developed (and
              has not developed) on the complicated topic of global warming.  Historians of
              science have not yet addressed the history of research on climate change.  The
              history is uninviting:  a confused tangle of disparate results leading to no
              grand synthesis, but only to partial and provisional conclusions.  A study of
              this history can illuminate how basic science is conducted on a topic where
              practical results are demanded even while definitive theories and methods are
              beyond reach.  In the first phase of this project, the history of climate
              change research from the 1890s to the present was surveyed.  This was followed
              by a detailed study explaining a major turning point in the history:  how
              scientists demonstrated during the 1950s that carbon dioxide released by
              industry might well cause global warming in the next century.  The next phase
              of this project, to be accomplished with this grant, will examine scientific
              developments in the field from 1946 through 1978.  Investigation will focus on
              specific cases, such as computer modeling of climate, the study of past
              climates, and the influence of dust on atmospheric temperatures.  Published
              scientific papers will be the primary source of data, augmented by popular
              articles and books, archival research, and oral history interviews and other
              retrospective information solicited from participants in the history.  Results
              will be disseminated through articles for scholarly and general audiences, a
              site on the World-Wide  Web, and, eventually, a book.
