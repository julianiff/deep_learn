Abstract    :
              9710996  Anderson    Mother Goose Asks Why? is a program of the Vermont Center
              for the Book currently being brought to 1200 parents in Vermont.  Centered
              around exemplary children's literature and science activities, the program
              provides a series of four reading/discussion/activity sessions to parents of
              preschool children.   Through exploration of basic questions such as "What Is
              It?", "How Many?", and "How Do You Know?", parents gain experience, skills, and
              confidence to introduce science to their 3-7 year old children.    The Vermont
              Center hopes to expand this program to twelve additional states, the District
              of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Before initiating this expansion,
              however, the Center needs to address two issues:  1) how to create appropriate
              strategies for reaching, recruiting, and retaining families in locations that
              are quite different from Vermont, and 2) how to create an evaluation strategy
              that will assess parental behavior and attitudinal changes over time.  Toward
              this end, the Center will gather representatives from the participating
              expansion sites and experts in family outreach to examine local issues and
              differences, to establish local contacts, and to begin development of 
              effective implementation strategies for the sites.  They also will work with
              The Network, Inc., a national education evaluation and research organization,
              to produce concrete measurements for parental behavior changes.
