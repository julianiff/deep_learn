Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of  NCRI's
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides  partial
              support for two years for a DS-3 connection to the vBNS.  Applications include
              projects in high performance computing, remote  visualization,
              telecollaboration, reservoir modeling, hierarchical  visualization, and
              satellite based data collection for long-term  environmental monitoring. 
              Collaborating institutions include the National  Center for Supercomputing
              Applications, Syracuse University, NASA Goddard,  University of California at
              San Diego and Berkeley, CalTech, and the  University of Michigan.
