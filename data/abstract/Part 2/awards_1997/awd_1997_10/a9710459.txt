Abstract    :
              ECS-9710459  Qiming Zhang      The objectives of the proposal are:      (a) To
              investigate structure/property relationships governing electromechanical
              properties or  polymeric materials.  (b) To provide understanding of
              electroprocessing/microstructure relationships in order to  control  design of
              electroactive polymers with optimized properties for end-use  applications. 
              (c) To develop new electroactive polymers with unique electromechanical
              properties leading to  rapid technological development.  (d) To shorten the
              time period between research concept, to increased scientific understanding, 
              and new technologies and devices by close collaborative studies involving
              Rutgers  University (Polymer Electroprocessing Laboratory) and Penn State
              (Materials Research  Laboratory), combined with the chemical synthesis work of
              Allied Signal and end-use  applications expertise of AMP, Inc.
