Abstract    :
              Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution, the Indian River      Community College
              and the St. Lucie County School District      have formed a partnership to
              provide "transition point"      young women (Those moving from middle school to
              high school,      high school to college, reentry women to professional course 
                  work) with experiences and materials geared to support them      in the
              pursuit of science oriented career pathways.  At the      secondary and
              community college levels, a new program,      Exploring Science & Technology -
              Based  Careers for Women is      planned.  At the middle school level, the
              expansion of a      summer Just We Girls program is planned.  Scientists will  
                 serve as mentors for the college student participants, who      in turn will
              serve as mentors for the younger women and      girls.  A dynamic, interactive
              regional network of      scientists, science teachers and young women potential
                   scientists is planned.
