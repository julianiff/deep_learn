Abstract    :
              ***  9710612  Arlinghaus     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II 
              project is to develop, demonstrate, and characterize a high-resolution,
              resonant post-ionization imaging sputter-initiated resonance ionization
              nanoprobe time-of-flight instrument (SIRINP-TOF) which will make it possible to
              map quantitatively, and with very high sensitivity, selectivity, efficiency,
              and with submicron resolution, the spatial distribution of trace elements in
              electronic and optoelectronic devices.  By combining liquid metal ion gun
              (LMIG) sputtering with efficient resonance post-ionization, Phase I
              demonstrated that high resolution imaging is possible.  It was also
              demonstrated that very high depth resolution on small analysis areas can be
              obtained with SIRINP by using a pulsed LMIG for data collection and a
              low-energy high-dose ion gun for eroding the sample. Phase II will redesign the
              instrument to reduce vibration and increase long-term stability to achieve 50
              nm resolution, and demonstrate the nanoprobe instrument's imaging and depth
              profiling capability on samples of interest to the semiconductor industry.     
              In Phase III, commercial high resolution image analyses and instruments will be
              made available for the analytical community. There is and emerging market for
              analytical instrumentation with submicron spatial resolution and high
              sensitivity and selectivity, particularly in the semiconductor and biomedical
              research area.  This market extends into the material sciences, environmental
              sciences, chemical, catalysis, and pharmaceutical fields.  ***
