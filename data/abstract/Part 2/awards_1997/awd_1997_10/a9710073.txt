Abstract    :
              University of California, Davis   The objective of this study is to identify the
              factors which assist in the development of entrepreneurship in rural areas of
              Hungary and those which act as constraints.  Gender differences, in particular,
              will be assessed.  Gender differences in types of small businesses and in
              enterprise survival rates will also be examined as will the impact of
              entrepreneurial activity on gender roles and relations.  A range of field
              methods will be used.  Questionnaire surveys of individual male and female
              entrepreneurs in 19 western Hungarian border villages and 11 border villages in
              southeast Hungary will be undertaken.  This information will be supplemented by
              life histories of women entrepreneurs in each study area, focus groups with
              sections of the rural population, and workshops in the villages for feedback of
              results and discussion.  The research addresses the important issue of
              mechanisms for development in transitional economies as well as the role of
              women in development.
