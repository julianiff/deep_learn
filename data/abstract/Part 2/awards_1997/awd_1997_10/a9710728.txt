Abstract    :
                Roman rule in Ancient Egypt has been characterized as a period of great
              cultural and economic revival.  Historic documents reveal a strong centralized
              government that prospered, as measured in exports, revenues collected and
              territorial expansion.  However, Roman rule in Egypt also has been described as
              unjust, adversely affecting the lives of the populace through anarchy and
              religious persecution.   Indeed, analyses of Roman census data indicate that
              Egyptian females were subject to high mortality, with life expectancy at birth
              of only 22.5 years.  Similarly, life expectancy for Egyptian males was 25
              years.  The specific objective of this research project is to understand the
              relationships between quality of life and centralized authority during the
              Roman period of Egypt.  This objective will be realized by examining
              relationships between economic status as revealed by archaeological and
              historic records, and quality of life, as scored by skeletal indicators of poor
              dietary intake, high disease loads, and trauma.  Excavation of two tombs from
              Baharia Oasis, Egypt will be conducted. Skeletal analysis of excavated remains
              will be performed in Cairo using standard methods. The methodology designed for
              this research project examines the relationship between how well an individual
              grows in conjunction with other stress indicators within a historical context. 
              This makes it possible to determine if mortality increased and life expectancy
              decreased under Roman rule, as suggested by the demographic data compiled from
              Roman census records.  In addition, we can test the accuracy of utilizing
              skeletal data to inform about quality of life of past populations while
              improving our understanding of the Egyptian population under centralized Roman
              Egypt.
