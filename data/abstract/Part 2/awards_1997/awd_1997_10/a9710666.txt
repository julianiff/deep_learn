Abstract    :
              ***  9710666  Arms    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              is aimed at the development of a network of miniaturized, intelligent,
              addressable sensing modules (ASM's), that can be embedded within a composite
              structure, remotely powered, and interrogated by a personal computer through a
              non contacting inductive link.  The inductive link is used for power and
              bi-directional communications.  A computer based interrogation system transmits
              a data request to a specific ASM on the network.  The data request is encoded
              on the AC waveform that delivers power to the embedded electronics.  Once
              addressed, the embedded ASM powers its sensors and data conversion components. 
              Data are sampled and encoded as pulse code modulated data; this modulates an RF
              carrier for transmission out of the material, back to the interrogating
              computer.  This versatile system was designed to allow a wide variety of
              sensors to be networked interchangeably.  In Phase II, ASMs will be enhanced by
              the development of specialized nodes, rigorous environmental testing, and
              software improvements, and working demonstrations.  Data will be collected
              during and after composite cure of a composite sonar dome.  The system will be
              used for model verification, dry dock inspection, and reduced cost at-sea
              testing.  Successful demonstration of the technology will greatly enhance
              market potential.    Structures with a broad variety of capabilities may be
              developed by embedding sensing networks of strain, crack propagation,
              acceleration, pressure, magnetic fields, etc.  Applications include health
              monitoring of thick composite structures, bridges, dams, and buildings. 
              Military and commercial market potential for these systems is significant.
