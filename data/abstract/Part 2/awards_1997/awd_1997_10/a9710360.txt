Abstract    :
                This project will produce a book-length history of experimental genetics in
              China, from its inception in the 1920s through its post-Maoist efflorescence in
              the 1980s.  Of the very few case studies of modern Chinese science, this will
              be the first one to span the Republican and Communist eras.  Genetics has been
              chosen because its history is exemplary, embodying a full range of issues faced
              by China's natural science community, including the creation of a research
              community from scratch, the role of foreign scientists in that creation
              process, the involvement of the state, and the interplay of science and
              ideology.     A premise of the study is that historians, which concerned with
              such abstract topics, must not lose sight of the actual research conducted by
              scientists, because one cannot speak meaningfully about scientists and their
              community without describing and evaluating their research.  This case study
              will demonstrate that, paralleling its accomplishments, there was a persistent
              and growing ambivalence about the modern scientific enterprise in China,
              generally expressed in nativist and populist conceptions of science.      A
              broad range of primary sources will be consulted for this history, including
              archival data from Chinese universities and research institutes and from
              American philanthropic foundations.  Past research activities are accessible
              through publications of universities and research institutes, and  from
              conference proceedings.  Interviews with scientists and visits for genetics
              research facilities in China complement the archival materials.
