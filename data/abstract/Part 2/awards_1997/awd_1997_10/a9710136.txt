Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to provide mechanisms which  support female
              economists in the pursuit of academic  retention and promotion.  It is an
              effort of the American  Economic Association's Committee on the Status of Women
              in  the Economics Profession (CSWEP).  CSWEP will develop and  implement a
              two-day workshop at the Allied Social Science  Association (ASSA) meeting to be
              held in Chicago, Illinois,  January 3-5, 1998.  Eight teams of five non-tenured
               faculty  will be paired with eight tenured faculty.  These teams will  work
              through materials concerning successful grant writing  and publishable
              research.  All teams will develop action  plans to support the likelihood of
              earning tenure at their  respective institutions.  In addition to increase the 
              representation of women among senior faculty rank, this  project provides the
              opportunity to test the effectiveness  of a team approach to mentoring, as
              opposed to a one-to-one  approach in the career advancement process.
