Abstract    :
              ***  9710722  Naleway    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              project aims to develop new commercial uses of conjugates capable of exploiting
              common marker gene expression in transformed cells to control the growth and
              character of cells in living tissue.  From our successes in Phase I we propose
              research that will provide breakthroughs needed to advance commercial uses of
              these recombinant gene systems in biotechnology.  In Phase II of this project,
              Marker Gene Technologies, Inc. proposes to establish this technology by
              preparing new conjugates of common growth regulators, drugs and enzyme
              inhibitors, for administration to a variety of animal cells or bacteria in
              tissue culture that contain gene fusion marker genes.  In addition, Marker Gene
              Technologies, Inc. will develop new vectors and systems for defined control of
              marker genes in vivo.  These new conjugate systems will provide innovative
              methods of detecting gene fusions and utilizing these fusion systems in
              transformed cells in vivo to control selected biological properties of these
              cells.    Potential Commercial Applications of the Research    The success of
              this project opens up commercial possibilities in the fields of medical
              intervention in genetic diseases, new drug delivery systems, and improved
              biotechnological production of new proteins and drugs in cell-culture systems.
