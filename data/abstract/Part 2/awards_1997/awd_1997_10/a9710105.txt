Abstract    :
              9710105  Holmgren  In a comprehensive two-year planning process begun in the
              early 1990s, The New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) developed a Master Plan for
              the years 1993 through 1999 intended to clarify and document the institution's
              priorities and commitments for the future. The construction and endowment of a
              Plant Studies Center to allow expansion of the currently crowded herbarium and
              library collections, to store the collections under state-of-the-an
              environmental conditions, to provide space for their growth through at least
              2020, and to provide nine study rooms for scholars visiting the Herbarium
              merged as the centerpiece of the Master Plan and is the largest single
              investment NYBG is making in its future. A campaign was conducted to fund the
              needs outlined in the Master Plan, including $33,000,000 for the construction
              and endowment of and the equipment for the Plant Studies Center. Funds needed
              for both the construction and endowment of the Plant Studies Center and the
              compact storage equipment for the Library and 65% ($1,621,178) of the cost of
              compact storage equipment for the Herbarium were raised in the campaign. Funds
              to cover the remaining 37% ($952,121) of the cost of the compact storage
              equipment for the Herbarium are provided by this award.
