Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of  NCRI's
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides  partial
              support for two years to create a gigapop centered around the  University of
              Maryland-College Park (UM-CP) and the University of  Maryland-Baltimore County
              (UMBC).  The two campuses are connected by an  OC-48 line, which also connects
              to the vBNS at OC-3.  Other research  institutions in the Baltimore area
              connect through UMBC, while Washington  area research institutions connect
              through UM-CP.  Applications include  projects in remote sensing data
              collection and distribution, atmospheric  science, the Earth Observing System
              program, interactive visualization, and  large-scale intelligent document
              retrieval.  Collaborating institutions  include most of the Internet 2
              institutions and several NASA facilities.
