Abstract    :
              Auburn University will use this grant to connect Patterson State  Technical
              College to the Internet.  The students and faculty of  Patterson State
              Technical College need the Internet connections  to be able to access
              information resources throughout the state,  the nation and the world.  The
              connection will benefit the  faculty, staff students of this institution as
              well as the  community in general.  The award provides partial support of the 
              project for two years.
