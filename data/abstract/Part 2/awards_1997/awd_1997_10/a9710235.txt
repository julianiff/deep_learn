Abstract    :
              This research is on design of low-power hardware for digital signal processing 
              (DSP) and communications applications. The approach incorporates both
              high-level  (algorithmic) and low-level (circuit) parameters, and includes
              novel methods for  design exploration, power estimation and low-power circuit
              synthesis. Key  features of the approach include: a.) joint optimization of
              algorithmic  performance with power dissipation, b.) integration of high-level
              algorithmic and  low-level circuit issues via high-level power estimation, and
              c.) explicit  incorporation of signal statistics at all levels of design.
