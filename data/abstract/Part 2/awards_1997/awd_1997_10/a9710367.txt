Abstract    :
              Technological advances in computer architecture  and communication technology,
              coupled with  economic factors, have led to the development of  a variety of
              parallel computing environments  with high message latencies. Examples include 
              mesh- and hierarchical-ring-based  multiprocessors, and networks of
              workstations.  Many  algorithmic techniques that ensured efficient 
              interprocessor communication (at least with high  probability) in the tightly
              coupled, small-  diameter parallel machines of the past no longer  guarantee
              efficiency in the new environments.  This project is dedicated to developing
              and  analyzing communication-scheduling algorithms  that ensure: (A) efficient
              parallel computation  in networks of workstations; (B) efficient  execution of
              dynamically evolving computations  in "ring-like" multiprocessors (including 
              chordal rings, express rings and hierarchical  ring networks); efficient
              orchestration of  variable-length communications  on ring-like networks.  Both
              analytical and  experimental methods will be invoked to craft  and evaluate
              algorithms that achieve these  goals. This project has complementary goals: (1)
               to gain theoretical understanding of factors  that enhance --- and detract
              from --- efficiency  of interprocessor communication in high-latency  parallel
              environments, and (2) to develop  algorithmic techniques that translate such 
              understanding into provably efficient  communication strategies.
