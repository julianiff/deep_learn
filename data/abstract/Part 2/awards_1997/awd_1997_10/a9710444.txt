Abstract    :
              C.P. Snow's Rede Lecture in 1959 declared that the humanities and sciences had
              grown so far apart that they had become `two cultures.`  In the decades since
              others have taken up the argument, contending that increased
              professionalization and specialization in science have widened the rift.    But
              concealed within many versions of the `two cultures` argument is an implicit
              assumption that `science` means `physical science,` or at least those sciences
              that most resemble the physical sciences in their methods and conceptual
              organization.  Throughout the twentieth century, however, there have been forms
              of science within the United States that are not easily categorized into either
              of the two cultures, and which have, in fact, served as an intellectual commons
              for meetings among researchers in various disciplines and for meetings among
              scientists and the lay public.  Natural history is perhaps the most powerfully
              resonant of such meeting grounds, though there are others.  Drawing on
              representative individuals selected from areas of biology and the social
              sciences, this study will highlight areas of scientific investigation that
              transcend or defy the two cultures.  The project will contribute to several
              fields within the history of science, particularly those areas of research in
              which scholars are examining relations between science and the polity, the
              nature of scientific change, and the development of theories at the
              intersection of the social and biological sciences.
