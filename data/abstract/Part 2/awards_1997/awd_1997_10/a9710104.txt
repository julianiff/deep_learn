Abstract    :
              9710104  Censky  The Carnegie  Museum of Natural History  collection of
              herpetofauna contains some 194,286 specimens. In the past five years,
              unanticipated growth in the collection (largely through accession of several
              orphaned collections) has resulted in overcrowded conditions and inadequate
              storage for many specimens. NSF support will increase space by reorganizing and
              consolidating parts of the collection, and to purchase more appropriate storage
              units. Seventy-five stainless steel tanks will be purchased and personnel hired
              to consolidate lot-cataloged specimens, consolidate large snakes from gallon
              jars into tanks, replace inadequate jar lids, alleviate overcrowding in tanks,
              and reorganize the formalin and turtle collections. When all tasks are
              completed, not only will the overcrowded condition of the collection be
              alleviated, but there will also be space available for about 10-15 years of
              growth at the present rate. More importantly, the collection will be housed
              more appropriately to insure its long-term maintenance and accessibility for
              scientific and educational purposes.
