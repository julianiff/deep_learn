Abstract    :
              This award from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the   Division
              of Chemistry provides partial support to enable the   participation of five or
              more graduate students at the 1997 Secondary Ion   Mass Spectrometry (SIMS)
              Meeting.  This is a biennial international   meeting and represents the largest
              international forum for dissemination   of information on SIMS.  Students will
              be invited to present their   research.  The meeting is held under the auspices
              of the American Society   for Mass Spectrometry.  Scientists from industry,
              government and academic   institutions are attracted to the program and will
              provide students with   broad exposure to all aspects of SIMS.  Topics will
              include the   following: surface analysis, developments in instrumentation,
              depth   profiling, semiconductor applications, metallurgical and geological  
              applications, and fundamentals of sputtering.  This award enables participation
              of graduate students in the 1997   Secondary Ion Mass spectrometry (SIMS)
              Meeting.  The conference provides   a broad view of scientific activities
              involving SIMS.
