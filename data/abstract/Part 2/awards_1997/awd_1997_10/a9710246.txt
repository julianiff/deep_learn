Abstract    :
                9710246  Avissar    We propose to hold the Sixth International Conference on
              Precipitation in Hawaii June 29-July 1, 1998.  Following the tradition of the
              previous five conference, this meeting aims at fostering interdisciplinary
              interactions between atmosphere scientists,hydrologists, mathematicians and
              statisticians.  The central theme of the conference will be research  issues
              related to rainfall predictability at the different time and space scales.  In
              particular, emphasis will be placed on the following topics: (i) application of
              modern observational techniques for precipitation estimation and prediction,
              (ii) dynamically modeling of clouds and precipitation, and (iii) limits of
              predictability.
