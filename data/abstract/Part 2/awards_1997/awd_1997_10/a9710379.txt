Abstract    :
              Simpson, Caroline  AST 97-10379    Dr. Simpson will investigate the evolution of
              low mass  dwarf irregular galaxies.  Radio observations of blue  compact and
              low surface brightness dwarf galaxies will be  augmented by optical and
              infrared observations of their  stellar components.  The new data will be
              combined with  data acquired previously to investigate whether these two  types
              of dwarf systems evolve sequentially or separately.
