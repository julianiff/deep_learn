Abstract    :
              9710038  Windham  The Garrett Herbarium, an integral part of the Utah Museum of
              Natural History (UMNH), is an important national and regional systematics
              resource. With nearly 120,000 pressed plant specimens, it is the third largest
              herbarium in Utah, and it ranks in the top 15% worldwide. The herbarium is a
              major repository for botanical specimens from the diverse and
              incompletely-explored Intermountain West, and it includes a series of historic
              collections and voucher specimens that contribute greatly to the unique
              research value of the collection. However, there are specimens stored on open
              shelves under conditions that are considered unacceptable by modern
              conservation standards. Funds from Institute of Museum Services, the Utah
              Museum of Natural History, the University of Utah, and a private donor have
              allowed the herbarium staff to address some of the problems identified by
              conservators. This NSF project will take this process another step by providing
              archival supplies and student personnel to re-folder many of the specimens.
