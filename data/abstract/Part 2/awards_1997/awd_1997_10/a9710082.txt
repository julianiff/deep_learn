Abstract    :
                This doctoral dissertation research project assesses when supreme courts
              review statutes and under what conditions.  Does the likelihood of judicial
              review vary across issue saliency, institutional rules (e.g., elected or
              appointed courts), justices (e.g., party affiliation), and strategic situations
              (e.g., divided or unified control of government)?  Despite the centrality of
              these questions, judicial scholars have only recently begun to systematically
              examine the forces influencing statutory review.  Thus, this doctoral
              dissertation systematically analyzes and evaluates:  1)  the extent to which
              judicial review varies across areas of law with varying degrees of saliency; 
              2) whether older statutes presumably passed by dormant coalitions, are more
              likely to be declared unconstitutional than newer statutes; and, 3) whether
              judicial review varies across institutional or political circumstances that can
              be reasoned to influence the strategic environment of state supreme courts. 
              The research design employs the collection and analysis of data from the fifty
              states.  These data consist  of  the population of state supreme court judicial
              review cases in five areas of law.  The analysis involves statistical
              estimation and evaluation of models of five types of legal cases that came
              before state supreme courts in the 1970-1996 period.  This doctoral
              dissertation promises to provide a holistic picture of judicial review by state
              supreme courts.
