Abstract    :
              9710313  Saltzman  The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to synthesize 
              polymeric materials with a selected range of chemical and  structural features,
              and use these materials to examine the  mechanisms for cell migration and cell
              growth.  The PI will  study changes in cell behavior for human leukocytes and 
              nervous tissue cells dispersed within the synthetic polymers  in which the pore
              architecture as well as the chemical  composition is systematically changed. 
              By using a variety  of polymeric materials, the PI will test the hypothesis
              that  optimal cell migration requires environments possessing  physicochemical
              features (pore size, adhesion,  deformability) within a restricted and
              definable range.  ***
