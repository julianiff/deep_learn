Abstract    :
              This comparative case study of the influence of community participation in
              environmental management, for the Valdez oil terminal in Alaska and the Sullom
              Voe oil terminal in the Shetland Islands, will contribute to several
              underdeveloped areas in the environmental policy literature:  empirical studies
              of the mechanisms through which communities can contribute to environmental
              management, the effects of decisions involving national and sub-national
              regulatory bodies, and the relationship of community involvement to atrophy of
              vigilance in organizations.  It will generate two detailed examples of how
              national and sub-national styles of regulation interact in shaping a specific
              set of policy choices and explore the processes and institutional arrangements
              through which various groups have debated proposals for and influenced
              deployment and maintenance of environmental safeguards at the two terminals
              throughout their histories.  The study proposes that organizations responsible
              for pollution prevention are vulnerable to an atrophy of vigilance in which
              environmental safeguards are reduced over time to save costs, but that
              incorporation of the concerns of local communities into the environmental
              management process tends to counteract this phenomenon.  Detailed examination
              of institutional arrangements, the substance and outcomes of public policy
              debates, and company and public records is necessary in order to measure
              whether or not and when organizational atrophy of vigilance occurs.  Results
              from the research will provide a detailed empirical basis for theory
              development and hypothesis testing in the three areas of the environmental
              policy literature identified above.  Results will be reported in articles and
              presentations.
