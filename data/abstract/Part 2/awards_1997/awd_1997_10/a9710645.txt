Abstract    :
              The Science and Gender Equity Program (SAGE-VA) builds upon the achievements of
              others who have developed and tested female friendly, hands-on science modules.
               This 24 month project targets middles school girls as well as science and
              mathematics teachers from the rural and economically depressed counties of far
              western Virginia.  The project will solidify a collaboration between scientists
              and science educators at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University
              (VA-Tech) and classroom teachers in these isolated areas.     The main goal of
              the project is to establish a collaborative network among teachers, professors,
              community organizations and middle school girls in rural schools.  The
              activities that will support this goal include establishing the above network;
              a summer camp for middle school girls and teachers; distant learning activities
              for collaboration and instruction; and, Saturday Academies.    This project
              will: increase teacher awareness of gender equity issues in science education,
              act as a mentor program to encourage girls to pursue science careers;
              incorporate the use of computer-based technologies for all participants and
              encourage participants to use these technologies as efficient, powerful
              learning and communication tools.
