Abstract    :
              This award supports a three-year project to conduct research and develop  tools
              for Internet performance diagnostics, measurement and analysis.  The  project
              focuses on two primary areas of Internet statistics:  routing  stability,
              topology and visualization; and network service provider  performance
              diagnostics and measurement.  The overall goal of the project  is to develop
              tools and perform statistical research that promotes the  stability and
              rational growth of the Internet.  It is expected that the  project will be
              supported in future years by other funding sources such as  industry-wide
              consortia.
