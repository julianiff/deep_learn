Abstract    :
              9710107  Dzombak  This is an award the objective of which is to determine 
              approaches that can be used to address environmental  problems associated with
              concrete that has been contaminated  by oils that contain polychlorinated
              biphenyl compounds.  The investigator will work at the Alcoa Technical Center
              for  a period of three months to investigate the historic  experiences with
              using surface coatings to encapsulate these  organic contaminants of concrete,
              exploration of new  materials and techniques for coatings to reduce their 
              initial absorption and finding new approaches for addressing  this problem.   
              This project will be performed in collaboration with  personnel from the Alcoa
              Technical Center in accord with  guidelines contained in NSF 95-111 and 95-112,
              Grant  Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry.  The  industrial
              collaborator in conduct of this project is Dr.  John R. Smith, Consultant, EHS
              Technology Center, the  Aluminum Company of America's Alcoa Technical Center
