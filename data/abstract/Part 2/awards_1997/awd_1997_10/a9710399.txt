Abstract    :
               This is a longitudinal study of youth in areas of the former Soviet Union. It
              is Wave 4 of "Paths of a Generation," a longitudinal study of graduates from a
              stratified, clustered sample of  secondary schools in 1983-1984, in five of the
              successor states of the Soviet Union: Latvia, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, and
              Tajikistan.  The researchers will also analyze the data from Wave 4, as well as
              data on the same individuals collected in the three earlier waves (in
              1983-1984, 1988-1989, and 1993-1994).  The main aims are (a) to understand the
              structure and mechanisms generating social stratification and social
              inequalities in both the Soviet period and the period since the Soviet
              collapse; (b) to test theories about the relative importance of structural,
              cultural, and individual factors affecting social inequalities; (c) to examine
              the impact of these factors and of social inequalities on political attitudes
              and participation; (d) to compare these processes in the Soviet successor
              states with those in other countries, including both other former
              state-socialist countries and market-oriented industrial societies. An
              important feature of the project will be to capitalize on a valuable existing
              longitudinal data base.     This research project is among the very most
              significant longitudinal studies of individuals in diverse areas of the former
              Soviet Union during a period of dramatic social change.  Thus it will provide
              priceless insight into the transformation of these societies, whose stability
              is of such great importance for the world.  Employing advanced methods of
              statistical analysis, this study will also test fundamental theories concerning
              stratification, mobility and other processes of great interest to sociologists.
