Abstract    :
              9710051  Verosub      Three important elements of Earth Systems History are
              Milankovitch forcing, Tibetan uplift and global ice volume.  A terrestrial
              record of the interaction of these three elements can be found in the
              paleoclimatic record of the Chinese loess plateau.  However, most studies of
              the Chinese loess and associated paleosols have dealt with the upper two-thirds
              of this 2.6 million year-long sequence.   The lower one-third, known as the
              Wucheng Formation, has a very different physical appearance, and the data that
              are available suggest that its pedogenic and magnetic properties are also
              different from the upper two-thirds.  These differences are believed to reflect
              the increasing influence of the Tibetan uplift as well as a shift from
              Milankovitch forcing dominated by obliquity and precession to one dominated by
              eccentricity.  This proposal represents a request for support to undertake
              fundamental pedogenic, sedimentologic, and mineral magnetic investigations of
              the Wucheng Formation with the goal of deciphering its paleoclimatic history. 
              We believe that such a study will serve as an important counterpoint to studies
              of the rest of the Chinese loess/paleosol sequence, that it will significantly
              improve our ability to interpret the paleoclimate record of the entire
              sequence, that it will provide new insights about the coupling between marine
              and terrestrial climate, and that it will lead to new opportunities to test
              computer models of atmospheric and oceanic circulation.
