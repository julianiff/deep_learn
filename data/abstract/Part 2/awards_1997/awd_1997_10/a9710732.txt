Abstract    :
              This study focuses on how knowledge about environmental safety is generated and
              how this is translated into different disciplinary and work contexts. More
              specifically, it examines waste management, worker safety, and public health
              practices utilized in nuclear weapons production.  Identifying this package of
              behaviors, risk assessment practices, and decision-making procedures as
              `environmental safety`, this analysis seeks to understand how nuclear weapons
              scientists, engineers, managers, and workers undertook to contain and limit
              damage from the hazardous materials with which they worked. Arguing that
              nuclear weapons production occurs in a dynamic sociotechnical system, the study
              uses changes in environmental safety to illustrate the knowledge flows and
              organizational structures in the Cold War Institution.  The general approach
              will be to track the generation and flow of ecological, health, and safety
              knowledge within the nuclear weapons production process through archival
              research of the laboratories, agencies, and divisions involved in such work. 
              Archival work will also be conducted to determine official policy and
              operational practices at various production sites.
