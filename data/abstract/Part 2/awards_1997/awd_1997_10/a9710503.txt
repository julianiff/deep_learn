Abstract    :
                This is a project to compare two efforts at biodiversity conservation underway
              in two quite different sociopolitical settings.  One of the cases involves the
              Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), a state corporation responsible for administering
              all of Kenya's protected areas and all its wildlife outside protected areas. 
              The other organization is the Malpai Borderlands Group (MPG) in the
              Southwestern United States, an nonprofit organization dedicated to conserving
              the undeveloped wildlands and rangelands of the Southwest and to preserving the
              traditional ways of life of such regions.  Both agencies work in highly charged
              environments, negotiating among powerful and strongly-held interests.  Both
              organizations must also transmit, translate and reformulate scientific and
              policy concerns expressed at the global, national, and local levels. This
              project will examine how this is accomplished and with what level of success in
              two quite different national contexts.
