Abstract    :
              ***  9710670  Kubacki     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              Project continues development of a multi-component deposition process, with
              focus on materials screening and development of organic donors to achieve
              required sensitivity and selectivity using safe materials which will integrate
              easily into semiconductor production facilities.  Multiple component cocktails
              will be investigated to optimize film properties and increase process latitude.
               Phase I demonstrated a new class of highly photosensitive, sub 0.5 micron
              plasma deposited organosilicon resists.  These resists may be photo-oxidatively
              patterned and processed without removal from a vacuum processing environment,
              thereby reducing environmental exposure, using less material, using safer
              material, and creating less waste.  Image development may be delayed with no
              degradation and is accomplished by chlorine based reactive ion sketch (RIE)
              leaving a   robust, negative tone silicon dioxide (SiO2)-like etch mask that
              allows pattern transfer into underlying materials in a single RIE sequence  
              Relationships developed in Phase I will be strengthened and new alliances
              sought as will resources to market the equipment and process.  A demonstration
              vehicle will be selected and arrangements made  with device manufacturers to
              make one or more functional devices using the all dry processing.  This process
              has technical and economic benefits for integrated circuits (IC's),
              micro-machines, displays, modules, photo masks.  ***
