Abstract    :
              SBR-9710450  Michael I. Luger  University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill    This
              award supports travel for a small group of international scholars and U.S.
              graduate students to participate in a research workshop on "information and
              innovative finance for regional development and restructuring."  The workshop
              will be held in conjunction with the fourth international conference on
              Regional Science and Technology Policy Research (RESTPOR), in North Carolina in
              May 1998.  The research workshop will be a focus of the broader conference
              which will include government officials and planners.  Thus, the papers and
              discussions of the workshop will find an immediate audience beyond the academy.
               In addition, the papers and interactions will be reflected in an edited volume
              that the investigator will produce after the workshop.    The four topics for
              the workshop are :  the potential of networked information technologies as a
              tool for regional development;  the operation of  "virtual" regions; 
              information technology and economic development of distressed urban areas;  and
              the financing of information infrastructure.
