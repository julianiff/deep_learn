Abstract    :
                The depletion of the planetary ozone layer is a serious problem of global
              importance.  The international agreement to eliminate ozone depleting
              substances, the Montreal Protocol, was adopted in 1987. Rather than focusing on
              the treaty and the consensus captured by this innovative agreement, this
              research focuses on patterns of social relationships, shared social
              experiences, and negotiated actions that result in implementation.  Future
              environmental regulatory action will benefit from a social scientific
              understanding of the mechanisms of community building and maintenance,
              information flow, and institutional development that are fundamental to the
              implementation process.  This research uses quantitative and qualitative
              methods to assess the structure of the ozone regulatory community, the social
              mechanisms that organize community action, and the effects of community
              structure and dynamics on the careers of ozone protection actors, the outcomes
              of regulatory negotiation , and future environmental protection. The
              quantitative component will use regression and network analysis of survey data
              to evaluate the structure of ozone regulatory field and the organizational
              designs for the future.  In-depth interviews will be used to elucidate stories
              of essential uses and acceptable alternatives as well as career paths of the
              participants.   %%%  The depletion of the planetary ozone layer is a serious
