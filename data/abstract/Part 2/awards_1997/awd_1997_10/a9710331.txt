Abstract    :
              The University of Missouri-Columbia requested support from NSF to  connect the
              Ozarks Technical Community College, Lebanon campus to  the Internet through the
              Missouri Research and Education Network.  This is a small campus with an
              enrollment of approximately 55  students, two full time and twelve part time
              faculty.  The  campus needs the Internet connection to be able to access 
              information resources throughout the state, the nation and the  world.  The
              connection will benefit the faculty, staff students  of this institution as
              well as the community in general.  The  award provides partial support of the
              project for two years.
