Abstract    :
              This research investigates the structure and cause of sunspot penumbra.  The
              investigators use an inversion of data that couple high spatial resolution,
              high spectral resolution, and the full polarization state of light from the
              solar photosphere.  This inversion allows them to determine the vector magnetic
              field and the thermodynamic state in the line-forming region.  Specifically,
              investigators compare and contrast two inversion techniques:  one that allows
              multiple magnetic atmospheres and non-magnetic model atmosphere to contribute
              to the detected signal; the second, a procedure that allows for bulk gradients
              in the velocity field and magnetic vector within the model atmosphere.  The
              more successful inversion procedure dictates which model applies to
              interpreting penumbral observations.  Finally, the investigators answer how,
              why and when penumbrae form in sunspot evolution.  Results from the research
              paint a more coherent physical picture of sunspot penumbrae, where knowledge
              has previously been limited, to attempt understanding magnetohydrodynamic
              phenomena in the sun (especially associated with sunspots).
