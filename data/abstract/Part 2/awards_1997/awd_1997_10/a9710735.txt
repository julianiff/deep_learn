Abstract    :
                    9710735  Stanton  This project is concerned with the design of precast
              concrete  structural systems for seismic regions.  Three linked studies are  by
              separate groups, covering the design, laboratory testing and  analysis of a
              large scale precast concrete structure.  This  project addresses the design,
              the University of California at San  Diego is conducting large-scale testing
              and Lehigh University  plans to perform a program of analysis.    The overall
              goals of the complete testing program are to:         o  provide design
              recommendations for precast concrete              seismic framing systems,     
                o  demonstrate that seismic performance suitable for the               most
              severe seismic regions can be provided by precast           concrete framing
              systems,       o  use the complete superassemblage of precast elements to      
                  investigate features of behavior that are not induced in           the
              statically determinate bean-column connection           specimens that have
              been tested to date.    The tasks in the study cover the design of the test
              structure,  limited comparisons of measured and predicted behavior and 
              drafting of the final design recommendations.  The testing  program will
              provide the final steps needed to equip engineers  and code-writers with the
              information that they need to formalize  suitable design rules and to permit
              this form of construction.    Significant benefits will accrue.  The primary
              ones are that  excellent seismic performance will be demonstrated to be 
              available from precast concrete and that design rules suitable  for inclusion
              in a code will be developed.  At a time when steel  moment frames have, in
              their traditional form, been found wanting  in seismic resistance, designers
              have few options in choosing a  framing system.  Development of a viable
              alternative has the  potential for broadening the range of design alternatives,
               improving performance and reducing construction time and cost.  ***
