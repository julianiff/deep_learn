Abstract    :
              9710354  Odde  This proposal brings a quantitative, engineering perspective  to
              the study of the chemical and mechanical properties of  microtubules (MTs),
              tubular protein filaments found in most  animal cellular cytoplasm.  The three
              aims of the proposed  study are:            The digital image analysis of the
              dynamics of MTs at         the leading edge of newt lung cells and fibroblasts.
               This         study will quantitatively measure the strain within the cell     
                 by direct observation of the dynamics and bending of the         MTs.      
              The thermodynamics of MT assembly and disassembly will  be studied.  The
              hypothesis is that energy is stored as  strain in the MT lattice.  Specific MT
              associated proteins  (MAPs) will be used to disrupt the microtubules and the 
              energy release will be measured by calorimetry.       The relationship of MT to
              MAP binding on the strain  will be studied.  The activity of the MT severing
              enzyme,  katanin, will be measured for both strained and unstrained 
              microtubules.  Katanin may be a key regulator of MT turnover  in-vivo.  ***
