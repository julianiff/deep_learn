Abstract    :
                This project will examine the history of certain forensic sciences to examine
              the changing status of evidence in science, in law, and in historical
              investigation.  The forensic sciences are a set of practical techniques that
              examine traces left by the body.  These techniques may be derived from
              fundamental science, but they are honed for use in a legal setting.  They are
              sciences of the particular in that they do not articulate general laws, as
              physics does, but seek to identify particular individuals and instances so as
              to create plausible stories about the past.  To that extent, the methods and
              aims of the forensic sciences closely resemble those of history and certain
              life sciences.  Among the questions to be addressed by the project are:  How
              are facts produced in different disciplines, from the humanities and social
              sciences to the biological and physical sciences?  How are such facts converted
              into proofs?  How can we understand the different standards of evidence that
              obtain in the laboratory, the courtroom, and the scholar's study?  And how have
              these standards varied in different cultural settings and over time?    This
              project tackles such questions by examining the concrete instances where
              science takes material form in particular contexts.  Among the specific topics
              are the shift in relative credibility of eyewitness reports and circumstantial
              evidence, the role of handwriting analysis in authenticating documents, the use
              of anthropometry and fingerprint analysis, the application of forensic
              anthropology to human remains, the use of lie detectors, and the introduction
              of blood-type and DNA analysis.  The overall  aim is to examine how societies
              have created different `theatres of proof` to coordinate the production of
              proof with the production of justice.  Central to this study is the role of
              expert knowledge in a polity that has become increasingly pluralistic and
              technically complex.                                                 ??` ?Â
