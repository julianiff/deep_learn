Abstract    :
              Cross-linguistic variation in semantics    How can languages vary in mapping
              linguistic form to meanings?  How do  children learn the semantic properties of
              their native language?  Can  there be systematic differences among languages in
              their semantics  unmatched by differences in grammatical structure?  This
              conference  and workshop series will draw on recent advances in semantics and 
              syntax to address such questions with precision.    Three semantic areas will
              be studied:  (1) reference of nominal  expressions (e.g., semantic differences
              among languages that  distinguish "mass" from "count" nominals--like
              English--and those that  do not--like Chinese), (2) verbal aspect and tense,
              and (3)  interpretation of pronouns or other "incomplete" expressions (where 
              this often involves connecting the "anaphoric" expression to some 
              "antecedent") and related matters of scope (the "range" over which  some
              expression operates).  Results will be not only of theoretical  interest but
              also of potential practical significance for such areas  as foreign language
              learning and speech pathology.
