Abstract    :
              9710140  Nelson    The aim of this proposal is to achieve an improved 
              fundamental understanding of the dynamical and structural  evolution of
              amorphous and partially disordered materials.  Density dynamics of super cooled
              liquids in the picosecond  through millisecond range will be examined, together
              with  the mode-coupling theoretical predictions of supercooled  liquid
              behavior.   Linear and (primarily) nonlinear lattice  dynamics in crystals near
              structural phase transitions will  be studied to elucidate anharmonic
              crystalline potential  energy surfaces that dictate phase transition mechanisms
              as  well as the dynamics of phase transitions under the  influence of short
              laser pulses.  Measurements will also be  conducted on thin film structures
              using laser generated  acoustic waves to carry out a systematic study of
              adhesion,  and to develop a new kind of photoacoustic imaging of  patterned
              films and film-substrate assemblies such as those  used in microelectronics. 
              %%%  An understanding of condensed materials such as glass  forming liquids and
              sol-gel glasses with viscous liquid  guests are of tremendous importance to
              industries involved  with the advancement of various technologies dependent on 
              both bulk and thin film materials applications.  For  example, this project
              will develop new techniques that will  allow for the first-time a thorough
              characterization of  adhesion mechanics in highly spatially resolved film 
              substrate structures, the study of semiconductor transitions  under the
              influence of short laser pulses, and density  dynamics in glass forming liquids
              that will allow more  complete testing of theoretical predictions and
              additional  guidance for theoretical development.
