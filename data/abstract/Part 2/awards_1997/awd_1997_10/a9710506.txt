Abstract    :
              9710506  Nur    The PI will continue his laboratory work on Gas Hydrates to 
              experimentally measure P- and S-wave velocities,  permeability and thermal and
              electrical conductivities of  hydrates sediments, as well as model elastic
              transport  properties and strength of hydrates to enable the inversion  of
              seismic data for estimating free in the hydrate system  and below it.  They
              will use the results to analyze existing  marine seismic data with the ultimate
              objective to develop a  methodology for calculating the amount of hydrate in
              ocean  sediments from seismic data.
