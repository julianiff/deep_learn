Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF)
              Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will   assist the
              Department of Chemistry at University of Washington in the   purchase of a 500
              MHz NMR spectrometer. This equipment will enhance   research in a number of
              areas including exchange coupling in transition   metal polyhydrides;
              helix/coil transitions, cold-induced helix unfolding;   energetics and
              mechanisms of reductive elimination reactions; sequence   determinants of the
              folding of recognition domains; dynamics of local   angular motions of specific
              groups in DNA; determination of protein   structure and dynamics; and structure
              elucidation for lesion sites in   damaged DNA.  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
              (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool   available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules.   It is used to identify unknown
              substances, characterize specific   arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
              to study the dynamics of   interactions between molecules in solution. Access
              to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are
              carrying out frontier   research. The results from these NMR studies are useful
              in the areas such   as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
