Abstract    :
                This Phase II SBIR project involves the development, testing and modeling of a
              surfactant foam/bacterial delivery system for in situ remediation of dense
              non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) contaminants.  The Phase I study demonstrated
              the efficacy of combining a surfactant foam technology with bioaugmentation, to
              remediate trichloroethylene (TCE) contaminated aquifers.  Results from this
              initial work suggested that foam facilitated transport of specialized
              microorganisms into subsurface aquifer sediments would result in the
              remediation of DNAPLs through mobilization and dispersion of the DNAPL and
              delivery of viable organisms for biodegradation.  Objectives for the Phase II
              study include optimizing the foam and bacterial injection in order to maximize
              the scouring of the DNAPL and to enhance bacterial survival and
              TCE-degradation.  In addition, this technology will be tested with:  1)
              numerous sediment types, 2) weathered sediment, and 3) other DNAPL
              contaminants.  Data collected from the Phase II work will be used to develop a
              mathematical model to predict the fate of DNAPLs (extent of TCE mobilization
              and rate of TCE degradation) under field conditions.  This model will be used
              to identify factors effecting the mobilization and degradation of TCE in the
              subsurface and will be used to design and predict field remediation efforts. 
              Potential Commercial Applications of the Research  Development of this
              technology will lead to a cost effective in situ bioaugmentation technology for
              treating even the most highly TCE-contaminated aquifers.  Chlorinated solvent
              contamination of aquifers is one of the most common environmental liabilities
              at both government and industrial sites, therefore a process that can
              cost-effectively solve this problem will most likely be a commercial success.
