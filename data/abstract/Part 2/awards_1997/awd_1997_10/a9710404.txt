Abstract    :
              The Foundation for Independent Higher Education requests support  from NSF to
              connect seven of their member institutions of higher  education to the
              Internet.  These include:    Cumberland University, Lebanon, TN    Manor Junior
              College, Jenkintown, PA    Martin Methodist College, Pulaski, TN    Milwaukee
              Institute of Art and Design, Milwaukee, WI    Presentation College, Aberdeen,
              SD    Urbana University, Urbana, OH    Wisconsin Lutheran College, Milwaukee,
              WI  Each of the institutions included will connect to the Internet  using
              service providers in within their respective areas.    These institutions of
              higher education need the Internet  connections to be able to access
              information resources throughout  the state, the nation and the world.  The
              connection will benefit  the faculty, staff students of these institutions as
              well as the  community in general.  The award provides partial support of the 
              project for two years.
