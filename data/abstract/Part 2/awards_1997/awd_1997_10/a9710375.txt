Abstract    :
              ***  9710375  CRAIG  Norman C. Craig of Oberlin College is supported by the
              Experimental   Physical Chemistry Program  to continue his high resolution  
              fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) studies of nonpolar fluorocarbon   molecules.
               The cis or gauche effect predicts that the more polar isomer   has the lower
              energy; Craig will analyze the rotationally-resolved   infrared spectrum of the
              nonpolar isomers of 1,4-difluoro- and   1,4-dichlorobutadienes and the
              microwave spectrum of the polar isomers to   determine their complete
              structures.      The overall goal of these studies is to gain information about
              the   adjustments in molecular bond lengths and angles that accompany changes  
              in a molecule's configuration, that is, in the positions that large atoms   or
              groups of atoms occupy when attached to certain molecular skeletons,   such as
              a rigid carbon-carbon double bond.  The results of these   experiments will
              help in understanding the propensities for one molecular   configuration over
              another and to stimulate high-level theoretical   calculations designed to
              explore these cis or gauche effects.        ***
