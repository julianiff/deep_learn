Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
              novel spray coating methodology for low-cost coating of solution-derived
              ceramic, lithium-ion conductive (IC) thin films for application in
              architectural electrochromic (EC) windows.  Spray coating is potentially a
              low-cost, high-volume, in-line route for difficult-to-process, multi-component
              oxide IC layers.  Phase II research will address scale-up issues for design of
              a full scale prototype in-line coating system.  An objective is to demonstrate
              a functional, aesthetically uniform 25 cm x 30 cm EC device incorporating an IC
              layer coated in a manner approximating conditions of a large-area system. 
              Electrochromic glazings are expected to impact the architectural glass industry
              since building occupants owners will be able to control the shading of their
              window glass electonically.  EC glazings will find application where solar
              control is needed for substantial energy savings and enhanced comfort.  In
              addition to architectural windows, EC glazing will be suited for transportation
              vehicles, large-area displays, recreational products, and consumer appliances. 
              Beyond application in electrochromics, this spray technology may find use in a
              variety of other product technologies requiring multi-component thin films such
              as rechargeable lithium batteries, electro-optical thin films, and specialty
              optical coatings
