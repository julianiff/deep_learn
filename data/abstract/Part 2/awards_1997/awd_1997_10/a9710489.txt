Abstract    :
              SSCP  9710489  Bernholc    The  objective  of  this  study is  to  explore 
              fundamental  chemical  and physical phenomena that influence the ultimate 
              mechanical   properties   and   limits   of   nanotube-based  materials. 
              Recent  advances  in  theoretical  methods   and  supercomputers  make 
              simulations of  breakage  and  failure  mechanisms  feasible.  In the
              simulations to be  undertaken,  the  length  of  a nanotube fragment consisting
               of  several  hundred atoms will be slowly increased until breakage.   The 
              results  of  these simulations will identify  atomistic  and  electronic
              mechanisms of failure, and provide quantitatively  reliable  estimates of the
              strength of nanotubes  and  their  temperature dependence.  %%%  New   evidence
               suggests  that  carbon  nanotubes  are   the  strongest  materials  known, 
              potentially  enabling   unique  applications  in  many areas critical to the 
              U.S.  economy.  This  research  will  involve  direct  measurements  of  the 
              strength  of  nanotube  ropes using micromanipulators.   The  results  will 
              provide  the  foundation  for  research   and  development  of  nanotube  based
              superstrong  materials  and  their applications  ***
