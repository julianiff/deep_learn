Abstract    :
              This project is building and experimenting with a prototype video server, which 
              extends the Stony Brook Video Server (SBVS). Developed over the past two years,
               SBVS provides an end-to-end performance guarantee for digital video delivery
              from  the server's disk, through multi-hop Ethernet-based networks, to the
              client's  display.  The extended server, called Stonehenge, will eventually
              store lectures  for use on all 64 SUNY campuses.  Stonehenge has three unique
              aspects:  (1) it  provides software tolerance to disk failures, maintaining
              performance guarantees  in the presence of faults;  (2) it integrates disk and
              tape arrays, and includes  dynamic striping and load balancing; (3) detailed
              performance and traffic  statistics from the running video server will be
              collected and analyzed.
