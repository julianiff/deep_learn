Abstract    :
              Semiconductor manufacturing technologies now enable the placement of up to 50 
              million devices on one die, and allow clock speeds to approach the GHz range. 
              These advances, however, are accompanied by larger yield losses (both 
              catastrophic and parametric) and lower reliability. This project is on the 
              development of techniques for improved yield-reliability estimation and 
              enhancement. These techniques include hierarchical yield estimation and 
              enhancement, minimum perturbation approach for yield and reliability
              enhancement  and new methods for crosstalk and electromigration minimization.
              The tradeoffs  among yield, reliability and other optimization goals such as
              speed and area, are  being investigated as well. This research emphasizes the
              integration of the yield  and reliability enhancement objectives with the
              primary goals of performance and  area, while keeping design data volumes
              manageable. A major focus of the project  is on proving the advantages of the
              new techniques by implementing and  integrating them into existing design
              frameworks.
