Abstract    :
              Wise and Janecek  OPP 9710358  This award supports the activities of a committee
              of marine  geologists, designated SHALDRIL (shallow drilling), to  investigate
              the technical feasibility of installing a shallow  drilling system on vessels
              of the US Antarctic Program (USAP).  The committee held an organizational
              meeting in December, 1996,  at which it discussed several existing systems that
              might be  suitable for use on USAP vessels.  Some of the systems are still  in
              development, but two seemed particularly promising for use in  Antarctic
              waters.  These are 1) The Dolphin in situ sampling and  testing system by Fugro
              McClelland Marine Geosciences, Inc.,  Houston, Texas, and 2) the Terrabor
              system developed by A/S  Terrabor-Namsos in collaboration with the Institute of
              Solid  Earth Geophysics-Bergen, both located in Norway.    The SHALDRIL
              committee plans to hold a workshop in late August,  1997, to further evaluate
              these drilling systems with a goal of  field testing one or more of them on
              USAP ships in the near  future.  Prior to the August workshop, however, an
              technical  evaluation of the suitability and feasibility of installing these 
              systems on the USAP ships Nathaniel B. Palmer and L. M. Gould  must be carried
              out by a professional engineer. With that  information in hand, the committee
              can then consider recommending  future field tests and eventually field
              studies.    This award provides funds to support the SHALDRIL committee's 
              activities during 1997, namely to 1) commission the engineering  study of the
              candidate drilling systems, and 2) to cover the  costs of its meeting in late
              August.  This meeting is expected to  be held in or near Tallahassee, Florida,
              over a three day period.
