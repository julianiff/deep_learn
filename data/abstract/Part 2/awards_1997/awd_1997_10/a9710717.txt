Abstract    :
              9710717  Harshavardhan   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              project has the primary objective of developing high temperature
              superconducting (HTS) films with a high power handling capability for high
              power RF (radio frequency) and microwave components.  Even though HTS thin film
              components exhibit very high-Q values, their power handling capability is often
              limited, imposing restrictions on the range of possible applications.  Power
              handling capability of HTS films continues to be a challenging arena requiring
              improvements. Leveraging on several successful advances made in the area of
              epitaxial HTS thin films and prototype device development on various
              technologically important substrates, the proposer explored new materials with
              possible high power handling capability.  The approach combined improved
              superconducting microwave properties in Ag-doped YBCO films with the design
              flexibility offered by a low dielectric constant substrate (MgF2) in achieving
              this goal.  Microwave measurements have been carried out.  Parallel Plate
              Resonators made from the YBCO films on MgF show no inter- modulation products
              within 41 dB of the carrier at surface field strengths of up to 0.5 mT at 77-80
              K indicating a possible high power handling capability in these films.  Based
              on the success achieved in Phase I, the proposer will, refine the materials
              properties of AG:YBCO for optimum performance in the Phase II program.  By
              further refining the AG:YBCO materials base, they will build prototype band
              pass filters with high power handling capability (30-40 dBm) operating at 77 K
              in the frequency range around 2 GHz and 10 GHz.   The major reduction in volume
              and weight together with improved performance of such devices in emerging high
              performance Transmit/Receive systems have a large market potential both in
              defense and civilian telecommunications.  ***
