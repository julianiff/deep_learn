Abstract    :
              ***  9710596  Liszka    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              will research, refine, and optimize a novel adaptive meshless technology, named
              hp-clouds, for the solution of large-scale 3D incompressible viscous flows with
              conjugate heat transfer.  In hp-cloud methods, the solution of the governing
              differential equations is obtained without resorting to a finite element/volume
              mesh or finite difference cells -- the approach removes the burden of mesh
              generation.  High-quality local approximations are built around a 'sprinkle' of
              nodal points (such local supports being termed as 'clouds'), and can be
              h-adapted (by simply inserting more nodal points) or locally enriched i.e.
              p-adapted by stacking-up more degrees-of-freedom at a chosen node.  The
              proposed hp-clouds technology is an original generalization of the moving least
              squares approximation methods used in various existing meshless implementations
              (such as the Element-Free-Galerkin-Method).  Current research shows that
              hp-clouds is computationally efficient, is easy to adapt to the geometry,
              evolving and directional solution features, and possesses high potential for
              parallel computations.  Since no mesh connectivity is required, this method
              offers immense flexibility in design optimization processes when changes to
              geometric shapes and addition/removal of components are frequent.    A
              successful completion of the proposed project will result in pre-commercial
              technology and software which will be ready for immediate application in
              computer-aided-engineering (CAE) design and analysis tools.  These tools will
              find immediate application across a wide range of manufacturing industries,
              including automotive, casting, molding and extrusion, food and chemical.,
              turbo-machinery, and others.    ***
