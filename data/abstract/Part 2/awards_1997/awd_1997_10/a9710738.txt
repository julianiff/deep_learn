Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of  NCRI's
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides  partial
              support for two years for OC-3 connections for eleven institutions  to an OC-48
              California statewide network.  The network will be connected to  the vBNS in
              two places:  the Los Angeles Basin, and the San Francisco Bay  area.   The
              eleven institutions are:  University of California campuses at  Berkeley,
              Davis, Irvine, Riverside, San Francisco, Santa Barbara and Santa  Cruz;
              Stanford; CalTech; University of Southern California and the  Information
              Sciences Institute.  The over 40 applications cover fields such  as
              metacomputing; distributed interactive simulation; remote telescope  operation,
              microscopy and tele-imaging for health care;  digital libraries;  and projects
              in physics, biology and communications.  Collaborating  institutions include
              Oak Ridge National Lab, Rice, Argonne National  Laboratory, Los Alamos National
              Laboratory, Syracuse University, University  of Tennessee and the University of
              Texas.
