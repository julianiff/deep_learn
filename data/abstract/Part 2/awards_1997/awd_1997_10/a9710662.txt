Abstract    :
              This project will collect national time-diary data to test substantive and
              methodological hypotheses related to people's use of time in modern societies. 
              Using established diary procedures with CATI interviewing, about 1500 adult
              respondents will be asked to complete a `yesterday` diary detailing their
              activities, when and with whom they did the activities, and whether they were
              engaged in secondary activities while they accomplished various tasks.  Data
              will be collected to be consistent with 1965, 1975, and 1985 national studies
              to allow exact cross-time comparisons.  The substantive significance of the
              research revolves around long-term trends in the time adults spend in various
              types of social contact, with particular interest in time spent with children
              and spouses and time spent alone.  This research will assess whether time
              devoted to conversations, child care, and doing activities with other family
              members has been declining, as has been suggested by authors using `social
              capital` explanations and related theoretical perspectives.  The methodological
              significance of the study centers on the problems survey respondents have in
              making accurate estimates of the time they spend on various activities. 
              Previous research has indicated systematic and consistent patterns of over-and
              under-reporting in estimates of time spent at paid work, and the present study
              will examine whether similar patterns apply to estimate questions about
              housework, religion, and organizational activities.
