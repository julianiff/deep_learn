Abstract    :
                Marion Technical College will use this grant to connect its  campus to the
              Internet using OARnet, an Ohio based ISP.  Marion  Technical College is a
              two-year college offering 30 technical  degree and certificate programs.  The
              college has over 1600  students and 100 faculty and staff.    The college needs
              the Internet connection to be able to access  information resources throughout
              the state, the nation and the  world.  The connection will benefit the faculty,
              staff students  of this institution as well as the community in general.  The 
              award provides partial support of the project for two years.
