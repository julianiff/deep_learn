Abstract    :
               This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop,
              optimize, and qualify significantly better varistors by the engineering of
              interfaces.  The need for better varistors originates from the fact that almost
              all electronic devices are subject to noise and high voltage surges from
              integrated circuits(IC)integration, switching or electrostatic discharge. 
              These surges and noises can severely affect the performance of electrical and
              electronic devices.  The Phase I effort demonstrated a technology that can help
              meet the current and near-term performance needs from varistors.  The
              proof-of-concept varistors featured higher non-linear coefficient, lower
              leakage current, and higher critical electric field values while simultaneously
              being miniaturizable.  The Phase I results also helped attract venture capital
              interest.  Phase II now seeks to develop, optimize and held test file
              varistors.  The optimized product will be the basis lot commercialization.  
              Nanostrtictured varistors have significant commercial potential for pulse and
              surge suppression and voltage stabilization in low and high voltage circuits as
              well as for noise reduction in communications and computer systems.
