Abstract    :
              Villa Maria College will use this grant to connect its Buffalo, NY campus to the
              Internet using NYSERNET, a New York based ISP. Villa Maria College is a
              two-year college with a wide range of programs.    The college needs the
              Internet connection to be able to access information resources throughout the
              state, the nation and the world.  The connection will benefit the faculty,
              staff students of this institution as well as the community in general.  The
              award provides partial support of the project for two years.
