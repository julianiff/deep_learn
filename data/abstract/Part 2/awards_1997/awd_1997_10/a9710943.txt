Abstract    :
              ***  9710943  Noto    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
              project utilizes emerging technology to produce high resolution, tunable
              Fabry-Perot etalons with no moving parts.  It utilizes new liquid crystal (LC)
              technology to grow precision nematic crystals onto the surface of traditional
              etalon plates and to control etalon resonant wavelength by application of a
              variable electric field.  The LC technique is the centerpiece of the proposed
              instrument and is expected to be an essential component in future spectroscopy.
                 Several prototype devices will be constructed with an ultra-high resolution
              etalon for use in LIDAR systems and a spectral imaging system for either RAMAN
              imaging or aeronomical all-sky Doppler imaging.  The technology will be
              applicable to many problems, ranging from process spectroscopy, where a
              spectroscopic analyzer is used on a production line for process control, to
              needs in space science for highly capable, inexpensive instrumentation.  This
              technology may also find uses in ground-based optical aeronomy, where tight
              budgets call for new instruments with expanded capabilities and that are fully
              automated and capable of surviving in harsh environments.  ***
