Abstract    :
               9710509 Kavanagh  This project strives for greater basic understanding of the
              origins of anisotropic strain relaxation in epitaxially strained InxGa(1-x)As.
              The project addresses fundamental research issues and encompasses
              identification of basic mechanisms of asymmetric strain relaxation in compound
              semiconductors in general, along with an orientation toward technologically
              relevant material combinations.  The approach involves a systematic study of
              the effects of sample miscut and doping which are expected to provide a precise
              method to compare the effects of different mechanisms. Both InP and GaAs
              substrates will be used allowing the study of anisotropies in high In
              compositions, and the investigation of the effects of a phosphide based
              substrate on InGaAs relaxation processes. %%% The project addresses basic
              research issues in a topical area of materials science having high
              technological relevance.  The research will contribute basic materials science
              knowledge at a fundamental level to important aspects of electronic/photonic
              devices and integrated circuitry.  Additionally, the fundamental knowledge and
              understanding gained from the research is expected to contribute in a general
              way to improving the performance of advanced devices and circuits by providing
              a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved
              materials, and materials combinations.  An important feature of the program is
              the integration of research and education through the training of students in a
              fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***
