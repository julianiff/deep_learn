Abstract    :
                        9710314  Schmidt    This award funds research by the principle
              investigator on four broad topics in Number Theory. The first topic is linear
              recurrence sequences,  and research on this will necessitate refinements of the
              Subspace Theorem. The second topic concerns  Diophantine approximation both in
              the classical and in the power series context.  For the third topic, the PI
              wishes to contribute to questions connected with Artin's conjecture on p-adic
              forms, in particular bounds replacing the d^2 (which was proved wrong) in the
              conjecture, and information on the primes p for which the conjecture is
              actually true.  The fourth topic is a particular project on solution trees of
              congruences in one variable.      This research falls into the general
              mathematical field of Number Theory.  Number Theory has its historical roots in
              the study of the whole numbers,  addressing such questions as those dealing
              with the divisibility of one  whole number by another. It is among the oldest
              branches of mathematics and was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic
              reasons. However, within  the last half century it has become an indispensable
              tool in diverse  applications in areas such as data transmission and
              processing, and  communication systems.
