Abstract    :
              This study will bring to the fore essential questions concerning the center and
              periphery of science by focusing on the collaboration between the British
              savants and the British Admiralty in the early Victorian era.  William Whewell
              and Sir Francis Beaufort were central  in placing the empirical investigation
              of oceanic tides on a firm foundation.  The present study will add an important
              and still unstudied dimension to William Whewell's achievements by analyzing
              his twenty-five year research project on the tides. It also will unveil Sir
              Francis Beaufort's role as the principal link between scientists and the
              British Admiralty in the early Victorian era.  Support will be used to carry
              out research on the following unpublished manuscript sources: 1) the Whewell
              Papers at Trinity College, Cambridge; 2) the Francis Beaufort collection at the
              National Maritime Museum, and the Hydrographic Office; 3) John Lubbock's papers
              at the Royal Society; 4) Records of the Admiralty at the Public Records Office,
              London, and the National Maritime Museum; and 5) local records where a Royal
              Naval Dockyard operated: Bristol, Plymouth, Portsmouth, and Liverpool.
