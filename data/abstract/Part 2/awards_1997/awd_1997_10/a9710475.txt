Abstract    :
              9710475  Hemley    The PIs will address two major geological questions using a 
              combination of  high-pressure  experiments (both multi-anvil devices and
              laser-heated diamond  cells) and first-principles quantum-mechanical
              calculations:  1)  How does the redox state affect the relative stability of
              the  major constituents of the mantle and core? and 2) How does the  redox
              state effect the partitioning of geophysically and  geochemically important
              elements among major mantle and core  phases?  Their objective is to develop
              new avenues of research  regarding the Earth's redox state, ranging from the
              practical to  the fundamental: for example, from developing means of 
              characterizing and controlling redox state in experiments at  ultrahigh
              pressures (P) and  temperatures (T), to understanding the meaning of a
              component's  fugacity at P-T conditions far above the critical point.  Multi 
              institutional collaboration will be an important aspect of this  research both
              because of the diversity of state-of-the-art  experimental and theoretical
              methods to be employed (no one or  two groups have sufficient expertise), and
              because this will  allow significant cross-checks of the results between
              different  laboratories, between different experimental methods, and between 
              theory and experiment.  ***
