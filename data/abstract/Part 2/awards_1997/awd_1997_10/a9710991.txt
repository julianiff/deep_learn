Abstract    :
                The flow microstructure of non-cohesive granular materials will be measured by
              using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with improved spatial and temporal
              resolution.  The main objective is better understanding of motion of
              particulate systems when the particulates are shaken, mixed and shared.  
              Non-intrusive capacitive probes will be used for density (solids concentration)
              measurements, and a high speed camera will provide information on
              inter-particle collisions in the proximity of transparent walls.  Quasi-two-
              and three-dimensional flow domains will be considered.  The connection between
              particle-particle and particle-wall interactions on the overall flow pattern
              will be probed, and experimental data for model verification will be obtained. 
                 The experiments have direct relevance to convection-driven particle
              separation and particle compaction.  The interpretation of the results has
              relevance to a broader category of phenomena in particle handling and
              processing.
