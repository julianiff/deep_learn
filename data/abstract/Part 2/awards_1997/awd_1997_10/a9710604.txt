Abstract    :
              This dissertation project explores how amputees use prosthetic technology to
              perform able-bodiedness, and how they collaborate with bioengineers and
              prosthetists to develop this technology.  American culture values the physical
              appearance of able-bodiedness and the capacity to perform activities such as
              standing and walking.  Amputees' uses of prosthetic technology to perform such
              activities are revealing of American conceptions of bodies and bodily movement.
               An examination of the social collaborations involved in reconstructing
              amputees' bodies offers an opportunity to study concepts of able-bodiedness and
              physical disability, and the relationship between bodies and technology in
              American culture.  This project will enable the investigator to do a
              cross-cultural comparison by supporting travel to India and Cambodia to study
              the Jaipur ankle-foot prosthesis.  The Jaipur foot is a form of Third World
              appropriate prosthetic technology, and offers an opportunity to develop a
              cross-cultural perspective on materials, methods of technology  manufacture,
              and the cultural context of consumer use of prosthetic technology.  This
              project will be conducted in two field sites: Sawai Man Singh Hospital in
              Jaipur, India, and a prosthetics workshop near Phnom Penh, Cambodia.  f8 Û-ª  þ
