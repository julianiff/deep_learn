              ABSTRACT  ATM-9710332  Colwell, Rita  American Society for Microbiology  Title:
              Climate Variability and Human Health: An Interdisciplinary  Vision, a
              Colloquium to be held June 1997 in Puerto Vallarta,  Mexico     This award
              partially supports an interdisciplinary colloquium on  climate variability and
              change and human health.  The product from  the colloquium would be a
              comprehensive, analytical peer-reviewed  report and action plan.  Approximately
              40 scientists and science  managers will participate.  The colloquium addresses
              the critical  issue of climate variability and change and their impacts on
              human  health.  The subject is relevant to the national and international 
              Global Change Research Program (GCRP) and to societal activities  around the
              world.  The colloquium report and plan for future  actions will be a valuable
              product of the meeting and should help  the science agencies in this country
              and abroad to plan future GCRP  work in this area.
