Abstract    :
              Principal Investigator:  James Lawler    Title:  Research on Plasma Light
              Sources    In this research, investigations into the use of suitable atomic
              systems for High Intensity Discharge (HID) plasma lighting will be carried out.
              The research has three parts: (1) investigation and measurements of the
              radiative lifetimes of the rare earth elements Dysprosium (Dy) and Holmium (Ho)
              as promising candidates for use in high intensity discharge lamps, (2)
              development of a two photon absorption technique as a diagnostic for high
              intensity discharge lamps (3) investigation of atomic Barium (Ba) as a possible
              atomic radiator of much greater efficiency than is currently available.  This
              third investigation could represent a breakthrough for the plasma lighting
              industry.  The lighting industry consortium ALITE has identified the search for
              new HID gaseous radiating systems as a research topic with the highest priority
              for the development of improved light sources.  Improved light sources is an
              area of significant economic and environmental importance for the Untied States
              and for the world.
