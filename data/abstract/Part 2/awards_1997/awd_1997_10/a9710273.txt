Abstract    :
                This project builds and expands upon a successful  Calculus Reform Project
              focused on recruiting and retaining minority students in the calculus sequence
              at CUNY-Manhattan.  The program emphasizes collaborative work on complex, real
              world problems, using appropriate technology, making film animations of
              algorithms, creating portfolios and doing research.  This project extends this
              interactive, dynamic learning environment to pre-calculus courses as well as to
              statistics courses.  Project results should reflect an increase in the number
              of women enrolling in calculus courses, improve the retention of women in
              pre-calculus and statistics courses, and improve the likelihood of women
              becoming mathematics majors.
