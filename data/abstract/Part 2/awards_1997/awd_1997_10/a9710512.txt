Abstract    :
              9710512  Walden  This award to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Woods
              Hole, Massachusetts, will provide new instrumentation to be used in conjunction
              with deep submergence vehicle Alvin, a submersible operated by WHOI as part of
              the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS), and with the
              remotely operated vehicle Jason, both of which are available to support ocean
              sciences research projects to investigators from throughout the U.S. 
              Instrumentation includes new data logging and video acquisition systems, a new
              laser-ring gyroscope for vehicle navigation, a "virtual Alvin" software system
              for pilot and observer training, new flotation to increase payload, a new
              scanning sonar for obstacle avoidance and scientific study of seafloor
              morphology, and several other items to improve the scientific capabilities of
              both Alvin and Jason.  The shared-use instrumentation supported here will
              assist researchers to conduct studies throughout the world ocean in 1997 and in
              future years.  ***
