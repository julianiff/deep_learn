Abstract    :
                This grant helps support expenses for key participants for this Geological
              Society of America (GSA) Presidential Conference on `Ethics and the
              Geoscientist` in Welches (Mt. Hood), Oregon.  Co-sponsors are GSA, the American
              Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG), the American Institute of
              Professional Geologists (AIPG), and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).  The
              conference is for a maximum of 100 invited and voluntary participants.  The
              great majority are geoscientists, but key participants include philosophers,
              ethicists, attorneys, judges, planners, and journalists, representing academic,
              governmental, and private sectors.  The primary conference goals are to promote
              dialogue within the geosciences community on ethical issues and to develop a
              framework for assembly and dissemination of information on these issues.  The
              conference will emphasize how to foster and promote ethical behavior. 
              Discussions will identify and discuss types of ethical systems, cultural
              controls on ethical behavior, case histories, issues in professional
              certification and enforcement in an ethical framework, codes of ethics and
              legal concerns associated with them, and means of instilling, fostering, and
              communicating ethical behavior.  The conference serves to assemble an
              interdisciplinary group to serve as catalysts in future promotion of ethical
              awareness, as well as disseminators and implementers for conference results. 
              The conveners will submit conference reports for publication in the literature
              of their organizations and others who have expressed interest.  Follow-up
              symposia and posting of information on the web sites of geoscience
              organizations should also develop.
