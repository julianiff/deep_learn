Abstract    :
              9710940  Alo, Richard A.  University of Houston - Downtown    CONACyT:
              Distributed Simulation of Multimodal Interfaces and Intelligent Agents in
              Virtual Environments    This international cooperative project with LANIA and
              UNAM proposes collaborative research in areas of high performance computation
              and architecture distributed AI, multimodal interfaces, and computer simulation
              of virtual environments. Planned are exchange of research, teaching faculty,
              technical support personnel, and graduate and undergraduate students associated
              with collaborating researchers. Moreover, design and adaptation of new courses
              (particularly in parallel processing and graphics) to be offered, development
              of a graphics classroom laboratory, and joint research workshops are also
              planned.
