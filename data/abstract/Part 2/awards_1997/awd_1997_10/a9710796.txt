Abstract    :
                Air quality in the Los Angeles basin is compromised by  reactive gases and
              particulates that lead to the formation  of nitrogen oxides and ozone.  These
              pollutants are known to  have deleterious effects on biological organisms, most
               notably among plant species.  A proper understanding of the  biological
              mechanisms of air pollution damage will be  critical to informed policy making.
               This project will use a  small plant in the mustard family, Arabidopsis, to
              study the  impact of air pollutants on plants at multiple levels  molecular,
              biochemical, individual and population.  An  interdisciplinary training
              environment will be provided for  the research students involved in the project
