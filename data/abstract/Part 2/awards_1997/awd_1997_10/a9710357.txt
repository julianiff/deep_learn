Abstract    :
              Elliot, Collinson, Hammer  OPP 9710357  Earth science research in the central
              and southern  Transantarctic Mountains during the last 35 years has  provided a
              wealth of new information on the geologic  evolution of the Ross Sea sector of
              the continent.  Many of  these advances have had significance to the global 
              geosciences community, such as the vertebrate faunas,  anatomically well
              preserved plant fossils, and the young  fossiliferous glacial deposits
              indicating radically  different climatic conditions.  This award supports a 
              workshop aimed at capitalizing on these past advances by  developing a white
              paper on possible future research  directions and identifying key scientific
              questions that can  be addressed.  Research goals fall into four general topic 
              areas: Late Precambrian-Early Paleozoic development;  Gondwana paleontology and
              paleoclimate; Mesozoic and  Cenozoic tectonic evolution; and Cenozoic landscape
               evolution and paleoclimate.  The workshop will also address  the support
              required to carry out remote field projects in  this new ear of logistic
              capabilities.  The workshop will  lead to a report that will lay out scientific
              goals for  future research in the central and southern Transantarctic 
              Mountains.
