Abstract    :
                  9710436  Weir  A summer institute in statistical genetics will be held at
              North Carolina State University for two weeks in June of 1997, 1998 and 1999.
              The institute will consist of a series of two- or three-day workshops designed
              to teach current statistical methods to geneticists. As increasing amounts of
              molecular genetic data become available, there is an increasing need for
              statistical analyses to extract all the information and make inferences. The
              need has become urgent in the search for genes affecting both discrete and
              quantitative traits, in the interpretation of DNA and protein sequence data for
              evolutionary studies, and in the use of genetic profiles for individual
              identification. The institute will offer instruction in each of these areas, as
              well as in basic statistical concepts. Because long-term progress in
              interpreting genetic data is going to require the involvement of people with
              advanced statistical training and skills, the institute will also offer a
              workshop in basic genetics for statisticians. This application is for funding
              to allow students, who would otherwise be unable, to attend the institute.
