Abstract    :
                This award is made under the high performance connections portion  of NCRI's
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides partial
              support for the installation and operation of  a OC-3 ATM connection to a
              cooperative PoP connecting the North  Carolina Supercomputing Center, Duke
              University, North Carolina  State University and the University of North
              Carolina, Chapel Hill  and the the Very High Performance Backbone Network
              Service (vBNS).    Applications include:  - Computational cardiovascular
              modeling  - Medical imaging and physiological modeling  - Computational
              astrophysics and relativity  - Computational chemistry and visualization to
              protein chemistry  - Quantum mechanical calculations for Altzheimer's Disease 
              - Transient analysis of hypersonic aircraft inlets  - Telemedicine program   
              The award provides partial support of the project for two years.
