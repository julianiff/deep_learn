                         Investigator Initiated Principal Investigator:    Philip C. Wankat
              Affiliation:                       Purdue University      This grant is awarded
              through the Separations and Purification Program sub-element of the
              Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of the Chemical and Transport
              Systems Division. The principal investigator is Dr. Philip C. Wankat at Purdue
              University. The research will evaluate a new method for the regeneration of
              adsorption columns. The method uses hot pure adsorbate vapor to heat the
              column. The latent heat available in the vapor is used to heat the column when
              the adsorbate vapor condenses on the adsorbent. A cold inert purge gas is used
              to purge the adsorbate out of the hot bed. Unlike  normal steam regeneration,
              the heating and purge steps are decoupled. Pure adsorbate is recovered from the
              purge gas by condensation. The purge gas is cleaned in a newly regenerated bed
              and recycled. Solute movement theory (local equilibrium analysis) and numerical
              solution will be used to predict regeneration.     Regeneration of adsorbents
              is an energy intensive step that controls the cost of commercial systems. The
              proposed technology should significantly reduce energy requirements, improve
              regeneration rates and enhance process efficiency. This would have an impact on
              various gas adsorption and separation technologies.
