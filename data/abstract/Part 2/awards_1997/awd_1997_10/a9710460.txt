Abstract    :
               This is a study of inter-racial contact and racial attitudes.  It uses data
              from the Monitoring the Future survey, a repeated cross-sectional survey of
              U.S. high school seniors carried out annually since 1976. Data have been
              collected each year from approximately 125 public and private high schools
              using a multi-stage cluster sampling procedure to obtain a nationally
              representative sample of high school seniors. Data for the years 1976-77,
              1981-82, 1986-87, and 1991-92 will be analyzed. Across these years, a sample of
              roughly 26,000 respondents will be obtained. The research will focus
              specifically on contact between African Americans and Caucasians since these
              are the only two racial groups identified in the data available. Log-linear
              models and structural equation models will be used to estimate the hypothesized
              relationships.      The purpose of the research is to examine the effect of
              interracial contact on racial attitudes among U.S. high school seniors and
              determine the conditions under which interracial contact fosters racial
              tolerance. The research has three objectives: (1) to examine the social
              structural basis of interracial contact, (2) to examine the effects of
              different types of interracial contact on the perceived quality of interracial
              contact, and (3) to examine the effects of interracial contact on racial
              attitudes and the way in which perceptions of the quality of contact condition
              these effects.     Research on how inter-racial contact and racial attitudes
              are related tests fundamental sociological theories of social influence and the
              relationship between attitudes and behavior.  In seeking to determine whether
              interracial contact affects racial attitudes and the ways in which such contact
              is socially structured, this research will provide new information about the
              consequences of racial segregation in the United States.
