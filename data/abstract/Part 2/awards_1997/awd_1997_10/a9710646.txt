Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a
              portable, effective, low cost and easy to use hard X-ray or gamma-ray
              inspection system for structural damage assessment.  Quick and effective
              laboratory and field nondestructive evaluation of structural damage is
              important for earthquake studies.  In Phase I, a conceptual design using the
              CSL high sensitivity, direct photon-electron conversion X-ray image system
              demonstrated a novel real-time nondestructive structural damage measurement
              technique for concrete with a spatial resolution of 14 lp/mm.  This new
              technique will be developed to a hard x-ray or a gamma-ray image detecting and
              processing system to directly visualize and quantify the structural damage,
              including damage location, damage pattern and sizes.  A real-time damaging
              process can be monitored, recorded and transferred by this fast hard X-ray or
              gamma-ray detector and the associated image transfer network system.  Together
              with the National Center for Earthquake Engineering Research at SLNY Buffalo,
              CSL will conduct a series of experiments to quantify the major design
              parameters of the prototype system and to prove the feasibility of this novel
              technique  This system will benefit the inspection and real-time monitoring of
              civil engineering structures including bridges, utility structures, aging
              schools, as well as residential buildings.
