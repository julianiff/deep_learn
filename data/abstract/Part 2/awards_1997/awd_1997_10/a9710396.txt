              Abstract    Collier  9710396    This research explores the intersections and
              conflicts among legal orders in Chiapas, Mexico where active debate over how to
              create a multi-cultural democracy is ongoing.  The increasing penetration of
              the cash economy and state law into indigenous communities  has been rapid. 
              The research builds on the investigator's work done in the same region in the
              1960s that analyzed "Zinacanteco law."  The current exploration of ongoing
              economic and political changes in Zinacantan focuses on how people in Tzotzil
              Maya township are revising and reimagining their dispute management procedures
              in response to the apparently contradictory forces of economic modernization
              and political pressure to emphasize  ethnic distinctiveness.  By focusing on
              the concept of "reconciliation," she investigates how women and men of various
              ages and economic conditions are invoking notions of "indigenous" and "human"
              rights to argue over the meaning and enforcement of traditional customs.  The
              research uses established anthropological methods of interviewing, case record
              analysis, and participant observation.. Three kinds of changes in the legal
              system will be analyzed: dispute management procedures, who initiates
              settlements, and the discourse of indigenous custom. The project extends
              theoretical developments in anthropological analyses and applications of
              dispute resolution.    %%%    This research explores the intersections and
