Abstract    :
                    9710204  Wight  The research project will investigate the seismic response
              of  exterior frame connections in composite (steel-concrete)  structures, with
              emphasis on defining a "repairable damage" limit  state and investigating the
              effectiveness of standard repair  methods for composite connections.  Currently
              such connection  subassemblies are being subjected to reversed cyclic loading
              of  increasing displacement magnitudes, eventually reaching  displacement
              levels corresponding to approximately 5% interstory  drift.  This degree of
              interstory drift is beyond the "life  safety" limit state and approximately at
              the "collapse  prevention" limit state.  Approximately four of the six
              specimens  for repair will be retested and two additional RCS exterior 
              connections with designs similar to two of the original specimens  will be
              constructed for retesting.  These specimens will be  subjected to reversed
              cyclic loading to increasing displacements,  stopping the testing at interstory
              drift level should be below  the "life safety" limit state, but beyond the
              "immediate  occupancy" limit state.    Post-test analytical studies will be
              used to simulate the  measured RCS connection behavior during both its original
              and  repaired behavior.  The degree of stiffness and strength  retention, and
              amount of energy dissipation capacity at various  interstory drift levels, will
              be compared between all specimens,  with special emphasis on the comparison of
              the results for the  same connection in its "original" and "repaired"
              conditions.   Analytical models will be developed for use in trial designs of 
              RCS frames structures.  The analytical modeling and trial designs  will be
              coordinated with current U.S. research projects on RCS  frames at other U.S.
              universities and Japanese research  institutions.    This is a project
              supported under the NSF initiative No. 94-154  "Composite and Hybrid
              Structures".  ***
