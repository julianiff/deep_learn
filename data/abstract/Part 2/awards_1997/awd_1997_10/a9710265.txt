Abstract    :
              9710265  Devereux    This program creates a new two-year MasterOs Program in the
               field of materials science at the University of Connecticut.  Three existing
              groups collaborate in the program: the  Institute of Materials Science (IMS)
              Associates Program, the  Connecticut State Technology Extension Program
              (CONN/STEP),  and the U. Conn. Materials Science Department.  This program 
              exposes first year students to industrial activities and  related business and
              finance issues.  The students travel  with CONN/STEP field engineers to
              industrial sites to  experience industrial problems and their solutions.  In 
              their second year the students research an industrial  problem that has
              educational value as well as industrial  impact.  They write a thesis and a
              final report on the  Masters Program. Through this approach the Masters Program
               provides the students with a combination of industrial  perspective, problem
              solving skills, teamwork and pertinent  business issues related to management
              and finance.   This  education grant is funded through the MPS Office of 
              Multidisciplinary Activities and the Division of Materials  Research.  %%% 
              This grant promotes novel opportunities for students to  prepare for academic,
              industrial, government and non-  traditional roles (such as communication,
              business,  leadership, ethics, mentoring) and assists in integration of 
              research and training with curricula.  ***
