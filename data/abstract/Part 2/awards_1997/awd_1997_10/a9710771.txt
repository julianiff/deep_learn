Abstract    :
              This award from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the   Division
              of Chemistry provides partial support to enable the   participation of eight to
              ten assistant professors and a similar number   of ACS Division of Analytical
              Chemistry graduate student award winners in   the 1997 Gordon Research
              Conference on Analytical Chemistry.  This   conference is entitled `Measurement
              Problems and Tools Arising from   Combinatorial Synthesis` and it focuses on
              the current and emerging   problems of doing analytical chemistry on enormous
              numbers of small   samples produced by this new approach to chemistry.  Much of
              the effort   in this area is presently resident in small venture capital
              companies and   this conference would expose bright, young analytical chemists
              from   academe to the opportunities in combinatorial chemistry.  This award
              enables participation of young analytical faculty and graduate   students in
              the 1997 Gordon Research Conference on Analytical Chemistry.    The focus is on
              analytical problems arising in the area of combinatorial   synthesis and the
              consequent explosive growth in the need for fast,   sensitive, and selective
              analysis of many, small samples.
