Abstract    :
              Abstract - Suib - 9710973    The use of microwave heating to induce chemical
              reactions is being studied to determine whether or not there are inherent
              advantages to using microwave heating over more classical heating methods. 
              Recent reviews have focused on fundamental mechanistic aspects, hardware,
              system design and applications of microwave heating.  In addition, recent
              symposia have addressed the use of microwave heating in waste management,
              chemical synthesis, advanced dielectric processing, and in medical and food
              technology, among others.    This grant is to provide partial support for the
              2nd NSF/EPRI Workshop on Microwave-Induced Reactions.  The 1st Workshop was
              held March 7-10, 1993 at the Asilomar Conference Center in Pacific Grove,
              California.  The 2nd Workshop will be held from Sunday, June 22, 1997 through
              Wednesday, June 25, 1997 at the University of Connecticut.  The Workshop will
              consist of oral presentations and poster sessions on current research in the
              area of Microwave-Induced Reactions.  It is meant to "take-stock" of this area,
              specifically to evaluate progress made by PI's supported by NSF and EPRI since
              the first workshop as well as to attempt to highlight work done by others in
              the field in the interim.  These funds are for partial support to defer travel
              and registration costs for invited speakers.
