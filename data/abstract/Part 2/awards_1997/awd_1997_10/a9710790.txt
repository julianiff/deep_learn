              ABSTRACT    PROPOSAL #: DEB 9710790    PI.: Dr. Gregory Florant    INSTITUTION:
              Colorado State University      This proposal seeks support for a workshop to be
              held at Colorado State University on February 28 and March 1, 1997. The goal of
              the workshop is to provide a unique opportunity for faculty and administrators
              from 16 midwest and mountain state universities and colleges, the majority of
              which are land-grant institutions, to discuss in depth, life science issues
              that are now, and will continue to, face these institutions in the coming
              years. On many campuses life science programs are organized along traditional
              disciplinary lines, are spread out over the campus, and are not optimally
              meeting the needs of life science students for the 21st Century. Many issues
              such as, how should introductory courses be organized for majors in different
              disciplines, how should departments be organized at a land-grant universities
              with numerous life science departments, and what administrative structure best
              suits a land-grant university for the life sciences, will be discussed during a
              series of plenary sessions and breakout groups. Concrete, implementable
              recommendations are the expected outcome of this workshop.
