Abstract    :
              9710601  Riley   In this Phase II Small Business Innovation Research project,
              the proposer will scale-up a novel deformation processing scheme discovered in
              the Phase I feasibility research. Commercially viable high-temperature
              superconductor (HTS) wire must have high Jc performance and low cost. In the
              Phase I feasibility research, the proposer determined the relative and absolute
              importance of materials and process hardening on the superconductor performance
              and microstructure of Bi-2223 composite tape using a fundamental approach   and
              a simple conceptual framework. This effort was successful, leading to
              performance improvements of up to 40% for multifilamentary composites
              appropriate for commercial application. In the proposed Phase II program, the
              proposer will scale-up the innovative deformation process scheme to fabricate
              long and continuous lengths of Bi-2223 composite with performance superior to
              that of conventional Bi-2223 composite.  ***
