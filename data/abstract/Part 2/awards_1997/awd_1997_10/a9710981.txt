Abstract    :
              Controllability of a Fluid-Structure Interaction Arising in  Chemical Vapor
              Deposition    In this project, we spell out an infinite dimensional control 
              problem arising from the use of chemical vapor deposition (CVD)  in the
              manufacture of this films on the surface of a substrate;  this CVD is used in a
              host of technological applications,  including the construction of
              microelectric circuitry, compound  semiconductor devices and high-performance
              cutting and grinding  tools.  Mathematically, one has a version of the
              Navier-Stokes  equations coupled to a semilinear heat equation, with the
              control  (temperature) implemented on a wall of the boundary.  With a view 
              towards determining the physical feasibility of improving the  quality of the
              film growth by controlling the wall temperature,  we aim to study the
              controllability of the associated system of  coupled partial differential
              equations, controllability in a  sense to be made precise below.  The approach
              to be taken in  addressing our control theoretic question will be that adopted 
              for other coupled partial differential equations seen in the  analysis of
              "smart material" technology.  Both continuous and  approximation theory will be
              considered in this work.
