Abstract    :
              University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign   The objective of this investigation
              is to focus upon the three dimensional structure of flow at confluences, the
              mechanisms responsible for this structure, and the connection between
              three-dimensional flow and confluence morphology.  Specific objectives are to
              identify 3-D patterns of fluid motion and factors that contribute to this,
              examine the interaction among various scales, and link coherent 3-D fluid
              motion to sediment flow and patterns of erosion.  This will be accomplished
              through the use of a Sontek acoustic doppler velocimeter.  Data obtained from
              the measurement program will be analyzed using an innovative robust statistical
              procedure that partitions sample data drawn from a mixed population into
              component populations.  Results of the research will be synthesized by
              developing dynamic visualization models of confluence dynamics using state of
              the art visualization software at the National Center for Supercomputing
              Applications at the University of Illinois.
