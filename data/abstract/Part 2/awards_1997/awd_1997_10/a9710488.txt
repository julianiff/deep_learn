Abstract    :
              Barbara McClintock was awarded the Nobel prize for her path breaking research
              that showed how genetic material moves easily from one chromosome to another,
              even from one organism to another of a very different kind.  Such insights are
              at the foundation of modern genetics research and technology, and with new
              bioengineering techniques exchanges of genetic material may be greatly
              accelerated.  This biography will demonstrate how McClintock's work on genetic
              exchange grew out of her studies of corn genetics, undertaken while she was a
              graduate student at Cornell University.  Through careful examination of course
              outlines, departmental records, evaluations, notebooks and other material, the
              book will trace the influence of advisors, colleagues, institutions, and
              cultural context on the development of McClintock's science.  The book that
              will result from this project will make McClintock's work, reputed to be very
              hard to understand, available to the thoughtful reader with a minimum of
              background in the biological sciences.  Readers of the book will include not
              only professional historians, philosophers, and sociologists of science, but
              also undergraduate students, graduate students, and members of the general
              public interested in understanding more about McClintock and her influence on
              the biological sciences.
