Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion  of NCRI's
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides partial
              support for the installation and operation of  a DS-3 ATM connection to the
              MREN where they can gain access to the Very  High Performance Backbone Network
              Service (vBNS). This link will be  upgraded to a OC-3c sometime in the summer
              of 1988.    Applications include:  - Advanced Photon Source project  - High
              Energy Physics  - Astrophysics  - Grand Challange computational fluid dynamics 
              - scalable libraries  - meta-computing research  - high speed image and video
              processing  - coastal waterways simulation  Collaborating with:  - Air Force
              Rome Laboratories  - Argonne National Laboratory  - Army Waterways Experiment
              Station  - Brookhaven National Laboratory  - Cornell Theory Center  - Fermilab 
              - Illinois Institute of Technology  - Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory  - Lawrence
              Livermore National Laboratory  - Maui High Performance Computing Center  -
              Northwestern University  - Old Dominion University  - Purdue University  -
              Stanford Linear Accelerator Center  - Texas Institute for Computational and
              Applied Mathematics  - University of Colorado  - University of Florida  -
              University of Washington    The award provides partial support of the project
              for two years.
