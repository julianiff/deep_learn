Abstract    :
              9710092  Smith    The objective of this RUI research is to identify the 
              fundamental physical parameters which determine the atomic  structure of thin
              transition-metal films deposited on  aluminum single-crystal surfaces.  The
              experiments are  designed to characterize the early stages of epitaxial  growth
              and/or compound formation in the limit of very thin  overlayers.  The selected
              transition metals span a range of  values for the mismatch in
              substrate-overlayer lattice  structure and for the chemical formation energy of
              the  transition-metal aluminide.  The thermal stability and  lattice matching
              characteristics of several of these  aluminides make them excellent candidates
              for epitaxial  metallization on III-V semiconductors, such as GaAs and InP. 
              The research focuses on those systems which appear most  promising for growing
              epitaxial structures.  In addition,  understanding and controlling the atomic
              structure of  supported thin films of  Fe, Co and Cr is important for 
              tailoring the magnetic properties of these films.  The  measurements
              characterize the degree of ordered growth or  substrate disruption at the
              interface using high-energy ion  backscattering and channeling, low energy
              electron  diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron diffraction.  Core-  level
              binding energies measured with X-ray photoemission  serve to identify compound
              formation at the interface.  Monte Carlo computer simulations, using the
              Embedded Atom  Method for calculating total energies, serves as a guide in  the
              structure analysis.  %%%  The results of this research will provide a better 
              understanding of, and ability to predict, atomic structure  at metal/metal
              interfaces.  This area of research has great  potential for contributing to
              microelectronic and  micromagnetic devices.  ***
