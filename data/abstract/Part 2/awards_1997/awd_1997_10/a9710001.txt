Abstract    :
              9710001  Bein    The focus of this research is on nanoporous films as hosts  for
              selective chemical sensors derived from assembled  ordered nanostructures
              composed of optically responsive  receptors encapsulated in thin films of
              micro- and  mesoporous hosts.  The novel structures will be formed by  first
              inducing the growth of certain molecular sieve  crystals and mesoporous ordered
              channel structures on  modified sensor substrates, followed by encapsulation of
               receptor sites into these channels.  Using this approach, it  will be possible
              to create chemically sensitive  nanostructures on optical fibers that combine
              unique  chemical selectivity with high stability due to  encapsulation in rigid
              host cages.  %%%  The focus of this research is on nanoporous films as hosts
