Abstract    :
              This dissertation project focuses on a case study analysis of American
              environmental toxicology in order to better understand the processes involved
              in the constitution of interdisciplinary sciences.  Preliminary analysis
              suggests that, since the early 1970's the field has developed into a
              well-established interdisciplinary science.  Comprised of government, industry,
              and academic scientists with training in various biological and chemical
              sciences, environmental toxicology exhibits substantial evidence of both
              `cognitive and social institutionalization.`  In contrast to much of the case
              study literature that documents the institutionalization of mostly larger and
              older fields representing the traditional disciplinary pantheon, environmental
              toxicology represents a `deviant` case of scientific development -- the
              successful institutionalization of an interdisciplinary science.   The project
              focuses on the questions: How did environmental toxicology achieve
              institutionalization as an interdisciplinary science? To what extent have
              institutional actors outside science shaped the organization of research on the
              ecosystemic impacts on toxins?  In answering these questions, the project draws
              from research on scientific disciplines and boundary-making, and on the
              relationships between science and social movements.  The tentative hypotheses
              focus on the articulation of environmental toxicology with the environmental
              movement in creating opportunities to establish relationships with diverse,
              extra-scientific audiences in order to gain legitimacy, secure resources, and
              recruit new professionals.
