Abstract    :
              ***  9710654  Sluis    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              addresses the transfer of pest resistance traits from wild species to domestic
              potato via the generation of periclinal chimeras.  Tissue-Grown scientists have
              developed a novel method for combining the best characteristics of two types of
              potato by forming chimeras.  Chimeric plants are composed of cell layers from
              different parents.  The goal of the proposed research is the creation of new
              potato varieties with the epidermal layer of a wild species and the core layers
              of a commercial potato variety.  The germplasm targets of this proposal would
              combine commercial potato varieties with wild species lines selected for insect
              resistance and tolerance to late blight (Phytophthora infestans).    The
              potential commercial application of the research is the rapid generation of new
              potato varieties that can take advantage of wild germplasm traits for pest
              resistance without the undesirable wild tuber traits so difficult to eliminate
              through breeding.  Wild species contain a wealth of disease resistance genes
              and genes of horticultural interest, but they also come with a heavy burden of
              genes detrimental to potato tuber production, such as delayed tuber set, odd
              colors, shapes and sizes of tubers, and excessive tuber glycoalkaloids.  Using
              chimeras, many well-established and valuable varieties can be enhanced without
              disturbing or damaging their primary commercial tuber traits.  ***
