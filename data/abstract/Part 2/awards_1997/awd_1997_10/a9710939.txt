Abstract    :
              This award is made under the innovative technology connections portion of 
              NCRI's "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64, which covers 
              K-12 education institutions (including vocational technical schools),  public
              libraries and museums.  It provides partial support for two years to  connect
              ten educational sites to the Internet using a microwave technology  known as
              Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service (MMDS).  NYSERNet is  working with
              CAI Wireless Systems, Inc. for this trial.
