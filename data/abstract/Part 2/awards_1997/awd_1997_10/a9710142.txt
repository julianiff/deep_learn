Abstract    :
              Du  9710142    This award supports a two-year collaborative research  project
              between Dr. Honghua Du of the Stevens Institute of  Technology and Dr. Soo Lee
              of Sun Moon University in Korea  on "Alteration of the Effects of Sintering
              Additives on the  Oxidation and Tribological Behavior of Silicon Nitride."  The
              study will investigate the effects of aluminum ion  implantation and the
              addition of alumina to silicon nitride  products sintered with magnesia. 
              Experimentation with  surface and grain boundary chemical characteristics
              should  lead to a better understanding of their relationship to  oxidation and
              wear properties and to such basic phenomena as  surface or interface reactions,
              diffusion, and tribochemical  interactions in the silicon nitride ceramic
              system.    This project will combine the expertise of the Korean team  in the
              processing and sintering of ceramics with Dr. Du's  extensive work on the
              corrosion resistance of these  materials.  Silicon nitride ceramics are used
              extensively in advanced  engines and for other structural applications.  Thus,
              the  oxidation and wear of these ceramics presents important  engineering
              issues.  ***
