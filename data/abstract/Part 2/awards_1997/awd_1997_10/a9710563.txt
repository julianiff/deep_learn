Abstract    :
              This project will use the history of the RAND corporation as a window on the
              complex interaction among national security and social welfare research and
              policy making in Cold War America.  It argues that the Cold War had deep
              effects not only on the locus of research and development but also on the
              process of knowledge production.  In research already completed the PI has
              examined RAND's nature and objectives as a research organization, the breadth
              and productivity of RAND's research programs, and the diffusion of RAND's
              research products.  The present study will focus on RAND's experience in
              non-defense research and the impact of RAND's methodologies on the execution of
              American social welfare policy in the 1970s and 1980s.  The project will also
              examine RAND's contributions to game theory, war gaming, economic theory, and
              simulation.  Methods of research include archival investigation, reading of
              primary and secondary sources, and interviews.  The result of the project will
              be a book expected to have wide readership across several disciplines.
