Abstract    :
                This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 11 project could significantly
              reduce the cost of radiologic nondestructive assessment.  Adelphi proposes to
              construct an inexpensive compact betatron, capable of high-flux x-ray emisson,
              for the purpose of Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) in civil structures.  The
              proposed x-ray source would replace more expensive RF linacs and thereby reduce
              the cost of radiological equipment.  In conventional betatrons, eddy-current
              losses in the iron limit the frequency and the maximum field, thereby limiting
              the output beam power.  With the use of proprietary low-loss, high-frequency
              materials, higher driving frequencies permit much higher x-ray fluxes while
              still reducing the size of the source.  Radiologic NDE requires just such an
              inexpensive x-ray source to provide rapid, high signal-to-noise analyses.  As a
              proof of principle, a prototype betatron x-ray source will be constructed and
              tested.  The proposed research will demonstrate that the betatron will provide
              an x-ray flux necessary for rapid evaluation of concrete structures up to 70 cm
              thick.  The betatron-based x-ray source developed under this proposal will find
              immediate commercial application as a replacement for the linacs currently used
              in industrial NDE.  A second application for such an inexpensive high-flux 
              x-ray source is radiotherapy treatment of cancer in developing countries.
