Abstract    :
              9710587  Serrano  This is an award to support research on the role of transient 
              factors that affect the flow and dispersion of contaminants in  contaminated
              aquifers.  The investigator plans to consider  factors that are normally
              excluded in formulation of mathematical  expressions to describe contaminant
              dispersion.  The factors that  will be considered include assumption that the
              formation is  subjected to recharge, the water table is unstable, boundary 
              conditions are not negligible and fluctuations as well as  normality of
              hydraulic conductivity are affected by dispersion  especially as they relate to
              contaminant penetration of the  saturated from the unsaturated zone by
              contaminants from non  point sources.    Results of this project are expected
              to improve our understanding  of the variability of large-scale contaminant
              dispersion in  aquifers attributable to many conditions not now capable of
              being  considered by existing mathematical formulations.  This knowledge  may
              be directly applied to engineering design of systems for  decontamination of
              groundwater already contaminated and may also  have applicability to
              considering prevention of the pollution of  aquifers by contaminants from
              nonpoint sources.  ***
