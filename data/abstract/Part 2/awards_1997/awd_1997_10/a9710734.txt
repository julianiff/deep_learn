Abstract    :
              Anderson                    This longitudinal study of the doctoral experience
              links that experience to the nature of academic work and institutions. The
              fundamental question addressed in the study is: How do the experiences of
              doctoral students and early-career faculty reflect the nature of academic work,
              institutions, values and normative assumptions? This question is derived from
              the assumption that analysis of the doctoral experience and the transition into
              faculty life will contribute significantly to our understanding of academic
              work, the social environment of research and instruction, and the complex
              system of expectations, attitudes, beliefs, preferences, and norms that
              underlie the academic enterprise. The graduate experience provides a unique
              window into the normative bases of academic life as doctoral students
              experience it, and as they make decisions about the extent to which they will
              participate in an academic enterprise with those values.  The project explores
              the assumptions, priorities, and preferences that shape the nature of academic
              work, by tracing their origins back to the experiences of doctoral students.
              The specific objectives of the proposed project are: 1) continuation of three
              years' previous data collection on the doctoral experience through a
              longitudinal series of interviews with approximately 100 of the 1994 cohort of
              doctoral students in 12 academic fields at a major research university; 2)
              extension of the interview series to a set of approximately 100 of the 1998
              cohort of doctoral students in a variety of fields at the same university; 3)
              completion of an exploratory study of the outcomes of doctoral education and
              the transition from doctoral to postdoctoral life, through 30-40 telephone
              interviews with recent doctoral graduates; and 4) preparation of conference
              papers and publications based on the project.
