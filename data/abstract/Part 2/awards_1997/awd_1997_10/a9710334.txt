Abstract    :
              Cambria County Area Community College will use this grant to connect the Hiram
              G.  Andrews Center to the Internet.  The Hiram G.  Andrews Center is one of the
              nation's oldest postsecondary trade and technical schools dedicated to the
              comprehensive  rehabilitation of persons with disabilities.  Located in rural
              Pennsylvania it needs the Internet connection to be able to access information
              resources throughout the state, the nation and the world.  The connection will
              benefit the faculty, staff students of this institution as well as the
              community in general.  The award provides partial support of the project for
              two years.
