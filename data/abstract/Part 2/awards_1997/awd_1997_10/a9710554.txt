Abstract    :
                The Lucile B. Kaufman Scholars program is designed to encourage undergraduate
              women in engineering to pursue graduate degrees in engineering.  The program
              will include 20 nominees and 8 alternates  with  junior status in engineering. 
              The program builds on two components: professional development and community
              building.    The professional development component includes an 8 - week summer
              research experience, culminating in a formal research symposia.  The community
              building component includes mentoring and networking events designed to create
              a supportive community environment for participants.  Mentors will also
              participate in diversity training workshops.    Students completing academic
              year activities in the program are awarded the title Lucile B. Kaufman
              Scholar," receive a $500.00 scholarship, and participate in the summer research
              experience, for which they receive a $1500 stipend.  Participant scholars
              achievements will be compared to a comparative cadre of non-participant, but
              similarly motivated students
