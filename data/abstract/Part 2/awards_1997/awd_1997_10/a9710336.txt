Abstract    :
                  9710336  Krishnamurti     Although there have been significant advances in
              the forecasting of hurricane track and intensity, especially in the one-to-two
              day range, longer range forecasts are much in need of improvement.  The
              principal investigator and his colleagues will conduct an investigation into
              the possible improvements that might be realized through the use of ensemble
              forecasting for predictions up to five days in advance.  They will focus on
              three primary areas of research:  (1) further development and parallelization
              of a very high resolution regional model for use in forecasting, (2) testing of
              a new method to develop the perturbations used in ensemble forecasting, and (3)
              evaluation of the overall forecast skill of the FSU global model which employs
              a physical initialization (primarily initializing rain rates) compared with
              operational forecast models.
