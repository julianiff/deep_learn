Abstract    :
              This project develops a unique graduate seminar on the design and supervision of
              undergraduate research projects in which graduate women across science,
              mathematics and engineering (SME) disciplines will be educated about academic
              and pedagogical issues related to undergraduate teaching and research design. 
              They will have direct experiences developing short research projects to be
              carried out by undergraduates in a linked undergraduate course, Introduction to
              Research.  The projects will be developed by pairs of students from different
              disciplines, will be in new or emerging SME fields and emphasize
              interdisciplinary or applied collaborations.  The graduate
              seminar/undergraduate course represents an innovative model for teaching and
              research that connects graduate and undergraduate education and emphasizes
              collaborative and interactive learning.  This model can be integrated readily
              into standard university curriculum and has the potential to foster
              interactions with industrial researchers that may lead to long-term
              associations.
