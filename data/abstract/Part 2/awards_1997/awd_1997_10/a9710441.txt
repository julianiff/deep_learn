Abstract    :
              ***  9710441  Farrar    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
              project will explore a novel steam-plasma torch (SPT) that has broad commercial
              applications.  Phase I identified various design parameters and conducted a
              laboratory feasibility test in which electrode wear was acceptably small. 
              Phase II includes design and demonstration test of a prototype SPT and will
              focus on a robust SPT that will be efficient and cost-effective as a plasma
              spray device in advanced chemical conversion applications.    Commercial
              applications of SPT include principally chemical conversion and materials
              processing.  In addition, new applications are anticipated in hazardous waste
              destruction, waste to energy conversion (such as processing chemical industry
              tar and sludge residuals), conversion of methane to acetylene, powder
              synthesis, and thermal spraying of metals and ceramics.  ***
