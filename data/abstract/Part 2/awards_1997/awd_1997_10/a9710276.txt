Abstract    :
                    9710276  The objective of this research project is to gain additional 
              knowledge on flexural behavior of steel-reinforced-concrete (SRC)  structural
              elements.  There is currently a lack of understanding  of seismic shear
              behavior to support the rational design for  composite or hybrid structures.   
              Specifically, the following issues related to seismic shear  design will be
              addressed.         i.   Shear resisting mechanisms in SRC elements       ii. 
              Shear strength decay upon the increase of displacement               ductility
              as considered in design; and       iii. Shear strength of SRC elements of
              high-strength or high             performance materials    The research program
              undertaken will focus on experimental and  analytical investigations of the
              cyclic shear behavior of high-  strength composite steel and concrete (HS-SRC)
              structural  elements.  Both the experimental and analytical phases of the 
              research will be conducted on fundamental behavior of high  strength SRC
              elements with applications to moment-resisting frame  structures.  The emphasis
              is on the evaluation of different shear  resisting mechanisms and the influence
              of ductility, as well as  calibration and development of models to best assess 
              contributions of various shear resisting mechanisms.    Results from this
              research will be used to develop   acceptable seismic design guidelines.  The
              research will not only  enhance our understanding of HSC structures, but also
              lead to  practical and reliable design of SRC structures and well as 
              development of HSC systems using high strength materials.    This is a project
              supported under NSF initiative No. 94-154  "Composite and Hybrid Structures".
