Abstract    :
              Travel funds in this grant help to support a philosopher and U.S. students in
              engineering and in science and technology studies, to attend the IEEE Society
              on Social Implications of Technology International Symposium on Technology and
              Society this June in Glasgow, Scotland.  The students will participate in a
              special session on two major themes of the meeting - intellectual property
              rights and new technology, and ethical, legal, and value issues that arise in
              university-industry research interactions.  The faculty participant will
              present a paper on issues of patenting and biotechnology.  Student selection
              will be based on a national call for applications sent electronically to major
              programs in science and technology studies in the U.S., as well as to
              engineering faculty interested in ethical and value issues related to
              technology.  Applicants will submit short research papers which will be
              reviewed for merit by the IEEE Administrative Committee, including the student
              representative who is organizing the special session.  Results from the
              conference are expected to be published in the SSIT magazine Technology and
              Society, and in the Social Science Computing Review.
