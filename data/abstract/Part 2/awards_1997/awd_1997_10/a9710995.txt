Abstract    :
              Hannes Jonsson is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational
              Chemistry Program to continue his research in the   development of computer
              algorithms for density functional theory   simulations and applications to
              semiconductor crystal growth.  Jonsson   will parallelize his own methods for
              finding minimum energy paths and   transition state activation barriers.  He
              will also investigate free   energy barriers which include anharmonicity, and
              algorithms which scale   linearly with system size.  His applications will
              focus on interpretation   of current imaging experiments by calculating adatom
              diffusion rates and   surface cluster formation rates for industrially relevant
              systems such as   silicon and silicon carbide surfaces, germanium-silicon
              interfaces, and   silicon dioxide overlayers.  Modern density functional
              theoretical methods will be developed and used   to study a variety of surface
              growth mechanisms of technological   importance.  In particular these methods
              will be extended to enable the   study of larger, more complex models of
              materials on new and emerging   massively parallel computers.   The methods
              involve the sophisticated   evaluation of accurate energetics for a number of
              complex atomic-scale   processes on semiconductor surfaces.
