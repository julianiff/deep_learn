Abstract    :
                This project studies how the introduction of user fees for the review of new
              drugs has affected bureaucratic incentives and output in the Food and Drug
              Administration. The study has two objectives. First, it develops an
              understanding of the mechanism by which user fees impact bureaucratic behavior
              in the FDA review process. This requires an understanding of the relevant
              institutional environment inside the agency and the relevant constraints and
              incentives facing FDA bureaucrats. Second, it empirically analyzes the impact
              of user fees on FDA review times for new drugs and the impact of user fees on
              the responsiveness of bureaucrats to pharmaceutical firms.  Previous work by
              Olson (1997) empirically examined the effect of firm characteristics on the
              length of time required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to review and
              approve new drug applications between 1990-1992. The primary finding from the
              analysis is that FDA reviewers respond systematically to the differences
              between pharmaceutical firms. The reason is that firm characteristics contain
              information which reduces reviewers' uncertainty about approving a dangerous or
              ineffective drug and leads to faster review times. Other firm characteristics
              such as firm size and country of firm ownership also influence the speed of the
              review process.  This project extends this analysis by examining how
              bureaucratic responsiveness to firms changed after the adoption of user fees
              for new drug review. The approach taken is one which treats regulatory
              decisions as endogenous and explains the variation in FDA review times as a
              function of differences that exist between firms and drugs. The analysis
              considers the set of new drugs approved by the FDA between 1990-1995.
              Coefficients of regulator responsiveness to various firm and drug
              characteristics are estimated for the 1990-1992 new drug approvals (prior to
              the implementation of user fees) and these coefficients are compared to
              estimates of regulator responsiveness to firm characteristics for the 1993-1995
              new drug approvals (following the implementation of user fees).  User fees are
              expected to shift regulatory responsiveness to pharmaceutical firms because
              they provide a financial incentive for regulators to process more applications
              and because they convey information to regulators that may reduce type I error.
              Results from this study have policy implications concerning the continued use
              of user fees in the FDA. This study also contributes to the growing body of
              empirical research which uses positive political theories to generate and test
              hypotheses about bureaucratic behavior in regulatory agencies.
