Abstract    :
               This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project concerns the
              development of novel types of miniature mercury and mercaptan gas detectors
              using recently developed highly sensitive microcantilever chemical sensors. 
              These sensors are manufactured using standard microelectromechanical systems
              and integrated circuit microfabrication techniques. During the Phase I project,
              these sensors were shown to detect mercury vapor concentrations down to 0.5
              parts per billion(ppb) and mercaptans down to 50 ppb.  Simple and rapid sensor
              regeneration techniques were demonstrated in the Phase I project, along with
              inexpensive and effective techniques for the removal of dust and other possible
              chemical interferents.  The Phase II project will construct, and test under
              field conditions, prototype mercury and mercaptan detectors.   The
              instrumentation will find application in numerous environmental applications
              requiring real time, sensitive analysis of mercury in air, soil, water, and
              food, and in mercaptan detection of leaks in natural gas supply lines and
              appliances.  Detectors based on the microcantilever sensor technology will be
              far more portable and sensitive, and also less expensive than currently
              available instrumentation.  The development of personal monitors and sensors
              for other vapors based on this technology is also envisioned.
