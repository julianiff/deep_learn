Abstract    :
                This project is a collaborative between Clarkson University  and the American
              Indian Science and Engineering Society  (AISES).  The collaborative will
              provide 20 American Indian  high school women from across the nation with a
              four week  summer program integrating engineering, mathematics computer 
              applications and enterpreneurship activities.  The program  is designed to
              build skills and support student achievement.  Educators from the Native
              community serve as mentors and  role models.  Parents, tribal leaders and other
              community  members will serve as project resources.  All project  participants
              will be exposed to various tribal customs and  beliefs.  Student participants
              will become part of on-going  research projects at the university and a
              reservation near  the university.
