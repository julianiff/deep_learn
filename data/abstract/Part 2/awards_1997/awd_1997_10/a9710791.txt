Abstract    :
                This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) is supported in  the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.  During the tenure of  this
              twelve-month standard grant, Professors Ewing and Day and  their students at
              Pennsylvania State University will attach single  oligonucleotide molecules of
              poly dT to small monodispersed beads  arranged in arrays on a flat substrate. 
              The arrays will be  hybridized with micro samples of messenger RNA and then
              reverse  transcription will produce an array of cDNAs for differential 
              screening and quantification for gene expression.  Using this  approach single
              gene products can be screened and identified by  sequencing in a single
              automated process.  Many genomic applications involve either small amounts of
              sample or  expression of low abundance genes.  Amplification by the polymerase 
              chain reaction is then required.  The work of Professors Ewing and  Day and
              their students at Pennsylvania State University will permit  single molecule
              detection on an array of cDNAs permitting  differential screening and
              quantification for gene expression in a  single automated process.  This work
              will have immediate impact on  problems in genomic fields.
