Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion  of NCRI's
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  This project will
              provide partial support to expand the Georgia  State University and the Georgia
              Institute of Technology's  network infrastructure and implement a OC-3 ATM
              connection to be  NSF supported the Very High Performance Backbone Network
              Service  (vBNS). This proposal augments a previous award made under this 
              program to Georgia Tech.    Applications include:  - Advanced Photon Source
              project  - High Energy Physics  - Astrophysics  - Grand Challenge computational
              fluid dynamics  - scalable libraries  - meta-computing research  - high speed
              image and video processing  - coastal waterways simulation  Collaborating with:
               - Air Force Rome Laboratories  - Argonne National Laboratory  - Army Waterways
              Experiment Station  - Brookhaven National Laboratory  - Cornell Theory Center 
              - Fermilab  - Illinois Institute of Technology  - Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory 
              - Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory  - Maui High Performance Computing
              Center  - Northwestern University  - Old Dominion University  - Purdue
              University  - Stanford Linear Accelerator Center  - Texas Institute for
              Computational and Applied Mathematics  - University of Colorado  - University
              of Florida  - University of Washington    The award provides partial support of
              the project for two years.
