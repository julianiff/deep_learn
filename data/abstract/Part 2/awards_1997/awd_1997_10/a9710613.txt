Abstract    :
              ***  9710613  Bryant    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
              project will continue the Phase I effort that investigated the
              microencapsulation of phase change materials (PCMs) in a form stable enough to
              withstand the melt spinning process, with special emphasis on capsules with
              mean particle size less than 10 microns.  Phase II will include:  (a)
              investigating dry heat stability of capsules in air, (b) identifying the nature
              of effluent materials given off with heat, ( c) optimizing the
              microencapsulation process and investigating process scale-up; (d)
              demonstrating the incorporation of microcapsules into the major melt-spun
              fibers, and (e) evaluating spinning performance and fiber properties.  Phase II
              is anticipated to produce micro-PCMs on a scale suitable for prototype spinning
              of melt spun fiber for conversion into apparel and other articles    The
              commercial applications of melt-spun fibers and fabrics with enhanced thermal
              energy storage capabilities is expected in the apparel and industrial
              insulation markets, where controlled protection in hot or cold thermal
              environments is required.  ***
