Abstract    :
              9710277  Silberberg    This grant will develop a Model Verification Homepage
              that will  provide access to a suite of real-time analyses of error fields in 
              weather forecast models.  The purpose of the web page and graphics  of model
              error fields is to provide new teaching tools for use in  Synoptic Meteorology
              and Weather Forecasting courses at Northern  Illinois University.  These tools
              will help educators communicate  and students learn about the strengths and
              weaknesses of  operational prediction models and statistical forecasts produced
              at  forecasting centers worldwide.
