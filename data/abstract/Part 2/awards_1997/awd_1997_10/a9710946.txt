Abstract    :
              Abstract    Heuer  9710946    Research and theory from social exchange, group
              dynamics, and attribution perspectives support the claim that the relation
              between respectful treatment and fairness judgments is qualified by the
              individual's belief that he or she deserves respectful treatment.  Further,
              research indicates that decision makers and decision recipients define fair
              treatment differently.  This disparity has the potential to frustrate a
              decisionmaker's best efforts to implement procedures fairly.  In addition,
              motivational variables contribute to the link between procedural concerns
              (especially respectful treatment) and perceived justice. This research consists
              of three field studies.  The first 960 New York City police officers are
              surveyed about their encounters with other police officers and with the public.
               This study is a 2 (in-group vs. out-group encounter) X 2 (respondent as
              authority/decisionmaker vs. respondent as decision recipient) X 2 ( officer as
              course of treatment vs. Officer as target) between subjects randomized
              factorial that permits a strong test of all three theoretical factors above. 
              In addition, 400 civilians are surveyed about their encounter with a sub-sample
              of the police thus permitting a direct comparison of police and civilian
              perceptions of the fairness of police treatment.  The second study asks 400
              trial court judges to report heir perceptions of their treatment of a litigant
              or a lawyer who recent appeared in their courtroom and asks the litigant or
              lawyer to also complete a questionnaire assessing their perception of the
              treatment.  The final study surveys 400 employees of organizations using the
              same design. These studies contribute to procedural justice theories as well as
              make an applied contribution in facilitating decision makers' efforts to
              implement procedures in a just manner.     ***
