Abstract    :
              9710306  Jain    The scientific basis for the development of advanced materials 
              and their record performance is founded on our fundamental  understanding of
              the correlation between their properties and  various aspects of the structure.
               Unfortunately, there are few  examples of such quantitative correlations for
              the case of  glasses and amorphous materials.  Therefore, to strengthen the 
              link between the structure and propertieslperformance a first  meeting of glass
              researchers from universities, industry and  govemment laboratories is proposed
              with the purpose of  establishing the practical implications of glass
              structure.  This  Conference will be organized under the auspices of the
              University  Conference on Glass Science series to take advantage of its well 
              established structure and low costs.  It is endorsed by the  American Ceramic
              Society and partially supported by industry.  Students and young researchers
              will be particularly encouraged to  participate in this interdisciplinary
              activity by offering them  scholarships.  The new information presented and
              generated at the  Conference will be published in the most widely read archival
               Joumal on the subject.  %%%  This conference will attempt to to draw closer
              linkage between  research on the structure of glasses and the properties that 
              result from that structure.  It will be held at Lehigh  University, Bethlehem,
              PA on June 17-20, 1997.  ***
