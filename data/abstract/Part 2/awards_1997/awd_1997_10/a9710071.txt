Abstract    :
              This project involves a cultural anthropologist from the University of Arizona
              studying how Finnish society, which displays a marked egalitarian style of
              gender relations, deals with conflict and aggression.  The project hypothesizes
              that egalitarian male-female relations have less physical and verbal aggression
              and more discussion, negotiation, and problem-solving than more unequal
              relationships, while in male-dominant relationships, the women is hypothesized
              to engage in more indirect aggression towards to the man than in
              female-dominated or egalitarian relationships.  The project will use a
              combination of qualitative, ethnographic methods including
              participant-observation and informal, conversational interviews on conflict,
              semi-structured interviews or laypersons and experts about conflict resolution
              patterns and egalitarianism.  This study should provide practical information
              as well as advance our understanding of the role of gender inequality in
              conflict and aggression.
