Abstract    :
              Burchard  9710434  When the bacterium Flexibacter maritimus is exposed to
              variety of antibiotics, resistant mutant colonies arise.  When ampicillin or
              other beta-lactam antibiotics are used, a striking result is seen after four to
              five days of incubation.  Resistant colonies appear on the plates at a
              frequency of between one in 10,000 and 1 in 100,000.  This is 10 to 100 times
              more frequent than would be expected for spontaneous resistant mutants.  In
              addition, the colonies that arise have a non-gliding appearance, unlike the
              parent gliding strain.  The non-gliding phenotype persists with subculturing in
              the absence of the antibiotic.  Fluctuation tests with Eschericia coli and
              ampicillin, or Flexibacter maritimus with other antibiotics such as tetracyline
              and vancomycin produce results consistent with selection of pre-existing,
              spontaneous mutants.  Replica plating experiments with F. maritimus and
              ampicillin show results inconsistent with the selection of spontaneous mutants.
               A number of approaches are being undertaken to determine the mechanism of
              production of the mutations, such as the possible induction of a transposable
              element that would increase the frequency of mutations in the bacteria. 
              Another possibility is that there are non-genomically encoded changes in wall
              structure that might be heritable.  Although the causes of these mutations may
              eventually be ascribed to conventional mechanisms, there is the possibility
              that an unusual genetic or epigenetic mechanism may be operating.
