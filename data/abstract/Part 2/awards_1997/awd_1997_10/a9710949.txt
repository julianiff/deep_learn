              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's 
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64.  It provides partial 
              support for two years for a DS-3 connection to the vBNS.  Applications  include
              projects in computational biology, computational chemistry,  materials science,
              distributed high performance computing, the Long Term  Environmental Research
              (LTER) Program, and visual programming environments.   Collaborating
              institutions include most of the Internet 2 institutions, as  well as the
