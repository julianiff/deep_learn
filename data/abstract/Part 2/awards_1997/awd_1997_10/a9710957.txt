Abstract    :
              University of Washington   The central objective of this research project is to
              examine the relationship between differing regional geographies of cross-border
              interdependency, their attendant patterns of transnational governance, and the
              implications of both for older forms of national governance.  The intent is to
              focus on the question: does the emergence of quasi-autonomous transnational
              regions represent the erosion of governance or just its political-geographic
              reorganization?  Using theories of regional agglomeration in part, a
              comparative approach is used to determine how transformations of governance
              relate to the economic geography of trade convergence, traded interdependencies
              and untraded interdependencies in two emerging transnational regions,
              Transmanche (French-English) and Cascadia (U.S.-Canada).  The research will
              involve data analysis of trade flows, in-depth interviews with administrators
              and planners, and a questionnaire survey of businesses.  The results will bring
              fieldwork results to bear on questions of the 'end of the nation-state' and the
              impacts of globalization.
