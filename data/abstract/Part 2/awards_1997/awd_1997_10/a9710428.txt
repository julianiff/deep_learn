Abstract    :
              Proposal Number:  ECS-9710428                                 Principal
              Investigator: Sergev Mirov    Title: UAB-General Physics Institute Cooperation
              in Comprehensive Study of the Fast Relaxation Processes in Laser Materials   
              Abstract    This proposal is to seek funds to support two Russian researchers
              from the General Physics Institute, Moscow, to continue research at the
              University of Alabama at Birmingham in a collaborative research agreement
              previously funded by NSF/EPSCor grant. The proposed work is focused on
              multiphonon relaxation processes of ion in solids.  This request builds upon
              the foundations already present, and seek to establish a formal collaboration
              between UAB and GPI.
