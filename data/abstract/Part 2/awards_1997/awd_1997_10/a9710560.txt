Abstract    :
              Pontifical College Josephinum will use this grant to connect its  Columbus, OH
              campus to the Internet using a OARnet, an Ohio based  ISP.  Pontifical College
              Josephinum is a private, Roman Catholic  seminary which offers six bachelor
              programs and three masters  degree programs with an enrollment of approximately
              130 students.    The college needs the Internet connection to be able to access
               information resources throughout the state, the nation and the  world.  The
              connection will benefit the faculty, staff students  of this institution as
              well as the community in general.  The  award provides partial support of the
              project for two years.
