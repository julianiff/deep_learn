Abstract    :

              Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to isolate cocaine specific
              antibodies with catalytic properties by encapsulating cells in gel microdrops
              (GMD) and subsequently analyzing and sorting them using flow cytometry.  Phase
              I research demonstrated the feasibility of using GMD technology to screen cells
              for catalytic activity using four different models each representing a distinct
              location for catalytic antibody expression.  Fluorescent products are retained
              within the agarose microsphere and cells of interest recovered for cloning or
              gene analysis using fluorescent activated cell sorting.  Employing this assay
              in defined microenvironments allows the identification and recovery of single
              cells based on product formation and/or binding.  Since cocaine specific
              antibodies are expected to be rare and weakly catalytic, the microencapsulation
              technology is particularly suited for these investigations.  Successful
              completion of these studies will lead to development of a rapid, automated
              method for isolating, analyzing and recovering cells producing antibodies of
              interest.    Catalytic antibodies represent a virtually inexhaustible source of
              biocatalysts.  The ability to generate specific proteases would have a
              significant impact on biotechnology and medicine for use as therapeutics as
              well as industrial enzymes.  The total worldwide market for catalytic
              antibodies is estimated to be in excess of $1.0 billion.  ***
