Abstract    :
              ***  9710491  Cogan    This Small Business Innovation Phase II project will
              develop thin-film electrochromic materials that provide enhanced color control.
               Electrochromic materials change their optical properties reversibly when
              electrochemically cycled between oxidized and reduced forms.  A new concept in
              electrochromic materials design based on bilayer or multilayer contiguous thin
              films of electrochromic inorganic oxides was investigated in Phase I. 
              Electrochromic coatings that modulate over a range of colors, e.g.,
              yellow-neutral-blue or gray-neutral, were identified.  A model was developed to
              predict the color and spectral properties of multilayer electrochromic coatings
              and devices based on the spectroelectrochemical properties of the individual
              layers.  Model predictions for bilayer coatings were confirmed by comparison
              with experimental data.     In Phase II, the multilayer coatings would be
              incorporated into thin film electrochromic devices designed for modulating
              solar transmittance through building windows.  Spectroelectrochemical
              measurements of individual and multilayer coatings would be used with the model
              to design devices with near-neutral optical modulation and wide luminous and
              solar transmittance range.  In addition, two and three-color electrochromic
              displays would be developed using the model and the accumulated database of
              spectroelectrochemical properties of the oxides investigated to guide the
              display design.      Commercial applications sought in Phase II are
              architectural solar control coatings exhibiting near-neutral visible modulation
              and multicolor electrochromic displays.  ***
