Abstract    :
                  ECS-9710631/9711231    Prem Kumar/Martin Fejer    This proposal is to
              develop compact and reliable sources of highly-squeezed light using lithium
              niobate waveguides.  The proposed experiments rely on traveling-wave degenerate
              second-harmonic generation and optical pamaretric amplification exploiting the
              (2 nonlinearity of lithium niobate.  The group has done a theoretical work on
              this subject and predicting the squeezing of both the fundamental and the
              second harmonic fields even in the presence of phase mismatch.  The work in the
              present proposal is to build the waveguide devices and to verify the
              theoretical prediction.  An integrated device that can produce squeezed light
              to expedite the transfer of such research into devices for practical
              applications.  The development of such a source would remove an important
              barriers to the application of squeezed light.    The PI has submitted a
              revised work statement and the corresponding budget for one year.   The Program
              Directors have reviewed the work statement and the revised budget.    The
              proposal is also being submitted from Stanford University with an identical
              project description, but with budgetary details relevant to the work to be
              carried out a  Stanford.  The funds sought by the Stanford  proposal are
              included in the budget as a subaward.
