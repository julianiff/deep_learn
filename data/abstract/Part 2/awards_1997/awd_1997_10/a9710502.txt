Abstract    :
              Abstract    C. Grigoropoulos - CTS 9710502        The principal investigators
              propose to study the thermal transport in the laser heating of glass surfacrs. 
              The foxus is on understanding and predicting the heat transfer and surface
              deformations associated with pulsed infrared laster heating.  Temperatures will
              be measured using time resolved pyrometry and interferometry to resolve the
              nature of thermal transport at small length scales.  Surface deformations will
              be measured using beam deflection and will form the basis for future modeling
              of the mechanial behavior of glasses at high temperatures and in radiative
              fields.
