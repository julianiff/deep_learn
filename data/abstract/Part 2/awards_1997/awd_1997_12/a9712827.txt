Abstract    :
                Since 1991, the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) has  held a series
              of highly successful workshops for women graduate  students and recent Ph.D.'s.
               The AWM will hold six additional  workshops in conjunction with major
              mathematical meetings during  1998-2000: each of the annual joint meetings of
              the AMS and MAA  and each of the annual SIAM meetings.  The workshop
              participants  will be selected by a panel of mathematicians on the basis of a 
              competitive application process.  They will be asked to present  their research
              at the workshop in a manner suitable for a general  mathematical audience. 
              They will have the opportunity to meet  and interact with each other and with
              assigned mentors, as well  as with other established women mathematicians.  The
              workshops  will also include panels, discussions, an informal luncheon, and  a
              dinner.    In addition, a minisymposium is planned for the International 
              Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM) in  Scotland (summer
              1999).  The minisymposium will consist of  research presentations by four
              outstanding women mathematicians  who have received the Ph.D. degree within the
              past five years.
