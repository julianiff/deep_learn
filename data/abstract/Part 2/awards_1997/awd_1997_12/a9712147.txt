Abstract    :
              This Planning Grant will explore the feasibility of  calculating upper ocean
              transports from paired vertical  profiles of oxygen isotope ratios in benthic
              foraminifera.  Depth transects of cores from the east and west sides of the 
              Florida Straits, will be sampled for modern through last  glacial periods,
              density profiles constructed from the  foraminiferal oxygen isotope ratios, and
              estimates of  geostrophic transport derived. Special attention will be  given
              to estimating the magnitude of error introduced by  various assumptions.
