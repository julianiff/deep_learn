Abstract    :
              9712537  Schneider    This six month project supports the planning process for
              200  schools from districts and Urban Systemic Initiatives in seven  regions to
              take the first critical steps in implementing standards-  based, articulated
              programs.  Included are schools from Texas (El  Paso), Arizona (Phoenix),
              California (Fresno, Los Angeles, San  Jose) and Colorado (Fort Collins,
              Colorado Springs).  Teams of high  schools and feeder middle schools are
              identified who are: committed  to 7th-12 grade science reforms; ready toi
              implement NSF-supported  curricula that are aligned with standards; and willing
              to work  together to assess their needs and carry out school-site developed 
              implementation plans.  The project works with teachers,  administrators,
              parents and other stakeholders in each region as  they undertake these
              activities.  A model for scaling-up science  reform nationally will be
              documented.  Cost sharing is 42%
