Abstract    :
                  ABSTRACT  EEC-9712750      Polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) is presently
              employed as a structural material in surface micro-machined sensors and
              actuators.  The design and fabrication of micromechanical structures can often
              be constrained by the deposition conditions and properties of poly-Si,
              therefore, the development of an alternative structural material which relieves
              these constraints would have a significant impact on MEMS technology. 
              Polycrystalline silicon-germanium (poly-SiGe) can be conformally deposited and
              doped at much lower temperatures (less than 500 lm1 (C) than poly-Si, and is
              readily etched by conventional wet or dry processes.  Low tensile stress can be
              achieved in as-deposited poly-SiGe films without high-temperature annealing. 
              These properties make poly-SiGe a promising structural material for
              surface-micromachined structures, particularly in integrated microsystems. 
              Because SiGe has only been investigated as an electronic material, its
              mechanical properties are note yet well known.    A comprehensive study of the
              mechanical properties of low-pressure chemical vapor deposited (LPCVD)
              poly-SiGe films, will be conducted to assess their potential for MEMS
              application.  The effects of deposition, doping and annealing conditions on
              film microstructure and mechanical properties will be determined for films of
              various Ge contents.  Established methodologies for evaluating poly-Si films
              will be employed to characterize stress and stress-gradients in poly-SiGe
              films.  The electrical conductivity and etching behavior of these films will
              also be studied.  The development of an integrated SiGe MEMS technology is a
              goal of this work.
