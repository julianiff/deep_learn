Abstract    :
              9712258  Shefer   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will
              develop the first turn-key, self-shielded accelerator-based intense positron
              beam source for use in research and industrial laboratories. Positron beams are
              powerful diagnostic probes for the nondestructive evaluation of metals,
              semiconductors, and polymers as well as for fundamental investigations of
              materials structure. A major impediment to the further development and use of
              positron-based diagnostics is the lack of suitable sources of intense slow
              positron beams. Presently-available radioisotope or electron LINAC sources are
              much too large and expensive for use in a laboratory or industrial environment.
               The positron source is based on the production of the short-lived (+-emitter
              13N via the light ion reaction 12C(d,n)13N. The Phase I study showed that a low
              energy deuteron accelerator with a specially-designed carbon target and
              positron moderator will be able to provide slow positron fluxes equal to or
              greater than 107 e+/sec. The source, to be constructed in Phase II, will
              utilize a compact, high current accelerator. In addition to providing a
              relatively intense beam, the accelerator-based source will be easy to operate,
              and will contain little residual radioactivity when not in use.   The initial
              market for the 13N-based intense slow positron source developed in this program
              will be university and industrial laboratories in the U.S. and abroad which are
              already using positron beams. The availability of the proposed source will
              facilitate the more widespread use of positron-based diagnostic techniques for
              semiconductors and metals. If these techniques come into routine use, the
              customer base for a diagnostic instrument based on this source may include the
              majority of semiconductor manufacturing facilities.  ***
