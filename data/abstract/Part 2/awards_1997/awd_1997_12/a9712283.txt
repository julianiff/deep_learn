Abstract    :
              The University of Illinois at Chicago and its partners, the National Center  for
              Supercomputer Applications (NCSA), the Argonne National Laboratory  (ANL) and
              Ameritech will provide an operational interconnection point at  the Ameritech
              Network Access Point (NAP) that will enable international  connectivity and
              interoperability of the cutting edge US research networks  (e.g., vBNS,
              Internet 2, Next Generation Internet components) and high  performance networks
              of other nations.  This project is a key piece of  infrastructure for high
              performance international Internet connections to  the vBNS.  It will
              complement the forthcoming NSF solicitation for High  Performance International
              Internet Services (HPIIS), and it will support  the G7 Global Information
              Infrastructure project "Global Interoperability  of Broadband Networking"
              (GIBN) by providing a common interconnection point  with staff support and
              performance monitoring. The Canadian Network for the  Advancement of Research,
              Industry and Education (CANARIE) has already  connected to the vBNS through the
              Ameritech NAP in an initial  proof-of-concept test.
