Abstract    :
              9712194  Weiss    This research is directed at the characterization of the 
              interactions and phase behavior of ionomer/homopolymer blends and  specifically
              the following objectives:         1.   to understand the macrophase and
              microphase behavior of         blends in which miscibility results from strong
              attractive         intermolecular interactions or repulsive intramolecular     
                 interactions;              2.   to define the role of the ionomer
              counterion, ionic         concentration and polymer molecular weight on the
              phase behavior         and properties of the blends;              3.   to
              determine the effect of strong attractive or repulsive         interactions on
              the spinodal decomposition kinetics and the         resulting morphology of
              critical mixtures; and              4.   to determine the interfacial behavior
              of these blends.         Two systems will be investigated: (I) blends of
              lightly  sulfonated polystyrene (SPS) and a methylated polyamide and (2)  SPS
              and bisphenol A polycarbonate.  The former is an example of a  blend with
              specific attractive intermolecular interactions, and  the latter is a blend for
              which miscibility occurs due to  intramolecular repulsive effects.  The
              specific experimental  techniques that will be employed include light
              scattering, small  angle neutron scattering, small angle x-ray scattering,
              neutron  reflectance and rheological analyses.  %%%  An ionomer blended with
              another polymer represents a special  class of copolymer/homopolymer blends in
              which one of the  components carries a charge.  The presence of the ionic
              species  may permit very strong, attractive intermolecular interactions  with
              another polymer and/or strong intramolecular repulsions  within the ionomer.
              Either phenomena may induce miscibility of  two otherwise immiscible polymers.
