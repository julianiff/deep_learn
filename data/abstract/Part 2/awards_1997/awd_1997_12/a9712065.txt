Abstract    :
              9712065  Pinter    This grant provides $14,758 as one-half support of the costs
              of  acquiring a workstation with expanded memory and disk storage and  GIS
              software for studies in geomorphology utilizing digital  elevation models
              (DEMs).  This facility will be used to explore  fundamental relationships
              between relief, elevation, erosion and  tectonics for major drainage basins in
              North America, will help  to characterize the dominant geomorphic agents
              responsible for  erosions in these basins and will test Anhert's Law, which 
              relates basin-scale erosion rates and topographic relief.  These  studies have
              global relevance to our understanding  of the  relationships between tectonics
              and climate.  This facility will  also support studies in groundwater and
              watershed hydrology,  environmental and resource analyses and geologic mapping.
