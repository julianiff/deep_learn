Abstract    :
                ***    Graber    9721630        In  this  study  we  propose to augment the 
              on-going  biological  and  physical  sampling phase of Cowen, Lwiza and Schultz
              (NSF  OCE:-9521104)  on  the  west coast of the oceanic island Barbados with
              surface  current  measurements using HF remote sensing technology. The
              measurements  would  provide maps of the evolution of the spatial and temporal
              variability in  the  regional circulation and the interactions of local flow
              with eddies  generated  at the retroflection of the North Brazil Current.  The 
              radar  would operate in HF mode which would provide a spatial resolution  of  1
               km  and  would coincide with the shipboard biological/physical  sampling 
              scheme.  The  radar  currents would provide crucial information  on  the 
              dominant  flow components such as tides, wind-driven, mean and  residual 
              circulation in this region. The HF radar measurements would be  used  to 
              characterize  the  time  space  scales of  the  hydrographic  signatures 
              associated  with  eddies  generated by the retroflection  of  the  North 
              Brazil  Current.  The addition of the remotely sensed  currents  to  the 
              shipboard sampling will provide direct measurements of the surface flow.  Such 
              information  is  crucial  to  interpreting  the  distribution   of  late-stage 
              larvae  that occupy this upper layer of  the  water  column.  Decomposing the
              current into components would be used to examine how the  flow  is  influenced 
              by  such  forcing agents  as  the  wind.  This  is  particularly  valuable in
              the lee of the island where  the  wind  stress  will  vary  both  spatially and
              temporally. Combining  the  surface  and  subsurface current measurements with
              the biological sampling would allow  us  to  examine the linkages between reef
              fish larval distributions  and  island flow patterns.    Specifically  our 
              study  could  assess  the   impact   of  offshore  mesoscale events disturbing
              the local  now  regime  and  the  fate  of  larval  retention.  Such  knowledge
                is  essential to  understand the translocation patterns of  coral  reef fish
              larvae in an island wake environment.  ***
