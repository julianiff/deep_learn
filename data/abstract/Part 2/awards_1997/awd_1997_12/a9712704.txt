Abstract    :
                    This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic   Chemistry
              program funds research in the laboratory of Professor Brice   Bosnich at the
              University of Chicago to study how dinuclear metal sites   can release their
              individual electrons to effect a two-electron reduction   of molecular oxygen
              to peroxide.  Such reductions are essential in   biology to activate oxygen to
              oxidize organic substrates.  This work will   contribute to a fundamental
              understanding of how the second metal ion can   more easily release an electron
              to molecular oxygen following withdrawal   of the first electron from the first
              metal ion to which the oxygen   coordinates.  Several binucleating ligands will
              be synthesized and   dinuclear metal complexes prepared as systems for studying
              the sequential   electron transfer process.  Reactions with oxygen atom
              transfer reagents   will also be studied.  Complexes that are likely to undergo
              oxidative   addition reactions in which the two electrons would derive from
              each   member of the metal ion pair will also be prepared and investigated.    
                Dinuclear transition metal ion complexes will be prepared in order   to study
              electron-pair transfer to oxygen and other substrates.  Some   types of
              biological activation of oxygen proceed by this route to   activate molecular
              oxygen to oxidize organic molecules.  This research   should lead to a better
              understanding of how electrons are derived from   metal ion pairs and this
              understanding could assist in inventing new   methods of activating oxygen to
              oxidize hydrocarbons in industrial   feedstock processes.
