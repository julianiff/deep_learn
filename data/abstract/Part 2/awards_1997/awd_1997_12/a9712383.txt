Abstract    :
              The last few years has seen a dramatic growth of interest in the  application of
              computer-aided interactive proof checking.  The  technology underlying
              interactive proof checking has improved as  a result of developments in theorem
              proving and model checking.  There is also a growing awareness of the risks of
              digital  hardware and software systems, the increasing complexity of these 
              systems, and the greater exposure to security threats.    Interactive proof
              checking is still not an effective tool in the  hands of nonspecialists because
              of the lack of insightful  explanations from both failed and successful proof
              attempts.  The  main problem addressed by this project is that of reconciling
              the  development and maintenance of proofs with the presentation of  proofs. 
              The main thesis of this project is that powerful,  appropriate, and transparent
              automation can improve the  productivity of proof construction and maintenance
              while  enhancing the value and cogency of the resulting proofs  and
              counterexamples.  The project will result in the transparent  inference
              procedures, structured and readable proof  presentations, and automated support
              for counterexample  generation.
