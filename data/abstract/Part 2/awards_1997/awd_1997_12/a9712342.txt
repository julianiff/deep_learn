Abstract    :
              9712342  Rebane  A three year activity is being undertaken during which
              Professor Rebane will engage in an experimental investigation of filtering,
              processing and switching of multi-spectral optical signals, based on the effect
              of spectral hole-burning in cryogenically cooled dye-doped polymers.  The
              physical principle makes use of diffraction by holographic gratings recorded in
              photon-gated hole-burning materials.  This phenomenon may have significant
              application in the field of optical communications, data processing and
              storage.  ***
