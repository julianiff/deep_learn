Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9712915  CHAUDHURY      Factors influencing polyelectrolyte are
              greater and more complex than those in organic solvents.  Quantitative
              comparison of theory to experiment, and therefore a comprehensive understanding
              of these factors, is lacking.  Only a fraction studies conducted with
              polyelectrolytes used samples with sufficient monodisperse molecular weight
              distribution to quantitatively isolate the relevant phenomena.    This
              collaboration (TIE) project utilizes the expertise of two Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Centers to address this problem.  Researchers at the
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers for Coatings Research at
              Eastern Michigan University will synthesize three classes of polymers to
              address the study.  Researchers at the Industry/University Cooperative Research
              Center for Polymer Interfaces at Lehigh University will perform fundamental
              studies to build a ground-up understanding of the absorption behavior of these
              polymers.
