Abstract    :
              This research concerns two areas in geometric algorithms,  including the
              exploration of some promising connections  between them.  One area is the
              application of random walk  techniques in the design of algorithms for sampling
              from a  convex body, volume computation, and related geometric  problems like
              bringing a convex body to isotropic position.  The key technique is using a
              random walk to generate sample  points, and the analysis of mixing and other
              properties of  this walk.  Further improvements depend on a number of 
              unresolved technical questions, mostly in geometry but also  connected with
              Markov chains.  The other topic is geometric  representations of graphs, and
              the application of such  representations in the design of graph algorithms. 
              This has  surprising connections with graph properties and parameters  like
              chromatic number, cliques, connectivity, cuts, and  topological embeddablity.
              Representations with favorable  properties can be used to design exact or
              approximation  algorithms for many such problems.  There are geometric 
              representations connected with random walks on graphs, and  geometric
              properties of these representations reflect mixing  properties of the random
              walk.  Applications of these  representations in the analysis of random walk
              techniques  are being studied.
