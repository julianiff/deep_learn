Abstract    :
                9712271  Kydd  ***           This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer
              project seeks to  develop an innovative new chemistry for printing metallic
              conductors on temperature-sensitive substrates. The university partner has 
              pioneered in the creation of Thin Film Transistors (TFTs) for Active Matrix
              Liquid Crystal Displays (AMLCDs) by printing technology.  The small firm and
              university research groups have joined to demonstrate a new technology for
              printing the metallization on large arrays of TFTS.  This will eliminate most
              or all of the expensive photolithography required to produce AMLCDs and reduce
              the cost of manufacturing the displays by as much as half. Preliminary work has
              identified bonding between the printed metallization and the silicon or glass
              substrates as the key technical barrier.  The objective of this proposed
              program is to identify solutions to the bonding problem and demonstrate the
              feasibility of low-cost printed TFT arrays.         The work proposed will make
              AMLCDs that are bigger, cheaper and much easier to produce. This will result in
              really large, low cost displays  that can be used for picture-on-the- wall
              HDTV.  ***
