              Moore (OCE-9712298)                              ABSTRACT                       
                                              Moore, Shaw- OCE 9711298                       
                               The impact of submarine groundwater discharges (SGWD) on the 
              coastal ocean has been suggested to be quite significant for a  variety of
              chemical cycles and biogeochemical processes in the  near shore region.  Data
              however to quantify and chemically  characterize these groundwater fluxes are
              difficult to obtain and  are lacking in ocean and hydrological sciences.  The
              lead PI  Moore has already shown that the key to determining the scale of  SGWD
              are measurements of short-lived radium isotopes, 223Ra and  224Ra, and the
              longer lived 226Ra.  The association with the  second PI Shaw, adds the
              important expertise to measure Ba and  stable trace elements, so that the PI's
              can better evaluate the  influence of these groundwater fluxes on a broad range
              of trace  elements and nutrients that are of wider interest to the marine 
              sciences, hyrological sciences and coastal management  communities.       The
              PI's propose to place bounds on the fluxes and inputs of  groundwaters  using 
              a  regional sampling approach.   During  the  project, field sampling will be
              conducted on three major  cruises  in  the  South Atlantic Bight between North
              Carolina and Florida.  Shorter  cruises  are  proposed to respond to  specific 
              drought,  storm  or  rainfall events.  Groundwater investigations utilizing 
              existing   wells  near  these  study  sites  are  also  proposed.  Overall, the
              combination of their unique tracer measurements  and  ancillary  data  will
              allow the PI's to evaluate  the  impact  of  goundwater  fluxes  on  the 
              coastal oceans,  and  the  important  controls on the strengths and composition
              of these fluxes.
