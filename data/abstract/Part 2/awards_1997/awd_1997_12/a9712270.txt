Abstract    :
                9712270  Cockroft  ****    This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer
              project will investigate the feasibility of engineering high efficiency in
              phosphors with strong near-infrared absorption that matches the requirements of
               the proposer's display technology and of tuning the blue spectral @on
              properties by the precise control of dopant concentrations.  The development
              and validation of a design model that predicts optimum dopant concentrations by
              solving the dynamics of energy transfer is essential to the development of such
              a phosphor for our application.  In Phase I the proposers will establish and
              validate a model and demonstrate an improvement in brightness and spectral
              properties of the blue emission, relative to existing commercial materials,
              from a small phosphor volume representative of our anticipated pixel
              architecture. The proposer has  developed a new electro-optic flat-panel
              display concept offering significant advantages in brightness, scalability and
              screen flexibility over existing flat panel display technology.  Full
              consumer-market competitiveness of this technology will require innovative
              advances in the generation of full color emission using low cost lasers.  This
              proposal describes a novel phosphor concept to convert near-infrared radiation
              to blue emission.         Potential uses of the new spectrum for displays
              include industrial, business and military applications as well as mass market
              electronic products like TVs, computers and video games.  ***
