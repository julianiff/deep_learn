Abstract    :
              ECS-9712923  Kumar    Over the past fifty years a meticulous theory of systems
              and control has been developed.  During this time researchers have delved into
              and employed tools from many branches of mathematics, from algebraic geometry
              to martingales.  The result is well founded mathematical system and control
              theory.  The rich vocabulary of concepts developed by systems and control
              researchers integrating dynamics, stability, optimization, uncertainty and
              information - has the potential to pay rich dividends if it is further
              nourished carefully and properly harnessed.    Thus we are at an exciting time
              which is opportune for a "Workshop on Future Directions in Systems and
              Control."  Systems and control researchers with to key qualifications -
              accomplishment as well as vision - have been invited.  They have been
              instructed to present their work, which is well motivated technologically,
              based on a system theoretic foundation, and has and extrapolation which is
              inspiring.  The collection of these strands of excellence will inspire the
              collective by example, and serve as a catalyst for future directions.
