Abstract    :
              9712787  Bardet  This action is to support the establishment of an Internet 
              World Wide Web (WWW) site for the NSF project "Resolution of  Site Response
              Issues from the 1994 Northridge Earthquake  (ROSRINE)".    The ROSRINE project
              brings together a strongly-coordinated  group of geologists, geotechnical
              engineers and  seismologists from a number of organizations to address 
              geotechnical site characterization and ground response  issues resulting from
              the 1994 Northridge earthquake.  This  project is funded by the National
              Science Foundation, with  cost-sharing from the California Department of 
              Transportation (Caltrans), the Electric Power Research  Institute (EPRI), the
              Southern California Earthquake Center  (SCEC), and the U.S. Geological Survey
              (USGS).  The project  is performed in cooperation with the California
              Department  of Mines and Geology (CDMG).    Two critical elements of ROSRINE
              are (1) the data exchange  between the research teams, and (2) the data
              dissemination  to a large number of researchers and practicing engineers.  This
              is now to be achieved through the creation of an  Internet WWW site in order to
              exchange and disseminate  ROSRINE-generated data in an efficient and timely
              manner.
