Abstract    :
              The award will support a program of research on the emergence and support of
              distributed collaborative communities, particularly those that are centered
              around specific business or educational objectives. The key issues and
              questions to be explored include:  (a) How virtual communities differ from
              face-to-face communities; (b) How individuals signal membership and what are
              the mechanisms for and barriers to entry or exit  (c) How particular
              technological characteristics enable or obstruct group work and community
              building  (d) How virtual communities are forged across computer-based networks
              and across the physical-virtual divide; and  (e) What are the implications of
              breaking down divisions between 'home' and 'work,'  for individual 'lifescapes'
              and broader community infrastructures. The methods to be used in this project
              include ethnographic studies and joint analysis of  videotape data.
