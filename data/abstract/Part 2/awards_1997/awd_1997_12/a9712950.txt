Abstract    :
              Poole  A Study of the Adoption and Implementation of Quality Programs at the
              Work Unit Level  Abstract  No matter how well-designed an organization-wide
              quality program might be, it will fail to have an effect if it is not adopted
              by the organization's work units.  The willingness of work units to adopt and
              fully implement quality programs determines the ultimate impact and
              effectiveness of these programs.  There is a dearth of knowledge concerning the
              adoption and implementation of quality programs by work units.  Hackman and
              Wageman's (1995) review of total quality management research indicated that of
              99 studies they reviewed, only 4 assessed degree of implementation of quality
              programs.  Given the high rate of discontinuation of quality initiatives,
              knowledge of the factors that promote adoption and effective implementation of
              quality programs would be useful from both a theoretical and practical
              standpoint.  This project investigates three interrelated explanations of the
              adoption and implementation of quality programs: structural, process and
              institutional explanations.  Dependent variables are decision to adopt, degree
              of implementation of quality program, and degree of effectiveness of quality
              program.  The study will investigate the ability of the three models to predict
              adoption and degree of implementation of quality programs within a large health
              care organization.    +f/ªÛ=+  ±  ?- ¼- +
