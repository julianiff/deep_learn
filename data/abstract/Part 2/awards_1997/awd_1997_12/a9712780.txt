Abstract    :
                9712780  Guffy  The proposal is for a Development phase Rural Systemic
              Initiative grant from West Texas A&M University, on behalf of a consortium of
              educational leaders and institutions in the state of Texas.  The project
              targets 178,000 students in 196 school districts in 73 rural counties.      The
              proposers would accomplish the goals of the development phase by organizing 6
              Focus Groups, each representative of the rural regions of Texas.  The groups
              will focus on:  1) SMT education; 2) Rural Workforce and Economic Development;
              3) Scientific Literacy and Appreciation in Rural Communities; 4) Rural
              Community Infrastructures; 5) Integrated Systemic Reform; and 6) Rural Resource
              Partnerships and Alignments.  In each of these areas, the Focus Groups will
              document the current state of several key indicators.  ??
