Abstract    :
                  9712605  Dorman    This ocean sciences instrumentation development project
              will   develop and test an acoustic seismic source which uses   hydrostatic
              pressure rather than explosives. The implosive   device consists of a pressure
              case with a hole on one end. The   hole is covered with a special ceramic plate
              prior to   deployment.  At depth, the plate is broken, causing an   implosion,
              which in turn produces a low-frequency acoustic   signal for use in seafloor
              research applications such as dealing   with shallow shear velocity structures
              and short refraction   profiles. Work to be performed involves engineering
              tests and   at-sea trials to compare the acoustic signals from those from  
              other types of sound sources. The proposed implosive device   would be safer
              than explosives and would not be encumbered with   regulatory restrictions.
