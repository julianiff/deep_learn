Abstract    :
              ***  9712200  Potter    This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer project
              will investigate the intrinsic properties of a new phosphor material. There is
              a critical need for efficient low voltage phosphors for the continuing
              development of field emission displays (FED) to compete effectively with
              entrenched active matrix liquid crystal displays (AMLCDs).  The proposer has
              recently developed a new low voltage blue cathodoluminescent phosphor as a thin
              film as well as a proprietary FED.  Elevated temperature, and therefore
              expensive substrates, are required to integrate this new phosphor into the
              display device.  To permit integration at lower temperature on less expensive
              substrates, such as glass or plastic, the new phosphor material will be
              synthesized utilizing ceramic techniques and then deposited using rf
              sputtering, which is a low temperature process.  Process parameters will be
              optimized for low voltage cathodoluminescent efficiency and maximum luminosity.
               Detailed analysis of the new material will enable the incorporation of dopants
              that will provide spectral responses suitable for full color displays.
              Establishing viable processes to incorporate the phosphor into FEDs will lead
              to the Phase II objective of fabricating the proposer's FED in existing
              integrated circuit (IC) foundries.         A wide variety of display
              technologies including field emission, electroluminescent, vacuum fluorescent,
              and surface conduction electron emitter display products.  ***
