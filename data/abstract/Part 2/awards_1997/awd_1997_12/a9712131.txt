Abstract    :
              The award will support a program of research on problems of coordination in
              networks. A network is a group of people or processors with links between
              certain pairs. Some of the problems to be studied take a network as a given and
              consider how to manage it efficiently. In other cases, the problem is how to
              design a network, as well as how to design the procedures to be followed by the
              agents at its nodes. In some of the design problems the agent at a node is
              assumed, in effect, to be a robot who behaves as the designer wishes, while in
              others the agent is autonomous and has independent goals that the designer has
              to take into account. Networks serve different purposes: transforming inputs
              into outputs, sending messages from one node to another, transporting
              commodities, coordinating mobile units, or dividing up computational tasks
              among processors. Part of this research considers differences between those
              purposes as well as their common properties. Other parts of the research pursue
              general themes in the design of efficient human organizations and the
              adaptation of market mechanisms to novel tasks of resource allocation.
