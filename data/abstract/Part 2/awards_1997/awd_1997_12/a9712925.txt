Abstract    :
                  9712925  Sanders     This project represents a collaborative effort between
              Dr. Sanders and Dr. Mullen of the University of Arizona (ATM-9714397).  It
              involves an investigation of the impact of initial data uncertainty and model
              error on, and the usefulness of ensemble forecasting techniques for, medium
              range (3-5 day) prediction of explosive cyclogenesis.  The principals
              investigators are employing fields from a long-term climate simulation with
              NCAR's Community Climate Model (CCM2) as well as analyses and operational
              forecasts of a classic case of explosive cyclogenesis which was observed during
              the Experiment on Rapidly Intensifying Cyclones over the Atlantic (ERICA)
              project.  Critical issues to be explored include the design of initial
              perturbations, the minimum number of members for the ensemble and the minimum
              resolution required for ensemble forecast purposes.       The results of this
              research could be of enormous practical benefit to operational weather
              forecasting.
