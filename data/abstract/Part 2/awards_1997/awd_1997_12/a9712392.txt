Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9712392  SCOTT    This proposal requests continued direct funding,
              for an additional two year period, of a  Center Evaluator at two
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers (IUCRCs).    The two centers
              are the Center for Process Analytical Chemistry (CPAC) at the University of 
              Washington (UW) and the Center for the Design of Analog/Digital Integrated
              Circuits (CDADIC), a multi-site center, headquartered at the Washington State
              University (WSU) in Pullman, Washington.  Four additional universities are
              involved in CDADIC as satellite research centers. These additional CDADIC sites
              are located at: the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle, Washington,
              Opegon State University (OSU) in Corvallis, Oregon-, The State University of
              New York (SUNY) at Stony Brook, New York, and, a probable additional site to be
              affiliated in 1997  it has 1996-97 planning grant  is Tuskegee University (TU)
              in Tuskegee, Alabama.    The evaluator will continue to be responsible for
              implementation of the I/UCRC Center Assessment Program at both centers.  This
              is a series of three related studies designed to identify the factors that have
              been shown to contribute to and/or inhibit attainment of each center's goals
              and outcomes. Included among the three basic studies are: a) developing
              comparative descriptions and conducting analyses of each center's developmental
              history in the form of annual historical profile updates; b) conducting
              intermediate and long-term studies of each center's organizational
              effectiveness using faculty and sponsor outcome instruments, and; c) conducting
              exit interviews of industrial sponsors that terminate their affiliation with
              either center.
