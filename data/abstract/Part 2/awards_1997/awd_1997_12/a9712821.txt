Abstract    :
              9712821  Mathiowitz  The aims of this research are to develop a novel 
              magnetically based system for bioadhesive measurements and  to develop local
              bioadhesive drug delivery systems, which  provide enhanced bioavailability of
              therapeutic agents to  treat peptide ulcers.  This research includes the 
              objectives:  (1) to finalize the development of a new  magnetic method to study
              bioadhesion between polymeric  microspheres and living tissue, (2) to use this
              method to  study bioadhesion of drug-delivering spheres to  gastrointestinal
              tissue, and (3) to track orally  administered microspheres in experimental
              rats.  The  adhesion forces will be measured by quantifying the magnetic  force
              required to hold an iron-loaded microsphere  stationary, while the adherent
              tissue is separated at a  constant rate.  The polymers selected for trial,
              hydrogels  and thermoplastic polyanhydrides, will be used to  encapsulate and
              deliver two different drugs, fibroblast  growth factor and platelet derived
              growth factor, which have  been shown to be useful in the treatment of ulcers.
