Abstract    :
              This  research  explores  a new two-dimensional  distributed  actuator  system
              for transporting a human body  on  a  flat,  compliant  surface by generating
              periodic  waves  on  a  bed  surface.   An  array of fiber actuators made of
              NiTi  Shape-  memory  alloy  (SMA)  are woven into  a  bed  mattress,  and 
              periodic surface waves are created by coordinating  the  SMA  fiber  actuators 
              that move the individual coil  springs  in  both vertical and horizontal
              directions. This active surface  system allows transfer of a bedridden patient
              between a  bed  and  a  chair without lifting the patient.  It also provides 
              assistance  to the patient for changing his/her position  or  posture  in  the
              bed to prevent bedsores. In  this  project,  kinematic  and static behavior of
              the active surface  system  interacting  with  the human body will be analyzed;
               optimal  wave  forms for transporting the human body comfortably  and 
              efficiently will be obtained; control algorithms for  moving  the  human  body
              and changing its posture will be  developed  based  on  the estimate of the
              body posture; and the  design  and  control guidelines for reducing the
              complexity  of  the  distributed actuator system will be addressed.
