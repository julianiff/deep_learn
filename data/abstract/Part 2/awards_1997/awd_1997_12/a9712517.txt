Abstract    :
                    This proposal seeks funding to support a faculty member to be resident at
              NSF for the purposes of studying LIS proposals, funded projects, and related
              high technology sites with educational mandates for their potential benefit for
              education, generally, and educational research in particular. The study would
              proceed in the manner of case study formative evaluation plan that would
              include site visits, and holding workshops on themes similar to the ones
              addressed above.  The outcome of this SGER would be a set of papers for
              presentation to NSF and other interested audiences leading, perhaps to a
              publication that would allow NSF to inform the field of educational researchers
              about  NSF's research and development agenda in light of the innovations of LIS
              and, ultimately, Knowledge and Distributed Intelligence. Other outcomes could
              include the dissemination of these recommendations in other formats including
              conference presentations.
