Abstract    :
              Abstract    L. Glicksman - CTS 9712053        The principal investigator
              proposes to study the influence of fluidized bed hydrodynamics, particularly
              the characteristics of the gas layer near the wall and the adjacent clusters of
              solids and their contact time, on the heat transfer.  The emphasis will be on
              rough walls and tube-fin walls.  An understanding of the statistical nature of
              the contact time is necessary for the future development of models that
              incorporate radiative transfer between surface adjacent to the dilute gas-solid
              mixture and the bed core.
