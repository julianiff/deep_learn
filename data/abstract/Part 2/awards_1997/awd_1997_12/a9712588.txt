Abstract    :
              The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Amitabha Sinha of   The
              University of California - San Diego in his continuing studies on the  
              influence of initial vibrational state selection on the dissociation   dynamics
              of molecules.  Using vibrational overtone-overtone double   resonance, he can
              prepare HOCl in specific rovibrational states on the   ground electronic state
              surface and investigate the expected   non-statistical behavior. 
              Photodissociation dynamics of molecules (e.g.,   CH3I and H2O) occurring on
              excited electronic states will also be   investigated, with the goal to better
              understand the coupling of   vibrational motion with nearly degenerate
              electronic excited states.    The study of chemical reactions and their
              associated reaction dynamics   stands at the forefront of contemporary physical
              chemistry. The goal of   the present study is to understand how various
              molecular vibrations   having similar total energy but corresponding to
              different intramolecular   distribution of the excitation influence chemical
              reactivity.   Measurements in which the excited states are fully resolved yield
              data   which allow detailed comparisons with current theoretical models and  
              promise to provide new insights into the factors that influence   selectivity
              in chemical reactions.
