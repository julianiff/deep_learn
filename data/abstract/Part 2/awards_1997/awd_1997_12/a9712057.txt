              ABSTRACT  ATM -9712057  Dirmeyer, Paul A.  Institute of Global Environment &
              Society, Inc.    TITLE: Integrating Climate,  Hydrologic,  and Decision Support
              Models for Regional Assessment.    The idea of the proposal is to develop an
              integrated assessment capability based on component models.  For this it is
              proposed to improve current climate,  hydrologic and assessment models and to 
              develop effective mechanisms for coupling these models in order to produce
              increasingly detailed projections of regional climate changes in climate and
              hydrological conditions which in turn are used to provide more realistic
              assessment of the consequences of resulting changes in water availability for
              key sectors.  This system will be tested over the Ganges-Brahmaputra valley.  
              This research fits into the goals of MMIA very well and if successful will help
              mitigating the detrimental effects of climate change.
