Abstract    :
              9712195  Stark, Louise  University of the Pacific    Special Project:  Workshop
              on Undergraduate Education and Computer Vision    This project provides partial
              support for faculty from primarily undergraduate teaching institutions to
              attend the IEEE sponsored Workshop on Undergraduate Education and Computer
              Vision, held in conjunction with the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
              (CVPR) '97 Conference.  Growth of the field of image-related computation,
              including particularly computer vision and pattern recognition, has created a
              significant need for additional educational opportunities in these areas and
              this project provides a highly leveraged approach toward meeting a part of that
              need.  The workshop provides well-documented examples of courses, course
              modules, case studies, laboratory resources and other teaching materials to
              help faculty design high-quality image-related undergraduate courses.
