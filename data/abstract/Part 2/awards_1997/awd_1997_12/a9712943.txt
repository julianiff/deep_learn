Abstract    :
              9712943  Woods  This proposal is the joint effort of the Southwestern Oklahoma
              State University, the Putnam City Schools, The Tulsa Public Schools and the
              Consortium for the Advancement of Science and Mathematics Education in
              Oklahoma.  Rural areas of Oklahoma contain one of the largest and most diverse
              populations of American Indians in the world.  Over 35 tribal groups have their
              own education officers and special education support systems, and most American
              Indian Students in Oklahoma attend public schools.  Rural Oklahoma also has a
              significant, growing population of Hispanics and a significant concentration of
              African Americans.    The proposal has linked to broad-based partnerships and
              plans to develop coherent linkages with existing programs to target systemic
              reform in Oklahoma.  The primary focus will be the establishment of a
              foundation for implementation of systemic reform in science, mathematics and
              technology education throughout the state, including the development of an
              implementation proposal to NSF.
