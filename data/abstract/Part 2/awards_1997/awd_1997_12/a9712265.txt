Abstract    :
                       This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer project seeks to
              develop organic light emitting diode (OLED) technology for low-power, low-cost
              displays.  A proprietary OLED technology, based on vacuum-deposited,
              small-molecule organic thin films, is widely recognized for excellent
              brightness and contrast, fast response time, high power efficiency at low
              operating voltage, and excellent reliability.  The proposer recently
              demonstrated a novel stacked OLED pixel architecture (SOLED) that achieves
              high-resolution, full color performance, where the red (R), green (G) and blue
              (B) sub-pixels are vertically positioned to emit any mixture of color and
              brightness.  To realize full commercial potential, however, significant
              research remains to be done to achieve saturated full-color.  The proposers
              intend to perform certain materials research and device structure optimization
              to demonstrate the feasibility of achieving saturated R-G-B spectral emission
              characteristics.  If successful, this research will provide the basis for high
              resolution, full-color displays in Phase II using photolithographic patterning
              techniques.         This technology has the potential to serve transportation,
              industrial, communications, computing and consumer electronics markets,
              including applications for personal digital assistants, projection displays,
              viewfinders in camcorders, video phones, hand-held computers, computer
              monitors, and, ultimately, the TV monitor on the wall.
