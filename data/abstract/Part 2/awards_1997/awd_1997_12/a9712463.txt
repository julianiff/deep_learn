Abstract    :
              9712463  LIPSCOMB    Nemerteans are common and important predatory worms, with
              ca. 1200 described species occupying a wide range of aquatic habitats.  Their
              biological attributes are of general and pharmacological interest and figure
              prominently in theories of animal diversification.  Yet they are widely ignored
              because identification, even to very broad levels, is difficult.  These worms
              have few external features that can be used reliably to tell them apart.  Until
              now, nemertean taxonomy has been based largely on reconstruction of internal
              anatomy via histological serial sectioning.  However, reference collections of
              sectioned specimens are poorly developed.  Identifying a nemertean is usually a
              long and labor-intensive process dependent on an uncertain record of prior
              work.  Few experts in this group are now active.  The named species represent
              less than a quarter of those thought to be extant.    In this PEET proposal,
              Diana Lipscomb and colleagues will improve the state of nemertean taxonomy by
              describing new species, reconstructing phylogenetic relationships among the
              species, upgrading the worldOs largest reference collection of histologically
              sectioned nemerteans, and developing a computerized nemertean information
              system linking text, data, and image files and available via the World Wide Web
              and CD-ROM.  The research will promote nested collaborations among nemertean
              researchers worldwide, and will train three new nemertean taxonomists in modern
              methods developed and applied to these worms during the course of the project.
