Abstract    :
                  9712761  Pantelides  This project conducts full-scale lateral load field
              tests of  reinforced concrete bridge bents to demonstrate the ability of 
              carbon fiber composite materials to increase structural integrity  and improve
              resistance to cyclic, lateral loading.  The tests  target specifically the
              improvement of the shear capacity of the  cap beam-column joints.    The test
              results will be used to calibrate analytical models and  suggest procedures for
              design of cap beam-column joints with  carbon fiber composites.  ***
