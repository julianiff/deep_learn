Abstract    :
              9712311  Hofmeister     A multifaceted approach is needed to understand the
              dynamics of the 410 km discontinuity near subducting plates and its connection
              with non-equilibrium transitions from olivine to b- and g-spinel.  The PIs
              propose:  (1) to measure transformation kinetics, hydration, and thermodynamic 
               properties from in situ  (T up to ~900(C at P up to ~50 GPa) infrared spectra
              of various approximations to slab and mantle compositions and to elucidate
              mechanisms through TEM and petrographic studies of recovered samples; (2) to
              constrain olivine metastability and the elevation, sharpness, and velocity
              contrast of the 410 km discontinuity in and near five subduction zones from
              seismic traveltime and waveform modeling.  (3) Construct a thermal-kinetic
              model to link mineral physics and seismic results.  The sub-areas are strongly
              linked: Rate laws determined from the IR data form the basis for the
              geodynamical model which will provide the temperature distribution for
              calculating synthetic seismograms.  Matching to seismic traveltimes and
              waveforms will provide feedback to the thermal-kinetic modeling in a
              highly-coupled manner.  Model results will provide guidelines for new IR
              experiments.  ***
