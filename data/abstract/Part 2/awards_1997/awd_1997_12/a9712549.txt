Abstract    :
              A near-bottom geological and geophysical survey of the eastern Atlantis
              ridge-transform-intersection will provide key observations necessary to assess
              whether oceanic massifs are anaoloous to continental core complexes.  The stdy
              will include DSL-120 side-scan sonar to produce a detailed morphologic base map
              of the entire massif.  Specifid sites will be targete for mapping and sampling
              with Jason/Medea and Alvin.
