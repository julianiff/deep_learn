Abstract    :
              9712657  Kabanov  This proposal will investigate complexes formed between 
              nucleic acids and cationic block copolymers and their  potential use in
              delivering DNA into cells.  Both water  soluble complexes (using polyethylene
              oxide/polyspermine  copolymers) and complexes soluble in non-polar media 
              (polystyrene/poly N-ethyl vinylpyridinium bromide) will be  synthesized and
              investigated.  Extensive characterization of  the complexes is planned via
              electron microscopy, circular  dichroism, light scattering, etc.  The rate of
              DNA release  from the complex under several "cellular" mechanisms will  also be
              studied.  ***
