Abstract    :
              9712602    This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) award is  funded to 
              initiate efforts to provide guidelines for assessing,  controlling, and 
              monitoring ground movements and building damage that are  direct and 
              uncomplicated, that will be accepted by contractors,  designers, and 
              preservationists, and that will aid in the provision of  improved, adequate, 
              and economic protection of structures.  The research will  develop model  tests
              involving four large tieback walls, which will be  extensively  instrumented
              and monitored during testing by excavation.  Models will be  used also to
              investigate scaling relationships and  interaction between  ground, retaining
              walls, and surrounding structures, during  and after  excavation.  Results of
              analyses will be compared with data  from previous  and current field cases. 
              These efforts will be used to  support the  development and assessment of
              guidelines for controlling  damage.  By  capitalizing on their strong existing
              cooperative efforts  with industry,  the principal investigators will formulate
              new criteria that  will result in  safer, more realistic, and more economical
              control of ground  movements,  while providing a higher level of protection for
              historic  and urban  structures.  ***
