Abstract    :
              9712322  Rai  Description:  This proposal provides final  funding to support
              participation of Delhi  University scientists currently resident in the  US and
              working on the DO Experiment at the  Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. 
              The  project is headed on the US side by Paul  Grannis, Stony Brook with coPI,
              Hugh  Montgomery, Fermilab.  The cooperating Indian  scientist is Dr. Ram
              Shivpuri, Director of the  Centre for Detector and Related Software 
              Technology.  The Delhi group has extensive  experience with the study of quark
              and gluon  structure, with detectors, and have the  computational techniques
              required for particle  physics studies.  They also have a strong  capability
              with the design of software systems  for offline computer analysis of data. 
              Scope:  The collaboration brings technical  capabilities from India, as well as
              equipment  provided from Indian sources, to   allow participation with American
              scientists in  the particle physics studies carried out at  Fermilab.  This is
              a unique opportunity for the  Indian participants to work on high energy 
              experiments at one of the world's most powerful  accelerators.  On March 3,
              1995, Fermilab  announced the discovery of the TOP quark by  this group of high
              energy physicists.      ***
