Abstract    :
              Prof. Oyama will continue studying the low-temperature catalytic oxidation of
              organic compounds with ozone over transition metal oxide catalysts.  Oxygenate
              and aromatic compounds, such as ethanol and toluene, will be oxidized
              competitively over Mn or Mo oxides supported on zirconia, titania, alumina and
              silica. The various supports will provide different reductibility - thus
              electron-accepting capability-to the oxides. The kinetics and mechanism of
              reactions, and the key steps determining selectivity will be studied by
              isotopic distribution.  The adsorbed intermediates will be investigated by in
              situ laser Raman spectroscopy.  The chemistry of oxidation with ozone will also
              be studied in separate flow reactor at high flow-rates on other oxides of
              interest.  Oxides of Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Co and Ni, wash-coated on open-cell foam
              substrate, will be tested in terms of activity for low-temperature catalytic
              oxidation of VOC model compounds with ozone.
