Abstract    :
              9712620  Garrison    The objective of this research is to investigate the
              effects  of carbon content on sulfide formation and void nucleation  resistance
              in titanium-modified steels.  It is hypothesized  that increasing the carbon
              content of titanium-modified  steels causes the precipitate particles of the
              Ti2CS sulfide  to be formed at higher temperatures, thereby producing  larger
              sulfide sizes.  Since the void nucleation resistance  of Ti2CS particles is
              expected to decrease with increasing  particle size, tying up sulfur as Ti2CS
              should be less  effective in improving fracture toughness as the carbon 
              content increases.  If it is confirmed that increasing the  carbon content
              increases the sulfide size and diminishes the  void nucleation resistance in
              the titanium-modified steels,  then methods will be explored to:  (1) refine
              the sulfide  size when the sulfur is gettered as Ti2CS, or (2) create new 
              methods of gettering the sulfur into void nucleation  resistant particles that
              remain effective at higher carbon  levels.  One approach that will be
              considered is to dissolve  the sulfides and later reprecipitate them at lower 
              temperatures in the austenite.  If the sulfide size is  refined by this
              approach and the reprecipitated sulfides are  Ti2CS, then the toughness of
              higher carbon steels which  contain reprecipitated sulfides will be
              investigated as well  as the void nucleation resistance behavior of these finer
               reprecipitated sulfides.  Gettering sulfur as Nb2CS rather  than as Ti2CS will
              also be considered.  Recent results  suggest that this is feasible and that
              such particles are  resistant to void nucleation.  %%  This research explores
              microstructural factors that  influence the fracture behavior of structural
              steels.  It  has potential impact on the design of fracture-resistant  metal
              alloys that could be employed in structures with  improved lifetimes and
              safety.  ***
