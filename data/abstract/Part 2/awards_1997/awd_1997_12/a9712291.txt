Abstract    :
              ***  9712291  Geubelle  An experimental and analytical research project will 
              investigate the fiber debond and pull-out processes in fiber  reinforced
              polymeric and ceramic matrix composites subjected  to dynamic loading
              conditions. While extensive work has been  performed regarding these two
              failure mechanisms under quasi-  static loading conditions, and while all
              preliminary  investigations on that topic indicate a strong dependence on  the
              loading rate, very little is currently known on how  these processes take place
              under dynamic loading conditions.  The joint experimental and analytical
              research project aims  at shedding some light on the dynamic debonding and
              pull-out  processes and constitutes a mandatory preliminary step for  the
              design of impact-tolerant composite structures.    The experimental part of the
              project consists of dynamic  push-out and pull-out tests performed on various
              model  composites with the aid of a specially adapted Split  Hopkinson Bar
              apparatus. In addition to macroscopic  load/displacement curves obtained from
              the elastodynamic  response of the bars, in situ optical observations of the 
              debonding and pull-out processes will be performed using a  photoelastic 
              set-up  and  a high  speed  camera, providing  independent measurements of the
              debonding length and speed.  In  situ thermographical measurements on the model
              composite  and post mortem microscopic analyses of the fracture  surfaces will
              also be performed to capture the possible  occurrence of localized frictional
              heating which has been  shown in some preliminary investigations to drastically
               affect the pull-out process.***    The analytical part of the project has two
              basic objectives:  firstly,   detailed  finite  element  simulations   of   the
               experimental  set-up will be performed to characterize  with  precision  the 
              dynamic  loading of the  composite  specimen  during  the  tests. Secondly, two
              distinct and complementary  numerical  schemes  (a  special volumetric/cohesive
               dynamic  finite  elemen t scheme and a spectral form of  the  boundary 
              integral method) will be used to investigate the adequacy of  existing 
              cohesive  and  friction  models  to  capture   the  observed fiber debond and
              pull-out processes.***
