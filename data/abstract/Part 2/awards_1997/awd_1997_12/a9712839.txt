Abstract    :
                      CTS-9712839          P.H. McMurray          Univ. of Minnesota         
              SUMMARY             The Fifth International Congress on Particle Sizing will be
              held in    Minneapolis, August 11-14, 1998.     The specific topics, pertaining
              to fundamentals of optical particle sizing,    that will be covered by this
              meetings, are as follows:     (Elastic scattering of shaped light beams by
              shaped particles;   (Dynamic light scattering              (Multiple scattering
              by suspended and deposited particles              ( Inelastic scattering.      
                       The conference will also cover innovative applications of these
              principles to measure particle size, size distribution, concentration, and
              measurement of particle properties other than the size including shape and
              compostition.     The areas of application that will be covered are:    (Fluid
              mechanic of multiphase flows, such as sprays of non-reacting and reacting    
              liquids;  (Particulate matter in pharmaceutical and chemical processes, such as
              crystallization,  powder handling etc.  (Aerosol mechanics;  (Particle sizing
              in the semiconductor industry, etc.
