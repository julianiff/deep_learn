Abstract    :
              9712785  Selvam  This project is centered on the unusual series of tornadoes 
              that occurred on March first, 1997, which covered nine  counties in Arkansas,
              killed twenty five persons, injured  more than two hundred, and destroyed a
              large number of  buildings.  During the study data will be collected on 
              structural damage, meteorological conditions and other  pertinent
              characteristics of this event from all available  local, state and Federal
              sources.  From this information  correlations will be established between type
              of damage,  construction practices, codes implementation and structural 
              design.  The objectives are to assess the effectiveness, or  lack of, ongoing
              construction practices in high risk areas,  and to make available to the
              research community a unique  data base.  These findings will help develop
              efficient and  economic extreme wind hazards mitigation procedures.  ***
