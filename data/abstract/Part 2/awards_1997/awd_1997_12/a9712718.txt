              Educational Innovation:Undergraduate Modeling, Simulation and Analysis    This
              CISE Educational Innovation award supports the development of a new course
              sequence in computational science for undergraduates.  The program, entitled 
              Undergraduate Modeling, Simulation and Analysis (USMA), enables qualified
              undergraduates to broaden their educational experience via small group
              interaction with faculty who are active researchers in modeling, simulation and
              analysis.  The USMA program provides formal courses in these areas as
              preparatory work for research in computational science, encourages small-group
              interaction with research-active faculty via a mentored research seminar,
              offers an integrative interdisciplinary project based on an application from
              engineering or the sciences, creates a mechanism for students from Hampton
              University to participate in the USMA program and begins to incorporate courses
              in computational science at that institution, as well.
