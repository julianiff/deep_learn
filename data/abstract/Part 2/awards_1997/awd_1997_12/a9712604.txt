Abstract    :
              Abstract  9712604  R.H. Davis, U. of Colorado - Boulder    The effect of
              particle roughness on particle-particle interactions in suspension flow will be
              experimentally and theretically investigated, including the visualization and
              analysis of particle collisions.  The study includes observation of particle
              contact and rebound by using microvideo photography, development of models of
              the contact forces and torques that can be subsequently employed to predict
              particle motions and flow microstructures, and formulation of a theoretical
              framework to study the flows with particle-particle contacts.    The project
              has relevance to particle and multiphase processes in industry and environment,
              and deals with a key research issue in suspension flow that has not yet
              received proper attention.  ***
