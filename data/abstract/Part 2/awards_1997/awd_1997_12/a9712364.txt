Abstract    :
              9712364  Kicher  This activity focuses on the development of assist devices  for
              people with disabilities.  This involves the Case  Engineering Service Group
              (CESG) of the Case School of  Engineering at Case Western Reserve University. 
              The CESG is  composed of undergraduate engineering students that  volunteer
              their time or receive academic credit to design  and build custom
              rehabilitative devices for individuals with  disabilities receiving care at the
              various medical  institutions in the Cleveland area.  This activity involves 
              over 100 students, five engineering classes involved with  projects and
              approximately 60 completed projects per year.  Examples of recently completed
              projects include:  (1) a  feeding re-enforcement tool for children with severe
              mental  retardation, (2) a tricycle that can be propelled by hand  with seating
              to provide posture support and security for  children with cerebral palsy, (3)
              a device to provide  computer access for children with ventilator dependence
              and  quadriplegia, (4) a specialized toy car to provide  independent mobility
              for a child with a spinal cord injury,  and (5) a pediatric playstation to
              encourage and motivate a  variety of children with disabilities to achieve more
               progress in their physical, occupational and speech therapy.  ***
