Abstract    :
              9712921  G.  H. Bernstein     University of Notre Dame    CISE Educational
              Innovation :  From Bits to Chips: A Multidisciplinary Curriculum for
              Microelectronics Systems Design Education    This CISE Educational Innovation
              award supports the development of an interrelated set of courses from the
              Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) and Electrical Engineering  (EE)
              departments that will emphasize both the technical and human aspects of
              microelectronics system development.  As a part of the project, students will
              work in interdepartmental teams to design and fabricate a working
              microelectronics system, specifically a microprocessor.  The project builds on
              particular strengths of the EE and CSE departments at Notre Dame and the
              educational plan is symbiotic with ongoing collaborative research between the
              two departments in the areas of nanotechnology, processing-in-memory computer
              architectures, and circuit and fabrication process optimization.  In addition
              to bringing research results into the curriculum, it is expected that ideas
              from development and implementation of the new courses will also assist the
              ongoing research.
