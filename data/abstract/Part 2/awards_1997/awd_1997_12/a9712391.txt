Abstract    :
              9712391  Marston  This young theorist is making a transition from an NYI award 
              to the regular program.  He is proposing work on a variety  of aspects of the
              strongly correlated electron problem.  In  theme, the chosen topics involve the
              role of quantum  coherence in a quantum many body problem.  For example, 
              during the scattering of an atom from a surface, charge  transfer takes place
              by tunneling, leading to a distribution  of charge species in the final
              product.  The PI has  successfully treated the interplay between the loss of 
              coherence and the strong Coulomb repulsion using a 1/N  expansion (N is the
              degeneracy of electrons in surface  states), finding good agreement with the
              experiments.  He is  planning an extension to higher orders, to improve the 
              understanding of experiments. Other topics in this project  include coherence
              and enlarged symmetries in quantum  nanostructures,  exact solutions of plateau
              problem in  integer quantum Hall effect and bosonization approaches to  the
              strongly correlated electron problem in 2 dimensions.  %%%  This young PI has
              been supported to work on two different  problems.  As an NYI, he has been
              studying the many body  problem of strongly interacting electrons, including
              the  properties under strong magnetic fields.  In a separate  grant, he has
              been studying the many body aspects of the  production of ions in an
              atom-surface collision.  In this  new grant, which combines his diverse
              research program in a  single grant, he is proposing to begin study in some new
               areas such as quantum dots.  ***
