Abstract    :
              The goal of this research program is to develop a realistic understanding of the
              complex dynamic behavior of piles and pile groups.  The aim is to develop a
              comprehensive database to (1) measure quantitatively the influence of realistic
              soil behaviors, practical soil profiles, pile configurations, static foundation
              preloads, and dynamic excitation levels, and (2) to validate and evaluate the
              accuracy and limitations of current analytical models and computational methods
              for analyzing soil-foundation interaction.

To achieve these goals, a series
              of experiments are being conducted on physical models of single and group piles
              embedded in the ground.  The results from these experiments will be used to
              calibrate and improve the predictive capability of the state-of-the-art
              analytical models (both simplified and complex) for soil dynamics analysis.
