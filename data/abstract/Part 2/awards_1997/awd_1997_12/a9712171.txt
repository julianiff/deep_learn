Abstract    :
                ECS-9712171  Nasser Peyghambarian    Professors Peyghambarian and Mazumder
              will explore the potential of organic photorefractive polymeric devices in a
              number of applications, including erasable high density optical storage,
              reconfigurable interconnects, holographic security and real time image
              processing applications.  This work will particularly focus upon the organic
              photorefractive materials used, and the effects of creating high optical
              excitations densities in organic solids.
