Abstract    :
              The proposed research addresses the current stagnation in N-  gram  language 
              modeling by developing a set  of  principled  techniques by which higher level
              structure can be applied to  the  problem of language modeling.  These
              techniques include  trans-finite-state    probabilistic    grammar   
              formalisms  (probabilistic feature grammars and tree-insertion grammars)  that 
              are  both  practical  and  lexically  sensitive,   and  similarity-based
              methods that address data sparsity  problem  for  large-N models directly.  A
              novel technique  of  multi-  pass parsing has potential utility in addressing
              some of the  practical  computational issues that  arise  in  using  such 
              models.   This  promising  combination  of  techniques   ---  lexicalized 
              grammar formalisms and the  multi-pass  parsing  method  to  make them
              practical, along with similarity-based  estimation to aid in solving data
              sparsity problems ---  has  the  potential  to  improve  language  modeling 
              beyond  the  asymptote   that  it  has  reached,  with  applications   in 
              improving  speech  recognition, information  retrieval,  and  many other
              language-processing applications.
