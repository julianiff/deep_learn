Abstract    :
              This research project will expand the evidentiary base for our understanding of
              the relationship between science and the concept of gender before they are
              their relationship were transformed during the nineteenth century.   By doing
              this the project will also reevaluate the emergence of science as a significant
              source of cultural and social authority.  Much of the existing historical
              literature attributes to the fields of anatomy, physiology, and psychology in
              the years before 1800 a cultural power that only developed by fits and starts
              during the nineteenth century.  Research materials for this project include
              lecture notes, correspondence, early printed materials, and municipal records
              that will be obtained from university, professional and public archives in
              Britain and the Netherlands.  Publications likely to result from this project
              include a monograph and a sourcebook for university students, which will
              provide them access to rare research materials.
