Abstract    :
              9712301  Presnall   This award will help support travel expenses for U.S.
              participants at the International Pressure Calibration Workshop to be held in
              Misasa, Japan in August 1997. The workshop is sponsored by the Institute for
              Study of the Earth's Interior at Okayama University in Japan. The purpose of
              the workshop is to develop an internationally accepted standard pressure scale
              to cover the recently attained range of ultra-high pressures now reproducible
              in the laboratory. The development of such a scale is necessary in light of
              recent technological advances with diamond-anvil cells and other high-pressure
              apparatus that has extended experimentally available pressures (and
              simultaneously available temperatures) well beyond the range accessible a
              decade ago.  ***
