Abstract    :
               This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) is to develop a new liquid
              metal flow anemometry method suitable for use at temperatures above the
              operating range of existing non-consumable probes (i.e. at temperatures in
              excess of 770 degrees Celsius).  It is anticipated that the device will provide
              spatial and temporal resolution on the order of 2 mm and 1 ms, respectively,
              thus significantly improving upon present measurement capabilities.  The
              device, fabricated from temperature resistant ceramics, will incorporate thin
              pressure-sensitive ceramic diaphragms and dual-cantilever.  The development of
              a new liquid metal flow anemometry method will provide the basis for a number
              of new technical and scientific applications, most notably high-temperature
              process control and monitoring, and high resolution velocity measurements in
              fundamental liquid metal flow studies.
