Abstract    :
              9712853  Wodicka  The object of this proposal is the development of a new 
              acoustic method to guide endotracheal tube (ETT) placement  and monitor the ETT
              position and patency over time.  The  method consists of measuring the
              reflections of an audible  sound pulse that is introduced into the ETT lumen
              and  propagates into the airways.  Patency and position  information is derived
              from the timing of the reflections  from the lumen and airways, respectively. 
              This approach has  proven extremely reliable in preliminary studies performed 
              using adult-size ETT's in anesthetized canines.  Thousands  of patients
              including roughly 83,000 infants per year in the  United States require
              placement of an ETT for ventilatory  support.  In every patient, insertion of
              the ETT is attended  by the risk of life threatening and costly complications
              due  to improper placement in the esophagus or a bronchus, or  blockage due to
              secretions.  The current standard of care  that attempts to avoid catastrophic
              complications is  expensive and requires the continuous monitoring of carbon 
              dioxide in expired gas, in concert with regular assessment  of tube location
              via chest radiographs and regular  auctioning of the tube lumen to ensure
              patency.  Despite the  vigilance of health care providers, a significant number
              of  complications associated with ETT use occur each year with  the
              disproportionate number occurring in infants where the  smaller tolerances by
              geometry predicate higher risks.
