Abstract    :
                   The notion of chaos and its accompanying consequences  have had a profound
              impact on our view of a number of  phenomena in the macroscopic or classical
              world.  However,  the extension of these ideas to the microscopic quantum 
              world largely remains a mystery, especially as a  correspondence between
              classical and quantum phenomena is  expected to exist.  What is established is
              that exclusively  quantum effects are seen in classically chaotic systems, 
              behavior collectively designated as quantum chaology.  Two  broad classes of
              `local` and `global` distinguish effects  which are, respectively, sensitive
              and insensitive to  details of the classical description.  In the proposed
              work,  these issues are considered in the context of a recent atom  optics
              realization of a simple dynamical paradigm.  Building  on earlier work with
              these experiments, one objective is to  study `local` mechanisms in this
              experimental context with  particular emphasis on contrasting quantum coherence
              in  systems with and without classical chaos.  The possibility  of a direct
              assessment makes this a novel realization.  This  would then provide a
              well-characterized system to assess the  interplay of local and global effects
              which has broader  significance to generic aspects in dynamics and non- 
              equilibrium phenomena.
