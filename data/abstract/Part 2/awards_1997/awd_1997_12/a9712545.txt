Abstract    :
              9712545  Rustad    The potential disruption of global C cycles by human activity
              in both developed and developing counties is one of the key environmental
              issues facing human populations as we move into the 21st century. Deforestation
              of tropical rainforests, changes in land-use, and continued burning of fossil
              fuels have resulted in an unprecedented increase in atmospheric CO2
              concentrations over the last half century.  This has raised concerns about
              potential global warming and climate change, and consequences for further
              disruptions of the global C cycle.    Soil respiration, which represents the
              combined respiration of roots and soil micro- and macro- biota, represents one
              of the major pathways of flux in the global C cycle.  Thus, a slight increase
              in soil respiration could significantly exacerbate atmospheric CO2 increases
              with consequent positive feedback to global climate change, whereas a decrease
              could offset further anthropogenic CO2 emissions.   As such, it is imperative
              that a better understanding of the factors that control soil respiration is
              gained and that include consideration of soil carbon storage and flux in
              discussions of emissions trading and greenhouse gas mitigation efforts is
              included.    In order to define the current state-or-knowledge on soil
              respiration, provide insight on critical directions for future research, and
              enhance scientific input to environmental decision-making, this project will
              assist in the implementation of a Symposium entitled:  "Controls on Soil
              Respiration: Implications for Climate Change" which will be held at the annual
              meetings of the Soil Science Society of America in Anaheim, CA, October 27-28,
              1997.
