Abstract    :
              ECS-9712863  Chowdhury    This proposal requests travel support for a number of
              electrical engineering students (with a major in power engineering) across the
              United States to attend the 29th annual North American Power Symposium (NAPS)
              to be held on October 12-13, 1997 at the University of Wyoming campus (UW),
              Laramie, Wyoming.  Travel expenses could be a deterrent for graduate students
              planning to attend this conference.    NAPS is an annual conference, sponsored
              by the Institute of Electrical & Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and a university
              on the North American Continent.  At this conference, university professors and
              students are encouraged to present the results of their research among
              colleagues at an early stage in their work.    NAPS participants are from the
              electrical engineering departments of major universities in the country with
              research interests in different areas of power engineering, some from
              universities abroad, and some from industry.  NAPS authors are required to
              attend the conference and present their papers.    This proposal discusses the
              justification for travel support, requested from the National Science
              Foundation, for student authors attending the symposium.  It also discusses
              coverage and criteria for selection of student authors, activities planned for
              the symposium, and the impact of the proposed travel grant.
