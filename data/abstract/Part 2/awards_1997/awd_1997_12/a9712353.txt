Abstract    :
              9712353  HORMIGA    Spiders are numerous, widespread and have a direct impact on
              human affairs.  About 30 species inflict medically important bites; more
              generally, spider venoms are used in medical and pharmaceutical research. 
              Spider silk has extraordinary physical properties; silks and their constituents
              are foci of biotechnological research with possible commercial applications. 
              Spiders also regulate insect populations in natural and agricultural
              environments.  Nevertheless spider diversity and biology are inadequately
              understood.  About 36,000 species are known to science, less than half of the
              number thought to be present on Earth.  Faunas in tropical and Southern
              Hemisphere temperate areas are most poorly known.  Even for the described
              species, accurate identification manuals, keys, monographs and phylogenetic
              analyses are, for the most part, lacking.      In this PEET proposal, Gustavo
              Hormiga, John Coddington and colleagues will improve the state of spider
              taxonomy by conducting monographic research within three subfamilies
              (Linyphiidae; Theridiidae; Tetragnathidae) of araneoid (Araneae) spiders.  The
              monographic research will make use of museum and field-collected specimens to
              describe new species, produce keys to species, reconstruct phylogenetic
              relationships among the species, and develop a computerized information system
              linking text, data, and image files and available via the World Wide Web and
              CD-ROM.  The research will train three new taxonomists in modern methods,
              developed and applied to spiders, during the course of the project.
