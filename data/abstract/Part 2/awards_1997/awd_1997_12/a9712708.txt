Abstract    :
              The PIs will determine whether the observed quasi-decadal oscillation (QDO) in
              ozone is a result of interannual changes in dynamical transport of ozone
              resulting from the observed QDO in stratospheric circulation.  This would help
              develop a self-consistent theoretical model of the QDO.  Using a series of
              updated data records, they will first determine the QDO in stratospheric ozone,
              temperature, geopotential height, and zonal wind.  They will apply
              observationally derived regression coefficients for vertical/meridional
              temperature gradients and geopotential heights to construct zonal wind and
              temperature gradient anomalies for each phase of the quasi-biennial oscillation
              (QBO) and QDO.  Then, they will modify the NCAR two-dimensional  chemical
              transport model for zonal mean circulation and temperature gradient field
              specification for each month and phase of the QBO and QDO.  Resulting mean
              meridional circulation and ozone distributions will be calculated as a function
              of month, latitude and pressure level.  Finally, the differences between
              calculated ozone distributions will produce an effective model-predicted ozone
              QDO's construction for comparison to observed ozone QDO.
