Abstract    :
              INT 9712323  Wang        This U.S.-Slovak engineering research project between
              Ming-Liang Wang of the University of Illinois, Chicago, and Milan Chandoga of
              the Slovak Technical University and Andrej Jarosevic of Comenius University,
              Bratislava, will examine novel approaches to measuring magnetic properties
              associated with actual stress levels in existing structures.  Specifically,
              this work will feature detection of damage and measurement of cable forces in
              cable stayed and suspended bridges, using an Slovak defined approach.  Results
              are expected to yield a well characterized magneto-elastic stress sensor with
              potential for application in industrial non-destructive testing.    This
              project in structural systems engineering fulfills the program objective of
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States
              and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas
              of strong mutual interest and competence.    ??
