Abstract    :
                    9712851  Bardet  This action is to provide support for participation by
              three  researchers from the United States in the Second US-Japan  Workshop for
              Collaborative Research on Mitigation of Urban  Earthquake Disasters, Tokoyo,
              Japan, February 27 thru March 1,  1997.    The objective is for these three
              researchers to present the  fields of geotechnical earthquake engineering and
              engineering  seismology, and to present the conclusions and recommendations of 
              the North-America Workshop on the Geotechnical Aspects of the  Kobe, Loma
              Prieta, and Northridge Earthquakes, held in Osaka,  Japan, January 22-24, 1996.
                 These three representatives, in collaboration with the US and  Japanese
              participants, are to identify the main research  opportunities, and to help
              formulate plans for US-Japan  collaborative research on mitigation of urban
              earthquake  disasters.  ***
