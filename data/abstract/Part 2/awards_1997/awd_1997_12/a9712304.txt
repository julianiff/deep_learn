Abstract    :
              9712304  Gardner  ***         This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer
              project will use computer models developed by the proposers to simulate the
              effect of using wire-grid polarizers in liquid crystal displays. Measured 
              parameters from prototype wire-grid polarizers will be used in the models to
              see if codes predict the benefits expected. Wire grid polarizers (WGP) offer
              performance and materials improvements for liquid crystal displays which can
              change the industry.  They are a reflective, inorganic, polarizer which will
              lead to brighter, lower-power liquid crystal displays.  The proposer has
              pioneered the technology to produce these polarizers and will produce them
              within the next 2 years.  The university partner had computer models of LC
              displays which can quantify the performance of displays incorporating WGP. The
              new WGP data for the model will come from 0.2 um and 0.16 um pitch polarizers
              prepared and measured by the proposer.  This data will be used, along with
              theory, to protect to the 0.1 um pitch (and smaller) WGP used in future LC
              displays.  These projections will then be folded in to existing computer models
              at the university  to quantify the performance improvements. The data generated
              in Phase I will be used to approach display manufacturing for development
              funding and to justify a Phase II program.           The large ($15 billion)
              market ensures that this LC display technology will be developed soon.  The
              proposer has an opportunity to develop a key technology for LC displays for the
              benefit of the United States.  ***
