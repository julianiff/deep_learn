Abstract    :
                    9712658  Raufaste  With this award continuing support is provided for the
              U.S./Japan  Panel on Wind and Seismic Effects, which was established in 1969.  
              Annual meetings are held in alternate years in the U.S. and  Japan, with the
              Panel developing technologies and strategies that  advance engineering design
              and construction practices.  The Panel  is comprised of 19 Federal agencies who
              participate on eleven  task committees.  The task committees focus on specific
              national  issues, e.g., earthquake hazard reduction; passive and active 
              control systems; repair and retrofit of structures; and wind  engineering for
              offshore structures.  The results of the task  committee workshops and
              conferences are usually published as  proceedings.  ***
