Abstract    :
              With National Science support Dr. Charles Holt will purchase equipment necessary
              to upgrade and expand the experimental economics laboratory at the University
              of Virginia. Instrumentation includes 20 Compaq Presario 3060 Pcs with 200 Mhz
              pentium MMX processors as well as etherlink adapters. These will be integrated
              into the current system. Experimental economists create simplified market
              situations in which variables can be manipulated and controlled and human
              subjects can compete for real financial award. This allows economics to
              introduce human factors including motivation and the need to act with imperfect
              information into both theoretical formulations and to actual market design.
              Such laboratory pretest, for example was employed in the design of the 1995 FCC
              auctions for personal communications services bandwidth. Results from
              experimental studies have shown that the behavior of financially motivated
              subjects is often systematically biased away from the predictions of standard
              game theory which assumes perfect rationality.   Effective simulation requires
              the ability of large numbers of players to interact quickly and the proposed
              system will allow 20 participants to be experimentally linked. This will allow
              increased complexity in the experiments performed. Dr. Holt is actively
              involved in both undergraduate and graduate teaching and students will benefit
              significantly from the upgrade.
