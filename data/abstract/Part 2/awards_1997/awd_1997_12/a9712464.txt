Abstract    :
              This project will be directed at developing a `seismic-while-  drilling'
              capability for the Ocean Drilling Program.  In  this technique the seismic
              source is the drill bit and the  sound is received on geophones on the
              seafloor.  The  advantage of this technique is that no additional ship time  is
              required to acquire the seismic data.
