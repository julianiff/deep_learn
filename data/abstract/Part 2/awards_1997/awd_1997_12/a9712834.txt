Abstract    :
                  9712834  Feldstein    This award provides renewed support for continued
              investigations into the nature of zonal-mean flow variability, regional
              low-frequency variability, and multiple zonal jet dynamics.  In their studies,
              the principal investigators will employ a hierarchy of models, ranging from
              simple barotropic to multi-level primitive equation, as well as the NCEP/NCAR
              reanalysis data sets.  This combined approach of idealized models and
              observational data is likely to provide important insights into the dynamical
              processes they seek to understand.  Among the questions that will be explored
              are:  the role of the barotropic processes in the suppression of eddy feedback
              for the zonal index (the zonal index being represented by the latitudinal
              displacement of the jet maximum), whether the prominent regional low-frequency
              anomalies are dominated by linear processes, the source for low-frequency
              variability of atmospheric flows, and whether stochastic processes are
              responsible for the inter-jet disturbances in cases of multiple-jet flows.    
              While of considerable theoretical interest, this research ultimately will have
              practical application in the improvement of extended range forecasting.
