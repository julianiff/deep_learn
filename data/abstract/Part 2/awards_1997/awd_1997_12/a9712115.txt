Abstract    :
              9712115  Rice    This grant provides $80,000 as two-years partial salary for 
              continued support of a technician to oversee operations and  maintenance and
              train new users on both the electron microprobe  (EMP) and the scanning
              electron microscope (SEM) at the electron-  beam facility, University of
              Oregon.  This is a Phase II grant  for technical support under the IF/EAR
              program. Continuation of  technical support for the electron-beam facility at
              the  University of Oregon will greatly contribute to the chemical and  physical
              quantitative and qualitative analytical needs of a  number of funded research
              projects including, textural analyses  of volcanic rock to elucidate magma
              chamber processes, studies of  fluid-rock interactions during metamorphism and
              hydrothermal  alteration, studies in high pressure experimental petrology, 
              studies in sedimentary petrology and reservoir rock physical  characteristics
              and studies of the properties of synthetic  materials.  Finally, a large number
              of graduate and undergraduate  students benefit from the training that this
              technician provides  as part of a formal departmental analytical methodology
              course.  ***
