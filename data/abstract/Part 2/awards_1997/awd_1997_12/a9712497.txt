Abstract    :
              9712497  Klibanov  The surprising observation that enzyme  catalysis can be
              carried out in essentially nonaqueous  systems has opened a major opportunity
              for biocatalysis.  Dr. Klibanov has played a major role in this area. 
              Apparently, little structure/activity work has been done in  these systems.   
              This proposal aims at studying the structure/activity  relationships of
              crystalline (and sometimes crosslinked)  enzymes in nonaqueous systems.  The
              x-ray crystal structures  of two model enzymes, as well as their intermediate 
              complexes, will be elucidated and correlated with catalytic  properties and
              stability.  Reasons for diminished activity  in non-aqueous solvents and for
              solvent effects on  stereoselectivity will be sought.    We believe that this
              work will have a significant impact on  the economical production of important
              specialty chemicals  such as chiral drugs and intermediate.  This award is co- 
              supported by the organic and macromolecular chemistry  program.  ***
