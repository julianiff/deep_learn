Abstract    :
              9712230  Kleinrock    This project entails a detailed analysis of recently 
              collected high-resolution bathymetry, sonar imagry, and  photographic data from
              the TAG (Trans-Atlantic Geotraverse)  area near 26 degrees north on the
              Mid-Atlantic Ridge.  The  goal is to understand the faulting and fissuring
              processes  in the area and to develop scaling relations of fault  displacement
              versus fault length.
