              Educational Innovation:  Integrating Software Architecture into an
              Interdisciplinary Software Engineering Curriculum    This CISE Educational
              Innovation award supports the development of a new software engineering
              concentration involving students from the Departments of Computer Science,
              Computer Engineering, and Management Information Systems.  The concentration
              involves two major parts: a sequence of fundamentals courses, and a year-long
              capstone project course sequence.  The fundamentals courses will present
              concepts from the research areas of software component engineering and software
              architecture, while the project course sequence will involve interdisciplinary
              teams of students developing a realistic industrial product while applying the
              novel concepts learned within the fundamentals courses.  The project also
              involves assessment and dissemination of the resulting curriculum.
