Abstract    :
              NSF Project Showcase is an exhibition of products and findings resulting from
              projects sponsored by NSF's Division of Undergraduate Education and Division of
              Engineering Education and Centers.  The exhibition is administered by ASEE. 
              The exhibition occurs on June 16, 1997, at the 1997 ASEE Annual Conference and
              Exposition in Milwaukee, WI, and will consist of 20 booths in the Wisconsin
              Center exposition hall.  Each NSF PI has their own exhibit booth and displays
              the results of their NSF-sponsored projects to the attendees of the conference.
