Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9712629  BAIER      This five year continuing award adds the
              University of Miami to the multi-university Industry/University Cooperative
              Research Center for Biosurfaces.  The Center will now be composed of the State
              University of New York at Buffalo (lead), Memphis State University, Alfred
              University, and the University of Miami.  The center continues to develop
              collaboration and synergy.  Memphis State University is below the industry
              funding requirements, therefore future funding will be reduced if the program
              requirements are not met.    These are the Long Term Goals and Objectives of
              the proposed new Center:    (1) Characterization of the surface
              chemical/physical properties of various synthetic substrata that promote or
              bioadhesion, in aqueous media of varied organic/inorganic content, including
              materials contacting the lungs, eyes, mouth, skin, or interior body
              environments.    (2) Determination of the surface properties of biofluids and
              cells as they engage in interactions with well-characterized substrata, giving
              special attention to the dynamics of media flow, cell arrival, surface
              modification, bio-attachment and -finally-stability of the attachment
              mechanisms, as observed in wound healing, for instance.    (3) Documentation of
              reactions between cells and adjacent cells, films and surrounding media, and
              other cross-reactions, with particular attention to technology that may control
              these interactions to either promote or prevent bioadhesion in practical
              environment, occupational or therapeutic situations.    (4) Scale-up of these
              biotechnologies to macrosystem processes, like filtration and purification,
              that utilize safe and effective structural materials and formulations for
              improved health and comfort.    Additional funds to provide support for the
              extra administrative activities of a multi-university Center are provided.   
              The U.S. Department of Army is providing funding to augment the ongoing
              research program and to obtain a membership in the Center.    Funding for  a
              woman undergraduate research student is being providing through the Women,
              Minorities, and Disabled Engineering Research Assistants Program.  The student
              will work with Dr. Hwang, the director of the University of Miami research
              site, on a center project related to the design of documentation systems needed
              for the testing and evaluation of the Baxter Novacor cardiac assist devices.
