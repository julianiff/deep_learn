Abstract    :
              ECS-9712180  Fatehi    The goal of this proposed project is to complete the
              investigations required to write a full research proposal to develop a new
              technique for U.S. power industry in order to improve the stability of power
              system and to increase power transfer capacity of the existing transmission
              lines.  The result of this research will provide more economic and secure
              electricity in the deregulated environment.
