Abstract    :
              9712037  Edwards         This grant provides $100,000 as two-years partial
              salary  support for two technicians at the University of Minnesota to  oversee
              operations and maintenance and train new users in  geochemical separations and
              mass spectrometric techniques utilizing  the five mass spectrometers (gas,
              ICP-sector and thermal  ionization) in the Minnesota Isotope Laboratory.  This
              is a Phase  II grant for technical support under the IF/EAR program. With the 
              recent addition of three new mass spectrometers to this facility as  the result
              of an ARI award (EAR-9512334), this laboratory is one of  the largest and well
              equipped mass spectrometry facilities in the  U.S.  The continuation of
              adequate technical support will enable  these PI's to fully utilize the
              capabilities of the state-of-the-  art mass spectrometers employed at Minnesota
              for studies  utilizing high-resolution isotopic records recorded in marine and 
              lacustrine carbonates for interpretation of global and regional  climate change
              and paleoenvironmental conditions.  Other studies  will further contribute to
              the refinement of the Quaternary  chronology of global sea level changes
              related to  glaciation/deglaciation events.  ***
