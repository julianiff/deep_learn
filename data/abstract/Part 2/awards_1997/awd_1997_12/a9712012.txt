Abstract    :
              9712012  Liu    This grant provides partial support for acquisition of
              additional  ground penetrating radar (GPR) antennas, a workstation and a PC 
              for the shallow geophysics program at the University of  Connecticut.  Three
              GPR antennas at frequencies of 25, 200 and  1000 MHz will be purchased to
              examine the attenuation of GPR  signals through various geological and
              structural environments.  The computers will be used for data acquisition and
              subsequent  inversions and modeling.  Together with research support from a 
              companion geophysics proposal, the PI will develop a non-linear  frequency
              dependence model for high resolution GPR tomography of  soils and the shallow
              crust and will investigate the propagation  of radar signals through
              inhomogeneous strata.  The potential of  improved GPR tomographic techniques to
              problems of environmental  significance (i.e. mapping contaminated groundwater
              plumes)  warrants continued development of this geophysical technique.  ***
