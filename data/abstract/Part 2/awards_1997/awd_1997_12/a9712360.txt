Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT  CTS-9712360  Frank L. Huband and Gan-Moog Chow  ASEE    Partial
              travel support will be provided to a group of about eight young academic
              researchers to participate at the NATO-Advanced Study Institute (ASI) on
              science and technology of nanoparticle synthesis, processing and nanostructured
              materials to be held on August 11-21, 1977, at St. Petersburg, Russia.  The
              Institute is aimed at providing advanced lectures on recent developments by
              invited speakers to selected advanced Ph.D. students, postdoctoral fellows and
              junior scientists; exchanges of scientific opinions among all participants from
              different countries;   and networking and fostering collaborations particularly
              among young scientists.  Tutorial topics include synthesis and processing of
              particles and thin layers, particle consolidation and assembly of structures,
              chemistry and physics of surfaces and interfaces, and related manufacturing
              processes and applications.  Besides plenary lectures, poster sessions, small
              group discussions, and informal interactions will be encouraged.  A book will
              be published in the NATO-ASI Series shortly after the meeting.  The NSF funds
              will be used for selected scientists and engineers to attend the Institute.
              Travel funds from this grant will be used only for U.S. citizens, nationals,
              and permanent residents.  Young scientists and engineers, advanced Ph.D.
              students or within five years after completion of their Ph.D., will receive
              priority.    By considering the emerging topic of research to be discussed at
              the Institute, the quality of the lectures, the exposure of young U.S.
              scientists and engineers to the international environment, this activity will
              contribute to the formation of young specialists in U.S. and to development of
              long-term ollaborations with top researchers in the world.
