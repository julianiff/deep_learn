Abstract    :
                    Deployment of an uplooking infrared radiometer aboard the USCGS Polar Star
              "Cruise of Opportunity" in June-July 1997 is proposed.  The field objective is
              to record downwelling longwave radiances from the arctic sky using a
              high-resolution interferometer.  Temperature-controlled blackbody sources
              coupled to the interferometer provide absolute calibration of the downwelling
              radiance (Watts m-2 cm Sr-1).  Spectra will be recorded at several zenith
              angles in order to assess the vertical distribution of trace gases,
              temperature, and water vapor of the boundary layer. The specific analysis goals
              are to extract (i) cloud microphysical proprieties (cloud emissivity and
              equivalent particle size), (ii) total column concentrations of infrared-active
              trace gases, and (iii)boundary layer vertical profiles of temperature and water
              vapor concentration.  These data will later be analyzed for information
              relevant to the radiative balance and chemistry of the arctic atmosphere.
