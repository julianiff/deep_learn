Abstract    :
                    9712768  Bansil    The   1997   International  Conference  on 
              Spectroscopies  in   Novel  Superconductors (SNS'97)  will devote one week to
              the research area of  superconductivity,   with   emphasis  on  spectroscopic  
              measurements  relevant  to  High  Tc Cuprate and related materials.  The 
              topics  of  primary    interest   include   Tunneling,   Superconducting  
              Quantum  Interference,  NMR,  Photoemission, Raman  and  Optical,  and  Neutron
               Scattering.  Other  topics will be discussed,  the  participants  will 
              include world leaders in this area. NSF support will provide financial 
              assistance to young investigators.  %%%  The   1997   International  Conference

              to the  research area of  superconductivity,  with emphasis on the High Tc
              Cuprate  and  related  materials.  The  focus  will  be on current  topics 
              relating  to  the  formation  of  the  high  Tc superconducting state  and  the
               physical  mechanisms which operate. The participants will include world 
              leaders  in  this area. NSF support will provide financial assistance to  young
               investigators.  ***
