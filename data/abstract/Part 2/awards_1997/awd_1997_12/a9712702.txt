Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT  CTS-9712702  D.T. Shaw  SUNY Buffalo    Partial travel support will
              be provided to speakers at the ultrafine particle engineering meeting to be
              held on May 12-13, 1997, at NSF.  The purpose of the meeting is to bring
              together selected NSF grantees, and invited guests from NIST and industry to
              evaluate progress made, the state-of-the-art  and research needs, and promote
              collaborations among researchers from universities, NIST and industry.  The
              focus of the meeting will be on synthesis and processing of nanoparticles,
              their characterization, applications.  There will be about 25 technical
              presentations, with time left for discussions on research trends and
              opportunities for collaborations.  The presentations will be published in
              proceedings, that will be made available to the scientific and engineering
              community at large.    This conference will increase the dissemination of NSF
              results, promote collaborations and interdisciplinary synergism paticularly
              between academic and industrial researchers, and continue the NSF-NIST
              partnership in the area of nanoparticles and nanostructured materials.
