Abstract    :
               Worldwide electronic product revenues were $791 billion in 1995 and are
              forecast to reach $1.2 trillion by the year 2000.  A number of technological
              breakthroughs must take place in order to sustain the rapid increase in the
              functionality of electronic systems, while maintaining their reliable operation
              and reducing size and cost.  Manufacturing of electronic systems is a
              hierarchical series of processes which can be grouped into semiconductor chip
              manufacturing, electronic package assembly, and board and system assembly. 
              Although the chip-level manufacturing challenges are being adequately
              addressed, the electronic package-level and board-level manufacturing remain
              relatively unexplored.  This workshop is for assessing the research needs in
              electronics manufacturing in the twenty-first century.  It will focus on
              identifying research needs in the development of innovative manufacturing
              processes; the design of next-generation; precision electromechanical systems;
              and, the development of virtual manufacturing tools for package and board level
              manufacturing.   The workshop brings together experts from academia, industry
              and government to discuss future research needs in electronics manufacturing
              and to identify the electronics manufacturing barriers for the next decade that
              can be addressed by universities in collaboration with industry and government
              laboratories.  The communications between the workshop participants are also
              helpful in building partnerships and minimizing duplicative efforts.
