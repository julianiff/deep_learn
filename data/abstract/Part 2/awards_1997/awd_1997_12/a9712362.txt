Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is the improvement of the implemented  and available
              software for solution of a variety of matrix  computation problems, including
              solution of systems of  parameterized linear equations, solution of systems of
              linear  equations over a polynomial function domain, matrix normal form 
              computations, and determination of matrix similarity and  equivalence.  Such
              tools are a heavily used portion of computer  algebra packages such as Maple,
              Mathematica, and Magma.  Also  they are relevant to custom large scale
              applications.  The  research will focus on (1) algorithm design, (2) parallel
              and  distributed implementation, and (3) use of heuristics.  An  explicit goal
              of this work is to provide implementations that are  directly usable by the
              scientific community.  Such  implementations will include stand-alone portable
              codes and code  to be included in the libraries of one or more of the generally
               available computer algebra systems.  In this sense this work will  enhance the
              problem solving environments available for scientific  and engineering
              computation.
