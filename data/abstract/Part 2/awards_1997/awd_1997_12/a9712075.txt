Abstract    :
              Jameson/Abstract  ATM-9712075           The objectives of this research are:    
                  1. to investigate how patchiness and clustering alters radar  measurement
              statistics.         2. to investigate how patchiness and clustering alters our 
              concept of drop size distributions and radar Z-R relations and         3. to
              investigate how patchiness and clustering alters aspects  of scattering
              particularly with respect to multiple scatter         The primary approach will
              be numerical experiments and Monte  Carlo simulations although observations
              will be included as well,  when available.  The objectives of these experiments
              are: (a) to  develop further our understanding of the effects of the variance
              of  parameters generated by patchiness and clustering on measurement 
              statistics by considering correlated samples and by considering  different
              radar parameters such as polarization radar variables (b)  to investigate how
              the variability of drop size distributions  within a radar beam effects Z-R
              relations such as those used by the  NEXRAD radars and (3) to explore the
              effects of clustering on  multiple scatter and backscattered microwaves as
              functions of the  variance of the number of drops per unit volume, the mean 
              separation distances, and drop sizes.
