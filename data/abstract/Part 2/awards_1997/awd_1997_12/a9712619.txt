Abstract    :
              9712619  Dordick  The Enzyme Engineering Conference is the longest, continuous 
              conference series that is sponsored by the Engineering  Foundation.  The first
              meeting was held in New Hampshire in  1971 and every other year thereafter. 
              The meetings  alternate between domestic and foreign locales.  The  conferences
              are generally attended by 150-200 world leaders  in enzyme engineering
              research.  Over half of the speakers  are from foreign nations.  The theme of
              the 1997 conference  is "technologies that have the potential for dramatically 
              shaping biotechnology and chemical technology in the 21st  century".  Leading
              enzyme scientists, including many of our  BES awardees (e.g., Arnold, Dordick,
              Clark) are  participants.  Among the key sessions are:            Protein
              engineering enzymes       Fine chemical synthesis using enzymes      
              Extremozymes       Artificial enzymes       Environmental biocatalysis      
              Analytical applications of enzymes    The conference will provide an excellent
              opportunity for  U.S. researchers to network with foreign scientists in the 
              field, many of whom come from countries with extensive  enzyme-use history,
              e.g., Japan.    The proposal requests $12,000 from NSF to support the travel 
              and registration costs of six of the U.S. speakers.  ***
