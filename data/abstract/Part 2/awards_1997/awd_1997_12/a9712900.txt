Abstract    :
              9712900  Dorman  This instrumentation development project will evaluate and
              adapt a   new seismometer sensor (the PMD Scientific) for use in a suite of  
              Ocean Bottom Seismometers (OBS) that are maintained in a pool of   shared use
              equipment. The new sensors will extend the useful   frequency range of the OBSs
              down to 0.03 Hz frequency.  Improved   sensors will make the instruments more
              useful for teleseismic   studies, surface-wave and shear-wave studies, and for
              compliance   determination of the seafloor shear modulus. The investigators
              will   purchase and evaluate seven new sensors, fabricate pressure housing  
              for each, and develop a new leveling system for them.
