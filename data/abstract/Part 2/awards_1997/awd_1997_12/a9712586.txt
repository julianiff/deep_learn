Abstract    :
              ***  9712586  Atkins  This workshop is the first phase of a process to assist in
              defining a multi-faceted research agenda in the general area of advanced global
              information and knowledge work environments -- environments to support people
              (as individuals and members of groups) in the entire life cycle of
              information/knowledge creation, dissemination, access, preservation, and use. 
              Such environments are enabled by the coalescence of computation, communication,
              and integrated media, driven by increasingly powerful and ubiquitous hardware. 
              Realizing the full potential of the technology, however, requires a holistic
              approach which considers both technical and social/behavioral/cultural factors.
               It will particularly include consideration of the current NSF/DARPA/NASA
              Digital Library Initiative (DLI) in terms of what has been accomplished,
              learned, demonstrated and what does this suggest about the need for follow-on
              activities.  ***
