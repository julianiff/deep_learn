Abstract    :
                9712309  Cupolo  ***         This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer
              project seeks to find the optimal red phosphor formulations which can be used
              in the standard  liquid crystal display (LCD) backlighting arrangement. By
              modifying  the conventional backlighting arrangement, through the use of novel
              phosphor materials, substantial advances in these directions are possible. 
              Standard backlit LCDs are known to have poor luminous efficiency and viewing
              angles.  The direct material costs of LCDs are high, which, when compounded
              with low production yields, have kept finished product prices high.  Despite
              this, the LCD is the most mature flat panel display technology commercially
              available.  The LCD has also captured the majority of the world's flat panel
              display market and consequently has the largest production capacity. 
              Therefore, there is a significant opportunity to improve the LCD. It is
              anticipated that these red phosphor materials will provide the basis for
              simultaneously improving the luminous efficiency by approximately 50%,
              maximizing the viewing angles, reducing direct material costs and improving
              production yields.         This technology will have applications in laptop and
              desktop computer displays, large-screen direct-view TV's, electronic
              billboards.  ***
