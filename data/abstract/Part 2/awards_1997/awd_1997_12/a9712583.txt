Abstract    :
               The objective of the workshop is to focus on the manufacturing innovations
              needed for reducing costs of composite components and systems.  Relevant topics
              such as newly evolving manufacturing technologies, cost reduction strategies,
              manufacturing process automation, computer simulation of manufacturing
              processes and virtual manufacturing will be covered in the presentations.   The
              list of invited speakers for the workshop includes well known composites
              manufacturing experts from both the automotive and aerospace industries, as
              well as universities and government agencies. The Proceedings of the conference
              will be put together by the workshop as a special publication/report.
