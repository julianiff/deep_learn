Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  MATLOCK  EEC-9712183    This award is for support for a two year phase
              out period for the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Advanced
              Steel Processing and Products at the Colorado School of Mines.  The objectives
              of the center are (1) performance of research of direct benefit to producers
              and users of steel, (2) eduaation of graduate students by involvement in
              research programs of theoretical and practical interest to the steel-producing
              and steel-using industries, (3) enhancement of undergraduate education related
              to steel, and (4) development of a national forum for steel producers, steel
              users, government, and academe to stimulate advances in the science and
              technology of the processing, quality, and application of steel.  Efficient
              transfer of technology is a major goal of the center, and it was among the top
              three centers in the   Industry/University Cooperative Research Center Program
              last year in technology transfer.  More than 60 students have graduated with
              the M.S. or Ph.D degrees resulting from Center support, and there are 23
              graduate students currently supported by the Center.
