Abstract    :
              9712253  Wilson   ***          This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer
              project seeks to bring a technology fundamental to polymer light emitting
              diodes to the commercial marketplace as flexible lightweight, robust displays
              in the near-term. Before the full realization of this new technology can be
              felt by the consumer, however, several important materials issues must be
              addressed, including device efficiency, lifetime, failure mechanisms, and
              packaging.  Recently, tremendous excitement has been generated in the field of
              flat panel displays by the introduction of small organic molecule (typically
              Alq - OLEDS) and polymer light emitting diodes (pLEDs).  These developments
              combine low cost manufacturing normally associated with polymeric films with
              the opportunity to produce robust, lightweight and flexible non planar displays
              hereto unknown in the marketplace.  Another significant advantage of organic
              based LED displays over their well known liquid crystal cousins is the
              elimination of viewing angle constraints.          The immediate commercial
              application of this research is for near-hermetic packaging of polymer or small
              organic molecule light emitting diode based flexible displays. Other
              applications in the food packaging industry will benefit from new, transparent
              ultra-high barrier films.  These applications include beer bottles, meal trays,
              food packaging for military uses, etc.  ***
