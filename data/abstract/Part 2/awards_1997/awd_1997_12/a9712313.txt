Abstract    :
              Sanford   9712313      An extensive survey of the Denmark Strait Overflow will
              conducted in 1997 and    1998 using expendable current and
              conductivity-temperature profilers and the    towed transport meter to
              complement traditional hydrographic measurements.    The goal of the study is
              quantify the effects of bottom friction, entrainment and    hydraulic control
              on the overflow. An additional objective is to identify the    generation
              mechanism for eddies, especially the role of conservation of potential   
              vorticity as the flow descends the slope and the growth of perturbations
              through    baroclinic instability.
