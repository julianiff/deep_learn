Abstract    :
              9712214    Jones    This planning grant proposal funds efforts for developing a
              Local Systemic Change project in four rural school districts in Virginia.  The
              four districts have an elementary population of 644 teachers.  All of these
              teachers will receive professional development for school reform if a full
              grant is funded.  A planning committee and site based teams will design a
              process for selecting K-8 curriculum materials and the process for delivering
              professional development in the four districts.    The requested funding from
              National Science Foundation is $49,935 with a cost share estimated as $99,354
              for a 24 month project.
