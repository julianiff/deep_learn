Abstract    :
                                          ABSTRACT      A  great  deal of attention has
              focussed in recent years  on  the  role  of  iron  as  a  limiting nutrient in
              the  so-called  High-  Nutrient  Low-Chlorophyll  (HNLC) regions  of  the 
              world  ocean.  Because  of  the paucity of the ultramicronutrient iron, 
              nitrate  and  phosphate  build up in the water column at anomalously  high 
              levels.  The investigators on this project have recently begun to  construct 
              quantitative models to account for  the  chemistry  of  HNLC waters and the
              associated dynamics of the pelagic community.  In  this  study, the
              investigators will continue to  explore  the  critical  linkages  that must be
              built into  quantitative  models  that  include  both  ecosystem dynamics  and 
              ocean  physics  and  chemistry.    These studies should eventually help  to 
              link  the  results  of both laboratory studies of iron limitation in primary 
              production  and open ocean iron `fertilization experiments'  with 
              sophisticated  global-scale models of  other  biogenic  elements,  especially
              carbon.
