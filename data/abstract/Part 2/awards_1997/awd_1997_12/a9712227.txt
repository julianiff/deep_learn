Abstract    :
              9712227  Fish  The proposed research effort develops an experimentally 
              calibrated mutiscale modeling approach for composite  materials and structures
              aimed at accurately predicting the  macromechanical (overall) structural
              response, such as  critical deformation, vibration and buckling modes, as well 
              as various failure modes on the mesomechanical (lamina)  level, such as
              delamination and ply buckling, and on the  micromechanical (the scale of
              microconstituents) level, such  as debonding, microbuckhng, etc. Adaptive
              multiscale  modeling approach developed in this research enables the  analyst
              to start from a simple model, based on the classical  step-by-step uncoupled
              approach, which may or may not  adequately simulate the response, and then
              adaptively refine  both the mathematical and numerical models to permit coupled
               multiscale ccisiderations, whenever and wherever these are  needed.  ***
