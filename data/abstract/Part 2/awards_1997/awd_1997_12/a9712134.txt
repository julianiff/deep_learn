Abstract    :
              9712134  Kroll  The diverse structural forms observed, for example, in lipid- 
              water phases are characteristic of those found in many  amphiphilic mixtures. 
              These structures consist of  interfaces, or membranes, which divide the
              material into  distinct volumes.  Such two-dimensional assemblies can form  a
              large variety of thermodynamic phases, such as closed  vesicles, lamellar or
              cubic crystals, and disordered  bicontinuous networks.  They also determine the
              architecture  of biological systems.  The objectives of this project are  to
              obtain a better understanding of (i) the equilibrium  thermodynamics,
              structure, and phase behavior of membranes  and other macromolecular
              assemblies, and, (ii) the dynamics  of complex liquids and the dynamical
              behavior of polymers  and membranes in solvent.  Both simulation and analytic 
              techniques will be used.  An essential component of this  research will be to
              develop and implement new algorithms for  the numerical simulation of the
              equilibrium and non-  equilibrium dynamics of these systems.  %%%  This project
              will employ advanced computational techniques  and theoretical analysis to
              study complex fluids.  The  systems to be studied are comprised of materials
              like water  and fatty acids.  These systems form all sorts of complex 
              structures which are not well understood.  They present a  significant
              challenge to the researcher.  These systems also  form the basis for biological
              materials which make up many  life forms.  ***
