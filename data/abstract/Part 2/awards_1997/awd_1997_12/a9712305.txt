Abstract    :
              9712305  Outten  ****  This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer project,
              the proposers will seek to optimize the electronic properties of a
              revolutionary new family of thin-@ coating materials, "Diamond-like
              Nanocomposites (DLN) for use as a cathode material in field emission displays. 
              This will be accomplished by doping the DLN films with low work function
              metals.  The performance of the @s will be evaluated by the magnitude of
              threshold electric field, total emission current, emission current density,
              emission stability, uniformity of emission sites, and device lifetime.  The
              optimal DLN deposition parameter space will be mapped and investigated.  Device
              performance will be correlated with film structure, composition, and electronic
              properties.  The technological/ economic hurdles to prototype and product
              development will be analyzed, and based on this a roadmap developed for
              eventual large scale integration of DLN technology into field emission display
              production..  DLN films represent a novel structure of matter, and offer
              significant advantages over many current diamond and diamond-like carbon thin
              film coating technologies.  The films exhibit a unique and highly tailorable
              suite of properties.          A low cost approach to large area FED
              manufacturing will result from the successful use of DLN thin film technology. 
              Replacement of conventional materials could result in considerable savings in
              materials and production costs.  ***
