Abstract    :
              This project continues investigation of the cylindrical algebraic  decomposition
              (CAD) technique.  This technique, developed in 1975  for quantifier elimination
              in the elementary theory of real-  closed fields, has been continually improved
              in the last twenty  years.  A vast number of mathematical problems can be
              expressed  in this theory and, potentially, solved via quantifier  elimination.
               CAD has many applications, including control  engineering, connectivity and
              path finding problems.    Major improvements are also being made to the
              algebraic  algorithms needed for CAD, including polynomial resultants and 
              greatest common divisors, polynomial factorization, polynomial  root isolation
              and refinement, and computations with algebraic  numbers.
