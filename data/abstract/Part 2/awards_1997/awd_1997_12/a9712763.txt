Abstract    :
              9712763  Slowey             This project will collect a set of gravity and
              large-  diameter piston cores on the slope of Oahu, Hawaii in water  depths
              from 200-3500 m. Stable isotopes and taxonomic  composition of planktic and
              benthic foraminifera will be  analyzed in order to estimate past temperature
              and nutrient  content of surface and deep water masses. Resultant data  will
              determine changes in regional sea surface temperature  and deep water
              production from the last glacial interval to  the present.
