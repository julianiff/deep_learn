Abstract    :
              Powell  OPP 9712995    Abstract  The Antarctic sedimentary record has already
              yielded high-  resolution information on paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic 
              changes, particularly on ice marginal and outlet glacier  fluctuations and in
              lacustrine and marine ecology and  biogeochemistry.  A coordinated
              SCAR-GLOCHANT (Global Change and  the Antarctic) and PAGES (Past Global
              Changes) initiative on  circumpolar paleoenvironmental research detailing the
              last 250  thousand years, will provide a solid basis for the understanding  of
              present and future variability in the Antarctic.  The  coordinated SCAR-PAGES
              initiative, termed ANTIME (Antarctic Ice  Margin Evolution), will be focused in
              two streams:  Stream 1  (last 20 thousand years) focuses on the last
              deglaciation and  interglacial environmental, climatic, and ice-sheet
              variability.  Stream 2 (last 250 thousand years) will focus on the 
              environmental, climatic, and ice-sheet response to glacial-  interglacial
              cycles.    A workshop will be held in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia during 6-  11
              July, 1997, to commence the ANTIME initiative.  This award  supports travel for
              U.S. scientists to participate in the ANTIME  workshop.  The principal result
              of the workshop will be a draft  science and implementation plan for future
              research priorities.  It will include information about potential opportunities
              for  collaboration and cooperation among individual and national  Antarctic
              programs.
