Abstract    :
              9712656  Quinn  Many important microbial and cellular processes require a 
              knowledge of the forces with which these entities adhere to  surfaces, other
              cells, and receptor proteins.  some of these  processes include cell
              separations, tumor metastasis and  wall adhesion, cell seeding for vascular
              prostheses, etc.  Most adhesion assays are very qualitative in nature, 
              frequently due to the irregular nature of the containment  "vessels", their
              small size, and the difficulty in obtaining  quantitative data without
              extensive investment in device  development.  Adhesion studies are usually done
              by measuring  the force to wash the cell off of the substrate.    This SGER
              proposal seeks to make the process simpler and  more quantitative by developing
              a set of cells of known  surface-receptor strength for use in calibrating new 
              measurement vessels and cell receptor systems.  The standard  cells will be
              latex beads which have been coated with the  appropriate receptor for the
              experiment and labeled with an  identifying tag.  The adhesion of the coated
              latex particles  will be determined in the Radial Flow Detachment Assay  (RFDA)
              device that the PI and  coworkers have developed over  the previous funded
              grant.  The cells of known adhesion  (resistance to shear washing force) could
              then be used to  determine more accurately the forces involved in simple 
              washing tests, e.g., washing of cells from coated wells by  pipette streams of
              water.  ***
