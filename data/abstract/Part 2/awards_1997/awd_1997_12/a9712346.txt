Abstract    :
              The  objective  of  this  project is the  development  of  robust  methods for
              enhancing speech in real-world noisy environments.  A  neural network approach
              is developed for time-domain enhancement.  The availability of only the noisy
              signal is assumed, in contrast  to  previous neural network approaches. 
              Effectively, a  sequence  of  neural  networks  is  trained on the  specific 
              noisy  speech  signal,  resulting in a nonstationary model that can be  used 
              to  remove  noise from the given signal.  Two related frameworks  are 
              developed:  (1) a neural state-space approach based on  nonlinear  extensions 
              to  Kalman  filter theory and  (2)  a  direct  neural  mapping  from  noisy 
              speech to enhanced speech.   This  research  represents   fundamental  enabling
               technology  for   interactive  systems requiring robust speech communications.
               More traditional  methods  are often effective under ideal situations, but
              tend  to  degrade for real world nonstationary noise sources.
