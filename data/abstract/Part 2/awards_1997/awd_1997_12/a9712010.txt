Abstract    :
              9712010    This proposal is for a Small Grant for Exploratory Research  which
              evaluates  the nature of interdisciplinary efforts in Civil  Infrastructure
              Systems  (CIS) research.  It acts as a pre-test of the Principal 
              Investigator's work  on the policy impacts of disciplinary models of decision 
              making in the  context of infrastructure policy making.  It is hypothesized 
              that the  impact of self-selection into professions and the  educational and 
              professional socialization into those professions shapes how  infrastructure 
              decisions are made.  Consequently, the potential for  interdisciplinary 
              understanding is increased.  The SGER will investigate this  condition in 
              attempting multidisciplinary CIS research.    The project will:  1) develop a
              clear understanding of NSF's  CIS-related  programmatic research portfolio; 2)
              develop a similar  understanding for  research and development at other federal
              and state  agencies; 3) identify  interdisciplinary CIS-related centers or
              institutes in the  U.S. and  throughout the world and describe their focus and
              expertise;  4) evaluate  the interdisciplinary nature of NSF-CIS awards; 5)
              identify  stakeholder  organizations to be partners and initiate discussions of
               research and  development partnerships; 6) develop interdisciplinary  framing
              of basic CIS  research needs; and 7) posit the impacts of the results on  the
              future of  engineering education.  ***
