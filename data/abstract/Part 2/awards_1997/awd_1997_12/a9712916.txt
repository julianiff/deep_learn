Abstract    :
              9712916  Su  This proposal seeks to improve the production of  heterologous
              proteins in plant cell culture by integration  of three new technologies: anew
              promoter; anew reporter  gene; and an improved perfusion bioreactor.  The
              recently  identified strong, inducible, acid phosphatase promoter and  signal
              sequence in Anchusa officinalis will be used in  conjunction with the green
              fluorescent protein (GFP) gene as  a reporter protein to monitor and optimize
              expression and  secretion.  A perfusion bioreactor will be designed to  enhance
              continuous production of secreted proteins.  ***
