Abstract    :
              9712135  Kastner  At accretionary margins sedimentary carbon is recycled as pore
               waters are squeezed from the compacting sediments. These pore  waters are
              discharged at natural seeps where some of the carbon  is  deposited as thick
              surface and subsurface layers, additional carbon  may be sequestered in gas
              hydrates, and some of the carbon is lost  to the water column in gaseous form.
              The relative proportions and  magnitude of these processes, however, are poorly
              understood. The  present project will begin an in situ , experimental approach
              to  examining and quantifying these processes on the Oregon margin.  Sampling
              chambers will be fitted to sealed borehole drilled by the  Ocean Drilling
              Program and will be used to collect precipitate and  fluid flow out of the
              sedimentary section. Samples from the year  long experiment will be
              subsequently analyzed to provide  information on the kinetics of carbon
              sequestration during fluid  expulsion. Not only will the research define
              chemistry of the  fluids and associated digenetic deposits, it also will relate
              the  mass deposited over time to a known volume of fluid, and measure  the
              affect of that deposition on sediment permeability. Microbial  research will
              examine the potential role and importance of  organisms in controlling the
              carbon partitioning.  ***
