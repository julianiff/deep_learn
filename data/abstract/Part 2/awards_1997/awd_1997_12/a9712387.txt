Abstract    :
              P.I.: Delaney  Proposal  Number:  97-12387     Institution:  University  of 
              Washington  Title:   REVEL:   Research   and  education   -   volcanoes, 
              exploration, and life      The  REVEL  program  was  initiated  by  the 
              University  of  Washington  in 1996 with the intention of involving  science 
              educators  in oceanographic research.  The current  proposal  requests  funds
              to support the continuation of this  project  during  the  summer of 1997.  Ten
              7th to 14th grade  science  teachers   will  participate  in  a  cruise  to 
              study   the  hydrothermal  vent fields on the Endeavour  Segment  of  the  Juan
              de Fuca Ridge in August, 1997.  The costs of the cruise  are  being  paid  by 
              the University of Washington  and  the  American  Museum of Natural History,
              with funds for  teacher  participation requested in this proposal.
