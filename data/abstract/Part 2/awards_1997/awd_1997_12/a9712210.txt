Abstract    :
                This research studies the ways in which political and social configurations
              enable some governments to commit themselves to sustainable macroeconomic
              policies.  Economists have stressed how important sound macroeconomic
              management is for sustaining economic development.  However, in the past decade
              many developing countries have reneged on their commitment to economic
              restructuring and reform.  In turn this has led to declining economies.  This
              research uses Indonesia and Nigeria as case studies to compare the political
              conditions and informal institutional arrangements that enable some governments
              to commit to and implement sound macroeconomic policies.  The research focuses
              on the role of coordination in solving problems of credible commitment and in
              lengthening the time horizons of politicians.  In-depth surveys of policy
              elites and the collection of economic data help test the theoretical concepts
              of committing to economic reform.
