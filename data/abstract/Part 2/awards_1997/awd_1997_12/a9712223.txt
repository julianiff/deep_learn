Abstract    :
              This project documents and analyzes the adaptation of  America's two nuclear
              weapons laboratories to the end of the Cold War. By 1996, it became clear that,
              despite the nuclear    test ban treaty, both laboratories would retain their
              primary focus on weapons science. Conversion was a largely stillborn project
              because of little enthusiasm for it in Congress and in the executive branch,
              and because the organizational culture of the laboratories obstructed
              conversion. The laboratories are reorganizing their way of doing weapons
              science around a group of new technologies that simulate aspects of nuclear
              weapons testing. Collectively, these technologies make up the Science Based
              Stockpile Stewardship program. The effectiveness and significance of these
              technologies is fundamentally contested by different political actors.  This
              project argues that it is in the nature of such simulation technologies that
              they are `hyper-constructible.`  The proposed project spans six months,
              including an interview component and a writing component.  The book will
              further our understanding of the effects of military funding on scientific
              institutions, of the difficulties in converting such institutions to civilian
              purposes, and it will suggest a less literal approach than that of most arms
              control analysts to understanding the significance of the Science Based
              Stockpile Stewardship Program.
