Abstract    :
              This award will permit Dr. Frank Asaro and his colleagues to continue
              development and testing of a x-ray fluorescence (XRF) technique for ceramic
              analysis. XRF, in common with several other approaches, determines the
              abundance of trace elements present in ceramics and such data is extremely
              important to archaeological researchers. Trace element frequencies are set by
              both the clay used to manufacture a vessel as well as the tempering material
              included and through analysis of relative abundances it is often possible to
              establish the presence of `wares` - groups of material which share a common
              fabric and thus should be classed together. It is also sometimes possible to
              trace specific wares back to their point of origin through comparison with
              geological collections of clay raw material. Through sourcing studies and the
              analysis of ceramics from large numbers of sites archaeologists can gain
              insight into the organization of ceramic production and trade. The movement of
              ceramics also sheds light on economic and political organization. Because
              ceramics played such a crucial role in many prehistoric societies and because
              it is well preserved and abundant in many archaeological sites, it provides a
              central focus of archaeological attention.  Although XRF is not widely used for
              trace element studies its potential is great. Its cost is relatively low and
              relatively little sample preparation time required. Were it developed to the
              level of accuracy of other techniques it would greatly facilitate
              archaeologists' practical access to trace element data. In this NSF award Dr.
              Asaro and his colleagues will pursue three goals. First they will work to
              improve the technique itself. They will develop new methods to accurately
              measure abundances of Th and the rare earths La and Ce. They will also improve
              measurement precision of Ba, As, K and Ti. Secondly they will compare the
              results of XRF and neutron activation through a carefully controlled
              multi-laboratory study. Finally they will apply the technique to a chemically
              complicated archaeological situation in Israel to gain practical field insight
              into both potential advantages and pitfalls. If successful this project will
              provide archaeologists with a valuable working tool.
