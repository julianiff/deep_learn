Abstract    :
              9712753   Lee   Description:  This proposal is for a US-Indo  collaboration
              between biological scientists  David Lee, Florida International University and 
              Kailash Paliwal, Madurai Kamaraj University.   The research is: The Effect of
              Light Quantity  and Quality on the Developmental Ecology of  Indian Tropical
              Forest Trees.  The researchers  will study seedlings of 16 native South Asian 
              tropical forest trees to determine how they  respond to changes in light
              quantity and  quality  as they grow in spectrally neutral and altered  shade
              conditions.  Plants will be examined for  growth rate, morphology, leaf
              anatomy, and  physiological response over a 10-15 month  period.   Results will
              improve understanding of the  ecological  responses of the species in natural
              conditions,  their sylviculture, and their establishment in  nurseries.  The
              research will increase  fundamental  knowledge about the effect of light
              quality and  quantity to the development of trees in natural  light conditions.
                Scope:  This study will be conducted almost  entirely at the Madurai Kamaraj
              University by  Indian researchers in close collaboration with  US PI David Lee
              who will spend part of his  sabbatical there.  The approach is novel and 
              should lead to significant advances in  fundamental  knowledge about tree
              regeneration in tropical  forests.   The research is basic and applied.  It
              will  greatly  strengthen US science by focusing on a region  little  studied
              by US researchers.  As a new  collaboration  that will involve young
              scientists, this  project  supports INT objectives.  The project will 
              strengthen  research links between the US and India.  The  interaction is
              mutually beneficial.    ***
