Abstract    :
              9712024  Mix  This award will support continued operation and equipment
              upgrading  at the Oregon State University Core repository. The core repository 
              serves as library/storage for piston, gravity cores and dredged  rock
              collections acquired by Oregon State researchers and those in  the surrounding
              region. Stored material is available both to  institutional and national and
              international science community, and  allows long-term preservation of material
              for research and  educational purposes. The award supports personnel and
              equipment  necessary to respond to sample requests and to maintain the core 
              collection in a suitable condition.  ***
