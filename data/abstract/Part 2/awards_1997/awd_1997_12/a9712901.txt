Abstract    :
                 The stratospheric ozone layer has been diminished as a consequence of
              anthropogenic release of chlorofluorocarbons. The thinning ozone results in
              increased levels of harmful ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation relative to less
              harmful ultraviolet A (UV-A) and visible light (VIS). Ultraviolet damage to
              marine phytoplankton cells have been limited to bulk calculations which do not
              take into consideration variability of damage between individual cells.  The
              single cell gel (SSG) comet assay is capable of measuring DNA damage and repair
              in individual cells.  We propose to use this technique to measure the effects
              of UV-B radiation on DNA damage in marine phytoplankton species and in their
              capacity to repair. Phytoplankton growing under culture conditions will be
              exposed in the laboratory to ambient irradiance levels of UV-B, UV-A and VIS to
              stimulate present and enhanced UV radiation. The ability of phytoplankton cells
              to repair DNA will be estimated to subsequent exposure to white light, to
              induce repair; and yellow light, to suppress repair.  Results of these
              experiments will make an important contribution regarding the usefulness of a
              novel method to measure UV-induced DNA damage and repair in phytoplankton.
