Abstract    :
                  PROPOSAL: Amphiphilic Particles    Because of the reduced budget, I will not
              be able to prepare amphiphilic particles from a large number of pairs of
              hydrophobic and hydrophilic monomers. The emphasis will be on the pair
              acrylamidestyrene, but other pairs will be also considered. We will investigate
              in details the stability of these particles in hydrophilic and hydrophobic
              media and, in particular, the effect of the thickness and porosity of the outer
              shell on their stability. The particle will be further used to determine their
              adsorption capacity for various dyes and various homogeneous catalysts. Our
              fmal hope is that such particles could be employed for protein separation and
              for homogeneous catalysis. ~ ~:      .  Eli Ruckenstein  :Distinguished
