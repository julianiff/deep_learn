Abstract    :
              9712340  Taylor   The objective of this project is to curate, compactorize and
              computerize the large and important collection of fossil plants that became
              part of the University of Kansas Natural History Museum and Biodiversity
              Research Center (KUNHM) in 1995.  The collection has previously lacked both
              adequate space and curatorial support, as specimen data will be entered into a
              computer database at the same time that the specimens are curated.  The
              collection consists of approximately 200,000 specimens, including ancillary
              material, and contains fossils of all plant groups from unicellular algae to
              flowering plants, ranging in age from Precambrian to Pleistocene.  The largest
              and most important part of this collection consists of Permian and Triassic
              plants from Antarctica, including several thousand silica permineralizations
              (in which internal anatomy is preserved), the rarest form plant fossil
              preservation.  This is the largest colletion of permineralized Antarctic plants
              in the world and includes a variety of permineralized wood with preserved
              growth rings, which can be used to reconstruct high-latitude paleoclimates
              during these time periods.  The collection will be organized stratigraphically,
              curated, computerized, and become accessible to other scholars in the field. 
              Since it will be databased, scholars will be able to search the collection
              either stratigraphically or systematically.
