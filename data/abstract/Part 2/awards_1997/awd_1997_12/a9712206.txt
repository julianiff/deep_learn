Abstract    :
              Salters  9712206    During this project the investigators will determine the Nd
              isotopic   composition in abyssal peridotites from the Atlantis II fracture
              zone and   from the 11-17 degrees east location on the Southwest Indian Ridge. 
              This   work will involve obtaining clinopyroxene mineral separates from abyssal
                periodtites, then determining the Nd isotopic compositions.  The purpose of
              this   study is to use the isotopic compositions to determine whether
              pyroxenitic sources contribute to the production of mid-ocean ridge basalts and
              mantle plume signatures.
