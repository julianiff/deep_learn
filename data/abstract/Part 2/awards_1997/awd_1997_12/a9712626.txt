Abstract    :
              9712626  Si  This is a grant to conduct theoretical research on the  physics of
              metallic non-Fermi liquids in strongly correlated  electron systems.  Projects
              will include: non-Fermi liquid  solutions to an extended Hubbard model;
              elucidation of the  elementary excitations in non-Fermi liquid metals close to 
              quantum phase transitions; and, a collaboration with an  experimental program
              to study the electron-spin diffusion in  the normal state of high temperature
              superconductors.  %%%  The theoretical research will study the behavior of 
              electrons in metals in which the electrons are strongly  interacting.  In this
              case, the very concepts on which  normal electrons behave in solids and the
              usual methods of  analysis are called into question.  This research will 
              attempt to resolve some questions related to this very  important problem which
              is of fundamental and practical  interest.  ***
