Abstract    :
              9712852  Benoit  This project addresses the evaluation of a novel field 
              technique to be used at the Treasure Island National  Geotechnical
              Experimentation Site (NGES) in San Francisco,  California; the objective being
              to evaluate the insitu void  ratio and soil fabric at this site.    This
              technique consists of vertical and horizontal  measurements of soil electrical
              resistivity using two  specially instrumented piezocones simultaneously pushed
              into  the ground.  The method, designed by a research group in  Italy at the
              Hydraulic and Structural Research Center of the  Italian Electricity Agency
              (ENEL-CRIS), allows continuous  electrical resistivity measurements in the
              vertical  direction for each probe and in the horizontal direction  between the
              two probes.  The results, using groundwater and  soil samples, are calibrated
              against laboratory tests on  samples reconstituted at various densities.  This
              field  technique permits a large volume of soil to be tested,  avoiding the
              unwanted remolding effects surrounding the  device.  Because of the difficulty
              in obtaining undisturbed  insitu samples for laboratory testing of sands, this
              insitu  method shows great potential in providing parameters needed  for the
              prediction of the dynamic response of soils  subjected to earthquake loading.  
               The potential of this insitu electrical resistivity cone  penetration test to
              provide new soil parameters to evaluate  the earthquake response of natural
              sand deposits will  advance the state-of-the-art and permit rapid and cost- 
              effective methods for characterization of cohesionless  soils.
