Abstract    :
              9712438  SIERWALD    Millipedes are of outstanding ecological importance and
              play a crucial role in nutrient cycling within the soil.  With an estimated
              total of more than 80,000 living species, the millipede class (Diplopoda) is
              the third most diverse among terrestrial arthropods, after insects and
              arachnids (spiders, ticks, mites).  They are one of the most understudied
              groups of animals, with few up-to-date taxonomic treatments and few remaining
              active experts.    In this project, Petra Sierwald, Richard Hoffman, William
              Shear and R. M. Shelley will combine their expertise to train new millipede
              experts and produce new taxonomic treatments, especially of North and Central
              American taxa, using modern methods.  Species checklists, keys and
              classifications, for use by experts and nonexperts, will be produced and made
              available electronically.  In addition, specimen collections will be prepared,
              and those now available upgraded.
