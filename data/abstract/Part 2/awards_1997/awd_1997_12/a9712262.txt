Abstract    :
              ***  9712262  Kalkhoran           This Phase I Small Business Technology
              Transfer project will investigate the feasibility of a novel, low-cost,
              full-color, flat panel display based on silicon.  In this panel, both the
              light-emitting elements and driver circuits are fabricated on a single
              polysilicon thin film deposited on a glass substrate.  Emission is provided by
              electroluminescent (EL) devices based on nanocrystalline Si formed by
              anodization within the film, followed by a stabilizing oxidation procedure. 
              Due to their quantum confinement properties, these Si nanocrystallites are
              efficient emitters of visible light.  Si-based EL devices can be integrated
              monolithically with thin-film-transistor (TFT) chip-on-glass drive circuits,
              resulting in a compact, self-driven display panel.  Because the display panel
              proposed is compatible with advanced silicon processing technology, it can be
              built with minimum complexity and cost, and offer very high resolution. In
              Phase 1, the proposers will investigate fabrication of visible EL devices based
              on oxidized porous polysilicon (OPPS) thin film phosphors on glass.  Attempts
              will also be made to demonstrate a seven-segment numeric display based on these
              emitters and investigate multicolor EL devices.  Phase II will optimize process
              parameters for fabrication of Si-based EL devices capable of emitting the three
              primary colors (red, green and blue), and a prototype full-color active matrix
              display monolithically integrated with its driver TFTs will be developed and
              tested.         All-Silicon displays may be used in applications such as
              instrument displays, head mounted displays, computer screens, portable
              televisions, and electronic games.  ***
