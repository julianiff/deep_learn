Abstract    :
              This grant will provide funds to upgrade the Brown  University Geophysics
              Computer Facility.  The work supported  by this facility includes study of
              oceanic spreading  centers, study of mantle seismic velocity variations and 
              anisotropy as indicators of mantle  flow, numerical modeling  of mantle
              upwelling and melting beneath spreading centers,  and the development of
              techniques to study elastic plate  thickness and continental issoostasy.
