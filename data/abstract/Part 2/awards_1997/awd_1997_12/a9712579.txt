Abstract    :
              Units with a longer time basis than the traditional phones or sub-  phones  may 
              provide a better structural basis  for  ASR  systems  customized  for 
              recognition of naturally spoken  discourse.   In  this  project,
              syllabic-length acoustic models are being explored  for  the  recognition  of 
              conversational  speech.   The  project  entails:  definition of the acoustic
              features derived from energy  trajectories spanning ca. 250-ms intervals of
              speech; statistical  modeling  of  these  syllable-length regions;  development
               of  a  decoding scheme designed to combine the outputs of these acoustic 
              models  with  the  more  traditional phone- and  sub-phone-length  models;  and
              embedding the syllable, phone and sub-phone features  into  a  multi-tiered 
              representation of  language  designed  for  robust  recognition  under a wide
              range of acoustic-environmental  and   speaking  conditions.   A  complete  ASR
               system  is  being  developed that will incorporate the results of this
              research, and  will be evaluated on fluent speech.  Successful results with 
              the  recognition  system have the potential to improve  practical  ASR  systems
                that  must  deal  with  the  decoding  of   spontaneous  discourse.  
              Additionally, the analysis of longer-time  structure  at  the  acoustic,
              statistical, and lexical levels should improve  our basic knowledge about the
              structure of conversation speech.
