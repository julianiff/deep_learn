Abstract    :
                  Jennes  9712928         Many important findings are discovered in a 
              serendipitous fashion.  Dr. Jennes was attempting to  synthesize specific
              antibodies to the gonadotropin releasing  hormone (GnRH) which he hoped to used
              as neuroanatomical  tools to help understand this important hormone system.  As
               a result of this work, he isolated two antisera, (antibody  #80 and #81), that
              did not recognize the GnRH receptor  protein but instead had unique neural
              properties.  Dr.  Jennes is now proposing that these two antibodies may lead 
              to the  isolation and identification of  novel neural  proteins important for
              the neuroendocrine system.   His  preliminary data strongly suggest that the
              antibodies  labeled #80 and #81 recognize two novel unknown proteins  that
              could possibly be a new neuropeptide and a membrane  receptor for a putative
              hormone, respectively.  Based on the  morphology and location  of antibody #80
              in the axon  terminals of the outer layer of median eminence, Dr. Jennes 
              speculates that it may be recognizing a new neuropeptide  which can be released
              into the portal system and transported  to the pituitary gland to modulate its
              hormones.   On the  other hand, antibody #81 labels neurons in the supraoptic 
              and paraventricular nuclei, the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal  tract into the
              neural lobe of the pituitary as well as axon  terminals in the outer layer of
              the median eminence and it  is absent in brain regions not accessible to
              peripheral  hormones.  Dr. Jennes speculates that  #81 is actually  recognizing
              a novel membrane receptor protein.   Using funds  available through the Small
              Grant for Exploratory Research  Program which supports small-scale,
              exploratory, high risk  research, he will now characterize and sequence the two
               proteins.  This is the first step towards understanding the  function of what
              possible could prove to be two novel  proteins important for understanding the
              endocrine system in  the brain.
