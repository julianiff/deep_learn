Abstract    :
              9712197  Damodaran  Protein adsorption and film formation at various interfaces 
              play important roles in many biological and technological  processes.  Despite
              the enormous importance of this field,  fundamental understanding of these
              processes, especially  adsorption at the lipid-water interface, is still
              elusive.  Thus, the main objectives of this project are: (1) to  develop
              experimental approaches to study the kinetics and  thermodynamics of the
              air-water interface; (2) to elucidate  the relationship between the molecular
              flexibility and the  equation of state of proteins at air-water and oil-water 
              interfaces; (3) to elucidate the molecular factors affecting  competitive
              adsorption of proteins from binary and ternary  protein solutions to the
              oil-water interface; and (4) to  investigate the thermodynamic compatibility
              and two  dimensional phase separation behavior of proteins in a  binary protein
              film at air-water and oil-water interfaces.  The outcome from this project is
              to generate the basic  information needed to understand various biological, 
              chemical, and technological processes which involve  protein/enzyme adsorption
              at air-liquid and liquid-liquid  interfaces.  ***
