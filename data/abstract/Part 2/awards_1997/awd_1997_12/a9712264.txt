Abstract    :
              9712264  Shatz  The PI plans to learn more about several models of inner ear 
              function.  The aim of this research is to provide the PI  with background in
              current models of the electromotive  effects in cochlear mechanics, including
              the Traveling Wave  amplifier (TWAmp) Dallos/Evans and finite element (FEM) 
              models.  The TW Amp models the cochlear via two coupled  transmission lines. 
              This model simulates a large range of  experimental observations but needs a
              physiological  equivalent.  The FEM model fails to represent the electrical 
              properties of the cochlear; if only models its mechanical  properties.  The
              Dallos/Evans theory purposes a mechanism by  which the outer hair cells, the
              main transducting components  of the inner ear, are stimulated via the organ of
              Corti.  None of these models individually serves as a comprehensive 
              representation of human cochlear function.  The applicant  therefore intends to
              study all three, with longer term goals  of using the TWAmp model to test the
              Dallos/Evans theory,  improving the FEM model to incorporate electrical 
              mechanisms, and developing an understanding of the  physiological equivalent of
              the TWAmp.  ***
