Abstract    :
              9712381  Dibble     This project uses laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and
              quantum chemical calculations to determine rate coefficients for the
              isomerization and dissociation reactions of alkoxy radicals. These unimolecular
              reactions are poorly characterized, yet alkoxy radicals commonly dissociate or
              isomerize rather than reacting with molecular oxygen in the atmosphere. The
              competition among these three reactions has important implications for ozone
              formation throughout the troposphere. Data obtained in this study will help
              improve our understanding of alkoxy radical chemistry, and aid in the study of
              many other crucial atmospheric reactions involving alkoxy radicals.    LIF will
              be used to probe transient concentrations of alkoxy radicals. LIF in the near
              UV has demonstrated enormous utility for spectroscopic and kinetic studies of
              alkoxy radicals. It possesses the sensitivity and time resolution necessary to
              carry out direct determination of absolute rate coefficients for isomerization
              and dissociation reactions. In this study, the LIF spectra of alkoxy radicals
              possessing at least four carbon atoms will be determined. The technique can
              distinguish between isomers of the larger alkoxy radicals. For those alkoxy
              radicals which are not amenable to study by this experimental approach, quantum
              mechanical calculations will be employed  to estimate the effects of structure
              on reaction rates for isomerization and dissociation. Benchmark studies on
              species for which experimental data is available will be used as a reference to
              estimate unimolecular reaction rates not yet established by experiment.
