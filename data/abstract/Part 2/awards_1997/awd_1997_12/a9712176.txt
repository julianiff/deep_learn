Abstract    :
              9712176  Shen    A comprehensive analysis of the local seismicity along a 300 
              km-long stretch of the Southern East Pacific Rise, 15 to 18  degrees south, and
              off-axis out to 400 km on either flank is  possible using data from the MELT
              ocean-bottom seismometer  experiment.  This experiment deployed 51 seismometers
              for 7  months, and provides an opportunity to detect tectonic and  magmatic
              events and intraplace seismicity at a super-fast  spreading ridge.  The study
              has two components.  The first  is to characterize seismic activity at and near
              the ridge  axis, to relate seismicity to variations along-strike in  volcanic
              and tectonic features of the axial zone, and to use  the spatial and temperal
              patterns of seismicity to evaluate  the existing models of the basic processes
              of the formation  of the ocean crust.  The second component is to assess the 
              level and nature of intraplate seismicity and its  correlation with seafloor
              age, seamounts, gravity  lineations, or other tectonic features.
