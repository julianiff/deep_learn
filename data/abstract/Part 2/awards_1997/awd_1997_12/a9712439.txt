Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support, the Political Science and Sociology
              Departments at Ohio State University will create a linked Data Archive Unit and
              a Statistical and Data Manipulation Unit as the first phase of a longer term
              plan designed to enhance the research productivity of a large number of senior
              researchers and graduate students in both departments. The system will be built
              around a Gateway G6-200 Windows NT and a HP Netserver LH2 Pro 6/200 for
              statistical and data manipulation, and a PC w/CD-Writer, second CD-Writer and
              600 recordable CD as well as HP Netserver LH5/166 for data storage.  Both the
              Political Science and Sociology Departments at Ohio State University are
              well-ranked nationally with respect to their research and graduate training.
              The research conducted in these departments encompasses a wide array of
              substantive topics as well as research methodologies. Yet a large core of
              researchers in both disciplines employ a common quantitative methodology
              centered on the collection and analysis of large scale social surveys and other
              large data bases which will clearly benefit from the instrumentation. A
              sampling of topics to be examined include: structural determinants of race-sex
              labor market segregation and earnings; racial residential segregation, social
              isolation and homicide; aging, status and sense of control; strategic position
              taking and the timing of voting decisions in Congress; democratization and war;
              a study of Black voting in the 1996 election; and general voting patterns in
              the same year. The instrumentation will be used extensively by students and
              thus serve a major training function.
