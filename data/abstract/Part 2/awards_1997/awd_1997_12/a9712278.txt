Abstract    :
                    This  proposal  is  to  evaluate the sensitivity  of  sulfur  isotopes  to
              several geologic processes which contribute  to  the  formation of mid-ocean
              ridge basalts (MORB) on a global  scale, and to use sulfur isotope variations
              to constrain the  processes  of assimilation and recycling in MORB  and  their 
              mantle  sources.  The stable isotopes of sulfur (mainly  32S  and  34S) are
              fractionated by many low-temperature processes  such as chemical alteration, 
              degassing  and  rock-seawater  interactions,  but  are   not  fractionated by
              high-temperature processes such  as  partial  melting and fractional
              crystallization.  As a result, sulfur  isotopes  in  MORB can be used as
              sensitive tracers  of  (1)  assimilation  of  seawater sulfur in mid-ocean 
              ridge  magma  chambers,  and (2) recycling of sediments and oceanic  crust 
              through the upper mantle and back into the source regions of  MORB.    We  
              will   use   high-precision   ion   microprobe  measurements  of  sulfur 
              isotopes in  primitive  immiscible  sulfides  from MORB glasses worldwide to
              define  the  global  variability  of  sulfur isotopes in MORB,  and  examine 
              the  relationships  of these variations to assimilation,  crustal  thickness,
              spreading rate, and proximity to hotspots.
