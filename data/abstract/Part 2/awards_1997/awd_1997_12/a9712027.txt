Abstract    :
                       This is a near-bottom magnetic survey and sampling  program on the
              southern East Pacific Rise designed primarily  to evaluate the possibility that
              lineated shore wavelength  variations within the Bruhnes magnetic anomaly, and
              the  central anomaly magnetic high in particular, reflect  geomagnetic
              intensity fluctuations.  Two long Deep Tow  profiles will be obtained in a
              corridor at 17.5 degrees  south, and an additional four long Deep Tow lines
              will  collected at 19.5 degrees south. If fluctuations in the  earth's field
              intensity do account for much of the tiny  wiggles commonly observed in oceanic
              magnetic profiles,  these short wavelength anomalies May provide new
              information  on past geomagnetic intensity variations as well as finer-  scale
              temporal markers for evaluating ridge crest processes  than are available with
              polarity revesals alone.
