Abstract    :
              9712543  WHARTON    Parasitic Hymenoptera (wasps) are extraordinarily diverse,
              containing some 70,000 described species, but comparatively poorly known
              taxonomically despite their importance in understanding terrestrial ecosystems.
               Virtually all parasitic Hymenoptera are parasitoids of other insects and many
              are quite host-specific.  They are therefore essential components in the
              complex food webs of natural ecosystems and they provide a valuable source of
              natural enemies for pest insects in managed ecosystems.  Improved taxonomy and
              more natural classifications of parasitic wasps will enable better
              characterization  and management of biological diversity, and it will directly
              support research directed at a more sustainable agriculture with fewer negative
              impacts on the environment.    This research, by Robert A. Wharton, James B.
              Wooley and colleagues, will provide comprehensive taxonomic monographs in four
              key groups of parasitic Hymenoptera.  The project will address taxonomic needs
              in four families representing four major lineages (superfamilies) of parasitic
              Hymenoptera: 1) Braconidae (superfamily Ichneumonoidea), 2) Encyrtidae
              (superfamily Chalcidoidea), 3) Eucoilidae (superfamily Cynipoidea), and 4)
              Diapriidae (superfamily Proctotrupoidea).  Specific objectives are to produce
              worldwide monographic treatments of key genera in each of these families,
              treating nearly 1000 species.  Four Ph.D. students will be trained in the
              course of the project, one in each major lineage to be addressed.  The
              collaborative nature of the project (including specialists from four different
              countries) will provide exceptionally broad training and experience for the
              students in all aspects of modern, collection-based  systematics research. 
              Training will emphasize taxonomic methodology at the species-level, including
              computer/video-aided image analysis, and computer databasing of character data
              as well as host and locality data.
