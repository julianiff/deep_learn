Abstract    :
                Producibility of the planar-flow process depends on the dynamics and stability
              of a group of three-phase and two-phase configurations.  The stability and
              control of these are crucial in strip-casting (or melt-spinning),
              impact-forming, die-casting, spray-foaming, and extrusion, among others; that
              is, in virtually any casting process where integrity of bulk properties and
              surface quality are paramount. The objectives of this research are:  (1) to
              understand the fluid mechanics of air entertainment at the upstream meniscus;
              (2) to develop implications of certain compatibility relations that constrain
              the downstream injunction; (3) to identify the physics responsible for an
              observed transition from smooth to rough texture with applied pressure; and (4)
              to capture the feedback influence of fluid flow on the morphological stability
              of the solidification front.        The ultimate goals are to understand the
              influence of processing on microstructure: the number, size and orientation of
              grains; to control surface quality and to widen the process operability window;
              and, to better control the phase-change, process stability and thereby quality
              of the ribbon, foil and sheet produced. Improvements on the engineering side
              are expected to go hand-in-hand with scientific advances.
