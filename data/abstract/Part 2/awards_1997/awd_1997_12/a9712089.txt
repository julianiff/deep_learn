Using a case study of shared transit-based electric cars in
              the San Francisco Bay Area, this dissertation project seeks to develop an
              understanding of the processes by which travelers can and might accept or adapt
              to transportation technologies, depending on the method and length of
              introduction.  Two types of innovation exposure will be examined in this study:
              an informational video and brochure.  To examine the dynamics of the household
              response to the innovation, a panel survey of San Francisco Bay Area residents
              exposed to the intelligent station car concept will be conducted.  The
              information gathered in this survey will be used to evaluate several dynamic
              household hypotheses.  For instance, a household's valuing response to an
              innovation's mobility limitations (e.g., range) will be altered by
              exposure/time with the new technology.  Dynamics in the household's valuing
              response will be revealed in attitudes, activities, and travel behavior of the
              household and reflected in the travel diaries and surveys administered to study
              participants.  The insights gained from this study could be used by individuals
              in both the public and private sectors to assess the demand for the intelligent
              station car innovation and other related technologies e.g., smart taxis, smart
              paratransit, and car-sharing organizations.  A wide-range of transportation
              technologies could benefit from the understanding gained from this
              study.
