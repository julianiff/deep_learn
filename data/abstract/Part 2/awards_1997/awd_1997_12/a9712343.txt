Abstract    :
              9712343  Handel  Exploratory research is funded to investigate the practical
              applicability of high-( paraelectric and ferroelectric materials as gate
              insulation materials in heterostructure field effect transistors.  The research
              includes verification of stability of high-( surface barrier layers, stability
              of the resulting device characteristics, possible quantum 1/f noise enhancement
              through remote piezophonon effects, etc.    Also included is development of an
              analytical description which allows for the optimization of the HFETs.  ***
