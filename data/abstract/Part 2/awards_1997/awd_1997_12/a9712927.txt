Abstract    :
                Springer  9712927      A transposon tagging system has been established using
              Ds transposable elements containing reporter genes. A collection of lines, each
              containing a Ds element inserted randomly in the Arabidopsis genome, has been
              generated. The Ds element carries a reporter gene, allowing the expression
              pattern of nearby genes to be monitored via the reporter gene. These lines have
              been screened for reporter gene expression in the shoot apex of Arabidopsis
              seedlings. Several genes have been identified that are specifically expressed
              in discrete domains within the shoot apex. These include genes expressed
              specifically in the shoot apical meristem, and genes expressed in domains at
              the base of each leaf primordium. Two lines (GT185 and GT522) have been chosen
              for further characterization. These lines both exhibit expression of the
              reporter gene in a group of cells subtending each organ (rosette leaf, cauline
              leaf, flower) and organ primordium. The expression pattern suggests that the
              genes controlling the reporter gene may be involved in the establishment of a
              boundary between the shoot apical meristem and organ primordia. As a first step
              in the characterization of the genes controlling reporter gene expression in
              these two lines, the reporter gene expression pattern will be carefully
              analyzed at different developmental stages. The genes controlling reporter gene
              expression will be cloned by amplification of DNA flanking the Ds insertion.
              The genes will be molecularly characterized by sequencing and in-situ
              hybridization. The relationship between GT185, GT522 and two genes that have
              previously been shown to play a role in meristem function will be examined.
