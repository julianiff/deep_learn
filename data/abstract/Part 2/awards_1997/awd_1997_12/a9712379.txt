Abstract    :
              Research in geometric algorithms and data  structures has flourished in the last
              decade.  This field has made a large number of fundamental  contributions to
              the understanding of geometric  structures and geometric computation.  This 
              combination of theory and practical significance  has been key to the vitality
              of this field.  This  continued vitality depends on a healthy balance  between
              these two influences.  This project is  concerned with the design and analysis
              of  fundamental algorithmic tools for geometric  problems with applications in
              computer vision,  pattern recognition, computer graphics,  computational
              statistics, and computer-aided  manufacturing.  Emphasis will be placed on 
              practical, implementable solutions to these  problems, and both theoretical and
              empirical  analyses of their performance.
