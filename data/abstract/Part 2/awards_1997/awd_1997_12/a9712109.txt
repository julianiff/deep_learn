Abstract    :
                     Modern cryptography relies heavily on assumptions about  the asymptotic
              intractability of certain number-theoretic  problems. However, at the
              implementation level, assumptions  about the concrete complexity of problems of
              a fixed size  must be made (e.g. the intractability of factorization 
              assumption in practice is "factoring 1024-bit cryptographic  numbers is
              impossible").  Determining what "small-size" is  too small to be secure is the
              focus of this project: to  design and implement algorithms which solve, in
              practice,  those number-theoretic problems which are the pillars of  modern
              cryptography.  These problems which are vital to  modern cryptography are i)
              the discrete logarithm problem;  ii) deciding quadratic residuosity modulo a
              composite  number; iii)  factorization of cryptographic numbers.  These  three
              problems will be central to this project.  The project  will also consider a
              host of problems peripheral to these  three:  primality testing, fast
              arithmetric with large  numbers, diophantine approximation, rapid factorization
              of  small numbers, factorization of random numbers, and other  problems that
              will surely arise as research progresses.***
