Abstract    :
              9712489  Economy  The broad based objectives of this GOALI project ( co-funded 
              by the Division of Materials Research and the Office of  Multidisciplinary
              Activities of MPS) are primarily to pursue  new and improved activated carbons
              for removal of  environmental contaminants and second to explore the design  of
              novel catalytic  systems which are based on activated  carbons.  This will be a
              collaborative effort between the  University of Illinois and 3M Corporation
              with the end goal  being the scale-up and commercialization of these materials.
               It will include a 3-month sabbatical stay by a 3M researcher  in Professor
              Economy's laboratory.  Several other companies  have also expressed interest
              and may participate.  The  objectives are focused on the following three
              themes: 1)  continued research and development of the activated carbon  on a
              glass fiber substrate with emphasis on tailoring the  pore size and shape and
              pore surface chemistry for selective  removal of impurities from both air and
              water, 2) use of  activated carbon fibers as catalysts and catalyst substrates 
              based on some very recent observations in our laboratory and  3) to provide
              developmental quantities of these fibers for  evaluation by our industrial
              partners.  %%%  This work is in the area of polymer-based  carbonaceous
              materials for activated catalytic  systems of applicability to environmental 
              solutions.  ***
