Abstract    :
              9712885  Nelson  The senior PI, in recent years, has been involved in (a) the 
              development of a Lagrangian formulation of long wavelength  phenomena in
              dielectric crystals, (b) using this formulation  to derive and elucidate
              high-order nonlinear interactions  and correcting widely held long standing
              misconceptions in  classical theories and (c) incorporation of magnetic 
              phenomena in his formulation using Grassmann algebra of  anticommuting
              variables.  This grant continues to support  his work following a string of
              successes in the previous  award.  This grant also includes work on a
              generalized  energy conservation law and a new Poynting vector, followed  by
              application to the properties of an optical soliton.  %%%  This senior PI is
              well known for his contributions to Laser  Physics.  In this renewal grant, he
              continues his work on a  sophisticated mathematical  formulation of
              electromagnetic  wave propagation in an insulating material.  In this renewal 
              he specifically wants to generalize the formulation to  include magnetic
              properties of materials.  ***
