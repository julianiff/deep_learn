Abstract    :
              In this project, scientists from the State University of New  York at Albany,
              Old Dominion University, and the University  of Washington will participate in
              a series of cruises with  scientists from the National Institute of
              Oceanography in  Goa, India, to study nitrogen cycling in the water column of 
              the Arabian Sea.  Because of a spatially extensive and  seasonally changing
              suboxic zone, the Arabian Sea is a  region of major global significance for
              denitrification and  nitrous oxide formation.  This American contribution to
              the  joint Indian-American effort would endeavor to (1) estimate  the
              significance of the  Arabian Sea in global  denitrification, (2) determine how
              the rate of Arabian Sea  water column denitrification varies spatially and 
              temporally, (3) determine the relative importance of  nitrification and
              denitrification in producing high effluxes  of nitrous oxide from the Arabian
              Sea to the atmosphere.
