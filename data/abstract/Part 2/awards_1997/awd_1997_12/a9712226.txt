Abstract    :
              This project will investigate algorithmic solutions to several  geometric
              problems arising in layered manufacturing, where a  physical prototype of a 3D
              object is built directly from its  computer model by orienting and slicing the
              model into parallel  layers and manufacturing the layers successively.  The
              problems  considered include finding orientations of the model that  optimize
              one or more design criteria (e.g., number of layers,  surface finish, amount of
              support structures needed), and  algorithms for model decomposition, packing,
              slicing, support  generation, and computation of offsets and tool-paths.  The
              scope  of the project includes the design and analysis of efficient and 
              practical algorithms, their implementation in software, and,  furthermore, the
              evaluation of this software via actual  fabrication of parts on a layered
              manufacturing machine. The  project will draw upon combinatorial, algorithmic,
              and data  structuring techniques from computational geometry.  The project 
              will also benefit considerably from the input and practical  expertise of
              engineers at a leading company specializing in  layered manufacturing, with
              whom a collaboration is already  underway. It is expected that the proposed
              work will result in  significant design and performance improvements in layered
               manufacturing and will also open up interesting new directions  for research
              in computational geometry.
