Abstract    :
              This project extends the lemma generation heuristics and failure  analysis of
              induction schemes in an induction and rewrite-rule  based theorem prover called
              Rewrite Rule Laboratory (RRL).  Finding an appropriate induction scheme and
              speculation of  intermediate lemmas are critical steps in mechanization of
              proofs  by induction.  For theorem provers to be effective for  applications,
              it is essential that a theorem prover be able to  automatically perform
              inference steps considered routine in the  application domain. This can be
              achieved, to a considerable  extent, with the help of decision procedure for
              data structures  used to model the application domain.  Further, these decision
               procedures should be tightly integrated with other inference  steps and
              heuristics including simplification (rewriting),  generation of induction
              schemes and their analysis vis a vis  likelihood of success, lemma speculation,
              and appropriate  instantiations of definitions and lemmas needed in proof 
              attempts.  Motivated by the application of hardware verification,  this project
              seeks to design and implement decision procedures  for data structures
              including bits, bit vectors, numbers, lists  and sequences, and arrays, and
              integrate them in the induction  based prover RRL.
