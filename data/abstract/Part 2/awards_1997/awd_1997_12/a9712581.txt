Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Joel Kuipers will purchase a
              computer based system to facilitate the analysis of discourse. The system
              integrates audio and visual data and therefore allows researchers to examine
              not only spoken language per se but also the crucial role that gestures and
              facial expressions play in human communication. The instrumentation includes 8
              Power Mac 8500 AV computer workstations, vPrism software which permits
              full-screen, real time digital video to be linked with transcriptions and
              annotations of that data on the same computer screen and permits key word
              searches on transcribed words. An Apple Macintosh Power 8500 AV will also be
              purchased to run the vPrism software.  This system will be employed by multiple
              departments, including Anthropology and Linguistics to pursue a number of
              projects. These include study of topic changes in Indonesian meetings, the
              comparative analysis of discursive changes over time, interaction of Zairian
              pygmies with villages and foreigners and the analysis of referential
              communication in aphasia. The enhanced retrieval and analysis capabilities will
              permit new standards of ethnographic and linguistic documentation and reveal
              the richly interactional and communicative aspects of human behavior. The
              instrumentation will be extensively used for instructional purposes and have a
              significant impact on both undergraduate and graduate education.
