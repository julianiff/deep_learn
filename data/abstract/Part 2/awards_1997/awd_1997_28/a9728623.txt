Abstract    :
              CMS 97-28623  Dobry  This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) award is 
              funded to support research on the development of a new  constitutive relation
              for sands and other granular media,  based on some recent particulate mechanics
              findings by the  PI.  These findings reveal some simple and very powerful 
              connections between behavior at the  article contact level  and the desired
              constitutive relation.  The new relation is  based on the force-deformation
              model at the contact between  two spheres developed by the PI, and it will be
              implemented  through a computer program.  A preliminary assessment  indicates
              that the new relation will naturally predict the  stress-induced anisotropy,
              volumetric contraction upon  unloading, and densification during cyclic loading
              observed  experimentally.  Parametric studies will be performed with  the
              computer program, and the predications will be compared  with available
              experimental results.  Finally, ways will be  explored to incorporate, also on
              the basis of fundamental  particulate mechanics consideration, other effects
              currently  not included in the relation, like dilation and anelastic  behavior
              during consolidation.  The new constitutive  relation should have significant
              impact on the analytical  modeling of static and cyclic loading of granular
              media,  given its fundamental particulate mechanics grounding as  well as its
              power and simplicity.  ***
