Abstract    :
              The behaviors and fates of cells are specified by the proteins they express and
              by the distribution of those proteins within the cell. One way that proteins
              are targeted to specific subcellular sites is via the localization of their
              corresponding mRNAs. Like other aspects of mRNA metabolism, localization is
              governed by specific RNA-protein recognition events. This proposal seeks to
              investigate the RNA-protein recognition events that mediate mRNA localization
              in Drosophila oocytes. It focuses on K10 mRNA, which is representative of a
              relatively large class of mRNAs (~30 members) that are synthesized in ovarian
              nurse cells and selectively transported into the oocyte during early stages of
              oogenesis. Previous studies have identified a small sequence element, called
              the TLS (transport/localization sequence), that is required and sufficient for
              K10 mRNA localization. The specific aims of the current proposal are: (1) To
              define precisely the structural features of the TLS that are required for its
              in vivo localization activity, (2) To determine whether the activity of the TLS
              is affected by its position in the mRNA, and (3) To identify and characterize
              proteins that bind the TLS.
