Abstract    :
              OPP-9728364  PI  Posson  Abstract    In 1988, the Interagency Arctic Research
              policy Committee (IARPC) established the AEDD Working group to identify,
              organize, preserve, and present information about Arctic environmental data
              which is available from US Federal agencies and selected Alaska State agencies
              and academic institutions.  The Arctic Environmental Data Directory (AEDD) was
              assembled as a subset of the Earth Science Data Directory of the U.S.
              Geological Survey.  AEDD contains more than 400 references to data sets, each
              of which has been reviewed for completeness, consistency, and accuracy.  Data
              sets described cover many disciplines including geophysics, hydrology,
              geochemistry, oceanography, cartography, atmospheric physics and chemistry,
              marine and terrestrial biology, health and medicine, contaminants, remote
              sensed data, and in situ data.  AEDD resides on a computer system accessible to
              scientists, policy makers, educators, and the interested public over the
              internet.
