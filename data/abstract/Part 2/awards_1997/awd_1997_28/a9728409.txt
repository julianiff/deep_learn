Abstract    :
              Deoller  9728409    Hydrogen  sulfide, a common constituent of  several  natural
               and  man-made  aquatic habitats, is both a potent  toxin  of  aerobic 
              cellular respiration and an electron-rich  molecule  used  by  some  bacteria
              as an energy source.   In  ciliated  gills  from Geukensia demissa, a marine
              mussel from sulfide  rich  sediments, sulfide oxidation supports  cellular 
              work,  indicating  for  the first time that in an  intact  metazoan  tissue, 
              mitochondria  switch  from  carbon  catabolism   to  sulfide  oxidation for
              energy production.  In this  project,  using  excised  intact G. demissa gills 
              and  isolated  gill  mitochondria,   three  central  questions   concerning  
              the  transition from carbon catabolism to sulfide oxidation  will  be 
              addressed:  what is the nature of this transition;  what  factors  regulate 
              it; and, since sulfide  exposure  history  influences capacity for sulfide
              oxidation, what mechanism(s)  underlies this alternation in capacity?  The
              results of this  work  will help rigorously address a long-standing question, 
              namely  how  do  organisms adapt to sulfide  exposure?   The  findings  may 
              indicate  that energy budgets  of  ecosystems  containing sulfide habitats need
              reconsideration if  sulfide  oxidation   can  result  in  carbon  sparing  in 
              metazoans.  Assessment  of  mitochondrial function using innovative  and 
              state-of-the-art  techniques will further our  understanding  of   this  
              possibly  widespread  adaptation  to   seemingly  in hospitable environments.
