              In all organisms, internal biological clocks drive daily (or  circadian)
              rhythms in physiological states, resulting in sleep-wake  cycles and other
              behavioral rhythms. Genetic studies of insects and  non-animal organisms have
              identified genes that code for many of  these molecular gears, but very few
              clock genes have been  identified in vertebrate animals. The goal of this
              project is to  understand how the components of the circadian system interact
              to  produce daily rhythms, and to determine how the clock is assembled  during
              embryonic development.       Recent work in this laboratory has demonstrated
              that clock  cells are located in the pineal gland and retina, and that these 
              cells release a hormone, melatonin, in a circadian rhythm.  Behavioral activity
              levels are also controlled by a biological  clock. The first major objective of
              this project is to determine  the causal relationships among these phenomena.
              Is behavioral  rhythmicity driven by melatonin rhythms, and is behavior
              regulated  by clocks in the pineal gland, the retinas or some other clock7 The 
              second objective is to determine when and how rhythms of melatonin  and
              behavior are initiated during development from a single cell  embryo to a fully
              formed vertebrate animal. Fish embryos are  fertilized and develop external to
              the mother. This allows  manipulation of physiological and environmental
              conditions to test  hypotheses about how the biological clocks that control
              melatonin  and behavior are initiated and set.       This initial
              characterization of the zebrafish circadian  system will provide the baseline
              information necessary to fully  exploit emerging zebrafish genetic information
              and technology in  future studies of  vertebrate circadian clock mechanisms.
