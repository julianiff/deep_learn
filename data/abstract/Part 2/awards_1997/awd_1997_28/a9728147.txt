Abstract    :
                9728147  TIGYI     The goal of this research is to understand the fundamental
              mechanisms that regulate the development of neuronal connections in the brain. 
              Past research by this group has led to the discovery of a novel group of
              molecules (lysophosphatidates) that inhibit the outgrowth of the neuronal
              processes that provide the wiring of the nervous system.  Interestingly, these
              molecules are generated after injury to the central nervous system and might
              impair regeneration and recovery of function.  Dr. Tigyi and his collaborators
              will investigate the molecular signals that mediate this inhibitory effect. 
              Specifically, they will generate, using molecular biological techniques,
              special cell lines that are deficient in one of three key molecular switches,
              Cdc42, Rac, and Rho, which are presumed to be involved in the inhibitory
              effect.  They will then analyze the molecular mechanism that turns these
              switches on and off.  By using these engineered neuron-like cells, they will be
              able to answer which one or more of these three switches needs to be turned on
              for the inhibition to take place.  Once the switches mediating the inhibitory
              effect are determined in the cell culture system, it will be possible in future
              research to investigate the specific role of lysophosphatidates and the
              switches they control in the development, regeneration, and repair of the
              nervous system.
