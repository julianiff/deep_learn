Abstract    :
              9728963  Chapin  The purpose of this research submitted to the Interagency
              competition on Terrestrial Ecology and Global Change (TECO) is to develop a
              predictive understanding of the major classes of feedbacks from boreal fire to
              climate as a basis for improved understanding of the changing role of the
              boreal forest in the earth's climate system. The goal is to understand
              processes that remain outside of current general circulation models (GCM's).
              These processes reflect "surprises" that reduce the reliability of GCM's to
              predict climate change because of limited understanding of the role of biotic
              and ecosystem feedbacks to regional and global dynamics. This project involves
              an integrative, large-scale field experiment in the boreal forest along with
              studies of paleoecological dynamics, and fire and climate modeling. The project
              will integrate measurements of forest dynamics following burning, soil
              processes, trace gas fluxes, and paleoecological reconstruction of vegetation
              and climate. The research will be conducted in association with the Bonanza
              Creek LTER program in Alaska. Once the field experiments are established, the
              long-term monitoring of field manipulation and experimental burning treatments
              initiated in this TECO project will become part of the Bonanza Creek  LTER
              program. The project is important because it represents one of the few
              extensive and integrative assessments of the feedbacks between fire in boreal
              forest and global climate dynamics.
