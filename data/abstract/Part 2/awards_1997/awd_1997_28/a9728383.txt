Abstract    :
              IBN 97-28383  GOLDSTEIN      Human hearing continuously monitors the frequency
              composition of  sounds throughout the audio range (50-16,000 Hz). The inner ear
               allows the brain to monitor about 4,000 different overlapping  frequency bands
              within this range. A model for how this is  accomplished by the brain, the"
              simple spectrogram model," has  been used widely throughout this century by
              scientists and  engineers.  The model  represents auditory frequency analysis
              with  25 contiguous linear filters, each spanning 1/3 of an octave, with  the
              brain monitoring the energy within short segments (10-250  milliseconds) of the
              filter responses.  By assuming further that  information received by the brain
              is limited by internal noise,  this model has served as a basic framework for
              predicting human  abilities to recognize speech and to discriminate changes in 
              sounds.  Limitations of the simple model are known, including  failures to
              predict audible distortion tones generated by inner-  ear nonlinearity, and
              sensitivity to signal waveform.  In recent  collaborative research with Bell
              Laboratory scientists, Dr.  Goldstein discovered that detection of signal peaks
              rather than  energy improves model predictions of discrimination phenomena. 
              This revived interest in an earlier, "peak-detection," model of  Dr.
              Goldstein's (1967) that was used to explain discrimination of  waveform changes
              produced by modulation of sinusoidal carriers.  As a result, evidence was found
              for two processes at each auditory  filter in the peak-detection model. 
              Because of other recent  evidence that slow modulations within speech sounds
              contribute to  their recognition, these newly recognized characteristics of 
              hearing may be particularly relevant for audio science and  engineering. In the
              present project, use of random signals  minimizes confounding effects of
              inner-ear nonlinearity on  interpretations of experiments. The project is
              exploiting this to  develop further the model of auditory peak detection.  In
              addition  to upgradi ng the classical spectrogram model, this research is 
              contributing knowledge of functions performed by neural mechanisms  beyond the
              inner ear.
