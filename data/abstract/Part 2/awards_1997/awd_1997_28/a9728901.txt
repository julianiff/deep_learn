Abstract    :
              9728543  Dohanich    One of the most fundamental questions in neuroscience is
              how the CNS is able to store and retrieve information.  It is clear that
              whatever the actual mechanisms that underlie learning, whether structural,
              physical, or even functional, they must involve chemical changes.  The steroid
              hormone, estrogen, has been shown to promote the growth of brain structures,
              modulate brain biochemistry, and affect performance on tasks of learning and
              memory.  Moreover, estrogen modulates the activity of a number of
              neurotransmitters including acetylcholine which has been hypothesized as a
              transmitter of learning.  Indeed, Dr. Dohanich has found that estrogen effects
              on memory become most apparent when acetylcholine systems have been compromised
              pharmacologically.  Using a variety of behavioral paradigms, Dr. Dohanich will
              now began to decipher the complex role of the ovarian hormones, estrogen and
              progesterone. on spatial learning and memory.  Moreover, using quantitative
              autoradiographic techniques, he will examine the effects of estrogen and
              progesterone on cholinergic receptors in brain regions important for memory. 
              The results from these studies will determine both the conditions and the
              mechanisms under which estrogen has memory enhancing effects.  These studies
              are especially important and timely given the recent reports suggesting  that
              the presence of estrogen in women is correlated with improved memory and a
              reduced incidence of Alzheimer's Disease.  Moreover, the results from this
              project will greatly enhance our understanding of the fundamental
              interrelationships of ovarian hormones, cholinergic neurotransmission, and
              learning and memory, an area which is filled with speculation while lacking
              important data.
