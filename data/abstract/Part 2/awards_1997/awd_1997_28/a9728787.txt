Abstract    :
              9728787  Yamazak    There is considerable indirect evidence that the Major 
              Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) of genes   a highly  variable string of about
              50 genes intimately involved in  immune recognition   also acts to provision
              individuals with  a unique odor (an odortype) analogous to a fingerprint.  The 
              objectives of this project are threefold: I) to obtain  direct evidence for
              this investigating odortypes of inbred  mice that have targeted gene
              disruptions ( knockouts ) of  one or both of two classes of MHC genes; ii) to
              investigate  the functional role of odortypes in the context of mother-  infant
              interactions;ii) to determine whether the odortypes  of the fetus, which is
              expressed in the secretions and  excretions of the pregnant animal, alters the
              way other  animals interact with her.    Broadly, the goals of this work are to
              increase our  understanding of how and to what end MHC genes, best known  for
              functioning in immune self-nonself recognition (the  genes that must closely
              match successful organ or tissue  transplants), code for individuality of odor.
               This  understanding will through light on how diversity of this  gene complex
              is maintained in nature, how individuals, be  they mice or people, recognize
              each other as individuals and  even, on a more practical level, on how dogs are
              able to  track individuals humans.  Thus, this project ranges from  molecular
              biology to population biology to forensics.
