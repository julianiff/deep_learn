Abstract    :
              Emotions reflect an appraisal of situations, and they help people to respond to
              situations in particular ways.   However, appraisals may be modified, and
              emotional response tendencies may be overridden. These emotion regulatory
              processes permit people to manage their emotions, to influence which emotions
              they have, and to choose how these emotions are expressed. Such emotion
              regulation is essential to healthy adaptation, and so pervasive that it is
              often taken for granted. Emotion regulation clearly has consequences for the
              person who is doing the regulating, but it also may have important consequences
              for others. The current project examines the social consequences of two
              important forms of emotion regulation. The first, antecedent-focused emotion
              regulation, is exemplified by reappraisal, in which one reinterprets one's
              situation so as to reduce its emotional impact. The second, response-focused
              emotion regulation, is exemplified by suppression, in which one inhibits
              emotion-expressive behavior. Behavioral, physiological, and self-report
              measures will be used to examine the social consequences of reappraisal and
              suppression. The long-term objective is to better understand the nature and
              consequences of emotion regulation. Such research could have important
              implications for understanding emotion and emotion regulation, and will lay the
              foundation for interventions promoting healthy forms of emotion regulation.
