Abstract    :
              Abstract  9728027  Lederer  An international symposium on "Mechanisms and
              Functions of Local Calcium Signaling" will be held September, 1998 to
              disseminate latest advances in this field.  The meeting, which is the 52nd
              Annual Symposium of the Society of General Physiologists, will focus on the
              mechanisms by which localized calcium signals are generated within cells, and
              on the diverse consequences of these signals for cell function.  The latest
              findings on this topic will be presented.  Lectures by leaders in the field
              will cover aspects of local calcium signaling in diverse systems including 
              both excitable cells (neurons, muscle, neuroendocrine) as well as non-excitable
              cells (lymphocytes, oocytes).  Poster sessions and six short talks devoted to
              late breaking results are also included.   The goal of this meeting is to bring
              together a diverse group of researchers to discuss and compare the latest
              findings in the field of local calcium signaling.  It is anticipated that the
              conference will not only provide the current state of knowledge, but will also
              play an important role in identifying new directions for future research in
              this field.
