Abstract    :
              9728329  Mackenzie  The plant mitochondrial genome is unusually variable in its
              size and highly complex in its organization when compared to its counterparts
              in yeast and animal systems.  Of particular interest for this project is the
              observation that distinct mitochondrial   DNA molecules, each containing only a
              portion of the genetic information, are retained in the genome at strikingly
              different relative copy number.  What accounts for this unusual organization in
              plants is not well understood.  It is clear that many features of the
              mitochondrial genome, including DNA copy number, are under nuclear gene
              control.  This project is designed to test the hypothesis that nuclear-directed
              copy number control of mitochondrial DNA molecules serves as a means of
              suppressing mitochondrial mutations in plants.  To test this hypothesis, the
              CHM gene in Arabidopsis thaliana has been cloned.  Mutations in this gene
              result in the amplification of mitochondrial DNA molecules that contain
              mutations.  Thus, characterization of this gene, its product, and its mode of
              action should allow a direct test of the stated hypothesis.  We plan to confirm
              the identity of the CHM clone, to localize its gene product, and to genetically
              test its function.
