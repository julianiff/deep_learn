Abstract    :
              MCB-9728218  Johnson, Douglas    The long-term objective of this project is to
              understand the signal transduction mechanisms that   control cell morphogenesis
              during the eukaryotic cell cycle.  The goal of this study is to decipher   the
              signaling pathways that control cell polarity in the yeast Saccharomyces
              cerevisiae.  Polarized   growth in response to normal or aberrant signals
              during the yeast cell cycle can result in several   different morphological
              structures.  We have previously characterized two proteins that are   integral
              components of the cell polarity pathway in yeast: a Cdc42p GTPase and a Cdc24p,
              its   guanine nucleotide exchange factor.  The observation that both have
              counterparts in other   eukaryotes suggests that common signal transduction
              mechanisms control cell polarity in   different cell types.  The specific aims
              of this study are to understand the molecular interactions   of Cdc42p with its
              upstream regulators, including Cdc24p, and several downstream effectors.   
              Also to be addressed is how the subcellular localization of these proteins is
              regulated.  To study   these interactions and their role in control of cell
              polarity, studies are proposed that combine   several genetic, cell biological
              and biochemical approaches.
