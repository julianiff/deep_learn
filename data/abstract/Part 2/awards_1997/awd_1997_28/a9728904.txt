Abstract    :
              9728904  Ladinsky      This award supports U.S. participation in a Science and 
              Technology Week in Vietnam.  The S&T Week will feature  meetings between a team
              of U.S. researchers in materials  science, information technology, and
              biotechnology and  corresponding groups of Vietnamese researchers.  The 
              objective is to introduce U.S. researchers to their  counterparts in Vietnam
              and vice versa, and to explore  opportunities for future collaboration.    The
              Vietnamese counterpart is Dr. Chu Hao, Vice Minister of  Science, Technology
              and Environment.  It is anticipated that  this planning meeting will allow U.S.
              participants to  identify the areas of greatest potential value for future 
              scientific cooperation and introduce Vietnamese researchers  to U.S. approaches
              to conducting basic research.
