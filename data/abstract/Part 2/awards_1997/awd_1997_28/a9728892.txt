Abstract    :
              Title:    Condition-Dependent Reproductive Strategies in a  Fish with Male
              Parental Care      PI:      R. Craig Sargent      Non-Technical Summary       
              Animals acquire resources throughout their lives, which they  ultimately invest
              in fitness:  i.e. survival and  reproduction.  The study species for this
              research, the  fathead minnow, is a fish in which males perform all  parental
              care.  Past work with this species has shown that  males with higher energy
              reserves are more likely to win  contests for nest sites with other males, are
              more likely to  be chosen as mates by females, and are more likely to sire a 
              lot of offspring over an entire breeding season.  This  research will
              specifically investigate now males allocate  resources to their breeding
              coloration.  It will also study  how this coloration may function as a signal
              to attract  females, as a signal of dominance to rival males, or both. 
              Manipulation of male energy reserves, through manipulation  of diet, will be
              used to determine how energy reserves may  influence male breeding coloration
              and fitness.  The results  of this research will provide insights into how
              energy  reserves (and overall health) affect animal signals,  communication,
              reproductive success, and fitness.
