Abstract    :
              The investigator uses experimental data from the MAPSTAR medium frequency
              partial reflection radar (operated during the Arecibo Initiative on the
              Dynamics of the Atmosphere).  He plans corrections to previously published
              estimates of atmospheric turbulence in the mesopause, deduced from medium
              frequency radar, applying the imaging Doppler interferometry (IDI) technique. 
              IDI measures positions and line-of-sight velocities of individual scatterers,
              so only those scatterers close to the zenith can be chosen, minimizing
              contamination of the vertical velocity by the larger horizontal components of
              gravity wave velocities.  His method corrects both the remaining gravity wave
              and finite zenith angle contamination of IDI data.  Finally, he compares
              Doppler broadening, fading rate and IDI turbulent dissipation rate measurements
              using the AIDA data set.
