Abstract    :
                      97-28896  Mechanisms of Associative Learning      Associative learning
              is a basic form of learning that is  generally thought to be central to the
              scientific  understanding of human memory and cognition.  The grant  research
              is directed toward identifying and characterizing  the fundamental mechanisms
              involved.  It follows and  contributes to an approach that is shared by a
              substantial  group of investigators, namely the use of a simple, 
              experimentally well-controllable instance of associative  learning about which
              a great deal of bevaioral and  biological information is available (in case,
              Pavlovian-like  eyeblink conditioning in the rabbit), and the attempted 
              development of a quantitative,  neural-network  account of  the regularities
              observed.    The focus of the grat research at this juncture is on a set 
              issues that have come to occupy great current theoretical  attention, involving
              the roles played by  elemental  versus   configural cues,  in different
              instances of assoiative  learning.  The research will evaluate the usefulness  
              componential  treatment in which elemental and configural  cues are generally
              presumed to compete with each other  within an adaptive-network environment. 
              The conception  holds promise of providing a principled account of the very 
              different patterns of generalization and discrimination that  is observed under
              what might appear to be minor variations  in the conditions of associative
              training.
