Abstract    :
                  This project is an extension of work begun at the University of
              Massachusetts at Boston under the TEAMS-BC Collaborative for ExcelIence in
              Teacher Preparation. Courses designed or revised under TEAMS-BC will be further
              developed and integrated into the teacher preparation curriculum. New courses
              in mathematics, science, and technology for prospective teachers will be
              developed. Faculty involved in the project will conduct formative evaluation
              research on student learning in newly developed and revised courses.
              Relationships with two Professional Development Sites, one elementary school in
              Boston and one in Cambridge, will be strengthened by the development of on-site
              courses for student teachers and greater cooperation with the school systems.
