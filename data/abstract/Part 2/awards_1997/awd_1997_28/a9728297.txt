Abstract    :
              9728297  Finkelstein  The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulates many
              aspects of plant growth and development affecting crop productivity, including
              embryogenesis, water relations and tolerance of a variety of environmental
              stresses.  Our long term goal is to study the function and interaction of
              elements involved in responses to ABA.  Dr. Finkelstein has recently cloned a
              gene required for seed responses to ABA, AB14, and found it to encode a protein
              with homology to a class of transcription factors.  The experiments outlined in
              this proposal will characterize the location and timing of AB14 synthesis
              within the plant, its biochemical function, and investigate its interactions
              with other gene products in coordinating seed development.  Our hypothesis is
              that AB14 is a seed-specific member of a small family of transcription factors,
              at least one of which (AB14) participates in seed- and/or ABA-regulation of
              gene expression, possibly in combination with other transcription factors.  
              The PI expects these studies to have general relevance to understanding the
              activities of the other members of this gene family.  Furthermore, they may
              have practical significance for potential manipulation of seed nutritional and
              storage qualities.
