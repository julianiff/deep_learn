Abstract    :
                This three-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research on
              studies of   high-density quark and gluon systems, which are produced in
              high-energy hadronic and   heavy ion collisions.  The collaboration involves
              Alfred Mueller of Columbia University   and Dominique Schiff and Gregory
              Korchemsky of the University of Paris, Orsay.  The   investigators propose to
              study the interaction of very high-energy quarks with the dense   system in
              order to understand better the role of quark and gluon jets as probes of hot  
              quark-gluon plasma.  In the hadronic case, they will study how unitarity comes
              about in   high-energy, hard collisions.  The US investigator brings to this
              collaboration expertise on high-energy interaction of   particles in nuclei. 
              This is complemented by French expertise in finite temperature QCD   (quantum
              chrome dynamics), probes of quark-gluon plasma, and high-energy scattering.   
              The project will advance fundamental understanding in theoretical, high-energy,
              particle   physics.
