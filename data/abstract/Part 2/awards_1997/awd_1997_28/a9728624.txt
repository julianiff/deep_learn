Abstract    :
              9728624  Spilhaus    This meeting will explore current multidisciplinary
              methodologies for assessing the impact of non-point source (NPS) pollutants
              upon soil and groundwater resources.  The meeting will encourage interaction
              between the disciplines of spatial statistics/geostatistics, remote sensing,
              geographic  information systems (GIS) and solute transport modeling to enhance
              the development of techniques for the measurement, assessment, and modeling of
              NPS pollutants in the Vaduz zone and in subsurface waters.
