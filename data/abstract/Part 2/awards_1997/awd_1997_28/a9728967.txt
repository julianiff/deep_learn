Abstract    :
              ENG-9728967  Rosenberg, Allison  This award is in support of a two-day workshop,
              conducted as a joint undertaking by the Government-University-Industry Research
              Roundtable (GUIRR) and the Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy
              (COSEPUP), will examine the primary stumbling blocks to effective partnering
              between research organizations in the university, industry, and government
              sectors. The workshop will utilize a case study approach to feature real
              examples of institutional experience.  The objectives of the workshop are to
              identify the most destabilizing factors (operational, cultural, or otherwise)
              impeding collaborative research across sectors, and to explore and disseminate
              information about constructive and practical approaches to solving those
              problems.
