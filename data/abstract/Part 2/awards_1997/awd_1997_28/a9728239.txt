Abstract    :
              Ray   9728239        The gene SHORT INTEGUMENT (SIN1) is an important regulator
              of reproductive and vegetative morphogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. Mutations
              in this gene cause uncoordinated morphogenesis of ovule integument cells, cause
              a heterochronic shift in the program of meristem fate change, and, so far
              uniquely in plants, produce a pronounced maternal-effect disruption of
              embryonic pattern formation. These preliminary studies indicate that SIN1 plays
              an important role in cell fate specification. We have now proposed two models
              that address the mechanism by which SIN1 controls meristem fate. Here we
              propose to:    I.    Clone the SIN 1 gene and determine its sequence.    II.   
              Test genetic models of how SIN1 regulates flowering time by continuing our
              analysis of the effects of sin1 mutation on functions of the meristem identity
              genes APETALA2, and LEAFY, as far as possible during this funding period.   
              Commitment to inflorescence development is the first important step towards
              reproductive development in flowering plants. The last important step
              constitutes fertilization and embryo development which occur within the ovules.
              The preliminary work described here has established a genetic connection
              between the earliest and the last steps in plant reproduction. The studies
              proposed here investigate the mechanisms behind this connection.
