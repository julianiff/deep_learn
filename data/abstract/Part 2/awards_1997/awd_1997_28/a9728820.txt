Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT      OPP-9728820  OSHERENKO, GAIL  DARTMOUTH COLLEGE    This award
              supports an international workshop on reindeer/caribou grazing systems,
              particularly the impact on large-scale development of ecosystems and human
              systems.  The proposal will bring together natural and social scientists
              working on arctic grazing systems, residents of the Arctic who are dependent on
              the sustainability of arctic grazing systems, and policy makers involved in
              resource management within the Arctic.  The results of the workshop are
              important for understanding the potential effects on resident subsistence
              communities from global changes that could potentially affect grazing
              populations.
