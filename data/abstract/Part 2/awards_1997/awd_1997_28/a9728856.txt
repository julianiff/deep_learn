Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    Chemical and biological oceanographers have long puzzled over the 
              source  of  nutrients, especially nitrogen, to primary production  in  the 
              central ocean gyres.  In the case of the  central  North  Pacific,  some
              believe that nitrogen fixing bacteria may  be  the  answer  while a smaller
              group believes that advection of nitrogen  from other parts of the basin is
              more likely.  In this small  but  clever  study, the principal investigator and
              a group of students  from   the   University  of  Washington  will  combine 
              spatially  continuous chemical and hydrographic measurements taken  underway 
              on  a  cruise from Washington to Hawaii to estimate how important  horizontal
              transport from the North American shelf to  the  basin  interior can be
              expected to be.  This will be the first time that  a  horizontal profile of
              sufficient resolution has been  made  to  allow  assessment  of  the importance
              of  margin-to-central  gyre  transport of nutrients.
