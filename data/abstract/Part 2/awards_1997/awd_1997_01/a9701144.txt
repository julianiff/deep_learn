Abstract    :
              Shpectorov, 97-0114      The principal investigator will study affinization as
              applied to dual polar  spaces. This process produces a large variety of
              interesting geometries with almost  classical diagrams. There are many nice
              examples including several geometries of  sporadic simple groups. The principal
              investigator proposes find all the most  symmetric --flag-transitive-- affine
              dual polar spaces.    The field of group theory is the mathematical theory of
              symmetry and interacts with  many other disciplines,  for example physics and
              chemistry outside of mathematics,  coding theory, number theory and geometry
              inside mathematics.The investigator?s  particular area is finite groups and
              geometries.  It is an  old subject but  still  facing great unsolved problems
              and with many opportunities for breakthroughs.
