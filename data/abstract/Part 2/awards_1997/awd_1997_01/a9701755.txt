Abstract    :
              Thurston  9701755    This award provides core support to the Mathematical
              Sciences Research Institute located in Berkeley, California.  The fundamental
              goal of the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) is to stimulate
              research in the mathematical sciences by bringing together, in a
              programmatically focused scientific environment, the top mathematical
              scientists, nationally and internationally, in given research subjects.  The
              interaction of senior and mid-level scholars and the very best postdoctoral
              fellows in a given field produces a stimulating  environment where new ideas
              can be exploited and developed. The training of postdoctoral researchers is a
              priority of MSRI, and the scientific structure and budgetary allocations of
              funds reflect this.  Normally, two academic-year scientific research programs
              take place each year.  In addition to these academic year programs, MSRI
              conducts workshops and conferences.  MSRI also supports summer research and
              training programs for graduate students. Programs are scheduled that reflect
              timely research interest and opportunities for cross-programmatic collaboration
              and scientific exchange.
