Abstract    :
              Knowledge-based   learning  environments   can   provide   highly  customized
              problem-solving experiences that are tailored  to  the  individual  needs  of 
              each student.  This  project  creates  the  technology  for  a  new  generation
              of  knowledge-based  learning  environments  by  developing  real-time 
              multimedia   explanation  generators   with   animated  pedagogical  agents.   
              Prominently  featured  in  learning environments, animated pedagogical  agents 
              can  observe  students'  progress,  provide  them  with  visually 
              contextualized  problem-solving  advice,  and  play  a   powerful  motivational
               role.   The project has three  major  thrusts:  (1)  developing   a  
              computational  model  of  real-time   multimedia  explanation   planning   for 
              dynamically   creating   customized  multimedia explanations; (2) developing a
              computational model  of  animated   pedagogical  agents;  and  (3)  conducting 
               empirical  evaluations of the pedagogical effectiveness of these models.  In 
              addition,  the  project also develops a teaching  laboratory  for  multimedia 
              technology  and  initiates  a  new  multidisciplinary  course on
              Knowledge-Based Multimedia Learning Environments.  This  work  significantly
              advances the state-of-the-art  in  knowledge-  based   learning  environments 
              and  human-computer  interaction.  Coupled  with  rapid advances in affordable
              multimedia  hardware,  the  successful deployment of these technologies will
              have a deep  and  lasting  impact  on students at all  levels.   By  achieving 
              significant  gains in learning effectiveness, these  technologies  will  bring
              about fundamental improvements in both the  classroom  and the workplace on a
              broad scale.
