Abstract    :
              9701899  Goldstein  This proposed research focuses on the consequences and
              implications of leaf level  nutrient limitation to photosynthesis, forest
              growth, and ecosystem processes caused by  nitrogen versus phosphorus, the two
              most widespread and important limiting nutrients. The researchers   propose to
              determine the consequences and implications of leaf level N versus P limitation
               in a very well-defined and constrained age sequence of sites in the Hawaiian
              Islands. The  sites are all natural forests dominated by a single tree species,
              with remarkably constant  environmental conditions, along which experiments
              have demonstrated that N limits  production in young sites, and P limits the
              oldest site. Long-term fertilizer experiments  are ongoing in these sites, so
              we can evaluate both nutrient-limited plots and the  consequences of removing
              limitation by N or P. Results from this study will both augment and be
              integrated with investigations of belowground processes, stand-level
              characteristics, and ecosystem-level nutrient cycling to better understand
              tropical forest dynamics. Such information will have substantial implications
              for both the responsiveness of forests to change, and the restoration and
              management of forest ecosystems.
