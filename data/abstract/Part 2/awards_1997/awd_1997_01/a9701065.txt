Abstract    :
                      9701065  Sin      This award provides funding for a research project
              that lies at the intersection of three areas, modular representations of finite
              groups, finite projective geometry and the theory  of designs and their codes.
              Under this project, Sin will try to on the one hand build a general framework
              in which techniques of representation theory and group cohomology can be
              applied to attack combinatorial problems about codes and geometries, while on
              the other hand he will study how the latter areas may provide a more geometric
              viewpoint in representation theory. The successful outcome of this research
              should lead to new methods and results in all three theories and, above all, to
              a cross-fertilization of ideas among them.      This research is in the general
              area of Combinatorics. One of the goals of  Combinatorics is to find efficient
              methods of studying how discrete collections  of objects can be arranged. The
              behavior of discrete systems is extremely  important to modern communications.
              For example, the design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone
              systems, and the design of algorithms in  computer science deal with discrete
              sets of objects, and this makes use of  combinatorial research.
