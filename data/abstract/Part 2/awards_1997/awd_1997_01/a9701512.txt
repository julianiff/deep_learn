Abstract    :
              Dobbin  9701512    This Doctoral Dissertation research examines the diffusion of
              work and family policies in U.S. organizations between 1960 and 1996.  It
              focuses on three questions: (1) Which employers provide work/family benefits?,
              (2) Why do organizations adopt work/family policies? and (3) What are the
              implications of work/family policies for redefining gender relations and
              restructuring work life?  This project investigates work/family policies
              related to maternity leave, parental and family leaves, childcare and elder
              care programs and flexibility about the timing and location of work. 
              Historical data will be collected by surveying a stratified random sample of
              profit, non-profit, and public sector organizations to get information on their
              personnel practices.   Additional data on why organizations adopt work/family
              policies will be collected from personnel management literature and
              organizational documents (e.g., personnel manuals, press releases, work/family
              brochures) to determine how work/family policies affect organizations' social
              construction of gender and their understanding of the boundaries between work
              and family.  ****     ??
