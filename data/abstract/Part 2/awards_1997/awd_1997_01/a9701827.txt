Abstract    :
                  This award supports a two day conference in February 1997 entitled,
              "Capturing Internet History".  The purpose of the conference is to begin
              recording the creation and development of the Internet through oral and written
              histories from the people involved.  A plan for recognizing and recording
              significant future events also will result.  MCI, Microsoft and NSF are
              contributing approximately equally to the conference.
