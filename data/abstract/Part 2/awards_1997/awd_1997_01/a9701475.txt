Abstract    :
              Parallel computing is becoming increasingly important to scientific advancement 
              and economic development.  For parallel computation to succeed we need to build
               machines that deliver high performance on real-world applications.  This
              project  attempts to measure application performance on networks of
              workstations and to  implement applications to tolerate the high latencies in
              such networks. The  initial applications under study come from computational
              biology and from  geographic information systems.  The integration of software,
              architectural, and  applications topics will be emphasized both in research and
              in courses developed  in this project.
