Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT, Lepowsky      Lepowsky plans to continue his investigations of the
              algebraic and  geometric features of vertex operator algebra theory and
              conformal  field theory, and to apply this work to a range of problems.  He
              will  continue to collaborate with Yi-Zhi Huang on their theory of vertex 
              tensor categories, with applications to algebraic, topological and  geometric
              questions, including questions associated with the  remarkable phenomena known
              as ``monstrous moonshine.''  He will also  pursue connections between vertex
              operator algebra theory and both  algebraic geometry and number theory.    In
              recent years, there has been a great deal of progress on a range of 
              mathematical theories related to string theory in theoretical physics.  This
              project focuses on vertex operator algebra theory, which provides  the
              algebraic basis of conformal quantum field theory, a foundation of  string
              theory.  The mathematical theory has its own motivations and  points of view,
              sometimes directly related to physical structures and  sometimes not.  In the
              project, basic problems on the algebra and  geometry of vertex operator algebra
              theory will be addressed, and the  results will be applied to problems in
              algebra, geometry, number  theory and finite group theory.
