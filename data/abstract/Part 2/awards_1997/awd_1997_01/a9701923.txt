Abstract    :
              Career:  This research is designed to address two major problem areas in
              managing infrastructure deterioration, renewal, and rehabilitation.  First,
              environmental laws are changing faster than we can design and construct
              infrastructure systems.  Second, because of these rapid changes, there is a
              critical need for assessment technologies to evaluate economically `smart`
              infrastructure alternatives that can sustain changes in environmental laws
              through its life cycle.  The ultimate goal of the research is to use the
              proposed `sick building` application as a first to develop an innovative
              methodology that could give engineers and policy makers the support system that
              will provide infrastructure planners a fundamental assessment technology to
              quantitatively evaluate current and future infrastructure systems in light of
              scientific, social political (national versus local), fiscal, and environmental
              constraints.  The objective of this research is to develop an integrated
              quantitative and qualitative life cycle cost analysis assessment technology for
              cost benefit evaluation of `sick building` renewal and rehabilitation within
              environmental compliance constraints.
