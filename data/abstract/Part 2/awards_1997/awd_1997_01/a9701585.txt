Abstract    :
              9701585  McAdam    This Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement grant
              examines three questions regarding student activism: (1) How have levels of
              student activism varied over time, and what accounts for this variation?; (2)
              Why does protest activity occur on some campuses and not others?; (3) and What
              is the relationship between student protest and protest activity at the
              national level?  Student protests that occurred between 1930 and 1990 will be
              investigated using data from student newspapers at forty-eight U.S. colleges. 
              Data on relevant covariates of protest will be gathered from archival sources. 
              Event history methods, which take into account the timing of events, will be
              the primary method of analysis.  The data gathered will be used to empirically
              test theoretical propositions regarding the location and levels of student
              protest over time, which will enable the investigator to refine social movement
              theory. This research will also increase our understanding of how social
              movements shape U.S. college campuses and society at large.  ****   ??
