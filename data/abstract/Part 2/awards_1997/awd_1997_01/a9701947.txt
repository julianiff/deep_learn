Abstract    :
              Abstract  Proposal: CMS97-01947  PI: Nazli Yesiller: Wayne State University   
              "Nondestructive Evaluation of Geomembranes"    The objective of this study is
              to develop nondestructive  testing techniques to characterize geomembranes and
              to  determine the physical, mechanical, and degradation  properties both in the
              laboratory and field.  Basic  correlations will be established between NDT
              parameters,  material properties, and microstructure of geomembranes.  NDT
              methods provide fast, simple, and sensitive testing  alternatives to
              conventional testing methods, and the tests  can be performed in the field
              without disturbing in-place  geomembranes.  The NDT methods proposed for use in
              this  study include liquid penetrant inspection and ultrasonic  testing.    The
              experience gained in the research component of this work  will be used to add a
              laboratory session to an existing  design-oriented geosynthetics course.  The
              testing methods  developed in the study will be used for demonstrations in 
              Landfill Design and Civil Engineering Materials courses.    ***
