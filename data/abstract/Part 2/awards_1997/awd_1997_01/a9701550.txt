Abstract    :
              9701550  Sevov    The  research goals of this project are to synthesize and 
              modify  novel  classes of materials to include the metal-borate-phosphate  and 
              metal-borate-phosphonate systems, to study  their  structure  and  
              structure-property  relations,  and   to   evaluate   their  electrooptical,  
              magnetic   and   catalytic   properties.    The  educational  goals  are  to
              introduce solid-state  and  materials  chemistry experiments into an
              undergraduate laboratory course for  seniors,  and  developing  a graduate and 
              undergraduate  lecture  course on topics in contemporary chemistry of materials
              issues.  %%%  This well integrated research and education program combines in a
               very  unique  way an emphasis on the synthesis, characterization,  and 
              structure-property relations of novel  materials  exhibiting  functional
              materials properties of interest to applications areas  such  as  catalysis, 
              and  magnetic  and  optical  materials  for  devices.    Integrating  these 
              current  high-priority  materials  research  challenges  with  the educational 
              curriculum  of  this  CAREER  Program results in the training of students in 
              areas  of  growing relevancy thereby advancing science and technology  while 
              improving job prospects for students.  ***
