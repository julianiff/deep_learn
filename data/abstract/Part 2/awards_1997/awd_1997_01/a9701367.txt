Abstract    :
              9701367  Ruggie    While much research to date examines the process of
              immigration to the U.S. and the reasons for immigrating, little attention has
              been paid to the tranformative impact of immigration on American society in
              cities where immigrants are concentrated.  This research explores the
              relationship between an increasingly plentiful supply of immigrant domestic
              workers upon American family structure and the employment patterns of native,
              middle-class women.  Specifically, it is hypothesized that by expanding the
              domestic service labor force, female immigration has encouraged growth in labor
              force participation by native, middle-class women in cities with high
              immigration rates.  Current models which seek to explain female labor supply
              and the gendered division of household labor do not account for the local
              prevalence of domestic service employment, although much anecdotal evidence
              indicates it is a critical factor.  By identifying historical trends in female
              labor supply and immigration across U.S. cities, the dynamics of this
              relationship, and its association with other facts, will be explored.  In
              addition, ethnographic interviews with employer households and immigrant
              domestics in a low- and high-immigration city will illuminate the mechanisms
              through which supply and demand for domestic labor articulated.  Data from U.S.
              Census tapes and publications will be analyzed along with data from 60
              interviews with housecleaners and babysitters in New York City and
              Philadelphia.  ****
