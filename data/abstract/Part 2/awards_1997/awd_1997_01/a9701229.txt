Abstract    :
                  This research in the laboratory of  Professor Jeff C. Curtis at the  
              University of San Francisco is funded under the RUI program by the   Inorganic,
              Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program.    Proton-coupled electron
              transfer reactions with low driving forces will   be studied in order to
              determine whether H-bonded intermediates   accelerate the movement of the
              electron from reductant to oxidant.    Details of other effects including
              isotopic substitution, driving force   and solvent will be determined in order
              to learn more about the mechanism   of proton coupled electron transfer. 
              Theoretical calculations will also   be performed to establish the electronic
              structure of the H-bonded   intermediates.       Proton-coupled redox reactions
              are important in catalytic   transformations and in biological electron
              transfer.  A simple reaction   of this type will be studied in order to
              determine its major features.
