Abstract    :
              The  objective of this research is the development of methods for  the  
              automatic  recognition  of  American  Sign  Language  (ASL)  utterances using
              as input the 3D shape and motion parameters of a  subject's  face, hands and
              arm.  These parameters  are  extracted  based  on the use of computer vision
              techniques on relevant image  sequences. The novel aspects of this research
              are: 1) use  of  3D  information  from  the vision-based analysis  of  the 
              data  that  consists  of the three-dimensional hand, arm and face  shape  and 
              motion,  2)  use of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to recognize  the  ASL 
              structure  at multiple levels, and 3) coupling  of  computer  vision  and  HMMs
              to go beyond the limitations of  both  computer  vision  and HMMs. Novel
              computer vision methods will be developed  based on the use of deformable
              models, visual cues, and knowledge  of anthropometry to allow the accurate
              tracking of a human's face  and  upper  limbs. The 3D output from the vision
              system  will  be  used  as  input  to the HMM for ASL recognition. To  improve 
              the  robustness of the system, research on feedback mechanisms between  the 
              computer vision system and the HMMs will also be  conducted.  The final goal of
              this research is to demonstrate the feasibility  of  building  an  automated
              robust system with  high  recognition  accuracy (recovery of sign sequences at
              the sign level)  that  is  capable  of handling the inflectional and
              derivational properties  of ASL in a systematic way.
