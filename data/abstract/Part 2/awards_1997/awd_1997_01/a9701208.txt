Abstract    :
              9701208  Clark     This award will provide funds for travel materials and
              supplies to enhance the dissertation research of Ms. Maureen Kearney, a
              doctoral student at George Washington University who is working under the
              supervision of Dr. James Clark.  Ms. Kearney's dissertation research involves a
              higher-level phylogenetic analysis of the Order Amphisbaenia, a group of highly
              specialized, limbless, burrowing reptiles that spend their entire life in
              underground tunnels.  Osteological characters will be examined from fossil and
              Recent forms primarily to: (i) identify monophyletic taxa within Amphisbaenia;
              and (ii) ascertain patterns and directions of divergence in morphological
              characters.  The research also seeks to identify effects of different
              character-coding approaches on phylogenetics analysis and explore theoretical
              issues associated with missing data in phylogenetic reconstruction.  
              Ultimately, the study will lead to a phylogenetic hypothesis of Amphisnaenia
              that will test previous taxonomies (leading to an improved classification),
              elucidate patterns of structural diversification, and contribute to systematic
              theory and methodology.  Support for training of graduate students in modern
              technologies is critical to maintain the workforce of scientists capable of
              addressing questions and issues in global biology.
