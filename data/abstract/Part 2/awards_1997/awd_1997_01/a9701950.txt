Abstract    :
              ATM-9701950  Minghua Zhang  SUNY-Stony Brook  Title:  Developing Data Products
              from Field Experiments to  Interface with Physical Parameterizations in GCMs.  
               An innovative approach will be used in this proposal to develop,  from four
              field experimental data sets, data that can be used to  evaluate GCM physical
              parametrization in stand alone mode.  The  data include grid-scale vertical
              velocity and adjective tendencies  that are required to force (or drive) GCM
              parameterizations in  stand alone mode.  This approach has the potential to
              meet the  accuracy requirements for the generated data to be used for such 
              testing.  An educational component to develop several short and  quantitative
              courses for undergraduate students is also include in  the proposal.
