Abstract    :
              9701995  Anastasio      The project will be conducted as part of  the NSF CAREER
              Program.  For his scientific research component, the investigator will study in
              situ photochemical mechanisms involving oxidation of halide compounds found as
              tropospheric aerosol particles.  Photochemical oxidant formation is known to
              occur in continental tropospheric aerosols, fog and cloud drops, and in marine
              waters.  However, the reaction mechanisms of halide oxidation are not well
              characterized.  These reactions are potentially important for the geochemical
              cycles of chlorine and bromine compounds present in the marine boundary layer. 
              Growing evidence has shown that these cycles include the oxidation of chloride
              and bromide in deliquescent aerosol species (such as HOX and X2, where X = Cl
              or Br).   These photoactive compounds can partition into the gas phase and
              photolyze to form Cl* and Br* radicals and as a result, can have important
              impacts on climate  (e.g. through the oxidation dimethyl sulfide) and on the
              concentrations of tropospheric ozone (e.g. through catalytic destruction).   On
              the educational plan, the investigator will develop graduate and undergraduate
              courses in atmospheric chemistry. The research project itself will involve
              undergraduate and graduate students and will be an early research opportunity
              and training experience.  Also, the investigator will broaden instructional and
              research activities relating to atmospheric chemistry topics to include other
              departments within the university.
