Abstract: This project consists of two loosely connected parts. The
              
first is to study invariant differential operators and spherical 
functions
              on multiplicity free representations. One obtains 
Capelli-type identities
              which lead to a new kind of symmetric 
polynomials. The second part is to
              study Weyl groups for Hamiltonian 
manifolds. This might lead to a proof of
              the Delzant conjecture 
concerning the classification of multiplicity free
              Hamiltonian 
manifolds. A further goal is to begin a systematic study of
              
Hamiltonian algebraic varieties.

The background of the project is the
              study of highly symmetric spaces 
like spheres or hyperbolic spaces. It is
              known that a significant part 
of the geometry of these spaces is described by
              a certain finite group 
of internal symmetries, called the little Weyl group.
              The aim of the 
project is to investigate two different aspects of the little
              Weyl 
group. The first is its influence on invariant differential operators
              
which in certain cases lead to beautiful identities generalizing those
              
found by Capelli in the 19th century. The second aim is to study the 
little
              Weyl group of Hamiltonian manifolds. These manifolds arise 
naturally if one
              formalizes symmetry of a classical mechanical system, 
like a top or a
              planetary system.
