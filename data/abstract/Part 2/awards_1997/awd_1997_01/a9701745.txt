Abstract    :
              9701745  CARLSON    Snails placed in the subfamily Nassariinae represent a
              significant portion of present-day snail diversity.  Hundreds of living species
              are known; in addition, hundreds of species appear in a fossil record of at
              least 60 million years in age.  The geneaology (phylogenetic history) of
              nassariine gastropods is not well understood, despite the large number of
              species and significant fossil record.  One approach to resolving this
              phylogenetic history includes using data from both living and fossil species in
              a single analysis.  However, the data from fossils are more incomplete than the
              data from living snails, and this relative incompleteness has caused problems. 
              Consequently, fossil data have previously not been included in phylogenetic
              history reconstructions based on extant species.    In this research, Sandra
              Carlson and doctoral candidate David Haasl will reconstruct the phylogenetic
              history or family tree of the subfamily Nassariinae, combining both an analysis
              of shell and anatomical traits and a comparative analysis of the fossil history
              of nassariine species.  Representatives of each major nassariine group will be
              obtained from museum collections and examined for informative shell traits. 
              Anatomical traits of  representative species will be obtained from the
              literature and from dissections of specimens.  The oldest fossil occurrence of
              each major group will be noted.  The usefulness of combining fossil data with a
              trait-based analysis will be tested by comparing trees constructed both with
              and without the inclusion of temporal fossil data.
