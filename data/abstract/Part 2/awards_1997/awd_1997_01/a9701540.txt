Abstract    :
              9701540  R. Baker Kearfott      During the past two decades, understanding of
              singularities, bifurcations  and related phenomena, and relevance to the
              physical world have increased.  At the same time, tools for bounding
              discretization and roundoff error have  improved, to allow automatic result
              verification based on classical  fixed point theory.  Traditionally, such
              verification proceeds by   linearization, then bounding with interval
              arithmetic.  However, in  methods developed to date, existence and uniqueness
              verification   necessarily must fail when the system is singular at solutions. 
              Goals  of this project are to (1) develop new, simple and natural modifications
               to existing verification techniques, to prove existence and uniqueness  when
              the nonlinear system is singular; (2) investigate the power of  the resulting
              tools, first for finite-dimensional problems (algebraic  systems), then for
              infinite-dimensional problems (differential and  integral equations); (3)
              increase understanding of singularities.      Many complex systems throughout
              the sciences and engineering, ranging from  load-bearing civil engineering
              structures to ecological systems to  human heart rythms,  are modeled by sets
              of nonlinear equations that   exhibit singularities and bifurcations.  Such
              bifurcations correspond   to changes in behavior  as conditions (the load, a
              temperature, etc.) change.  Understanding of such phenomena has blossomed in
              recent years, but analytical  problems remain.  This study will provide tools
              to enable an efficient and  automated, yet mathematically airtight analysis. 
              This in turn will  lead to more predictability in the physical world.
