Abstract    :
              Florence Thomas, PI        This program combines research in biomechanics with
              an  education component  linking public, K-12, undergraduate, and graduate
              education.  The research  addresses how the morphology of the predominate
              organisms in  a community  affects biological processes at the scale of the
              whole  community rather than  the scale of the individual.  Rates of nutrient
              uptake by  whole communities,  that vary in flexibility and morphology, will be
              measured  over a range of  water velocity in a research flume.  Comparisons of
              measured  uptake rates  with those calculated using empirically derived
              equations,  describing mass  transfer to non-biotic surfaces, will be made to 
              parameterize mass transfer  relationships for biotic surfaces. The results can
              be  applied to other  problems concerning rates of transport within
              communities,  such as feeding,  fertilization success, and the transport of
              other dissolved  compounds such  as pollutants. The education component of the
              program  includes: 1) the  development of an interactive display in a public
              aquarium  to interpret  flume experiments for visitors and K-12 education
              programs;  2) research  fellowships for minority students; and 3) incorporation
              of  biomechanics/hydrodynamics  into undergraduate courses.
