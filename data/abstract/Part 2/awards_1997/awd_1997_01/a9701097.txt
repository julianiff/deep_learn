Abstract    :
                  9701097  Meagher  Insects can cause positive and negative selection on
              flowering plants through their contrasting roles as pollinators and predators. 
              This project addresses selection pressures placed on Silene latifolia (white
              campion) flowers by moths of the Hadena genus, which are pollinators and seed
              predators.  The relative importance of Hadena moths as pollinators will be
              assessed for white campion growing in its native Spanish environment.  Positive
              effects will be evaluated by reconstructing pollination events using genetic
              paternity analysis.  Negative effects will be evaluated by investigating seed
              predation.  Both positive and negative impacts of moth visitation will be
              analyzed in relation to flower size, which is important for moth attraction. 
              Long-term effects of predation will be investigated by analyzing variation
              among populations in flower size in relation to observed current predation
              rates.  This system provides a rare opportunity to study an interaction between
              two species that involves both positive and negative selection.  Seed predation
              is also a major issue in agricultural systems, where pollination is desirable
              but the attraction of seed predators is not.
