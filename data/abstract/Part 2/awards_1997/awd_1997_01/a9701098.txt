Abstract    :
                  9701098  Charlesworth  Sex determination in many species is controlled by a
              special pair of chromosomes, the X and Y chromosomes.  The Y chromosome usually
              has few active genes.  In some species, "neo-sex chromosomes" have been formed
              by the fusion of an X or Y chromosome to a regular chromosome, causing this
              chromosome to be transmitted in the same way as the true sex chromosomes.  This
              allows study of the forces responsible for the degeneration of the Y
              chromosome.  The fruitfly Drosophila miranda is a classic example, in which
              some of the genes on the neo-Y chromosome have degenerated.  Different
              processes that might be responsible for degeneration have different
              consequences for the patterns of between- and within-species variation of neo-Y
              chromosome genes.  The DNA sequences of neo-Y chromosome genes will be obtained
              from different individuals of D. miranda, and from its relative D.
              pseudoobscura, in order to find out which processes are occurring.  This work
              will illuminate the origin of the basic features of sex chromosomes, and
              enhance knowledge of the genetic mechanisms controlling variation in DNA
              sequences.  Since sex chromosomes play an important role in human genetic
              diseases, the results will aid our understanding of these diseases.
