Abstract    :
              9701793  Washington  The primary goal of this work is the development of a novel
              class of aperture antennas capable of variable directivity (beam steering) and
              power density (variable focusing or beam shaping).  The actuation for these
              antennas is employed using a distinct mechanism.  The mechanism employs
              Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) film bonded to a lightweight metalized mylar
              structure.  Since the film is piezoelectric, any electrical voltage drop across
              the film will cause the film to lengthen in its stretch direction.  The
              resulting lateral deflection from a length change causes the production of a
              moment which causes the antenna surface deflection.  In addition, the
              educational aspects of this proposal can be summarized in three distinct task:
              The first involves the development of hands-on demonstrations that highlight
              major principles of mechanical, electrical, and electromechanical systems.  The
              second involves the use of an interactive web site with hypertexted class notes
              to enable one to teach at level more in-depth than general classroom knowledge.
               The final component is the development of an interactive slide presentation
              that highlights the contribution of African Americans, Hispanics, and Women to
              engineering and science.  ***
