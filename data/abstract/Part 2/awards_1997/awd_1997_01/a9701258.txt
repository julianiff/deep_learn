Abstract    :
                9701258  Dissertation Research: Selection on Male Ornaments Through  Male-Male
              Competition    Natural selection of ornaments in males have received 
              considerable attention.  Most recent attention, however, has  focused on the
              role of female preference for male ornaments.  One model regarding how such
              traits and preferences can  begin to co-evolve is pre-existing bias. According
              to models  of pre-existing bias, female preference predates the trait.  The
              reasons such biases may exist are numerous, such as, a  bias may be related to
              some other context (i.e. feeding) or  to some means of nonspecific evaluation
              or due to some bias  that no longer extant.  Any trait that arises that can
              take  advantage of such a bias would be selected.  Though such  biases are
              demonstrated in females of many species,  contributing to the exaggerated and
              maintenance of male  traits, it has not been examined whether males may also
              have  such biases.  This study will examine whether the males of  one group may
              have pre-existing biases (in addition to the  females) which has contributed to
              the exaggeration of a  sexually selected trait.  Intra-sexual selection due to
              pre  existing biases may play an important role in the  exaggeration of male
              traits, but have not been previously  examined.  Positive results from the
              proposed work would  suggest that students of sexual selection should reexamine
               the role of male-male competition in the evolution of male  traits.
