Abstract    :
                  9701330  Rausher  The response of plants to herbivory has long been of
              interest to biologists.  The majority of work in this area has focused on how
              plants defend themselves against herbivores - plant "resistance".  However,
              plants may also tolerate herbivory (i.e. minimize the effect that herbivory has
              on productivity).  Although plant tolerance to herbivore damage may
              dramatically alter how biologists think about plant-herbivore interactions,
              little is known about the ecology or genetics of  tolerance.  We will use field
              experiments and quantitative genetics to study the tolerance of the common
              morning glory, Ipomoea purpurea, to three types of herbivore damage. 
              Specifically, we will i) measure genetic variation for tolerance,  ii)
              characterize the genetic relationship between tolerance and other ecologically
              important traits, including resistance, and iii) measure the relationship
              between tolerance and plant productivity.          The study of plant tolerance
              to herbivory may have important implications for agriculture.  Herbivores are a
              major problem in modern agriculture leading to loss of productivity and
              requiring large inputs of expensive and environmentally harmful pesticides. 
              Developing strains of crop plants that are more tolerant of herbivory may
              minimize the need to eliminate herbivore   pests and therefore may contribute
              to more economically and environmentally sustainable agriculture.  This study
              will provide important information on the genetics and ecology of tolerance
              which will be necessary for evaluating the role that plant tolerance may have
              in agricultural systems.
