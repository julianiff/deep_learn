Abstract    :
              9701642  Wang  A CAREER award supports studies of heavily loaded conformal 
              contact tribological machine elements.  An integrated 
              theoretical-numerical-experimental approach will be used  with emphasis on the
              mixed lubrication and boundary  lubrications regimes and on failure
              transitions.  The  ultimate goal is to develop accurate models of performance 
              in conformal contacts for use in design of advanced machine  elements of this
              type.  The educational component of the  award focusses on stimulating the
              student's creativity and  self-motivated activities by integrating
              fundamentals,  design, and career development.  ***
