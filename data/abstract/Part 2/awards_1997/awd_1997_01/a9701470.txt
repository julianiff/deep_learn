               ABSTRACT      Proposal No:   CTS-9701470    Proposal Type:  CAREER  Principal
              Investigator: Edward J. Maginn  Affiliation:   University of Notre Dame     
              This CAREER grant is awarded through the Interfacial, Transport and Separations
              Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division. The Principal
              Investigator is Dr. Edward J. Maginn of the University of Notre Dame. A
              research program will be developed that utilizes molecular simulations and
              theory in tandem with laboratory experiments to rationally design molecular
              sieve membranes for separation and catalytic applications. The program will
              demonstrate that molecular modeling can be used effectively as a screening tool
              which reduces the number of experiments required in searching for optimal
              material performance and operating conditions and as an interpretive tool that
              enables researchers to better explain experimental results and develop
              predictive models.     The  application of molecular design principles; to
              engineering problems is crucial in the industries served by chemical
              engineering. Society increasingly demands products having very specific
              properties and compositions. This is most easily seen in the burgeoning
              pharmaceutical, specialty chemicals and advanced materials industries. Society
              also demands that the processes which make these products have minimal
              environmental impact. To meet these needs, the discipline of chemical
              engineering must respond by developing molecular design and engineering
              capabilities that enable precise control over material properties and
              manufacturing processes. This can only come from understanding the way micro
              and mesoscopic variables, which can now be tailored, affect macroscopic
              performance. The work proposed seeks to provide educational and research
              capabilities that can be used to meet this growing need.
