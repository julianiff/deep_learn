Abstract    :
                          This is a proposal to adapt a TRW off-the-shelf software system 
              architecture to address two goals of the GGCM project: to flexibly  integrate
              multiple modules and to provide a 'user friendly'  interface to magnetospheric
              research community.  An open  architecture that is accessable to support the
              wide variety of  users in the magnetospheric research community is a
              fundamental  requirement.
