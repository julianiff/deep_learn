Abstract    :
              9701834  Shepherd  This research planning grant will put in place the 
              foundations for developing a knowledge-based model to  evaluate the
              effectiveness and reliability of water shortage  response plans during a
              drought.  It will follow a threepart  research strategy to : a) formalize the
              expertise of water  agency personnel to evaluate drought response strategies;
              b)  determine the timing and phasing of drought response plans  to minimize
              adverse impacts from water shortages; and c)  develop a knowledge-based model
              for testing and refining  plans for drought and water shortages. The expected
              products  include new methods for evaluating and improving drought  response
              plans, a peer-reviewed journal article and the  preparation and submission of a
              full proposal to NSF.  ***
