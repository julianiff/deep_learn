              Prober  This experimental research project focuses on electron noise  and 
              correlations in phase-coherent nanostructures. These studies will  explore  how
              electrons interact with their environment  and  will  provide  new  information
              on the effects of  electron  phase  and  correlations.  The  noise studies will
              be  carried  in  diffusive  microbridges  and quantum point contacts, in the
              frequency  range  of  0.1  to  20GHz.  Phase coherent transport,  sub-Poisson 
              shot  noise, and noise of superconductor-normal metal contacts may also  be 
              studied. Quantum limits on the spectral distribution  of  the  noise with
              frequency will also be investigated.  %%%  This research project involves
              experimentally studies the origins  and  limits on noise in nanometer-scale
              electron devices used  to  detect  radiation, emphasizing the 0.1 to 20GHz
              frequency  range.  Applications  of such detectors include radio astronomy and
              radar  receivers.  The  novelty  of the research  is  in  its  focus  on 
              nanometer  scale  devices  where quantum  behavior  of  electrons  becomes 
              important. In these circumstances the  understanding  of  noise   effects   is 
               incomplete,   both   experimentally    and  theoretically. Results from this
              research may include unusual new  effects  or  detector devices which may find
              new  application  in  technology. This research project is interdisciplinary in
               nature  and involves both graduate and undergraduate students who will be 
              excellently trained to enter positions in industry, government or  education.
