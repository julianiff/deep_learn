Abstract    :
                  9701114  Charlesworth  Genetic material is exchanged between maternally and
              paternally derived homologous chromosomes, by the process of crossing over. 
              The level of within-species variability in the DNA sequence of a gene is
              related to the frequency with which the gene experiences crossing over.  
              Chromosome four of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster lacks crossing over,
              and its genes show little variability.  This provides an opportunity to test
              two major hypotheses about the relation between crossing over and variability. 
              Under the first hypothesis, variability is eliminated in the absence of
              crossing over because a selectively favorable variant drags all genes on the
              chromosome along with it, as it spreads through the species.  Restoration of
              variability depends on new mutations, which are necessarily rare.  Under the
              second hypothesis, variability is reduced because selection continually
              eliminates harmful mutations all along the chromosome; the relative abundance
              of rare versus common variants should be little affected.  These hypotheses
              will be tested by examining the proportions of rare versus common variants at
              genes on this chromosome, using DNA sequencing technology.  This research will
              shed light on the genetic mechanisms affecting diversity levels in natural
              populations.  This has broad implications for conservation biology and the
              genetics of human variation, as well as for knowledge of fundamental biological
              processes.
