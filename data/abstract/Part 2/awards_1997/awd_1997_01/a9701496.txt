Abstract    :
              9701496  Foland  This project involves a collaborative, multi-faceted, and
              multi-disciplinary investigation of compositional and other factors governing
              Ar retention, Ar closure temperature, and 40Ar/39Ar cooling ages in natural
              amphiboles and micas.   The fundamental research objectives are to: (1)
              determine the compositional dependence of Ar retentivity within dioctahedral
              and trioctahedral micas and common amphiboles; (2) examine the role of grain
              boundaries and sub-grain domains on Ar retentivity; (3) examine the diffusion
              geometry or anisotropy of Ar in these minerals; (4) test rigorously the
              ionic-porosity model for Ar retention, and secondarily for Sr and Ca; (5)
              refine our basic understanding of the crystallographic factors influencing Ar
              transport and closure temperatures, and (6) add to existing knowledge of
              cooling history in selected orogenic terranes.  The field aspect of the
              proposed work will be focussed in the Adirondack Mountains, NY, and the Black
              Hills, SD.
