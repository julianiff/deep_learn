Abstract    :
              9701765  Robertson  While the loss of organic carbon and nitrogen via soluble
              forms has implications both for source and sink ecosystems, the extent and
              magnitude of fluxes are poorly known. Preliminary data from a range of
              ecosystems in an agricultural landscape in southwest Michigan suggest that
              fluxes of dissolved organic nitrogen can be quite significant. A review of the
              literature on leaching of soluble organic carbon and nitrogen, primarily
              studied in forests, suggests only abiotic controls. Several biotic controls are
              proposed here, given their large effect on the abiotic controls shown to
              significantly affect leaching of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen(DOM). To
              better understand controls, an idea of the source of the leached DOM is
              critical. This study proposes a two tiered approach to looking at both aspects.
              A broad study of different ecosystems along a successional gradient and an
              intense study using isotopic tracers on the sources of leached DOM in one
              ecosystem. It is hypothesized that those factors which influence hydraulic flux
              will have the greatest effect on the mass loss of C and N through leached
              organic forms.
