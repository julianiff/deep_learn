Abstract    :
              9701493  Rohe      This Dissertation Research Improvement project examines the
              effect of residential location on the social networks of people who live in
              scattered-site and clustered public housing.  This work will provide insight
              into how housing density affects social networks.  Two research questions will
              be addressed-- (1) do the social networks of low-income people living in
              predominantly low-income neighborhoods differ from those of low-income people
              living in more affluent neighborhoods; and (1) if differences in social
              networks exist, are they associated with a differential access to opportunity? 
                Data will be collected by in-person interviews with 270 public housing
              residents living in two different types of housing in Montgomery County,
              Maryland.  Specifically, this research will compare 148 residents who live in
              low income housing developments with 122 who live in units scattered throughout
              more affluent areas.  This research addresses a gap in current knowledge about
              social networks of low income individuals; bridges the neighborhood effects and
              social networks literatures, suggesting that neighborhood and social networks
              together impact an individual's live chances; and  examines assumptions
              undergirding an U.S. housing policy initiative that places low-income people in
              more affluent communities to provide them with social and economic opportunity.
