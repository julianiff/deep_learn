Abstract    :
                This proposal will focus on the coordinated and integrated use of  space-based
              (the ISTP constellation of satellites) and ground-based  measurements of
              ionospheric emissions and electrodynamics to  investigate substorm onset and
              evolution.  The PI will continue to  act as the GEM liaison to the NASA GGS
              program to foster  collaboration and to note times for which the satellite and
              ground  station locations are most optimum to address particular  objectives. 
              The work here is focused toward the Tail/Substorm  Campaign of GEM.
