Abstract    :
              This project is investigating applications of dihedral sequence comparison 
              (DISCO) to protein structure comparison and protein folding problems.  DISCO 
              transforms atomic coordinates into one-dimensional dihedral sequences, then 
              applies the BioSCAN sequence alignment computer to find segments with similar 
              three-dimensional folds.  The goals of the DISCO project include:  (1)
              exploring  new algorithms and representations of the three-dimensional
              structures of folded  proteins by one-dimensional sequences; (2) exploring the
              use of the BioSCAN  system to compare these sequences; (3) developing
              statistically-based scores for  measuring the structural similarity of folded
              protein segments by comparing their  dihedral sequences; (4) developing a
              robust computational system based on BioSCAN  for protein structure analysis;
              and (5) making the DISCO system available over  the Internet to the scientific
              community.
