Abstract    :
              9701453  Pollack    This  is  a  Woman  Career Advancement Award to study  the 
              dielectric  properties of proteins.  The  goal  of these experiments is to
              study the important problems  of  protein shape (conformation) and protein
              folding, the process by which  a  linear  chain  of amino acids assumes the
              shape  which  allows  the  protein  to  perform its specific function. Folding 
              intermediates  of  proteins   will  be  studied  with  different  techniques,  
              such   as  measurements  of the dielectric constant  of a protein  solution. 
              The  dielectric constant is a measure of the distribution of charge  within 
              the  macromolecule and changes as the protein folds. Membrane proteins  will
              also be studied.  %%%  This  is  a  Woman  Career Advancement Award to study 
              the  dielectric  properties of proteins.  Proteins  are  large molecules that
              consist of a long chain  of  amino  acids. The molecule  'folds' itself  into 
              a  specific shape that dictates its function. The goal of  these  experiments
              is to gain insight into the important problems of  protein  shape 
              (conformation) and protein folding. Different techniques,  such  as  a 
              detailed  measurements  of the  distribution  of  positive  and  negative
              charges in the molecule,  can  yield new information about the forces that
              cause the protein  to  fold in a unique way.  Different  types of proteins will
              be studied, including  the important  class of proteins that cross membranes.
