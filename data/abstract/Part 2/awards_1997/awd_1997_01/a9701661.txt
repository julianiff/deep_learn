Abstract    :
              9701661  Ridgeway      Existing theory on group processes provides a clear
              description of how cultural status beliefs determine the power and prestige of
              actors performing collective task.  Yet there has been very little theorizing
              and research on the role of status processes during individual tasks.  This
              research proposes to test how status characteristics (e.g., gender) affects
              performance on a test.  Specifically, this Doctoral Dissertation Research
              Improvement proposal investigates whether/how the presence of same and opposite
              gender research subjects affects undergraduates' performance on ten questions
              taken from the Graduate Record Examination.  Performance will be recorded for
              twenty subjects under each of six conditions.  The conditions include: 1) male
              respondent believes himself to be alone; 2) female respondents believes herself
              to be alone; females respondent hears but does not see another respondent and
              is able to infer from voice that the other respondent is: 3) same sex; 4)
              other-sex; male respondent hears but does not see another respondent and is
              able to infer from voice that the other is: 5) same sex; 6) other-sex. 
              Analysis consists of comparisons among combination of respondents in the six
              conditions on mean performance scores, proportion correct, and time spent on
              each item.  This research proposes to contribute to our understanding of the
              relation between cultural status dimensions and goal-directed behavior, and
              offer insight into why particular social groups are differentially responsive
              to social performance cues in evaluative settings.     ****  ??
