Abstract    :
              9701614  Yuh  Our primary research objective is to investigate and develop 
              intelligent control strategies for underwater robotic  vehicles (URVs) with
              manipulator workpackages.  The motion  of the manipulator, which is attached to
              the vehicle's main  body, affects the motion of the vehicle, whose dynamics are
               also subject to parameter uncertainties, changes in payload  and environment,
              and nonlinear behavior.  It is necessary to  develop an intelligent control
              system for such vehicles to  provide:       automatic compensation for the
              errors of the vehicle    motion, due to manipulator motion and underwater
              currents.       coordinated control of both vehicle and manipulator    using
              deliberate vehicle motion; such motion will help task    performance and add
              the degrees of freedom of the vehicle to    those of the manipulator
              workpackage;       learning and adaptation capabilities to parameter   
              uncertainties and changes in the environment; and       close coupling of
              control knowledge transfer between  the high-level and low-level subsystems of
              the overall URV  control system.    The study:       extends a theoretical
              modeling of the underwater    robotic vehicle and manipulator, including
              dynamic    interaction between links and vehicle main body, kinematic   
              redundancy, contact stability of the system in contact with    the environment,
              and fixtureless manipulation;       develops a theoretical framework for
              intelligent    control strategies based on fuzzy neural network (FNN)   
              control using fuzzy clustering techniques and on-line    reinforcement learning
              technique; and       includes experimental demonstration of the proposed   
              approach on the University of Hawaii's underwater robotic    vehicle, ODIN
              (Omni-Directional Intelligent Navigator).  ***
