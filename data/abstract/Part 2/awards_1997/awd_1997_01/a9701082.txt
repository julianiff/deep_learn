Abstract    :
              Spring  9701082    The lubber grasshopper can take noxious chemicals (including 
              herbicides) from its diet and store them in its body. The  composition and
              quantities of these sequestered chemicals  depends on the internal,
              physiological capabilities of an  individual grasshopper. These qequestrative
              abilities, and  the compositions of secretions, vary greatly among 
              individuals. This physiological variation can be  characterized by isolating
              segments of the grasshopper gut.  Further, when attacked by predators, the
              grasshoppers  secrete the noxious chemicals as a deterrent. The PI can  perform
              experiments using collected secretion and live ants  to test the defensive
              efficacy of specific secretion  samples. This provides us with a system to
              examine the role  of internal, physiological variations on an animal's 
              interactions with other organisms. One of the chemicals that  lubber
              grasshoppers sequester from their diet is the common  herbicide
              2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-D). This herbicide is  commercially available in
              radioactive form, making it  relatively easy to detect and measure in the
              defensive  secretion. The PIs can measure the amount of 2,4-D in the  secretion
              of individual grasshoppers, and then test the  relative level of ant deterrence
              for each secretion sample.  Thus, we can not only measure the internal,
              physiological  variation in the uptake of 2,4-D but also characterize the  role
              of that variation in ecological interactions.
