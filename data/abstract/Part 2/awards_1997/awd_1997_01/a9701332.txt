Abstract    :
              9701332  Lewis  While biodiversity continues to be the focus of many ecological
              studies and  conservation efforts, its relation to ecosystem function remains
              unresolved. The literature  provides examples of both interdependence and
              independence between biodiversity and  functioning of ecosystems. The purpose
              of this project is to test three hypotheses, as  follows: (1) a given biotic
              compartment in an incrementally stressed ecosystem will show  suppression of
              biodiversity first, and suppression of biomass subsequently; (2) suppression 
              of ecosystem function is primarily related to suppression of biomass, rather
              than to  biodiversity per se; and (3) suppression of biomass differs among
              biotic compartments  according to a predictable series of thresholds:
              multicellular organisms < unicellular  autotrophs < microbial decomposers.
              These hypotheses will be tested on a group of  streams, some of which have been
              stressed by acidic mine drainage. These streams are  excellent model systems
              because they include a wide gradient of multiple stresses (low pH,  high
              concentration of metals, oxide deposition), each of which is quantifiable.
              Pilot  studies on these streams are consistent with the three hypotheses. The
              project will focus  on expansion of the information on benthic insects and
              periphyton as necessary to test the  hypotheses, and use of molecular
              techniques to obtain comparable information on  microbial decomposer
              compartments.
