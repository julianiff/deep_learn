Abstract    :
                                      ABSTRACT       The Principal Investigators propose to
              conduct an experimental study of forced convective boiling flow through
              channels that are of millimeters in height.  The flow will be hydrodynamically
              and thermally developing.  Heat transfer data will be collected for
              single-phase flow, boiling incipience, and conditions leading up to the
              critical heat flux.  A liquid crystal thermograph developed for a previous pool
              boiling study will be used to obtain temperature profiles for the entire heated
              section of the test channel.  The liquid crystal data will provide
              spatiotemporal information concerning the development of the boiling front. 
              Based on the experimental data, correlations for heat transfer in the different
              flow regimes will be developed.
