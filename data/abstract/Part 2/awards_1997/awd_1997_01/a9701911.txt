Abstract    :
              DNA computing is a new interdisciplinary research area that  bridges the gap
              between computer science and biochemistry.  The  potential strength of DNA
              computing lies in the high memory  capacity of DNA molecules and the intrinsic
              massive parallelism  of biochemical operations.  In 1994, it was demonstrated
              that it  is possible to engage DNA in combinatorial computation through 
              well-established biochemical techniques.  The ultimate goal of  this four-year
              project is to establish the foundations of DNA  computing while tackling
              important issues through research and  education activities.  The following
              topics are investigated:  Establishing theoretical models for  DNA computing.
              Development  of computational models, data structures and high-level 
              operations for DNA Computing. Development of a complexity theory  for DNA
              computing.  including trade-offs among resources and  reducibility. 
              Development of DNA computers algorithms that are  more efficient than
              algorithms on existing computers. Educational  plan:  An interdisciplinary
              undergraduate course on DNA  computing.  The course will be teamtaught.  The
              objective of the  course is to introduce students to the basic principles of
              liquid-  phase DNA chemistry and to the relevant notions in computer  science. 
              In the last third of the course, students will be  divided into teams to work
              on team projects based on research  related problems.
