Abstract    :
              9701767  Tenore    Support from NSF will augment funds from  the Luso-American  
              Foundation (FLAD), and the Portuguese National Science   Organization (JNICT)
              to encourage interaction among U.S. and   Portuguese marine scientists sharing
              mutual research interests on   coastal oceanographic processes characteristic
              of the land-sea   interface that significantly influence productivity of
              coastal   marine environments.  The project builds on previous work to  
              encourage the Portuguese to develop a rigorous research framework   and
              structure collaborative activities along the lines of    NSF-funded LMER (Land
              Margin Ecosystems Research) projects.   Collaborative US - Portuguese research
              efforts have centered on   developing methodologies to characterize and
              quantify land use   patterns, coastal habitats, and available data on
              hydrographic   patterns and biota of the Portuguese LMER sites. Results from
              this   project will form the basis for prioritizing specific research  
              projects to further the knowledge of coastal marine science in   Portugal.
