Abstract    :
              9701299  Pringle  Tropical streams are typically characterized by an abundance
              of omnivorous fishes and shrimps; however little is known about the relative
              roles of these macroconsumers in structuring stream communities. These species
              typically have migratory life cycles, inhabiting both lowlands and headwaters
              during their lifetime. High levels of water withdrawal from lower stream
              reaches are resulting in direct mortality of these biota and changes in their
              distribution and abundance. Proposed research will determine the effects of
              fishes and shrimps on benthic community structure along the continuum of the
              Rio Espiritu Santo in northeastern Puerto Rico.  In this study, the following
              questions will be addressed: (1) Do omnivorous fishes and shrimps significantly
              affect patterns of sediment accrual (i.e. the benthic depositional
              environment)?; (2) Do trophic cascades occur when omnivorous fishes and shrimps
              are excluded? and (3) How do effects of fishes and shrimps vary along the
              stream continuum? Effects of fishes and shrimps on insects, algal resources,
              and sediment accrual will be experimentally examined by manipulating their
              presence and absence at three sites along the river continuum using an in situ
              electric exclosure technique. Proposed research will provide information on the
              role of omnivory in structuring a tropical stream community and will expand our
              previous studies of effects of fishes and shrimps on leaf decomposition to
              include their effects on primary producers, sedimentation, and community
              structure along the river continuum. This research will also enhance our
              ability to predict how these threatened stream ecosystems respond to
              anthropogenic disturbance.
