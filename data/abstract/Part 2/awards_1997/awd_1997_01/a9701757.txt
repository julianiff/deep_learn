Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT      OPP-9701757    Key, Jeffrey   Boston University     This research
              project is a key component of a large, coordinated, multi-investigator program,
              Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean.  The research program will be
              conducted for 14 months from a ship frozen into the ice pack. These
              investigators will measure atmospheric conditions of the permanent ice cap of
              the Arctic Ocean from a scientifically instrumented C-130 aircraft during the
              Spring and Fall in conjunction with a NASA research program jointly conducted
              at the site. These researchers will determine the flux of incoming heat
              radiating onto the ice floe as a function of changing cloud conditions. Their
              results will help determine how atmospheric heating is coupled to adsorption of
              heat by the ice. These measurements are critical to understanding how heat is
              reflected or absorbed by the ice as it melts in the summer and thickens in the
              winter in response to seasonal variations in climate. The aircraft measurement
              program makes an essential contribution to the SHEBA team of researchers who
              will measure atmospheric variables with a large array of instruments on the ice
              floe and aircraft flying above as well as ice and ocean property measurements
              made on and below the ice floe. The combined set of measurements in SHEBA will
              allow refinement of climate models for the Arctic region. Those improved models
              will lead to better predictions of the climate and the permanence of the Arctic
              ice cap under a proposed global warming that could occur if atmospheric carbon
              dioxide levels are increased above present levels.
