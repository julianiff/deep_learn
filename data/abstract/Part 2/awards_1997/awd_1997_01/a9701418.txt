Abstract    :
              9701418  Partial evaluation is an automatic tool for program  specialization,
              customization, and optimization.  The goal  of this project is to establish
              partial evaluation  technology as the key component of a new methodology for 
              constructing and customizing adaptable software written in  modern imperative
              programming languages.  Despite successful  applications, current partial
              evaluation technology is  unable to satisfactorily treat modern imperative
              languages  that include object-oriented, multitasking, and exception-  handling
              features.  Moreover, partial-evaluator construction  does not begin to approach
              the maturity of compiler  construction where well-organized tools sets
              dramatically  ease the burden of designing, building, and modifying  systems. 
              The project focuses on the construction of a  language-independent tool set for
              building partial  evaluation systems that can handle features found in modern 
              imperative languages.  This tool set will be built on top of  the IRIS language
              processing facilities developed in the  Arcadia project. The core of the tool
              set will be a general-  purpose specialization environment for Ada 95.  The
              tool set  philosophy will be validated by reusing artifacts in  (a)  the
              construction of a special-purpose specializer for one or  more application
              domains, and  (b) the construction of a  second general-purpose specializer for
              a minimal core of a  second language supported by the IRIS tools.  ***
