Abstract    :
              9701739  Palloni    This Doctoral Dissertation project examines the relationship
              between the family structure of Cuban-Americans and their economic and social
              adjustment in the United States.  Previous research on immigration adaptation
              and acculturation has focused on characteristics o the economic and social
              environment which immigrants encounter upon arrival, on the individual
              characteristics of immigrants, and on the receptivity of the host country.  An
              important element that has been overlooked in these studies has been the role
              that the family and household arrangements of immigrants play in their social
              and economic adaptation to a new environment.  Of particular interest is
              whether living arrangements and family structure is a result of certain
              'survival strategies' pursued by immigrants as a result of precarious
              conditions or if they are cultural related.  Cuban-Americans will be studied
              because much has been written about their relative socioeconomic success
              relative to other immigrant groups.  The project will use three data sources: 
              microfiles of three U.S. censuses (1970, 1980, and 1990), published tabulations
              of Cuban censuses, and a purposive survey of Cuban business owners and their
              employees in the Miami Metropolitan area.  The census data will be used to
              describe the living arrangements of Cuban-Americans relative to those of
              Anglo-Americans at three points in time.  Additionally, household and
              demographic characteristics of Cubans living in the U.S. will be compared to
              those living in Cuba (prior to and after the 1959 revolution). Finally, a
              survey of business owners and their employees will be conducted to address
              questions that cannot be answered using cross-sectional census data.   ****
