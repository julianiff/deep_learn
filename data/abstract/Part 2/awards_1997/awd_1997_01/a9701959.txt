Abstract    :
              9701959  Hodgson    Economic time series models can often be reduced to a
              sequence of uncorrelated innovations that may be characterized by complicated
              forms of dependence, heterogeneity, and non-Gaussianity (i.e., non-normality)
              that are difficult to model.  Despite long-standing awareness of this fact, the
              range of econometric methodologies currently used by empirical researchers
              rarely extends much beyond maximum likelihood techniques that assume these
              innovations to be Gaussian, such as ordinary least squares.  The objective of
              the project is to facilitate the extensions of this range through the
              development of adaptive maximum likelihood techniques and semiparametric
              efficient estimators applicable in many modeling contexts of interest to
              financial and macroeconomics, and through the development of a software package
              implementing these techniques.    The educational component of this CAREER
              award provides graduate students training in adaptive estimation techniques as
              part of the syllabi of advanced graduate level courses on either nonparametric
              econometric techniques, theory of efficient estimation, applied time series
              econometrics, or applied financial econometrics.   Graduate students will also
              be trained in the use of the software developed under this project.      .
