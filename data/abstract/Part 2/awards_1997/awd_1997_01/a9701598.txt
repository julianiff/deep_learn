Abstract    :
                          Seymour  9701598    This project encompasses three lines of research
              in graph theory. (1) To design a fast algorithm to test if a directed graph has
              a circuit of even length.  this is a well-known open problem, with a number of
              algebraic ramifications.  At the time of this writing, the investigator, Neil
              Robertson and Robin Thomas have made substantial progress with it, but further
              development is necessary. (2) To develop a theory of digraph minors, parallel
              to the highly successful theory of graph minors; this is made approachable now
              because of the recent solution of the Galllai-Younger conjecture.   The
              ``undirected'' theory has led to numerous results and algorithms of wide
              interest and applicability, and the investigator believes that similar success
              with the ``directed'' theory.  (3) To complete work on solving Tutte's
              conjectured extension of the four-colour theorem.  A group of researchers,
              including the PI, has found a new proof of the four-colour theorem itself, and
              they have reduced Tutte's conjecture to a form which can probably be proved by
              modifying this new proof.    This research is in the general area of
              Combinatorics. One of the goals of  Combinatorics is to find efficient methods
              of studying how discrete collections  of objects can be arranged. The behavior
              of discrete systems is extremely  important to modern communications. For
              example, the design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone
              systems, and the design of algorithms in  computer science deal with discrete
              sets of objects, and this makes use of  combinatorial research.
