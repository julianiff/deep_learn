Abstract    :
              9701347  Rieseberg   Graduate student Richard Noyes, under the direction of
              Prof. Loren Rieseberg at Indiana University, is studying the phylogenetic
              relationships of representatives of the c. 500 species of the sunflower
              subtribe Conyzinae, including Erigeron (fleabanes) and Conyza (horseweeds).
              Presumed to have originated in South America and spread northward, the
              Conyzinae appear instead to be a Nopth American group of sunflowers in origin,
              based on preliminary DNA sequence evidence from these researchers, which have
              spread southward and to other continents, in part as weeds that set seed
              without fertilization (a condition named agamospermy--dandelions being the
              better known example). Additional field collecting of samples, followed by
              molecular sequencing of a nuclear gene (ribosomal ITS regions) and a
              chloroplast gene (ndhF) and further study of traditional morphological
              characters, are tasks that will lead to phylogenetic reconstructions for the
              group. In turn, that genealogical framework facilitates the determination of
              geographical migrations and tracks in the evolution of these plants, and of the
              number of origins of the agamospermous condition.   A well supported phylogeny
              of the fleabanes and their relatives, for the Americas and Africa, will improve
              classification of the group and provide reliable markers for identification.
              Also, studies can then progress on the ecological conditions favoring the
              origin of agamospermy, a peculiar asexual mode of seed production known in
              several lineages of the large sunflower family.
