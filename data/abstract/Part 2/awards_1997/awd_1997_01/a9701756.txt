Abstract    :
                      An International Workshop will be held from February 28 - March 02, 1997
              in Columbus, Ohio, to review the current state of knowledge, and to identify
              important unanswered questions and problems, relating to the flow and behavior
              of tidewater glaciers.  About 25 participants are expected , representing the
              various disciplines involved in research on tidewater glaciers.  On the basis
              of discussions held during the Workshop, a report summarizing recommendations
              for future research will be produced.
