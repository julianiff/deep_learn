Abstract    :
              9701282  Fuerst     This award will provide funds for materials and supplies to
              enhance the dissertation research of Jeannette Krieger, a doctoral student at
              Ohio State University working under the supervision of Dr. Paul Fuerst.  Ms.
              Krieger's dissertation research involves a study of intraindividual DNA
              sequence variation (i.e., among individuals) in the nuclear-encoded, 18S
              ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene among species of sturgeon from North America. 
              Sturgeons belong to an ancient group of fish whose origins date at least to the
              Jurassic.  Phylogenetic relationships among species of sturgeons are not well
              known, and may species currently are threatened or endangered.  The nuclear
              genome of sturgeons appears to have undergone repeated cycles of duplication. 
              Tandemly-repeated DNA sequences such as the ribosomal genes, however, are
              thought to evolve as a unit because of a phenomenon named "concerted evolution"
              (also called "meiotic drive").  This project is designed to: (i) characterize
              the degree of intraindividual and interindividual variation in 18S rRNA gene
              sequences in nine sturgeon species; (ii) determine whether all rRNA gene
              variants are actively transcribed; and (iii) localize (via in-situ
              hybridization) all identified rRNA gene variants to specific homologous and
              non-homologous chromosomes.  Characterization of variation in the 18S rRNA gene
              (at all hierarchical levels) will help determine the utility of these sequences
              in phylogenetic inference.  Data obtained also will be paramount in testing
              various hypotheses (model) regarding patterns of concerted evolution.  Support
              for training of graduate students in modern technologies is critical to
              maintain the workforce of scientists capable of addressing questions and issues
              in glo`al biology.
