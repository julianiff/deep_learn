Abstract    :
              9701768  Manga    This proposal describes long-term educational and related
              research activities in the area of geological and environmental fluid
              mechanics.  A set of undergraduate courses will be developed to replace the
              standard piece-meal and phenomenological teaching of the subject with an
              inductive approach; classes will focus on a set of hands-on active-learning
              laboratory experiments which emphasize the process of discovery.  A set of
              graduate classes will also be developed which focus on interdisciplinary
              collaborative research projects, with an emphasis on interactive learning and
              communication.    A set of complementary research activities will address
              problems in hydrology, geodynamics and volcanology.  This work will involve the
              same combination of theoretical and experimental approaches that will be used
              in the classroom.  Specific research problems include studying the hydrology of
              spring-dominated streams in the Oregon Cascades (research will be integrated
              into a summer field school), characterizing the dynamics and rheolgy of bubby
              magmas and lavas, developing pore length-scale models of multiphase flow in
              porous materials in order to understand macroscopic properties of such flows,
              and relating the chemical evolution of the Earth's mantle to dynamic processes.
               Despite the wide range of these research problems, they all share a common
              feature, namely, the application of quantitative methods in fluid mechanics to
              problems in the geological and environmental sciences.  It is anticipated that
              much of the material for lab exercises and graduate classes will be provided by
              these research problems, and that the development of lab exercises will in tern
              provide inspiration for new research directions.
