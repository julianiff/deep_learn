Abstract    :
              Fast networks have made it possible to aggregate distributed CPU, memory,
              storage, and data to provide the potential for application performance superior
              to that attainable on any single system.  However, achieving performance on
              these metacomputing systems has proven difficult.  Currently, application
              developers use customized application schedules to achieve performance on a
              metacomputer.  Such schedules are based on a prediction of how the application
              will execute, given its resource requirements, the performance capabilities of
              the system resources, and the time-varying contention effects caused by
              competing applications executing on the metacomputer.  This project's goal is
              to use the application-centric scheduling paradigm that is emerging from the
              practices of metacomputing applications developers as the basis for scheduling
              software which promotes application performance on metacomputing systems.  To
              do this, the PIs will design and implement application-centric scheduling
              agents - called AppLeS (Application Level Scheduler) agents - for individual
              metacomputing applications.  AppLeS agents will schedule the components of an
              individual parallel application on a non-dedicated system according to the
              dynamically changing performance each resource can deliver.
