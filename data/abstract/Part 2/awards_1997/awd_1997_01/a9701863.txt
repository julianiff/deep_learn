Abstract    :
              PI: Jim Hensley  Over the Top in TEaMS ( OTT) blends the efforts of an urban 
              school district and an array of partners in a long-range  project to
              significantly increase minority enrollments and  success rates in courses
              comprising the science,  mathematics, engineering, technology (SMET) pipeline. 
              The  Kansas City, Kansas Public Schools (KCKPS) is a minority  majority school
              district in the Kansas city Metroplex.  68%  of the students are minority, 54%
              being African American.  KCKPS students scored well below national averages on
              the  1996 MAT-7 and ACT.  Of 225 students in Algebra I at grade  8, only 15%
              were African American males.  OTT will double  minority enrollment in advanced
              math/science classes, double  minority enrollment in AP/IB science/math
              classes, increase  minority enrollment in grade 8 Algebra I to 75%, prepare all
               students for success in Algebra II, prepare all students for  success in
              Chemistry I, significantly raise average minority  math/science scores on
              national achievement tests and state  assessments, complete a revised
              math/science curriculum that  reflects NTSA/NCTM standards, increase teacher
              knowledge and  use of research based teaching tools, and increase student 
              interest level and student confidence in science/math.  KCKPS will implement a
              set of interventions  intended to eliminate barriers and build  capacity toward
              minority quccess in SMET  pipeline courses.  These interventions include: 
              math/science curriculum reform and improvement  of K-8 science/math curriculum
              resources,  intensive staff development enrichment programs  outside the school
              day(summer, after school,  Saturday), tutoring programs, providing teacher 
              leaders in math/science at each school,  creating community partnerships for
              mentor  support, and developing counselors as pumps for  minority students into
              the SMET pipeline.
