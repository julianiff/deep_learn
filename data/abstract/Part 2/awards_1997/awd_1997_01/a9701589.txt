Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT   Malikov 97-01589      The three topics of the proposal are:
              Harish-Chandra bimodules over affine Lie  algebras, localization of admissible
              representations to the moduli of vector bundles and  a  Lie algebra of the
              group of homeomorphisms of the circle.  The main tools to be employed are the
              Bernstein-Beilinson technique of localization of g-modules and related  ideas
              originating in modern physics, for example Kazhdan-Lusztig tensoring and vertex
              operator algebras    The last decade has seen a spectacular interplay of ideas
              coming from quantum physics  and mathematics. This proposal is about the fusion
              of these ideas. The results might find  application in conformal field theory,
              representation theory, geometry and low dimensional  topology.
