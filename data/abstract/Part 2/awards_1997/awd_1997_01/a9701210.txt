Abstract    :
              9701210  Friedman   Graduate student Sandra Floyd, under the direction of
              advisor Dr. William Friedman at the University of Colorado, is conducting
              intensive studies of the anatomy and development of plant embryos in several
              species of putatively primitive flowering plants, to document cellular events
              leading to double fertilization and the formation of (usually triploid)
              endosperm in these exemplars of ancient angiosperms. Flowering plants, or
              angiosperms, are distinguished from other vascular and seed plants by a series
              of seemingly unique fertilization events, leading to the formation of the plant
              embryo with surrounding nutrient tissue called endosperm. Pioneering
              microscopic research by Dr. Friedman, using powerful microspectrofluorometric
              measurements of DNA content in cells, has demonstrated similar events in seed
              development in the peculiar gymnosperms of the order Gnetales. Ms. Floyd is
              extending the research program to basal lineages of angiosperms, to explore the
              cellular details of anatomy and development involved in the evolution of early
              angiosperm embryos.   Fine-scale morphological or ultrastructural characters of
              embryo development in primitive groups of angiosperms hold promise of helping
              to resolve the phylogenetic relationships among early lineages of flowering
              plants, a question still unanswered in light of DNA sequence data accumulating
              for many of these plants. Access to the specialized equipment and skills needed
              for this kind of research are significant attributes of this doctoral
              dissertation improvement grant.
