Abstract    :
              This proposal will develop quanitative global maps of the  distribution of high
              latitude field-aligned currents parameterized  by IMF orientation and strength,
              and by season.  This will be the  first investigation to revisit this issue
              since the original maps  were produced from TRIAD data over 20 years ago.  Much
              has been  learned since that time and the data will be treated more correctly 
              in terms of binning.  In addition, a new analysis technique will be  utilized
              which consideres both horizontal components of the  magnetic perturbation
              observed at the satellite,  This will allow  a relaxation of the assumption of
              the "infinite current sheet"  model for the interpretation of the data.
