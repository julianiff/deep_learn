Abstract    :
              9701488  Wang    This project examines the structure and magnetic properties  of
              epitaxial Co/Cu/Co trilayers and Co OwiresO prepared by  molecular beam epitaxy
              (MBE).  The Co and trilayer films are  grown on flat and vicinal (step bunched)
              silicon (111)  surfaces, respectively.  The parameters describing the 
              interface roughness and mixing of these Co nanostructures  are determined
              quantitatively in situ from the angular  profile measurement of diffraction
              beams using high  resolution, low energy electron diffraction complemented 
              with scanning electron microscopy.  The coercivity, magnetic  anistropy,
              exchange coupling, magneto resistance, and  magnetic inhomogeneity are obtained
              in situ from the surface  magneto-optic Kerr effect (SMOKE), ferromagnetic
              resonance,  and the Van der Pauw method.  Atomic force microscopy and  magnetic
              force microscopy provide important information on  morphology and magnetic
              domain wall structures.  In addition  the temperature dependence and magnetic
              stability of these  nanostructures are studied.  %%%  The quantitative
              relationship between interface roughness  and magneto resistance and magnetic
              exchange coupling and  their temperature dependence will permit an optimization
              of  the trilayer that has the largest and thermally stable  magneto resistance
              at very low magnetic fields.  Such  materials have applications in magnetic
              read heads for  ultrahigh density hard disk drives.  ***
