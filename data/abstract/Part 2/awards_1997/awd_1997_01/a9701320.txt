Abstract    :
              9701320  Coley  The relationships between plants and their pathogens are not
              well understood, yet these systems present fascinating questions which bear
              upon fundamental issues of evolutionary ecology. This research will address one
              such topic, the maintenance of resistance and virulence polymorphisms.  This
              study will undertake an integrated investigation of various hypotheses for the
              maintenance of polymorphism in the native wild sunflower (Helianthus annuus)
              and its fungal rust (Puccinia helianthi). First, a series of garden experiments
              will determine whether there are detectable fitness costs associated with
              bearing unnecessary resistance or virulence alleles. Such costs might balance
              the benefits of resistance or virulence, resulting in polymorphic populations.
              In addition, both direct and indirect fitness benefits of resistance will be
              examined in natural populations. A frequency-dependent advantage for rare
              resistance or virulence genotypes might also be important to the maintenance of
              polymorphism, and a controlled garden experiment will be performed to test this
              hypothesis. Finally, surveys of natural populations in Utah will compare
              polymorphism in areas favorable or unfavorable for the rust, and will examine
              polymorphism in populations of differing sizes and degrees of isolation.  The
              proposed research will critically test a variety of hypotheses for the
              maintenance of virulence and resistance polymorphisms, and will make a valuable
              contribution to our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of natural
              plant-pathogen systems.
