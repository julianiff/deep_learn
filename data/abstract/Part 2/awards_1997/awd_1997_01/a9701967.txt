Abstract    :
              9701967  Akylas    Internal gravity waves are of considerable geophysical
              interest:    large-amplitude internal wave disturbances frequently occur in the
              ocean   thermocline both in deep water and in coastal regions, as well as in
              the   lower atmosphere.  This effort focuses on the dynamics of internal-wave  
              groups, particularly the coupling of the short-scale carrier   oscillations
              with the envelope of the group.  This is a fully nonlinear   mechanism that
              plays an important part in the generation of   gravity-capillary solitary waves
              on deep water and in the radiation of   oscillatory tails by nonlinear wave
              groups.  The main objective is to   understand this coupling mechanism in the
              context of stratified flows,   both from a physical and a mathematical point of
              view.    The results of this research effort are expected to be useful in  
              detecting and controlling the propagation of nonlinear wave disturbances   in
              various applications.  In the ocean environment, for instance,   knowledge of
              internal-wave activity is important in under-sea navigation   and in the design
              of deep-water offshore facilities.  In the atmosphere,   internal waves play an
              important part in the initiation and organization   of thunderstorm squall
              lines, the modulation of rainfall and the   dispersal of atmospheric
              pollutants.  Nonlinear pulses are also used in   high-speed transmission of
              data in optical fibers and in optical   switching devices; understanding the
              propagation characteristics of   nonlinear pulses is essential to the
              transmission of noise-free signals   over long distances.
