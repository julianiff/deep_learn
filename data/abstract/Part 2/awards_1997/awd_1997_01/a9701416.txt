Abstract    :
              This research is on developing methodologies and tools for designing real-time 
              embedded systems with the goal of providing a tool environment to help
              designers  explore a vast design space and locate superior system architectural
               configurations. The approach is to work at the system level or processor level
               of abstraction and to formulate the problem as a multi-attribute optimization
              one  which captures various quality requirements in system design. Specific
              topics  being addressed are: 1. Evaluating timing performance through studying
              the  flexibility of a system configuration with respect to timing
              specifications, and  formulating metrics for estimating the flexibility of
              systems. 2. Developing an  interface tool for assisting system developers to
              specify value functions and  preferences. 3. Combining the imprecisely
              specified multi-attribute utility  theory with evolutionary algorithms to find
              optimal solutions for multiple  objective optimization problems.
