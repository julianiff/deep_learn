Abstract    :
              9701637  Wethington    This Doctoral Dissertation research examines the martial
              quality of interracial Asian-white couples.  The large number of interracial
              couples in the U.S. and the limited knowledge of these families prompted this
              study.   It is hypothesized that such interracial families may experience more
              stress and strain and may be at risk for higher marital instability and lower
              well-being than same-race families.  The major goal of this research is to
              complement and improve upon existing studies of interracial families. 
              Knowledge of the marital quality and consequences of such marriages may have
              important social implications.   Given that marital quality is highly
              predictive of divorce, this study will enhance our understanding of it in
              non-majority populations.  Research findings will permit a better accounting of
              positive benefits of public policies that affect the probability of divorce. 
              Data will be gathered from 3,000 Asians  and 500 whites from geographically
              diverse locations.  This will generate a finale sample of approximately  452
              couples (i.e.,140 Asian-white couples, 211 Asian couples, 99 whites couples and
              2 other white-minority unions)  Potential subjects will be contacted by mail
              and interested subjects will be asked to complete a self-administered mail
              survey which contains questions on marital quality, and perceived social
              integration and support.    ****
