Abstract    :
              9701973  Distributed object computing is a new computational paradigm  in which
              independent software objects interact with each  other over a distributed
              computing network. A key promise of  distributed object computing is that it
              may greatly simplify  the construction of distributed software systems.
              However,  it also introduces enormous problems in ensuring the  integrity of
              interactions between objects and the  reliability of system execution. The
              objective of this  research is to investigate mechanisms for ensuring the 
              integrity of the computational interactions in distributed  object systems. In
              particular, the design, implementation  and empirical evaluation of two classes
              of mechanisms are  investigated: (1) formal interface specifications, which 
              allow precise definition of object interface semantics and  provide a means for
              automatically checking conformance to  interface semantics during execution;
              and (2) methods for  systematically testing distributed object systems in a 
              minimally invasive manner. The significance of this research  is that it
              addresses those attributes of distributed object  systems that make them
              ill-suited to the use of traditional  software validation techniques. An
              additional objective of  this project is to enhance the software engineering 
              curriculum with content that teaches how the fundamental  tenets of software
              engineering both influence and are  influenced by the unique aspects of
              distributed object  technology.  ***
