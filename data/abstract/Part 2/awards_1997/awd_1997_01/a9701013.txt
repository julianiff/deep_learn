Abstract    :
              9701013  Gordon    This award supports a conference on the arithmetic and
              geometry of algebraic cycles.  As a subfield of algebraic geometry, the subject
              of algebraic cycles has thrived through its energetic interaction with
              algebraic K-theory, Hodge theory, arithmetic algebraic geometry, number theory,
              and topology.  The immense recent progress in algebraic cycles, based on so
              many interactions with so many other areas of mathematics, has made the subject
              less accessible to graduate students and non-specialists.  The goal of this
              conference is to have leading experts who study algebraic cycles from all these
              different directions speak on their various points of view, aiming their talks
              to graduate students, recent Ph.D.'s as well as to researchers who work in
              other aspects of the arithmetic or geometry of algebraic cycles.    Algebraic
              geometry has a long and important history in mathematics, particularly because
              it interacts with so many other fields of mathematics, such as topology,
              analysis, algebra, and number theory.  It has flourished during the last half
              of the twentieth century, especially in this country.  At its simplest and most
              fundamental level, algebraic geometry studies sets defined by polynomial
              equations. Such sets arise in many problems in computer science and robotics,
              and there is increasing interaction between algebraic geometry and these
              fields.
