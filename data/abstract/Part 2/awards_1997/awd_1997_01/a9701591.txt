Abstract    :
                  9701591  Palmer   Stream environments are difficult to fully understand
              because food and living space tend to be distributed in an uneven way, and
              animals move extensively within the environment.  These are factors which have
              lately received much attention separately, but not together.  In particular,
              many theoretical studies assume either that animals move at random, or that
              they have perfect knowledge of their environment, and thus can determine the
              best location to move to.  However, many animals do not fit these simplified
              ideas-they can control their movements to some extent but do not have extensive
              information about their environment.   The investigators will use computer
              models, with varying levels of biological realism, to determine how animals
              move within the uneven stream environment, and how their movement affects
              population sizes and stability.   They will also perform experiments in an
              artificial stream to determine how much control small stream invertebrates can
              exert over their movement in the face of flow.  The movement patterns and
              population levels of small stream invertebrates have important consequences for
              the stream environment, because they form the base of the stream food web and
              are involved in the microbial processes web as well.
