Abstract    :
              9701966  Wuthnow    In recent years there has been a renaissance in the
              sociological examination of cultural changes in society such as the increase in
              individualism at the expense of collectivism (e.g., Bellah et al., 1985) and in
              people's use of human centered over theistic legitimization for their actions
              (e.g., Hunter 1991).  However, in these studies society-wide level of analyses,
              macro-level explanations, and lack of comparable measurements of the past and
              present culture prevent deeper understanding of the processes underlying
              cultural change.  This  Doctoral Dissertation research investigates the
              micro-foundations of this broader cultural change through examining one limited
              public issue --the debates about the propriety of the genetic modifications of
              humans.  The primary data are from a systematic study of the printed debates on
              this topic from 1958 to present.  Specifically, a sample of all books, book
              chapters, and articles produced on this subject will be analyzed using the
              citation study method.  In this method patterns (or raw numbers of instances)
              among citations are used to evaluate hypotheses about the construction of
              knowledge.   Additional information will be collected through interviews with
              writers of books and articles that are most cited during specific time periods.
               Lastly, case studies will be done on two commissions, one state created (The
              President's Commission) and one voluntary sector created (The United Methodist
              Church), that were empowered to discuss this issue. Through examining changes
              in the debate on genetic engineering, this research will increase our
              understanding of the processes involved in broader social change.  ****
