Abstract    :
              9701972  Pohl    This is a renewal proposal on the elastic properties of thin 
              metal films.  A new technique has been developed with which  the shear modulus
              and internal friction of films with  thicknesses as small as 10 nm on silicon
              substrates can be  measured at low temperatures.  The substrates are
              couleDpaddle oscillators which are  chemically etched out of 0.3 mm thick
              ultrahigh purity  silicon wafers.  These oscillators are to be used to study 
              polycrystalline metal films deposition by various  techniques. in which 
              exploratory measurements have revealed  an internal friction which resembles
              that of amorphous  solids.  It is remarkably independent of the metal used, and
               at this point shows little dependence on the way in which  the film has been
              deposited.  As a possible explanation,  tunneling states of dislocations will
              be explored.  %%%  This is a renewal proposal on the elastic properties of thin
               metal films.  This metal films on substrates are often used,  e.g., as current
              leads in the microelectronic devices.  In  order to ensure their performance,
              defects in such films  have to be identified and controlled.  In previous work,
              we  have developed a new technique for measuring elastic  constants of
              crystalline metal films on silicon substrates.  We have found that all films
              measured so far hjave an  internal friction at low temperatures which resembles
              that  of amorphous solids, indicating a considerable amount of  disorder.  The
              objective of this investigation is to  identify this disorder, and to find ways
              to reduce it.
