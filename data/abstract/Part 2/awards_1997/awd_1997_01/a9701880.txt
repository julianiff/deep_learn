                 This research project is a key component of a large, coordinated,
              multi-investigator program, Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean. 
              The research program will be conducted for 14 months from a ship frozen into
              the ice pack. These investigators will utilize measurements of the flux of heat
              from different surface ice conditions of the permanent ice cap of the Arctic
              Ocean.  Their results will help determine how atmospheric and oceanic heating
              is coupled to adsorption of heat by the ice. These measurements are critical to
              understanding how heat is reflected or absorbed by the sea ice as it melts in
              the summer and thickens in the winter in response to seasonal variations in
              climate. The measurements of surface ice conditions will be incorporated into a
              modeling program that makes an essential contribution to the measurements and
              modeling by the SHEBA team of researchers.  This project will be integral to
              the full SHEBA measurement program of atmospheric and oceanic variables
              conducted with a large array of instruments on the ice floe and aircraft flying
              above as well as ice and ocean property measurements made on and below the ice
              floe. The combined set of measurements and sea ice models in SHEBA will allow
              refinement of climate models for the Arctic region. Those improved models will
              lead to better predictions of the climate and the permanence of the Arctic ice
              cap under a proposed global warming that could occur if atmospheric carbon
              dioxide levels are increased above present levels.
