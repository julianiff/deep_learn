                    ABSTRACT    PROPOSAL # : DEB-9701714    INVESTIGATOR(S) : HAMILTON   
              INSTITUTION: MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY     The aims of this research are to
              investigate linkages between hydrology, biogeochemistry, and ecology of
              wetlands in glacial landscapes, with the long-term aim of developing a
              predictive understanding of the relative sensitivity of different wetlands to
              climate change. The research plan involves monitoring of a large number of
              different wetlands in relation to annual variation in climate, and as part of
              the NSF CAREER program it includes significant student participation through
              class projects and independent research.  The wetlands to be studied are all in
              central Michigan.  The general hypothesis is that the variability among
              wetlands can be explained by variability in a small number of key hydrologic
              processes including groundwater inputs, hydraulic residence time, and seasonal
              pattern of flooding and desiccation.  These same variables will also control
              responses to climate change.
