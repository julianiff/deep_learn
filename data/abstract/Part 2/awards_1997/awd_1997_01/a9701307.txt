Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT-DMS 9701307    Semmes         This project is largely concerned with
              notions of  "complexity", i.e., concrete measurements of how complicated a
              given  object is.  Finite and combinatorial notions of complexity play a  basic
              role in computer science, but one can also see analogous ideas  at play in
              traditional areas of mathematics, in connection with  analysis, geometry, and
              topology, for instance.  In the present  project we take much of our
              inspiration from the ideas and methods of  real-variable harmonic analysis, but
              the structures that we consider  will be predominantly geometric in nature.    
              In asking what is "complexity" one should also ask what is  "simplicity". 
              Traditional mathematics offers a rich variety of  answers to both questions,
              and these answers are often connected to  various forms of computational
              efficiency.  In this proposal we shall  mostly be concerned with notions of
              geometric or combinatorial  structure in which there are some nontrivial rules
              or patterns but  perhaps also moderate amounts of bending, breaking, or other 
              disturbances.  In particular, we would like to develop new methods for 
              identifying, measuring, and comparing forms of structure in ways that  are
              flexible enough to accommodate substantial distortion.
