Abstract    :
              9701001  WELLER    Tiger moths are known for their brightly colored adults and
              woolly bear larvae. These moths also have fascinating life history traits such
              as complex associations with toxic hostplants, extreme mimicry of wasps and
              other insects, and elaborate courtship sequences involving both scent and
              sound.  An understanding of the phylogenetic history of tiger moths is critical
              if scientists are to understand when, how and why these traits appeared.  For
              many groups of moths, however, phylogenetic histories are not, or are poorly,
              understood.    In this research, Susan Weller and doctoral candidate Rebecca
              Simmons will investigate the phylogenetic history of wasp mimicry and male
              scent structures in a group of tiger moths called the Myrmecopsis group
              (Euchromiinae).  The phylogeny of the group will be reconstructed from internal
              morphological characters not associated with mimicry and courtship. Data will
              be gathered by examining specimens borrowed from museums with major holdings.
              Once the phylogeny of this group is determined, the history of mimicry and
              courtship structures will be traced on this framework. This study should yield
              information leading to an understanding of how, when and why complex behaviors
              appeared in various groups of animals.
