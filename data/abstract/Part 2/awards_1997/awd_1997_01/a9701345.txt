Abstract    :
              Westneat  9701345         This study will elucidate major evolutionary patterns 
              in the functional morphology and hydrodynamics of locomotion  in a diverse
              monophyletic group of reef fish: the  triggerfishes and filefishes (Superfamily
              Balistoidea).  Data on the fin morphology, 3-D stroke kinematics, and 
              hydrodynamics of a taxonomically broad sample of these fish  will be collected
              and analyzed within the framework of  general mechanical predictions and tuo
              theoretical  hydrodynamic models applicable to long-based paired fin 
              propulsion.  Objectives include: (1) assessing the strength  of a widely
              assumed but untested correlation of fin shape  and kinematic profile; (2)
              testing the theoretical  advantages proposed for swimmers with long, narrow
              fins and  deep, rigidly held bodies; (3) determining which of the two 
              hydrodynamic models yields better estimates of mean thrust;  and (4) examining
              predictions from simple lever mechanics  and muscle architecture.  The study,
              the first in aquatic  locomotion to consider detailed form and kinematic data
              in a  regorous phylogenetic framework, will narow the traditional  gulf between
              functional studies that ignore the influence of  common ancestry and
              evolutionary studies that fail to  acknowledge biomechanical and hydrodynamic
              principles and  contraints.  The study will explore novel mechanisms of  thrust
              with potential applications in underwater propulsion  technology.
