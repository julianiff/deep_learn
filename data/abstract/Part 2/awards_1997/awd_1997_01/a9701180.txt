Abstract    :
              9701180  Wise  The proposed research will investigate the dynamics of predation
              by generalist ground predators - wolf spiders (Lycosidae) and ground beetles
              (Carabidae) - on insect pests of vegetables. Carabids and lycosids, which
              consume a wide spectrum of herbivore species, also prey on each other -
              behavior defined as intraguild predation (IGP). Four specific questions will be
              addressed: (1) Does predation by lycosids and carabids suppress densities of
              herbivorous insects? (2) Do lycosids and carabids negatively impact populations
              of other predators? (3) Does IGP limit carabid and lycosid populations? (4)
              Does the size structure of the ground-predator guild influence its impact on
              herbivore populations? Manipulative field experiments will address the above
              questions by controlling immigration of lycosids and carabids into fenced
              vegetable gardens, and observing effects on pest densities, densities of other
              predators, and plant productivity. The field experiments will be complemented
              with laboratory feeding trials. The research will elucidate the extent to which
              IGP limits the impact of generalist predators on herbivore densities. Since the
              study will be conducted in an agricultural system, results will improve
              understanding of the limitations and strengths of indigenous generalist
              predators as biological control agents, which will contribute to their more
              effective use in integrated pest management.
