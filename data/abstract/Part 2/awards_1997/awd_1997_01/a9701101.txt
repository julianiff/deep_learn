Abstract    :
              Pommerance  9701101              This award supports work on problems in
              analytic, computational, and additive number theory.  One of the principal
              investigators will probe further the basic ideas behind some known algorithms,
              by making rigorous some of the established algorithms, and by developing the
              appropriate tools necessary to help analyze the next generation of algorithms. 
              He will also study rigorous discrete logarithm algorithms for the
              multiplicative group of a finite field with bounded degree over its prime
              field, as well as several 'Erdos-type" problems in analytic number theory.  The
              other principal investigator will try to obtain a more precise understanding of
              character sums by proving distribution results and lower bounds for the largest
              such sums.  He also will study consequences of the abc-conjecture.  Finally he
              will examine several of the infamous problems involving elliptic curves.   
              This is research in the field of number theory.  Number theory starts with the
              whole numbers and questions such as the divisibility of one whole number by
              another.  It is among the oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally
              pursued for purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,
              it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for computer
              science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
