Abstract    :
              9701111  Werner  Predation and competition are thought to be important factors
              that help determine the structure and composition of ecological communities.
              Past studies of the interaction of these two factors have found that taxa
              either compete well or resist predation well, but not both. These observations
              suggest that there is a tradeoff between the ability to compete and the ability
              to resist predation. Differences in predation risk and competitive ability are
              associated with differences in predator-induced and competitor-induced
              morphology of larval anurans including differences in tail fin depth and mouth
              size. Populations within one species of larval anuran differ in morphology and
              one can take advantage of these population differences in morphology to
              determine if populations are trading off competitive ability and predator
              resistance. This tradeoff can be further tested by generating more exaggerated
              differences in the morphological traits by making use of different magnitudes
              of morphological plasticity among the populations. Based on an understanding of
              competitive abilities and predator resistance among populations within a
              species, the relationship among anuran species within the same genus can be
              predicted and tested. The proposed work has important implications to evolution
              of local populations, species interactions within a community, and
              productivity-diversity relationships across communities.
