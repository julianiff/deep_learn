Abstract    :
              9701052  CAIRA    Tapeworms are obligate flatworm parasites that are often
              restricted to specific host animals.  Many tapeworm species have been
              associated with their hosts for long periods of time.  Understanding the
              phylogenetic history of tapeworms is significant to biologists, who wish to
              understand the consequences of shared history on host and parasite species, and
              to lessen the harmful effects of tapeworms on humans and domesticated animals. 
              The phylogenetic history of tapeworms has been difficult to reconstruct,
              because morphological characters are few and difficult to interpret, fossils
              are absent, and investigations on molecular characters have not been conducted.
                  In this research, Janine Caira, Chris Simon and doctoral candidate Peter
              Olson will infer the phylogenetic history of tapeworms by sequencing the
              nucleus-encoded 18S-like ribosomal RNA gene, from representative species in
              each of 14 recognized major groups (orders) of tapeworms, and conducting a
              comparative analysis of these sequences.  The work will provide a foundation
              with which to test hypotheses of tapeworm phylogenetic history based on
              morphological, ecological, and other types of evidence.  In particular, the
              researchers will determine whether the tapeworms placed within an order share a
              common history (are Omonophyletic groupsO) or not.
