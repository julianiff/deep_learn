Abstract    :
              Smith, 9701578      Abstract.    The proposed research lies at the junction of
              non-commutative ring  theory and algebraic geometry. The most abstract  setting
              for the subject is to view a pair, consisting of an abelian  category and a
              distinguished object in it, as the category of  sheaves on some imaginary
              non-commutative space and the structure  sheaf of the space. Such a pair is
              called a scheme.  The category of modules over a ring together  with the ring
              itself is a basic example.    Much of the project involves the examination of
              special examples  with the goal of getting a better understanding of the
              appropriate  analogues of standard geometric notions such as subschemes, open, 
              closed, singular, etc. Particular  attention will be paid to non-commutative
              analogues of projective  spaces; included in this are the Sklyanin algebras,
              which first  arose from some problems in physics. It is also proposed to
              examine  several homological properties of non-commutative rings, such as 
              Auslander regularity, the Koszul property, and the Cohen-Macaulay  property.   
              The basic problem addressed by  non-commutative ring theory is to understand
              the solutions in  (possibly infinite) matrices to systems of polynomial
              equations in  non-commuting variables.   Non-commutative algebraic geometry
              aims to  develop a more geometric approach to such a problem, essentially by 
              viewing the solutions as geometric objects.
