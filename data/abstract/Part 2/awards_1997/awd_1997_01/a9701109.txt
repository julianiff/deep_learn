Abstract    :
              Karban  9701109    Induced resistance following herbivory has been broadly
              documented across many taxa of plants.  The investigators examine two aspects
              of induction 1) whether induced responses increase plant fitness, and 2) why
              plants employ induced responses over constitutive strategies.  Field-grown
              annual plants will be experimentally induced in an environment with herbivores
              and male and female fitness components will be compared to uninduced control
              plants.  In addition, three non-exclusive hypotheses for the benefits of
              induced responses over constitutive strategies will be tested:  Do plants that
              employ induced responses benefit from 1) saving allocation costs when not
              induced, 2) not being apparent to specialist herbivores when not induced, and
              3) having slower adapting herbivores than plants that are constitutively
              (continuously) defended?    Costs of induced plant responses have rarely been
              found and the benefits have been largely ignored.  This proposal attempts to
              fill these gaps.  Additionally, understanding the ecological benefits of
              induced defenses will be potentially useful in the protection of crop plants
              from yield-reducing herbivores.
