Abstract    :
              Philip Reid of the University of Washington has received a CAREER award   in the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study reaction dynamics   of
              environmentally important compounds.  Reid will focus on condensed   phase
              reactions of halooxides and other halogenated species.  Resonance   Raman
              intensity analysis or time-resolved Resonance Raman spectroscopy   will be used
              to investigate the reactivity from initial excited-state   nuclear evolution to
              the appearance of ground state photoproducts.    The teaching program will
              involve the creation of new courses and   instructional tools to enhance the
              undergraduate chemistry curriculum.    Internet-based teaching methods and a
              new course in physical chemistry   for environmental scientists are being
              developed in response to a   recently created interdisciplinary program in
              environmental education.    Undergraduate and graduate students from the
              University of Washington   will participate in collaborative research at
              Pacific Northwest National   Laboratories.
