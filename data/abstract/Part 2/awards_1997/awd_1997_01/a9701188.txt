Abstract    :
              SHULT  9701188    The principal investigator  will investigate new  infinite
              families of geometries recently discovered.  Also, the PI will study
              locally-generated geometries generalizing some earlier results to
              characteristic two.  This area bears some relation to the classification of the
              finite simple groups.  Finally, the PI will look at  point-line
              characterizations of classical geometries of infinite rank.    The field of
              group theory is the mathematical theory of symmetry and interacts with many
              other disciplines,  for example physics and chemistry outside of mathematics,
              coding theory, number theory and geometry inside mathematics.  The
              investigator's particular area is finite groups and geometries.  It is an old
              subject but still facing great unsolved problems and with many opportunities
              for breakthroughs.
