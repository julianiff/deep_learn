Abstract    :
              9701890  Arulanandan  This action is to support an international 
              workshop/conference to discuss progress toward, and research  needs for,
              mitigating the deterioration of the Nation's  infrastructure resulting from
              exposure to earthquake  hazards, from the viewpoint of ground motion and ground
               failure.  The focus is on the contributions of the NSF-  funded VELACS project
              (Verification of Liquefaction Analysis  by Centrifuge Studies), the
              applications of the VELACS  concepts to practice, determining additional
              research needs,  and disseminating this information.    A previous
              international workshop held at the University of  California, Davis, in
              February 1992, also addressed this  topic.  Since then, numerous contributions
              have been made to  the field of geotechnical earthquake engineering, and some 
              limited applications to engineering practice have been  achieved.    The
              objectives of this workshop/conference are: 1) to  evaluate the progress that
              has been made in the past four  years in the areas of verified numerical
              procedures, site  characterization to obtain insitu properties for use in 
              numerical procedures, and application of verified numerical  procedures in
              engineering practice; and 2) to determine the  research needed to make further
              progress.    This workshop/conference is expected to lead to further 
              advancements in the field of geotechnical earthquake  engineering.
