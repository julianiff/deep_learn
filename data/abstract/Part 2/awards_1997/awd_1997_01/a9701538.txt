Abstract    :
              9701538  Sharma  The proposal deals with fabrication of new devices and sensors
              using fiber-optic Bragg gratings.  While the characteristics of reflection
              Bragg gratings is quite well understood, this is not so for tapped Bragg
              gratings.  This is proposed to be done here.  A novel directional coupler
              consisting of two tapped Bragg gratings side-by-side will be fabricated.  Its
              application as a wavelength sensitive light-tap will be inveqtigated.  A number
              of such devices fabricated in series will be useful for distributed sensing of
              transverse strain in Smart Structures.  Such a sensor will compliment the well
              known distributed sensing of longitudinal strain by reflection Bragg gratings
              in series.    Reflection Bragg gratings will also be used to fabricate a
              chemical sensor for sensing environmental gases like NH3, H2O and CH4 in a
              novel correlation spectroscopy set up where a grating will replace the
              cumbersome bulky reference cell.  With the grating set up 100% modulation of
              correlation between the gas absorption lines and the Bragg wavelength can be
              obtained unlike partial modulation by Stark shift and broadening of spectral
              lines as in conventional correlation spectroscopy.  This technique will be used
              for distributed sensing of environmental gases.  This will have important
              applications in the area of monitoring and control of atmospheric pollution.   
              Students will be an integral part of all research activity described in the
              proposal.  At any time over the four year duration of the proposed integrated
              plan one Ph.D. student will be involved in the research, working towards
              his/her degree in applied physics.  The University has a work/study program for
              undergraduate students working towards their physics/engineering degrees.  A
              student typically works as a research assistant and is paid to cover his
              tuition and other expenses.  At any given time the proposed research will
              support one undergraduate student as well, assisting a graduate student in
              his/her research.    Finally, the proposal d escribes an apprenticeship program
              for high school students in which they will spend 4-6 weeks of their summer
              getting a hands-on experience with basic devices in a fiber-optics laboratory.
