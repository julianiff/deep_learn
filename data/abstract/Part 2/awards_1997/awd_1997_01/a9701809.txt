Abstract    :
                  9701809  Templeton   Explaining species distributions is one of the major
              challenges in biogeography.  Historical and ecological factors may explain why
              some species are widespread while others have restricted distributions. This
              study will investigate two fruitfly species distributed through most of the dry
              areas in east South America.  Drosophila serido, a superspecies complex
              composed of at least 5 putative species, shows remarkable variation throughout
              this range.  On the other hand, D. buzzatii shows no sign of diversification. 
              How these patterns result from present forces such as population structure and
              past forces such as population history will be addressed by the analysis of DNA
              sequence variation (mtDNA and nuclear) across the range of these species.  The
              procedure to be used is new and should differentiate historical from ecological
              factors affecting distributions.  The methods developed will apply to species
              in general, to help understand basic forces  affecting the distributions of
              species.  Empirical studies such as this one are needed to test the validity of
              the assumptions.  This study will also provide information on the distribution
              of dry areas during past climate changes in South America, which is relevant to
              conservation.
