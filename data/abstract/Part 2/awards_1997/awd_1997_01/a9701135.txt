Abstract    :
              9701135  Hillis  One of the more puzzling genetic questions is how clonal
              species maintain themselves through time.  Gynogenetic species are clonal
              animals that face an obstacle to long-term persistence because reproduction is
              dependent on males of another species.  A gynogenetic species cannot persist in
              isolation; it must coexist with another species whose males it is capable of
              parasitizing behaviorally.  However, simple population models of such
              interactions predict that gynogenetic species should rapidly become extinct. 
              The existence of gynogenetic species indicates that these models are an
              insufficient description of reality.  One factor that would allow the
              persistence of the gynogenetic species is frequency-dependent behavior.     
              This investigation will examine frequency-dependent behaviors and their role in
              the maintenance of gynogenetic species.  A mathematical model will be
              constructed that incorporates frequency-dependent mate selection, and then the
              model will be tested using two species of poeciliid fish: the gynogenetic
              specie and the species upon which it depends.    The model will establish the
              levels of frequency-dependent mating that theoretically can result in a stable
              equilibrium of a gynogenetic species and the species upon which it depends. 
              The experiments will determine if mate selection is frequency-dependent and if
              frequency-dependence is great enough to explain the coexistence of gynogenetic
              species and the species they parasitize.
