Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  OPP-970151      LINDSAY. RONALD  UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON    This
              research project is a key component of a large, coordinated, multi-investigator
              program, Surdace Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean.  The research program
              will be conducted for 14 months from a ship frozen into the ice pack. This
              investigator will use upward looking sonar to determine the thickness
              variations of the permanent ice pack through a full annual cycle.  This
              research will be important for the determination of the effects of the flux of
              incoming heat radiating onto the ice floe as a function of changing atmospheric
              and oceanic conditions. Their results will help determine how atmospheric
              heating is coupled to adsorption of heat by the sea ice. These measurements are
              critical to understanding how heat is reflected or absorbed by the ice as it
              melts in the summer and thickens in the winter in response to seasonal
              variations in climate. The sea ice thickness measurement program makes an
              essential contribution to the SHEBA team of researchers who will measure
              atmospheric variables with a large array of instruments on the ice floe and
              aircraft flying above as well as ice and ocean property measurements made on
              and below the ice floe. The combined set of measurements in SHEBA will allow
              refinement of climate models for the Arctic region. Those improved models will
              lead to better predictions of the climate and the permanence of the Arctic ice
              cap under a proposed global warming that could occur if atmospheric carbon
              dioxide levels are increased above present levels.
