Abstract    :
               9701091 Seiberling  This project aims for greater fundamental materials science
              understanding of issues surrounding surfactant-mediated epitaxy.  For example,
              Sn and Sb are surfactants that have opposite influences on film growth, but the
              difference is not understand on the basis of chemical bonding. This proposal
              address the microscopic bonding arrangement of Sn and Sb on Si(100) and their
              interaction with a growing Ge film.  Transmission ion channeling, which can
              determine the bonding sites of atoms on a surface with a resolution of better
              than 0.01 nm, will be used to follow the positions of the surfactant and Ge
              atoms from the initial bonding site, with Ge on top of the surfactant layer,
              through the surfactant/adatom exchange, leading eventually to the final state. 
              %%% The project addresses issues in a forefront research area of materials
              science. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a
              fundamental level to important aspects of electronic/photonic devices and
              integrated circuitry, in general.  Additionally, the fundamental knowledge and
              understanding gained from the research is expected to contribute to improving
              the performance of advanced devices and circuits by providing a fundamental
              understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved materials, and
              materials combinations.  An important feature of the program is the integration
              of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally
              and technologically significant area. ***
