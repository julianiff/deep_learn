Abstract    :
              9701128  Sousa  Though many studies have addressed the impacts of anthropogenic
              disturbances on free-living species, few have considered how these impacts
              might disrupt the tight links between parasites and their hosts. In this study
              the PIs investigate the impacts of logging-induced disturbance on the density
              and distribution of a suite of stream-dwelling species and ask how these
              changes can alter dynamics of their shared trematode parasite. The trematode
              parasite, Cephalouterina dicamptodoni, obligately and sequentially infects
              larval Pacific giant salamanders (Dicamptodon tenebrosus), a common aquatic
              snail (Juga silicula) and a nymphal stonefly (Calineuria californica). This
              study consists of three phases: 1) documentation of the effects of logging on
              the density and distribution of each host species; 2) examination of the
              patterns of parasite prevalence and abundance within each host species from
              both logged and unlogged streams; and 3) experimental investigation of the
              hypothesis that disturbance-induced changes in host distributions and densities
              alter parasite transmission processes and in turn parasite population dynamics.
               This work is the first to explore the impacts of logging on both patterns and
              mechanisms of parasite-host interactions.
