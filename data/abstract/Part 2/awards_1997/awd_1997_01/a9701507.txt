Abstract    :
              9701507  Stein    Metal  polyanion  or  -cation clusters will be  used  as 
              building  blocks   (or   as   metal   precursors)  to  synthesize   extended 
              inorganic-organic  network structures to  design  new  classes  of  functional 
              materials. The clusters will be preorganized  in  two-  and three-dimensional
              structures using surfactants to optimize the  cluster arrangements for linking;
              salt-gel reactions will be  used  to  convert  the pre-organized salt
              structures into  high  surface  area mesoporous materials, with the salt-gel
              reactions studied  in  collaboration with Argonne National Labs; methods for
              the  linkage  of  the  inorganic clusters by organic connectors through
              hydrogen  bonding, coordination polymerization, and covalent bonding will be 
              developed; and optimized linking mechanisms will be combined  with  templating 
              techniques  to  produce well-ordered  structures  with  accessible void spaces.
               %%%  New   classes   of   functional   porous   materials   based    on 
              cluster-network structures will be designed with void  spaces  for 
              applications  in  catalysis,  separations,  sensing,   optics   or 
              electronics.  Integrating  these current  high-priority  materials  research
              challenges with the educational curriculum of this CAREER  Program  results in
              the training of students in areas  of  growing  relevancy thereby advancing
              science and technology while improving  job prospects for students.  ***
