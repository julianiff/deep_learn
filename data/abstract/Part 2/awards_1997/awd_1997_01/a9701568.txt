Abstract    :
              9701568  Moehle  The PEER Center is a consortium of nine core institutions, 
              closely linked and regularly interacting through electronic  networks.  The
              focus of PEER is to develop urban earthquake  risk reduction technologies
              within a performance-based  earthquake engineering framework.  The research
              program  contains five basic thrust areas:  (1) policy, planning and 
              economics; (2) seismic hazards; (3) performance assessment;  (4) systems
              reliability; and (5) innovative technologies.  PEER serves as a
              problem-focused, integrative center that  bridges disciplinary gaps and
              barriers.  In addition,  project applications provide research focal points, a 
              business and industrial partnership program should attract  funding, and urban
              demonstration projects will test the  applicability of research results. 
              Education and  partnership programs are used to educate students and  attract
              qualified under-represented minorities to earthquake  engineering, and include
              innovations such as the Engineering  Undergraduate Scholars Course, the K-12
              Public Education  Program and a WWW page.  The PEER Center is one of three 
              EERCs networked with an overarching governing board to  provide synergism in
              creating new knowledge and technology,  educating the next generation of
              earthquake engineers and  scientists, and providing outreach to industry,
              government,  pre-college schools and potential user groups.
