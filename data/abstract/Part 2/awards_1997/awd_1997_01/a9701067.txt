Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT    OPP-9701067       KADKO, DAVID       MIAMI UNIVERSITY       This
              research project is an ancillary project to be conducted in conjunction with a
              large, coordinated, multi-investigator program, Surface Heat Budget of the
              Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean.  The research program will be conducted for 14 months
              from a ship frozen into the ice pack. This investigator will measure the
              concentration of Beryllium isotopes in the ice and open areas in the ice where
              the ocean occurs at the surface to determine how much heat from  the melt water
              is added to the ocean .  This research will be important for the determination
              of the effects of the flux of incoming heat radiating onto the ice floe as a
              function of changing atmospheric and oceanic conditions. The results will help
              determine how atmospheric heating is coupled to adsorption of heat by the sea
              ice and transferred to the ocean during melting. These measurements are
              important to understanding how heat is reflected or absorbed by the ice as it
              melts in the summer and thickens in the winter in response to seasonal
              variations in climate. The combined set of measurements of this project and the
              larger SHEBA program will allow refinement of climate models for the Arctic
              region. Those improved models will lead to better predictions of the climate
              and the permanence of the Arctic ice cap under a proposed global warming that
              could occur if atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are increased above present
              levels.
