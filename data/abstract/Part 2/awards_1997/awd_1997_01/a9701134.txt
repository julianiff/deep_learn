Abstract    :
                9701134  Wills  Microsatellite sequences are arrays of short repeated DNA
              sequences.  Their variation in repeat number makes them useful for studying
              many questions in population biology.   Such arrays are highly unstable, and a
              current topic of debate is over what factors influence the stability of these
              sequences.  This project aims to develop yeast as a model system to study
              microsatellites, in which hypotheses can be tested by experiments.  Development
              of a yeast model will entail rigorous computer analysis of the complete yeast
              genome and the determination of mutation rates at a range of loci, using
              molecular genetic techniques. Over 20 unstable repeats have been identified in
              yeast.  The relative roles of repeat length, repeat sequence, genetic context,
              and cellular growth conditions on the stability of these repeats will be
              examined.  This project will develop molecular markers for the study of
              laboratory and natural strains of yeast.  The identification of unstable loci
              in yeast should lead to a powerful model system to test evolutionary hypotheses
              about mutations at such loci.  This work will allow comparative studies of
              microsatellite sequences as they relate to genome organization, stability, and
              evolution.
