Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    OPP-9701390  GUEST, PETER  NAVAL POSTGRADUATE SCHOOL      This
              research project is a key component of a large, coordinated, multi-investigator
              program, Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean.  The research program
              will be conducted for 14 months from a ship frozen into the ice pack. These
              investigators will measure atmospheric conditions near the surface of the
              permanent ice cap of the Arctic Ocean to determine the flux of heat radiating
              onto and off of the ice floe. They will determine how atmospheric heating is
              coupled to adsorption of heat by the ice. These measurements are critical to
              understanding how heat is reflected or absorbed by the ice as it melts in the
              summer and thickens in the winter in response to seasonal variations in
              climate. The heat flux measurement program makes an essential contribution to
              the SHEBA team of researchers who will measure atmospheric variables with a
              large array of instruments on the ice floe and aircraft flying above as well as
              ice and ocean property measurements made on and below the ice floe. The
              combined set of measurements in SHEBA will allow refinement of climate models
              for the Arctic region. Those improved models will lead to better predictions of
              the climate and the permanence of the Arctic ice cap under a proposed global
              warming that could occur if atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are increased
              above present levels.
