              AND   ENVIRONMENTAL LABORATORIES    This research project is a key component of
              a large, coordinated, multi-investigator program, Surface Heat Budget of the
              Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean.  The research program will be conducted for 14 months
              from a ship frozen into the ice pack. These investigators will utilize
              measurements of the thermal and dynamic conditions of the permanent ice cap of
              the Arctic Ocean to be incorporated into a modeling project that will determine
              the factors responsible for the summer melting of the sea ice. Their results
              will help determine how atmospheric and oceanic heating is coupled to
              adsorption of heat by the ice. These measurements are critical to understanding
              how heat is reflected or absorbed by the sea ice as it melts in the summer and
              thickens in the winter in response to seasonal variations in climate. The
              modeling program makes an essential contribution to the SHEBA team of
              researchers who will measure atmospheric and oceanic variables with a large
              array of instruments on the ice floe and aircraft flying above as well as ice
              and ocean property measurements made on and below the ice floe. The combined
              set of measurements and sea ice models in SHEBA will allow refinement of
              climate models for the Arctic region. Those improved models will lead to better
              predictions of the climate and the permanence of the Arctic ice cap under a
              proposed global warming that could occur if atmospheric carbon dioxide levels
              are increased above present levels.
