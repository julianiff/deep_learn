Abstract    :
              9701088  Clark  Issues related to management and the potential change in forest
              structure due to climate change demand increased knowledge of the basic biology
              underlying forest dynamics. Theoretical studies have demonstrated the potential
              for variations in life history strategy to explain both the co-existence of
              species in forest communities and the patterns of forest stand development.
              Validation of such studies have been hampered by lack of species specific field
              data. The PIs seek to explore whether the level of variation actually seen in
              the field for two life history parameters, growth and mortality, can explain
              compositional differences observed between forest types. To these ends, the PIs
              are using tree ring data to derive species specific functions relating growth
              and size class and growth and mortality for tree species growing in five types
              of southern Appalachian forests. Simple models will be used to explore the
              implications of observed variations in growth and mortality for forest stand
              development.
