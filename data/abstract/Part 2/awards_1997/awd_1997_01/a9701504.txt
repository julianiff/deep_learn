Abstract    :
              This CAREER project in high performance computing and communications (HPCC) will
              develop an integrated research and education framework for predictive
              simulations of complex, real-life phenomena.  The objective of this research
              project is to extend molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to larger system
              sizes, longer simulated times, and greater realism, through the use of new
              multilevel algorithms and novel models encompassing multiple levels of physical
              abstraction: i) space-time multiresolution schemes; ii) hierarchical dynamics
              via a rigid-body/implicit-integration/normal-mode approach; iii) adaptive
              curvilinear-coordinate load balancing; iv) variable valence MD based on
              electronegativity equalization; and v) multilevel preconditioned conjugate
              gradient method.  Multimillion-atom MD simulations will be performed for
              multiscale phenomena in nanophase ceramics and metal-oxide nancomposites.  The
              proposed research will impact advanced material technologies based on
              "multiscale structure control."
