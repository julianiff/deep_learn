Abstract    :
              The primiary purpose of this project is to develop architectural optimization 
              tools with dramatically improved efficiency and accuracy.  Tools will be 
              developed in three inter-related categories.  The first is a comprehensive 
              semi-automated methodology for simultaneously exploring the microprocessor and 
              system level design spaces.  The second is a hardware emulator coupled to 
              software simulation.  The third parallelizes the search for an optimum using a 
              network of workstations.  The end result, called ROADS, will have dramatically 
              improved efficiency and accuracy over existing methods.    ROADS will form the
              centerpiece of a new course sequence that will integrate the  topics of
              computer architecture and implementation.  Multilevel simulation will  allow
              students to address a much wider scope of design problems than the  simulators
              used in most current curricula.  The result will be a new generation  of
              engineers better prepared to both design and implement new computing 
              architectures.
