              This research project is a key component of a large, coordinated,
              multi-investigator program called SHEBA (Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic)
              Ocean.  The SHEBA program will simultaneously measure, over an annual cycle,
              the various fluxes and properties of the atmosphere, ice pack, and upper ocean
              that determine the aggregate mass and energy budgets of Arctic sea ice.  Its
              goal is improved understanding of how and to what extent, the ice covered
              Arctic Ocean affects climate variability in lower latitudes and in global
              climate models (GCMs).  Towards that goal, two potentially important
              radiation/climate feedback processes have been singled out for study: 
              Ice-Albedo Feedback and Cloud-Radiation Feedback.  Work sponsored here is
              directed toward understanding the impact of the upper ocean on aggregate
              ice-albedo feedback via the ice mass and heat budgets.  The ocean component of
              the program will provide (1) continuous time series of upper ocean state
              properties and turbulent fluxes at the main SHEBA station, supplemented by
              remote buoy measurements; and (2) measurements for determining the disposition
              of solar heating in summer leads.  The research program will be conducted for
              14 months from a ship frozen into the ice pack.  The ocean measurements program
              makes an essential contribution to the SHEBA team of researchers who will
              measure atmospheric variables with a large array of instruments on the ice floe
              and aircraft flying above.  The combined set of measurements in SHEBA will
              allow refinement of climate models for the Arctic region.  Those improved
              models will lead to better predictions of the climate and the permanence of the
              Arctic ice cap under a proposed global warming that could occur if atmospheric
              carbon dioxide levels are increased above present levels.
