Abstract    :
              9701522  RALEIGH        The University of Hawaii will operate the R/V MOANA WAVE
              in  1997  as  a general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-funded  research
               projects.   The MOANA WAVE is a  210'  research  vessel  owned  by the U.S.
              Navy and operated as a UNOLS vessel in support  of  academic  research.  The
              ship is scheduled for  190  days  of  which  170 are in support of
              NSF-sponsored programs.  All of  the  cruises are in the Pacific with three NSF
              cruises in the vicinity  of  Guam.  The remaining NSF cruises are of short
              duration out of  Hawaii  in  support the Hawaii Time Series project.  In 
              addition  the vessel will support three short cruises for NOAA.        The
              MOANA WAVE is part of the academic fleet used by NSF to  support  oceanographic
               research.   Most  oceanographic  research  requires  highly specialized
              equipment that must  be  permanently  installed  on  a  ship  for which the
              ship must  be  specifically  designed.   This  equipment  also requires  highly
               trained  crew  members  for  maintenance and operation.  These  vessels  do 
              not  operate  in the same manner as general cargo or fishing  vessels, 
              therefore,  NSF  supports the operation of a variety  of  vessels  specifically
               dedicated  to  oceanographic  research   that   are  operated  by 
              universities and research institutions  around  the  country.  ***
