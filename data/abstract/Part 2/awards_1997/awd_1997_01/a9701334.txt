Abstract    :
              Ketterson  9701334         Recent investigations have revealed the presence of 
              maternally-derived steroid hormones in the yolks of avian  eggs.  However, many
              questions concerning both the  functional significance and the mechanism of
              action of yolk  steroids remain unanswered.  By concentrating on the 
              interactions between hormones, physiology, and behavior, the  proposed research
              will elucidate the role yolk steroids in  the development and survival of
              offspring in the context of  hatching asynchrony.  In doing so, the mechanisms
              by which  yolk steroids facilitate growth and survival will be  identified.    
                Preliminary research on the eggs of red-winged  blackbirds, Agelaius
              phoeniceus, has shown that the  concentration of yolk testosterone varies with
              laying order  in such a way that later-laid eggs contain more hormone. 
              Therefore, this research will focus on the developmental and  fitness effects
              of yolk testosterone by:  (1) Establishing  whether yolk testosterone levels
              are correlated with growth  rate, muscle development, or begging intensity. 
              (2)  Demonstrating causation between yolk testosterone levels and  these
              physiological and behavioral variables by injecting  testosterone into yolks. 
              (3) Investigating the effects of  female age on yolk testosterone levels in a
              system where  older females produce a greater number of fledglings than 
              first-time breeders.
