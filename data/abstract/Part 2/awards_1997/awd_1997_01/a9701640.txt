Abstract    :
              9701640  Slavin  This is a grant to support research at a largely  Undergraduate
              Institution, the Oakland University.  The  research program consists of a
              theoretical study of  nonlinear magnetism and excitations in finite media, i.e.
               devices.  The specific projects in this grant are: (1) Two  dimensional
              nonlinear diffraction of finite aperture SW  beams and pulses in magnetic films
              leading to self  channeling, self focusing  and wave collapse; (2) Formation 
              and propagation of one dimensional "bright" and "dark" spin-  wave envelope
              solitons in weakly dissipative magnetic films  and (3)  parametric
              amplification of "bright" envelope  solitons in magnetic films by external
              microwave pumping.  Results of this research will be useful for the development
               of microwave signal processing devices based on nonlinear  spin wave processes
              in magnetic films.  %%%  This grant supports theoretical research at a
              predominantly  undergraduate institution on a problem in device magnetism.  The
              research is expected to advance our understanding of  nonlinear wave dynamics
              in a magnetic medium and has  applications to a better understanding of the
              properties of  high quality garnet films as used in microwave technology.  The
              project involves undergraduate students within the  framework of an
              internationally acknowledged active research  program.  ***
