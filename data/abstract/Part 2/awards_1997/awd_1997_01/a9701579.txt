Abstract    :
              9701579  Xiao    In  this  GOALI  supported research program magnetic  tunnel 
              junctions (MTJ) will be prepared and studied with ultra-fast  laser  
              spectroscopy,   near-field  optics,   and   magneto-  tunneling.   The  purpose
              is to study the  fundamental   and  technological  issues  essential  to  the 
              performance   and  competitiveness  of the MTJ.  The proposed work  is  closely
               linked to activities at IBM Research, Yorktown Heights.  IBM  will, where
              appropriate, pay for the support of students for  work  done  at  IBM 
              Research.   This  activity  is  jointly  supported by DMR and the OMA office of
              the MPS Directorate.  %%%  Magnetic  tunnel  junctions are devices which  are 
              actively  pursued  by  industry as the new memory and sensor  elements  such as
              data storage reading heads and non-volatile magnetic  random-access-memory 
              (MRSM) cells.  The  scientific  issues  include  gaining  a  more  complete 
              understanding  of   the  magnetic   behavior  of  these  systems,  especially  
              while  illuminated by light and the effect of reducing  the  device  size.  
              The  GOALI  supported work links  expertise  at  the  academic   institution 
              with  activities  at  IBM  Research,  Yorktown Heights.  IBM will, where
              appropriate, pay for  the  support  of  students for work done at IBM 
              Research.   This  activity  is jointly supported by DMR and the OMA office  of 
              the MPS Directorate.  ***
