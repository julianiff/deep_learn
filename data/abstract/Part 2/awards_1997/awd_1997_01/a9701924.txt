Abstract    :
                An examination of the transition states of surface reactions forms  the focus
              of this research project supported by the Analytical and  Surface Chemistry
              Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary  Activities.  Professor Gellman and
              his students at Carnegie Mellon  University are addressing the nature and
              energetics of the  transition state in various elementary surface reaction
              processes  including  -hydride elimination, alkyl coupling and phenyl coupling 
              reactions on Cu and Ag surfaces.  The transition state is probed by  fluorine
              substitution of reactants and the monitoring of reaction  kinetics and
              mechanism using vibrational spectroscopy and thermal  desorption spectroscopy. 
              Activation barriers and energetics  obtained experimentally will be compared
              with computational  investigations of transition state energetics.   The use of
              the methods of physical organic chemistry to examine  transition states in
              surface reactions is the subject of this  research project.  Fluorine
              substitution is used to probe the  stability and energetics of the transition
              state for various  hydrogen elimination and coupling reactions occurring on
              copper and  silver surfaces.  This information will provide the thermodynamic 
              background essential for an understanding of catalytic chemistry on  these
              surfaces, as well as for similar processes in electrochemical  and corrosion
              environments.
