Abstract    :
              9701250  Goldberg  In this proposal, the PIs develop a framework to determine
              the mechanisms of species compositional change following the creation of a gap.
              It is critical that we learn the mechanistic basis for these changes to
              understand the process of, and thereby develop models for, gap dynamics.
              Release from competition due to reduction of neighbor biomass has been the
              assumed, but largely untested, mechanism responsible for species compositional
              change in disturbances. The competitive release hypothesis predicts that the
              competitive hierarchy remains unchanged but competitive inferior species are
              able to colonize a gap faster than the dominants. However, the PIs suggest that
              the competitive hierarchy may also shift in favor of species adapted to
              disturbed conditions. At least two other mechanisms of change could cause this
              shift in hierarchy: alterations in the abiotic environment independent of
              biotic effects and changes in neighborhood size-structure. The PIs will
              separate these three potential mechanisms of change in factorial manipulations
              of neighbor biomass (removed or present), abiotic soil alteration (soil
              disturbed or undisturbed) and neighborhood size-structure (juvenile colonists
              or adults). Data on the absolute and relative performance due to each of these
              components will allow us to compare the responses of six target species.
              Preliminary results suggest that the experimental design is able to separate
              these effects and that species characteristic of gaps respond differently to
              components of change compared to non-gap species.
