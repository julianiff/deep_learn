Abstract    :
                  9701007  Doyle   Graduate student Carl Bailey, under the direction of
              Professor Jeff Doyle at Cornell University, is studying the mustard-family
              genus Sphaerocardamum of Mexico, to improve taxonomic classification of the
              group, construct a phylogeny of the eight or so known species, and explore
              variation in floral development genes.  Additional field collecting in Mexico
              will augment materials assembled from the field and herbarium.  New molecular
              data from DNA sequencing of both nuclear and chloroplast genes will provide
              evidence for phylogenetic analyses, and these data can be combined with
              traditional morphological characters in delimiting species, assessing
              hybridization in areas of sympatry, and studying the historical biogeography of
              the group.  Gene probes from the Arabidopsis model system, a related plant in
              the family, will be used to explore variation in genes affecting floral
              development and other features distinguishing related species.   The
              significance of the project includes contributions to the taxonomy and
              phylogeny of the Brassicaceae (mustard) family, evaluation of the reliability
              and stability of key morphological characters in the genus Sphaerocardamum and
              close relatives, the development of new sources of DNA data for phylogenetic
              reconstruction, and the exploration of variation in genes affecting flower
              development, making use of probes from the Arabidopsis model system.
