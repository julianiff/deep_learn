Abstract    :
              9701746  Farrell       F. T. Farrell, in collaboration with L. E. Jones of
              SUNY-Stony Brook,  is investigating the structure of manifolds, with particular
              emphasis on  aspherical manifolds.  A motivating problem is Borel's Conjecture,
              which  posits topological rigidity for closed aspherical manifolds.  They also 
              study related smooth rigidity questions under extra geometric assumptions.  In
              particular, the relationship is being studied between the surgical and 
              harmonic map approaches to rigidity problems.       A geometric object is rigid
              if it can't be deformed.  For example, a  sphere cannot be deformed without
              changing its curvature.  During the last  35 years, there has been intense
              interest in rigidity questions centering on  geometric objects with
              non-positive curvature.  (The Euclidean plane has  zero curvature, the sphere
              has positive curvature, and the non-Euclidean  plane has negative curvature.) 
              The techniques used until recently to  investigate these questions have mostly
              come from analysis (calculus)  together with differential and synthetic
              geometry.  In the last 15 years,  techniques from cut and paste topology
              (surgery theory) have found  application to these questions.  Farrell and Jones
              approach rigidity  problems from topology but also use techniques from
              geometry.  ***
