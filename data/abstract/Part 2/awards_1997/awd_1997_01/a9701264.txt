Abstract    :
              9701264  LIPSCOMB    Ophiuroids, or brittle stars, are the largest class of
              echinoderms.  They occupy nearly every marine environment from the tropics to
              polar seas, and the intertidal to abyssal zones.  Nonetheless, ophiuroids
              remain one of the least studied groups with respect to their systematics. 
              Brittle stars in the deep sea may also inform an ongoing debate about the
              origins of deep-sea animals.  Some scientists believe that the deep-sea
              environment is a refuge for ancient species, others believe that deep-water
              species appeared more recently, by invasions from shallow-water and Antarctic
              faunas.    In this research, Diana Lipscomb, David Pawson and doctoral
              candidate Susan Hottenrott will conduct a systematic revision of two ophuroid
              genera, Ophiomusium and Ophiosphalma (family Ophiolepididae) which are dominant
              members of the deep-sea fauna in all oceans.  The 77 species that comprise
              these genera are poorly characterized.  By studying the gross and fine
              structural anatomy of specimens archived at various museums, this study will
              provide the first detailed description and identification keys of these
              species. It is anticipated that this analysis will result in a better
              understanding of ophuroids in general and deep-sea species in particular.  The
              study should also give insights into the origin of deep sea faunas, by
              including biogeographic analyses that will test competing hypotheses for the
              origins of these brittle stars.
