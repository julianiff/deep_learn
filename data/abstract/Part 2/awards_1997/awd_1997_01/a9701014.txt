Abstract    :
              Gina L. Hoatson and Robert L. Vold of the College of William and Mary are  
              supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in their   continuing
              studies using solid-state deuteron nuclear magnetic resonance   (NMR)
              spectroscopy and the extension of their work using nitrogen-14 and   carbon-13
              NMR.  To overcome the low chemical shift resolution inherent   using standard
              methods for obtaining solid-state deuteron NMR, they will   use magic angle
              spinning (MAS) experiments to measure very slow motional   rates.  For
              carbon-13, they plan to exploit a new two dimensional   methodology, Variable
              Angle correlation SpectroscopY (VACSY), and obtain   information about
              orientation dependent relaxation by combining this with   spin temperature
              alternation.  For nitrogen-14, the PIs propose to use   overtone spectroscopy
              with stochastic excitation as an alternative to the   technically demanding
              direct detection of single quantum nitrogen-14 NMR   signals.  These new
              techniques are to be applied to urea inclusion   compounds and dendritic
              polyamidoamines.  New uses of molecular dynamic   simulations for interpreting
              NMR data for complex molecular assemblies   will also be explored.   This work
              involves novel multinuclear NMR techniques for determining   structure and
              dynamics in complex molecular assemblies.  An improved   understanding of order
              and motion at the molecular level will increase   knowledge of how these
              correlate with macroscopic properties.    Eventually, this cognition may help
              direct the design of new materials   with properties optimized for specific
              applications.
