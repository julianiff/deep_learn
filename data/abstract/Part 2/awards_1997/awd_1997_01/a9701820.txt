Abstract    :
              9701820  Losos     This award will provide funds for domestic and international
              travel and for materials and supplies to enhance the dissertation research of
              Mr. David J. Pepin, a doctoral student at Washington University in St. Louis
              working under the supervision of Drs. Jonathan B. Losos and Allan Larson.  Mr.
              Pepin's dissertation research will utilize phylogenetic relationships among 46
              species of monitor lizards (genus Varanus), as inferred from mitochondrially-
              and nuclear-encoded DNA sequences, to examine and test several hypotheses
              regarding variation in morphology and life history.  Monitor lizards vary
              dramatically in body size and are an ideal, model group in which to test these
              hypotheses.  Specifically, the influence of allometry on life-histmry traits
              will be examined to determine the influence of life-history on body size. 
              Reproductive traits to be examined include egg-clutch number, and hatchling
              size.  The award will provide support for Mr. Pepin to travel to several
              museums in the United States to obtain data from specimens sampled from the
              Philippines, Guam, Indonesia, and Northern Africa.  Foreign travel to Australia
              and Western Europe will allow Mr. Pepin to obtain data from specimens not
              available in U.S. museums.  Funds for materials and supplies will permit
              acquisition of both morphological and molecular data. .  Support for training
              of graduate students in modern technologies is critical to maintain the
              workforce of scientists capable of addressing questions and issues in global
              biology.
