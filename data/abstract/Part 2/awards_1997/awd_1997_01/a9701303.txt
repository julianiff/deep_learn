Abstract    :
              9701303  Tian    This project concerns various Riemannian geometric properties
              of the Teichmuller space, which in turn gives a new way to parametrize the
              moduli of compact Riemann surfaces. More specifically, the investigator is to
              use the geometric characteristics of the Teichmuller space to study fibrations
              of maps into surfaces, and to identify the diffeomorphism group of the circle
              with the moduli of simply connected complete hyperbolic surfaces. Other
              applications include minimal embedded surfaces in Euclidean three sphere.   
              Riemann surfaces are an abstraction of curved surfaces; compact Riemann
              surfaces are pretzel-like surfaces (with any number of holes) where angles are
              well-defined. These surfaces originally arose in connection with solving
              polynomial equations in two variables.
