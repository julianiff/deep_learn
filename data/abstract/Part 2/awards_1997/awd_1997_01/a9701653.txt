Abstract    :
              9701653  Friedman    This award provides support for the research and
              programmatic activities of   the Institute for Mathematics and Its Applications
              (IMA) at the University   of Minnesota.  The IMA is a unique institute
              addressing a national need.    The programs of the IMA are designed to foster
              linkages among the   mathematical sciences, other sciences, and industrial
              research by identifying   problems and stimulating research in various
              interface areas of mathematical   sciences and to encourage the participation
              of mathematical scientists in   areas of application by providing an atmosphere
              conducive to   multidisciplinary research.    Yearly IMA programs are carefully
              chosen to provide a meeting ground for   mathematical scientists with engineers
              and scientists from academia,   industry, and government laboratories. The
              interaction of senior and mid-  level scholars and  postdoctoral fellows is
              designed to provide an   environment where new ideas can be developed and
              explored.  The IMA   places a high priority on the training of postdoctoral
              researchers, including   both individuals associated with the annual program
              and those participating   in the industrial postdoctoral program.  The IMA also
              supports summer   research and training programs for graduate students, as well
              as an ongoing   seminar on industrial problems.  Efforts are made to schedule
              programs of   timely research interest and where opportunities exist for
              cross-disciplinary   and programmatic collaboration and scientific exchange.  
              In addition to   National Science Foundation support, the IMA is supported by
              29   Participating Universities and 12 Participating Corporations.
