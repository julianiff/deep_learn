Abstract    :
              9701440  Jaffe  Biomedical ultrasonic imaging is an important nonivasive  method
              which permits the diagnosis of many types of  cardiovascular disease. 
              Unfortunately, the method fails  when viewing blood vessels that are either too
              small or too  deep inside the body because these features reflect very  little
              of the incident sound.  A method that we have  invented to circumvent these
              conventional limitations  consists of measuring the special characteristics of
              the  reflectivity from these structures and then crowing custom  made sonar
              waveforms which have been specifically tailored  to their reflections.  This
              grant will fund both in-vitro  and in-vivo experiments which will allow us to
              both refine  and verify the utility of the method in the lab and also in 
              clinical studies.  ***
