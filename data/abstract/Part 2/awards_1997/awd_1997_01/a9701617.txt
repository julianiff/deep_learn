Abstract    :
              The proposed research aims to intestigate models of dialogue that  can  support
              robust and flexible interaction between  people  and  computer systems.  When
              computers are used to teach users about a  new  topic  or technique, users may
              have difficulty understanding  the  knowledge  and  reasoning behind the
              system's  answers.   To  address   this   difficulty,  this  research   will  
              specify   a  computational  theory and methods to allow systems  to  vary  the 
              presentation   of  material  dynamically.    Specifically,   this  project 
              will address two important research issues.   First,  it  will   provide   a 
              specification  and  representation   of   the  linguistic,  intentional, and
              social information  that  influence  people's  understanding of an ongoing
              dialog and that  allow  for  the  detection of misunderstanding, if it should
              arise.   Second,  the  research will provide methods for integrating and 
              employing  these  information sources to produce relevant utterances and  to 
              identify  and  resolve  communication  problems  as  they  arise.  Evaluation
              of the approach will employ two tutoring systems  that  are under development:
              one that explains medical concepts and one  that  teaches  general life skills,
              such as  good  nutrition  and  budgeting.   Final  evaluation of the proposed
              research  will  be  based  on testing with end-user populations, runtime
              performance,  and technical correctness.
