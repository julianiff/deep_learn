Abstract    :
              9701486  Zhang  Researchers at RPI will extend electro-optic sampling techniques
              to free space applications for the first time.  This technique allows
              characterization of freely propagating electromagnetic waves using a transverse
              electro-optic sensor.  These sensors are suitable for real-time, video rate,
              2-D, subpicosecond far-infrared imaging applications, such as realtime THz
              imaging of moving or in vivo objects.  ***
