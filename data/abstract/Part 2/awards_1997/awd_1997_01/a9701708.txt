Abstract    :
              The research portion of this project advances the study of simultaneous 
              multithreading, a processor architecture technique aimed at increasing the 
              utilization of the execution resources in processors that issue multiple 
              instructions in each clock cycle.  The research objectives are threefold:  (1) 
              to re-evaluate memory system architecture in light of a simultaneous 
              multithreaded workload;  (2) to investigate processor issues such as 
              synchronization methods and strategies to deal with large register files;  (3) 
              to address the implications of simultaneous multithreading on the software 
              system.  The work entails revamping of an existing simulator for multithreaded 
              processors, and use of the new simulator in evaluating alternatives.    The
              educational portion concentrates on a revamping of the department curriculum 
              in computer architecture.  New graduate courses on computer architecture are 
              being introduced, and simultaneous multithreading is being integrated into the 
              core architecture courses for undergraduates.  All course work is being
              enhanced  with hands-on experimentation with instruction-level simulation.
