Abstract    :
              9701057  Kunz  Populations of social mammals typically are subdivided into
              semi-isolated breeding groups maintained by behavioral impediments to
              dispersal.  Such socially-mediated constraints on genetic exchange have been
              proposed to increase the magnitude of random drift (chance fluctuations in the
              frequencies of gene variants from one generation to the next) and genetic
              divergence among breeding groups, thereby enhancing rates of evolutionary
              change.  According to this hypothesis, the diversifying influence of random
              drift, operating independently within behaviorally-segregated breeding groups,
              is of sufficient magnitude to overpower the homogenizing effect of genetic
              exchange within and among populations.    The objective of the present study is
              to test this prediction by analyzing the distribution of genetic variation in
              natural populations of a highly social mammal, the short nosed fruit bat
              (Cynopterus sphinx), in peninsular India.  The degree of genetic subdivision
              within and among populations will be assessed in terms of (2) the frequencies
              of gene variants encoded by the nuclear genome and (2) the frequencies and
              genealogies of mitochondrial DNA sequences.  The genetic consequences of social
              structure will be examined by assessing the distribution of genetic variation
              within and among three levels of hierarchical subdivision: individuals, harem
              social groups, and geographic populations.  This nested hierarchy provides a
              framework for examining the way in which patterns of mating, dispersal, and new
              social group formation influence population-genetic structure.
