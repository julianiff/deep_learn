Abstract    :
              HRD-9701829  Cole    Clark Atlanta University, in cooperation with its sister
              United  Negro College Fund (UNCF) institutions in Georgia (Morehouse,  Morris
              Brown, Paine and Spelman Colleges), proposes to establish an  Alliance for
              Minority Participation (AMP) program.  The junior  college partner is Atlanta
              Metropolitan College and the Atlanta  Public Schools is the junior precollege
              partner.  The combined  undergraduate enrollment of the Georgia-UNCF AMP
              exceeds 15,000  with more than 55,000 precollege students.  The enrollment in
              the  sciences, engineering and mathematics (SEM) is 2,640.  The goal of  the
              program is to double the number of SEM graduates by the year  2002 based on the
              1996 rate and to improve the quality of  instruction to insure that increased
              numbers of baccalaureate  recipients go on to graduate study.  Building on the
              strengths of  each partner, this AMP will (1) increase the recruitment efforts
              of  potential SEM majors from Georgia; (2) establish or enhance  prefreshmen
              summer bridge programs for 125 students; (3) provide  financial support through
              scholarships and research assistantships;  (4) provide students with research
              experiences; (5) improve the SEM  curricula with a special emphasis on entry
              level courses; (6)  improve the instruction in entry level SEM courses; and (7)
              conduct  workshops on mentoring and peer tutoring, and establish  relationships
              with 10 graduate programs.  Dr. Thomas W. Cole, Jr.  President of Clark Atlanta
              University is Principal Investigator,  Dr. Melvin R. Webb is Project Director
              and Dr. Denise Stephenson-  Hawk is Project Co-Director.  Dr. Thomas W. Cole,
              Jr. will Chair  the AMP's Governing Board.  The National Advisory Committee
              will be  chaired by Dr. David C. Turner of the Naval Research Laboratory.  
              Each AMP institution will have a campus coordinator and an  interdisciplinary
              faculty team to work with the program.  UNCF will  provide staff resources as
              well as fund-raising and publicity  assistance.
