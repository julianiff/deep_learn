Abstract    :
              9701998  Barabasi  This is a CAREER award to a new faculty member and, as such, 
              involves both research and education.  The research  component is comprised of
              a study of the connection between  theory and experiment which aims for a
              coherent  understanding of the basic mechanisms and universality  classes
              determining the morphology of interfaces moving in  porous media.  The
              influence of disorder and fluctuations on  surface morphology will be
              investigated.  The research has  implications for oil recovery and
              environmental research.    The educational part of the award involves utilizing
              the  world wide web for improving graduate courses.  A  comprehensive database
              will be developed of instructional  materials available on the web.  Effective
              incorporation of  this material into the curriculum will result in a virtual 
              meta-course.  %%%  This is a CAREER award to a new faculty member and, as such,
