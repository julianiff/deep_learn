Abstract    :
                This is a proposal to assemble a data set that can be used to  investigate the
              precise timing of substorms.  The PI will initiate  a GEM campaign called the
              Substorm Precision Timing Campaign and be  responsible for developing the
              campaign, advertising it to the NSF  community, building the data base,
              stimulating research on the data  base, conducting meetings at GEM workshops,
              organizing symposia to  discuss results of the campaign, and directing efforts
              to obtain  publication of the results.
