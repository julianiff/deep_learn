              Washington State University    Title:  Research Planning Grant:  Nonlinear
              Optical Near Field Microscopy      This is a Research Planning Grant funds to
              initiate a program to develop nonlinear optical spectroscopic techniques in a
              Near Field Optical Microscopy configuration.  Optical surfaces where low
              frequency electrical fields are present will be probed. Such electrical fields
              are certainly present in VLSI and sub-micron electronic circuits due to the
              large electrical current densities present but direct measurement techniques
              have been lacking. With the proposed approach it should be possible to probe
              such fields with sub-micron resolution.
