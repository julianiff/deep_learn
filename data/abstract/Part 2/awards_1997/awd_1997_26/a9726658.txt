Abstract    :
               Brazil has long been known for the diversity of its social and racial identity,
              with lots of ways for people to identify along racial and ethnic dimensions, in
              contrast to the US where the social identity of race was forced into a binary
              black-white contrast. More recently a US style black-white oppositional style
              of political identity has been growing in Brazil.  This project involves the
              dissertation research of an anthropology student from the University of
              Michigan, studying race, class and collective political action in Brazil.  The
              student will study political activities and social implications of membership
              in three neighborhood carnival and political associations in Salvador, a focal
              point for Afro-Brazilian political mobilization.  One group represents the
              while elite, another traditional black culture, and the third represents
              contemporary a black power movement.  The project will test three hypotheses,
              that the salience of a new `black` Brazilian identity is growing at the expense
              of intermediate racial-ethnic-cultural categories  with which a majority of
              local people have traditionally identified; that the common racial identity
              will be more salient as a ground for common interest than the diverse class,
              educational, residential, gender or age identities; and that the newer `black
              identity` organizations will weaken the older vertical, patron-client relations
              that have structured local politics in the past.  The student will conduct
              participant observation in the groups as well as administer questionnaires to a
              sample survey of 60 members of each.  In addition formal life histories will be
              elicited from a smaller number of members. This research will expand our
              knowledge of this important region of the world, advance the training of a
              young social scientist, and provide new knowledge about changes in race as an
              organizing principle in Brazilian society.
