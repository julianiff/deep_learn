Abstract    :
              9726009  Hemming    A major challenge to earth scientists is to document past
              changes in the earth's atmosphere and chemistry, and to constrain the causes of
              those changes.  We propose to use the boron isotopic composition of mid-Miocene
              benthic foraminifera to test the hypothesis of Woodruff and Savin (1991) that
              the "Monterey Excursion", a time of anomalously high d13C compositions in
              benthic foraminifera, was the result of carbon fixation which lowered
              atmospheric CO2.  The boron isotopic composition of foraminifera is an ideal
              way to test this hypothesis, as the lower pCO2 should result in higher ocean pH
              (and hence higher d11B values) at this interval.  The ability to determine
              paleo-pH will allow us to better understand the CO2-H2O equilibrium between
              oceans and atmosphere in the past, which will contribute to our knowledge of
              global climate change and the processes that lead to glaciations.  This in turn
              may help us to better understand recent changes in earth's chemistry, such as
              the 30% increase in atmospheric CO2 that resulted from fossil fuel burning.   
              Recent evidence suggests that the boron isotopic composition of carbonates is
              controlled by the pH of their parent fluid (e.g., Vengosh et al., 1991; Hemming
              and Hanson, 1992; Spivack et al., 1993; Hemming et al., 1995).  Success in the
              application of boron isotopes as a pH proxy for Pleistocene glacial oceans
              (Sanyal et al., 1995; Sanyal et al., in press) lays the foundation for looking
              at ocean chemistry further back in geologic time.  The viability of this tool
              is dependent on preservation of a primary marine signal in the foraminifera. 
              The marine composition appears to be preserved in the samples studied by Sanyal
              et al. (1995), but preservation needs to be evaluated in older samples.  The
              time interval of interest to our study was a period of particularly high
              preservation, so we are reasonably confident that it will be possible to
              determine primary marine boron isotope signatures through the mid-Miocene.
