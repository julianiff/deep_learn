Abstract    :
              9726584  Stern    The project is to conduct finite-amplitude numerical 
              calculations of salt fingers in an unbounded domain with  uniform vertical
              temperature and salinity gradient.  The  research will focus initially on an
              asymptotic state in the  vicinity of absolute thermohaline instability. It is 
              intended to obtain predictions for the rms  T-S fluctuations, which are
              testable in future sugar-salt  experiments.  Some insight into the ergodic
              question might  be obtained from the simpler two-dimensional small epsilon 
              case.
