Abstract    :
              The research will investigate how modern  organizations, comprising interlocked 
               ensembles of people and information technologies, can be understood as
              `intelligent   organizations.`  As modern organizations redefine how they
              develop, process, and   assimilate information and manage knowledge, they are
              increasingly being conceived as   large-scale, distributed `cognitive' systems,
              with properties and processes such as   organizational memory, organizational
              learning, and organizational intelligence.  This   project aims to build an
              empirically-grounded framework and associated metrics for   understanding the
              phenomenon of organizational intelligence. The research will explore   ways to
              conceptualize and measure organizational intelligence, and will develop a sound
                conceptual framework comprising variables that are related to organizational
              intelligence   and interrelationships among them. These variables will capture
              elements of organizational   structure, information technology and systems,
              culture, knowledge assets, stakeholder   relationships, and strategic
              processes. Both review and empirical methods including   interviewing will be
              used.  The resulting framework will form a basis for operationalizing   the
              concept of organizational intelligence, and for studying it widely with
              empirical   approaches. It  will provide and disseminate insights and
              conceptual tools upon which   other researchers can build.
