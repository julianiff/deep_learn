Abstract    :
              Kleppa  9726699    This grant supports systematic investigations of the 
              thermochemistry of refractory materials.  These studies are  based on
              applications of a unique high-temperature reaction  calorimeter which is
              operated continuously at temperatures  up to about 1500K.  This calorimeter was
              developed with  special support from the NSF in 1987-88. During the coming 
              three years this investigation will be extended to the  compounds formed by the
              mildly radioactive actinide elements  thorium and uranium with the late
              transition metals and the  noble metals. The investigations plan a special
              modification  of the unique high-temperature reaction calorimeter which  will
              allow measurements of heats of mixing the heats of  solution in binary liquid
              alloys at temperatures up to about  1500K without introducing one of the two
              reactants from room  temperature.  The goal is to better understand the basis
              for  how thermodynamic properties of a binary system depends on  the character
              of its two constituents.  %%%  There have been few calorimetric studies of the 
              thermodynamic properties of uranium and thorium alloys based  on binaries with
              the transition metals.  This work adds to  the enthalpy data base for binary
              compounds of these  elements.  ***
