Abstract    :
              This award supports Dr. Frederick F. Lange, a postdoc, and three graduate
              students from   the University of California-Santa Barbara in a collaboration
              with Fritz Aldinger and   Wolfgang Sigmond of the Institute of Non-Metallic
              Inorganic Materials at the University   of Stuttgart.  Both groups are working
              on developing short-range repulsive potentials for   silicon nitride (Si3N4)
              powders to allow consolidated powder bodies to have a clay-like   consistency
              needed for forming reliable engineering shapes.  The U.S. group has already  
              shown that short-range potentials can be created for Si3N4.  The German group
              are   investigating various chem-adsorption techniques, and are studying the
              processes involved   with state-of-the-art methods and facilities such as
              Atomic Force Microscopy.  Silicon   nitride is the most promising structural
              ceramic for use in advanced heat engines.
