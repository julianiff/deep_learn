Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9726176  Rozgoni      In order to be competitive in the integrated
              circuit industry, silicon chip manufacturers must continually strive to
              decrease the feature size of the components of the integrated circuits.  A
              smaller feature size enables the chip manufacturers to both make smaller chips,
              fulfilling the market demand for ever smaller electronics, and to increase the
              yield of chips per silicon wafer, decreasing the cost per chip.  In order to
              ensure high quality chips in high yields, the base material, the silicon wafer,
              must be as free from bulk and surface defects and imperfections as possible. 
              It is estimated that in order to meet production demands in the year 2007,
              defect densities in silicon wafers must be below 0.01 per cm2.  It is currently
              not known how this goal will be reached at a cost the industry can afford.  The
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Silicon Wafer Engineering
              and Defect Science (Si Weds) plans to provide critical solutions to increase
              yield, performance and reliability of silicon materials.  The center is based
              at North Carolina State University, and is a partnership between Arizona State
              University, the University of Arizona, UC Berkeley, MIT, the University of
              South Florida, and Stanford University.
