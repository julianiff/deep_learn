Abstract    :
              9726607   Ranker      This study is a three-way collaboration between Dr. Thomas
              Ranker of the University of Colorado, and colleagues, Dr. Alan R. Smith at the
              University of California, Berkeley, and Dr. Christopher H. Haufler at the
              University of Kansas, that builds upon the previous successful collaborative
              efforts of fern researchers.  This major research initiative will increase our
              understanding of the evolution and diversification of seedless vascular land
              plants. The goals of the proposed research are to explore groupings of related
              species of two advanced fern families (Polypodiaceae and Grammitidaceae), their
              evolutionary relationships and geographical histories, and morphological
              changes through time.  The 1000 species of ferns are well represented in the
              tropical regions around the world and have relatively few temperate members,
              except for the genus Polypodium itself. Although ferns in general are ancient
              plants, recent analyses of the relationships of fern families suggest that
              species in these two families originated more recently than any other ferns. 
              Such a recent origin suggests that a greater proportion of species in these two
              families should be extant than in other more ancient groups where extinction
              may have eliminated some groups; efforts to reconstruct the genealogical
              history of this group may be more successful than those of more ancient,
              derived groups. This research will consider a large number of species, and will
              attempt to sample all  of about 50 recognized genera and subgenera from both
              the New World and Old World.   Morphological characters and DNA sequences from
              at least three chloroplast genes will be used in analyses designed to construct
              hypotheses of the evolutionary history of these families.  Quantitative
              techniques will be used for inferring the historical biogeography of the ferns.
