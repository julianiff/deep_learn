Abstract    :
              Abstract    This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) award.  Dr. 
              Eisenberg and his colleagues propose to use the methods of  semiconductor
              science to analyze electric current flow through  ionic channels of known three
              dimensional structure in biological  systems. Ionic channels are protein
              molecules found in all living  cells and are of great technological and
              scientific importance to  both fundamental understanding of biology as well as
              practical  application of biological principles for product development in  the
              fields of health, energy, and environment .  This research is  based on the
              concept that the mathematical models used to  describe the properties of ionic
              channels and semiconductors are  nearly the same. This project is designed to
              test that concept.
