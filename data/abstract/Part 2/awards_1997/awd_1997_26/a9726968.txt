Abstract    :
              9726968  Brown    This project is to continue light and electron microscopic
              studies on the role of the cytoskeleton in pollen morphogenesis in higher
              plants.  The project will be a comparison of pollen development in three
              systems:  orchids (Orchidaceae), grasses (Poaceae) and sedges (Cyperaceae). 
              The developing pollen cells of each exhibit a complex but characteristic set of
              meiotic and mitotic divisions, nuclear movements, and other events that
              establish polarized or asymmetric pollen structures.  Based on detailed
              descriptions of normal events, experiments are designed in which either the
              microtubule or actin arrays are perturbed to assess the role these cytoskeletal
              elements play in determining the developmental patterns of the pollen.  Cells
              will be exposed to various drugs (colchicine, cytochalasin D) known to affect
              microtubules or actin filaments, specific antibodies (anti-gamma tubulin,
              anti-integrins) and other agents in order to disrupt those cytoskeletal
              elements which appear to be involved in specific cellular events during pollen
              formation.  Experiments will also be undertaken to examine the role of
              apoptosis.  The project will provide fundamental comparative information on
              pollen development in higher plants and will document basic mechanisms by which
              the cytoskeleton determines cell polarity and tissue asymmetry.  ***
