Abstract    :
                This two-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research aimed
              at   analysis of high precision variations of the Earth's gravity field
              obtained by a global   network of superconducting gravimeters.  The
              collaboration involves the research groups   of David Crossley at Saint Louis
              University and Jacques Hinderer of the Geophysics   Institute in Strasbourg,
              France.  This project is part of the Global Geodynamics Project   (GGP), which
              is an international six-year effort to record the Earth's gravity field using  
              superconducting gravimeters.  The investigators will manage the scientific and
              technical   program of the GGP and cooperate on the analysis of the data and an
              approach for   separating the actual planetary effects from local station
              noise.    This project will advance understanding of the dynamics associated
              with the Earth's   interior, especially the rotations of the liquid outer core
              and solid inner core.  In addition,   it will contribute to knowledge about
              Earth-atmosphere-ocean interactions.
