Abstract    :
              Lukehart  9726956  The third Gordon Research Conference on Biology of the
              Spirochetes is being held in January, 1998.  This conference is the only
              ongoing international meeting devoted to basic research on spirochetes, which
              is a separate phylum of the Bacteria.  These organisms have a unique but common
              overall structure and mode of motility.  There are both free living spirochetes
              and also those associated with parasitism of arthropod hosts including termites
              and ticks, and also mammals.  Some species have been found to augment
              degradation of polymers such as cellulose.  The free living organisms are
              ubiquitous and are found in both fresh and salt water, and some species among
              the largest prokaryotic organisms yet described.  Many of these organisms are
              very difficult to study because of their inability to be cultivated in vitro
              and because of the lack of a facile genetic system for creating mutants. 
              Nonetheless, this is one of the most rapidly growing areas in general
              microbiology and genomic research.  The first two Gordon Research Conferences
              were held in 1994 and 1996; both were attended to the capacity allowed by the
              Gordon Conference guidelines, and both were judged by the participants to be
              among the most useful and stimulating meetings ever attended.  The 1998
              conference, which is anticipated to have approximately 135 attendees, will agin
              provide a forum for scientists, including faculty, graduate students, and
              postdoctoral fellows from the United  States and abroad, to discuss recent
              developments and ideas regarding the biology of the spirochetes funds are
              provided to support participation by beginning investigators.
