Abstract    :
                9726458  Allen    This project aims to investigate a variety of basic
              materials  issues in thin films and at interfaces, e.g., coalescence during 
              initial stages of film growth, silicide formation with restricted  dimensions,
              and dimensional stability and reflow of aluminum  nanostructures through the
              use of  a recently developed  nanocalorimetry technique.  The proposed research
              seeks new  insights into effects of particle/cluster/island size and of 
              surfaces in stability and kinetics of materials, and to reveal  new information
              about behavior of materials at nanometer length  scales.  %%%  The project
              addresses basic research issues in a topical area of  materials science having
              high technological relevance.  The  research will contribute basic materials
              science knowledge at a  fundamental level to important aspects of
              electronic/photonic  materials.  The fundamental knowledge and understanding
              gained  from the research is expected to contribute to improving the 
              performance and stability of advanced devices and circuits by  providing a
              fundamental understanding and a basis for designing  and producing improved
              materials, and materials combinations.  An  important feature of the program is
              the integration of research  and education through the training of students in
              a fundamentally  and technologically significant area.  ***
