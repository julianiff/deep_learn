Abstract    :
              Rapid expansion of wireless communication services during the last decade  is
              expected to continue at an even faster pace in the future.  This growth 
              creates a demand for novel modulation, coding, and detection methods  suitable
              for the rapidly varying multipath fading channels encountered in  mobile radio.
               We propose to investigate a new approach to the estimation  and prediction of
              the fading channel which does not rely on statistical  characterization.  In
              this method, the physical nature of the flat fading  signal is exploited to
              yield a deterministic model that predicts the  channel for an entire block of
              data.  Specifically, the mobile radio signal  is decomposed into several
              scattered components distinguished by their  Doppler shifts;  the slowly
              varying parameters associated with these  components are determined and
              tracked, and the composite fading signal is  predicted.  This approach may
              potentially result in the ability to  anticipate and compensate for the "deep
              fades that severely limit the  performance of wireless communication systems
              and will aid in the  development of low-power mobile radio systems.
