Abstract    :
              Software tools are defined as abstract tools that can be  programmed to vector
              field systems to perform a desired task,  such as centering, rotating and
              filtering field configurations.  Hardware tools are defined as generic objects
              that can interact  with other objects being manipulated by the vector field
              system,  in manners that are suitable for mechanical assembly operations. 
              Examples of hardware tools include grippers, sliders, compliant  fixtures, etc.
              These tools can be viewed as basic building blocks  of micro-assembly
              manipulation tasks, that together define an API  for the development and
              specification of micro manipulation  strategies in a modular way, using a "high
              level language".  This  research will investigate utility tools on both
              sensorles and  sensor-based frameworks. Path planning in a compliant 
              accommodating vector force field system will also be  investigated.
