Abstract    :
              Smith  9726425    Tropical rainforests are renowned for their extraordinary
              diversity of  species. Birds are prominent in this regard, as tropical
              rainforests  contain a spectacular array of unique species having no parallel
              elsewhere.  However, the specific evolutionary mechanisms that generate
              biodiversity  are poorly understood. In this proposal, morphologic and genetic
              data will  be gathered to test a new hypothesis for rainforest speciation. This
               hypothesis postulates that ecotones, small rainforest fragments that exist  in
              the grasslands outside the central rainforest, are habitats in which new 
              adaptations and new species appear that can enrich the biodiversity of  central
              rainforests. Natural selection in ecotone populations of three  rainforest bird
              species will be quantified and the morphologic divergence  between them and
              central rainforest populations will be estimated.    Although this study
              addresses fundamental evolutionary questions, it also  has important
              conservation implications for sub-Saharan Africa. Centrally  located rainforest
              areas are presently the main focus of conservation  efforts, whereas ecotone
              regions are rapidly being lost due to overgrazing,  burning and wood harvesting
              with little or no effort toward their  conservation. Such ecotone regions are
              assumed to be less important because  they are mosaics of pure habitat types
              that may contain fewer species and  smaller, more unstable populations. 
              However, it is possible that these  transition areas between forest and savanna
              are important sources of  evolutionary novelty that contribute to rainforest
              biodiversity.            \\Clm-06\debpop\POPBIO\ABSTRACT\SMITH425.ABS
