Abstract    :
              9726445  Handel  Spatial relationships can have strong influences on the
              structure and function of ecological communities, and restoration experiments
              can be used to explore those influences during formative phases of community
              development. The context of this research is the failure of natural succession
              to woodland on urban, derelict lands. The experimental approach is to test
              methods for stimulating woodland development, studying above- and belowground
              processes that promote or inhibit succession.    In an on-going experiment on a
              large tract of highly disturbed land, the Fresh Kills Landfill in New York
              City, clusters of woody plants have been established as successional inocula.
              The clusters are arrayed in different patch sizes to assess the development of
              mutualisms, the role of herbivory, and the limitations of soil processes on
              establishment and rates of restoration. Funding for the current proposal will
              allow these investigators to continue this valuable long-term restoration
              experiment. Results from this research will provide explicit practical
              information for the restoration of degraded lands. In addition, this project
              will provide experimental tests of questions derived from the large body of
              theory on ecological succession.
