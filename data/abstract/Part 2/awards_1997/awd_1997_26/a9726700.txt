Abstract    :
              9726700  Dolan     With this planning grant, the staff of the Bucks County
              Historical Society will work with a group of museum professionals and community
              representatives to develop plans for interactive exhibits that have science and
              math content that will be placed in an outdoor park.  They want visitors to
              learn about the science, history, and aesthetics of early American hand tools
              and technology by experiencing various hands-on activities.  The planning
              activities will include meetings of the planning committees, front-end
              evaluation, and the testing of some prototype activities.  At the end of the
              twelve month planing period they will have 1) a better understanding of their
              audience and their knowledge of the science and technology to be presented in
              the exhibit, 2) a schematic design for the activities to be included in the
              park, 3) plans for complementary educational activities, and 4) results of
              prototype testing of selected activities
