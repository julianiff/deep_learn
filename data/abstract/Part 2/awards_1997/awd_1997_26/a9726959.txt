Abstract    :
                  Richey  9726959    This is a 12-month award proposed Drs. Jeffrey Richey and
               Marc Hershman, the University of Washington, collaborating  with Mr. Tolentino
              Moya, Mr. Anond Snidvongs, and Mr. Jariya  Boonjawaat of the Asian Region of
              the International  Geosphere-Biosphere Programme.  Dr. Jeffrey Richey requests 
              funds to support one post-doctoral student  and one graduate  student and
              travel support to put together network based  virtual workshops. The purpose of
              these workshops is to  advance the application of an integrated regional river 
              basin model for the East Asia and the Pacific Region.  These  workshops will
              use a customized  Internet-based  communication system to link the existing
              sites and  institutions under the International Geosphere-Biosphere  Programme
              (IGBP) and sister organizations in the Asia-  Pacific.  The project uses new
              communication tools for  carrying out international modeling study and
              conducting  virtual workshops through Internet, and provides  opportunities for
              U.S. students to work with their  Asian  counterparts through the Internet.
