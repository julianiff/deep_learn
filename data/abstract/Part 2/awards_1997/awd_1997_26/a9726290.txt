Abstract    :
                    9726290    Abstract    Funds are solicited to help sponsor a seventh
              scientific meeting on plant-herbivore interactions as a Gordon Conference on
              22-27 February in Ventura California.  The six previous meetings on such
              interactions have proven highly productive and made substantial contributions
              to progress in ecology.  This session would lead to continued progress in the
              field particularly in the areas of biochemical and morphological plant
              defenses, multi-trophic interactions, assessing the costs of anti-herbivore
              defenses, the evolution and coevolution of plan-herbivore interactions. 
              Solicited funds would partially support the participation of 26 speakers and 8
              graduate students and post-docs at the conference.
