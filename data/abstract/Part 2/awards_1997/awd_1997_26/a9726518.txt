Abstract    :
              9726518  Raber  This award is to support a study to be conducted by the 
              National Research Council (NRC) to review the roles of the  various federal
              agencies in planning, constructing, and  operating facilities that provide
              synchrotron radiation,  neutron beams, and high magnetic field capability for
              the  study of materials, including biological, structural, and  electronic
              materials.  The NRC will conduct a study through  consultation with the broader
              scientific community on the  emerging and anticipated needs for the
              capabilities these  facilities offer.  Representatives from the academic 
              community ,industry, and government will be invited to  participate.  The study
              will recommend guidelines to the  agencies based on the projected scientific
              and technical  methods needed to characterize materials, and the future  roles
              of the various agencies in a resource-limited  environment.  The guidelines wil
              consider collaboration and  coordination between the agencies in planning
              future  facilities, and will identify means to optimize the roles of  the
              agencies, the states and the private sector, to make the  most effective use of
              their respective strengths in the  context of evolving user communities and
              changing national  and international resources.  The estimated time for 
              producing a report is one year from the date of this award.  This project is
              partially supported by the Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities and the
              Division of Materials  Research at the National Science Foundation, the
              National  Institutes of Health, the National Institute of Science and 
              Technology, and the Department of Energy.  ***
