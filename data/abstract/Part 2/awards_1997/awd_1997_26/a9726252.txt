Abstract    :
              9726252  Anderson    The PI will conduct an interdisciplinary study of mantle
              dynamics,  from the earth's surface downward.  Plates, including cratons and 
              slabs, exert a strong control on mantle motions and surface  volcanism. 
              Lithospheric architecture and stress in the plates  will be correlated with
              global gravity, bathymetry, tomography and  volcanism datasets in order to sort
              out surface vs. internal  causes, and to explain island chains and large
              igneous provinces.  Mineral physics and constraints from geochemistry,
              cosmochemistry  and heat flow will be used to interpret mantle tomography and 
              large-scale variations of flow and composition.  ***
