Abstract    :
              Circuit simulators are often used to analyze non-electrical problems when it is 
              noted that such a problem has an analogous electrical description. This is 
              certainly the case for micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). But it should
              be  noted that circuit simulators have been greatly optimized over the years
              for the  analysis of large transistor circuits, and cannot be used to simulate
              MEMS  designs. In fact, general purpose simulators, such as SCEPTRE, have
              fallen into  disuse. This research explores the possibility of a MEMS-specific
              simulation  tool, with a focus on the questions: 1. Is nodal formulation and
              traditional  circuit simulation the best way to simulate MEMS?  2. If not, is
              the potential  improvement significant enough to justify a specific tool?  A
              prototype simulator  in MATLAB is being built to demonstrate concepts. This
              borrows from prior work  on circuit simulation. Applications of algorithms,
              such as Asymptotic Waveform  Evaluation (AWE), and successive chords for
              nonlinear iteration, are being  investigated for simulation of MEMS.
