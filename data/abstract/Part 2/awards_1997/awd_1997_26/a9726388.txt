              in CISE:  Crack Propagation on Teraflop Computers    This research effort will
              focus on the design of algorithms and systems to support the numerical
              simulation of crack propagation problems on parallel computers.  The specific
              focus is on 3-dimensional, time-dependent fracture simulations using
              unstructured, adaptive grids on the IBM SP-2 and on EARTH-MANNA, a machine
              based on a fine-grain, multiheaded program execution model.  The effort will
              involve three major tasks:    Design and implement 3-D adaptive, parallel mesh
              generators producing meshes of provably good quality    Develop and implement
              restructuring compiler technology that will support the automatic generation of
              efficient parallel code, starting equations that arise in the simulation   
              Evaluate the adequacy of existing thread generation and load balancing
              mechanisms on the parallel  platforms, and reimplement those mechanisms for
              crack propagation studies
