Abstract    :
              This SGER award will support analysis of stable isotopes in  individual 
              specimens of planktic foraminifera collected in sediment  traps from the 
              equatorial Pacific and off Bermuda.  The objective is to  determine whether 
              isotopic ratios are dependent upon ambient-water alkalinity  as observed in 
              controlled laboratory experiments.  If an alkalinity effect  exists and can  be
              quantified, published interpretations of changes in ocean  production, 
              circulation, and pCO2 based upon foraminiferal isotope data  will require 
              revision.
