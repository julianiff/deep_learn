Abstract    :
              Investigators continue their quantitative observations of the solar calcium
              K-line, as well as data reduction.  Data is compared with UARS observations so
              that future predictions of solar ultraviolet emission are available, regardless
              of spacecraft status.  In addition, they are developing other indices using
              synoptic Big Bear data, and continuing digital measurements of white-light
              emission of the Sun, particularly for determining sunspot areas and comparing
              with solar constant data.  Finally, they are investigating the role of
              different magnetic features in constituting the K-line.
