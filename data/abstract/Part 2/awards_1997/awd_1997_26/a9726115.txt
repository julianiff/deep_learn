Abstract    :
              Abstract - Ydstie - 9726115    Distributed Processing Units (DPU's) pick up
              information as needed to perform control calculations, local optimization, data
              reconciliation, filtering and/or dynamic simulation.  Processing speed and
              reliability are high due to parallelism and redundancy - a distributed system
              can continue to function even if a "stable" DPU goes down.  Distributed
              computation makes it easy to update hardware and software.  Members of an
              engineering team can change process equipment and modify control algorithms in
              sequence or parallel without loosing stability.  Control systems in industry
              are distributed for reasons of computational efficiency, safety and cost.   
              The PI's plan to develop systematic procedures and computational tools for the
              synthesis of distributed control systems.  The research will address the
              following problems: (1) how to design distributed control systems; (2) how to
              perform dynamic simulation in a distributed network of computers; and (3) how
              to address the interaction between design and control.  The broader aim is to
              develop a theoretically consistent and workable theory for chemical process
              control which takes into account the process physics in an effective manner.
