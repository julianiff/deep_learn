              Title:  Development of a 4.8 nm  laser in transition to ground state of Boron-V
                 Development of soft x-ray lasers at the very short wavelengths will be
              investigated. Compact soft x-ray lasers will have many important applications
              in biology and materials science.  In this work, the x-ray generation is based
              on rapid recombination of plasmas created by optical field ionization (OFI).
              OFI in hydrogen-like Lithium-II, hydrogen-like Boron-V and hydrogen-like
              Carbon-VI will be explored. The work will include modeling of the confinement
              of the plasma by the microcapillary configuration in addition to experimental
              investigation.
