                               This grant is awarded through the Separations and Purification
                     Program sub-element of the Interfacial, Transport and Separations       
              Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division. The principal       
              investigator is Dr. Steven Strauss from Colorado State University. The       
              research will develop a series of redox-active metal-complex        extractants
              to  extract target ions from aqueous waste streams. The        novelty of the
              research is the fact that the proposed technology may        lead to
              extractants that are recyclable, with contaminant recovery in       
              concentrated form, thereby minimizing disposal volumes. The        extractants
              are ferrocenes and the target ions are typically ionic        species.   The
              closed cycle scheme proposed involves recognition and        linking of the
              contaminant  ions to the  ferrocene extractant, removal        of the ionic
              species,  and reactivation of the ferrocene. The        extraction selectivity
              can be modified through chemical modifications        of the ferrocenes, and
              the PI proposes to study a class of polydentate        ferrocenes where the
              ligands can be chemically modified by design to        target specific ions.   
                           The development of molecular recognition compounds is of
              tremendous        importance to separation and extraction processes associated
              with        environmental technologies. The development of rugged, recylable   
                  extractants wi th molecular recognition characteristics can have a       
              major impact on separations technology and pollution prevention.
