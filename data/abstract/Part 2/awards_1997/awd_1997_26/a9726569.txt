              ABSTRACT    Proposal #9726569 (Frank and Groffman)    Title:  THE SUSTAINABILITY
              OF GRAZING ECOSYSTEMS    Institution:  SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY    This research
              examines the question of whether large herbivores actually contribute to the
              sustainability of grasslands that they occupy, through their effects on soil
              carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) processes. The prevalent view that herbivores
              decrease belowground productivity is not supported by results from Yellowstone
              National Park, where grazers appear to increase belowground production,
              particularly the input of labile soil C.  The hypothesis to be tested is that
              the promotion of labile C input by grazers is fundamental to acceleration of
              nutrient cycling in Yellowstone and may be critical in sustaining the energy
              and nutrient dynamics of Yellowstone and other grazed ecosystems. This work
              addresses three questions in Yellowstone: (1) How do grazers affect soil C
              input? (2) How do grazers influence soil C-N linkages?  (3)  What effects do
              the plant growth and allocation traits that are selected for in grazed
              grassland have on sustaining soil processes?  Answers to these questions are
              important because abundant large herbivores and grasslands have coexisted for
              millennia, yet our current view of the effects of these animals on grassland
              processes suggest inherent instabilities of grazing ecosystems.  Because 50% or
              more of the Earth's land surface is grazed by large herbivores, increasing our
              knowledge of how herbivores influence ecosystem C accumulation and N cycling
              should significantly improve our understanding of terrestrial effects on global
              C and N cycles.
