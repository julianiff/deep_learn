Forest ecologists attempt to understand forest dynamics
              through the development of spatially-explicit simulation models that describe
              individual-level interactions. One such model is known as SORTIE. The SORTIE
              model is relatively recent and fairly highly regarded by community ecologists,
              despite limited validation. This proposed investigation will use a long-term
              data set on tree demography to parameterize and validate a forest dynamics
              simulation model known as SORTIE. One strength of this project is the
              application of the model to a forest community quite different from that for
              which it was developed.  The investigation will combine field studies, analysis
              of long-term plot data and simulations.  An important focus of the project is
              to assess the sufficiency of shade tolerance to the theory of forest dynamics
              by evaluating the performance of SORTIE in predicting several elements of
              forest structure and dynamics.
