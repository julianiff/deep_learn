Abstract    :
              Research would be undertaken to evaluate a six-dimensional state  space model
              for the basic energy components of the night-side  magnetosphere coupled to the
              ionosphere by region 1 currents.  This  model provides a physics based
              alternative to empirical forecasting  techniques.  The evaluation of this
              physics based model with  involve (1) a critical comparison of the model
              results to data-  based prediction filters, (2) couple the model to particle 
              simulations, comparing the results to geomagnetic indices within  the Bargatze
              event data set, and compare the model's nonlinear  dynamical response to that
              of the magnetosphere as deduced from  state space analysis of magnetosphere as
              deduced from state space  analysis of magnetospheric variables.
