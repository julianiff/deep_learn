Abstract    :
              9726229  Manson  This senior PI has enjoyed a long-standing support for 
              theoretical research on scattering of atoms from surfaces  and adsorbates.  He
              has developed a formalism to study an  important aspect of inelastic
              scattering, namely one which  involves creation of several lattice phonons of
              the target.  In this grant he is planning to extend this formalism to  include
              the presence of an adsorbate,  and in particular  complex multi atom objects,
              e.g. hydrocarbons.  He is  planning to study the role of the adsorbate internal
              degrees  of freedom in inelastic atom-surface scattering.  There are  in
              addition several associated projects of fundamental  importance.  One considers
              the development of surface  sticking in both quantum and classical regimes and
              which  leads to considerations of energy accommodation coefficients  and lift
              and drag coefficients .  In another project, the PI  plans to consider the
              scattering of a metastable Helium  atom.  This work will involve collaboration
              with  experimental groups at the Florida State University, the  University of
              North Carolina and the Max Planck Institute at  Gottingen.  %%%  This renewal
              grant to a senior PI is in support of  theoretical work on scattering of atoms
              from surfaces,  especially aspects of energy loss during scattering.  This 
              grant includes study of the role of atoms and molecules  present at the
              surface, especially as the energy is shared  between the internal vibrations
              and oscillations of these  atoms (or molecules) and the heating of the target. 
              He will  also consider the characteristics of scattering of highly  excited
              projectiles and the associated questions about  sticking and energy loss.  ***
