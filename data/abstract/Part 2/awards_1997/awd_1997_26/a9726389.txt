Abstract    :
              9726389  Goldberg, Kenneth  University of California-Berkeley    Challenges in
              CISE: Planning and Control for Massively Parallel Manipulation    Increased
              miniaturization of mass-produced products such as disk drives,   displays, and
              sensors requires fundamental innovations in design and parts   handling. Many
              of the components in these products will be integrated circuits and MEMS (Micro
              Electro Mechanical Systems) fabricated with massively parallel wafer etching
              technology. Conventional pick and place robotic techniques are inadequate for
              the efficient assembly of these micron-scale components. This proposal
              addresses an entirely new methodology founded on recent insights from
              sensorless and minimalist robotics: massively parallel manipulation.    The
              idea is to move parts using planar forces and moments that require a minimum of
              sensing and servoing. The shape of the field, as defined by the magnitude and
              direction of the force at each point, can be designed to position, align, sort,
              and assemble arrays of small parts in parallel.    Planar force fields have
              enormous potential for precise parallel assembly of small parts. The goal of
              the research is to develop an entirely new methodology for precision part
              manipulation and to demonstrate it with new theory, algorithms, and
              high-performance devices. This research has the potential to parallelize the
              manufacture of a new generation of consumer and industrial products.
