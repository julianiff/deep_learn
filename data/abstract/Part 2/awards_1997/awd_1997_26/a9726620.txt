Abstract    :
              This award supports Drs. Carol Haney, Dale Sayers, Dean Hesterberg and a
              graduate   student from the North Carolina State University in a collaboration
              with Norbert Stoll of   the Department of Automation Engineering at the
              University of Rostock.  The   collaboration brings together the complementary
              capabilities of the German and U.S.   groups to develop methods for the
              extraction, preparation, and analysis of soil and water   samples containing
              arsenic.  The samples will be collected from a World War II chemical   weapons
              manufacture site in the eastern part of Germany.  Preliminary indications are
              that   the site has significant contamination from both organic and inorganic
              arsenic compounds.    The goals of the research are a complete characterization
              of the arsenic-containing   compounds at the site, determination of the
              mechanisms by which organic arsenic   compounds are transformed into inorganic
              compounds in different locations and soil types,   and development of
              remediation techniques.  Analytical methods to be used are gas  
              chromatography, high-pressure liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, and
              x-ray   absorption spectroscopy.
