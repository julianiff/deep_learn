Abstract    :
               Throughout the developing world, educated women bear fewer children, and bear
              them later than do uneducated women.  Demographic modernization theory proposes
              that schooling itself induces women to bear fewer children; this project
              suggests instead that cumulative processes of selection over the life course
              produce the observed correlation. Selection includes both intentional choices
              and the structural contexts in which people make choices.  This dissertation
              project involves an anthropology student from Northwestern University, studying
              how processes of selection into and out of a Catholic school in Cameroon,
              Africa, influence the life-historical moment at which a woman bears her first
              child.  The project will collect demographic event histories and conduct open
              ended life history interviews with students and former students of a private
              secondary school. The parents will be interviewed about socialization and
              schooling choices for their children, and preadolescent girls will be
              interviewed about their aspirations for school, career and family.  Finally the
              student will conduct participant observation at the school itself to understand
              the social organization of the school and its effect on the student's perceived
              opportunities.  This research is important because it will advance our
              understanding of a key relationship affecting population growth in the
              developing world, as well as contribute to the training of young social
              scientist and advancing our expertise about this important region of the world.
