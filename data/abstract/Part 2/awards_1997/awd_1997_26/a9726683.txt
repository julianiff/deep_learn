Abstract    :
              9726683  Vesecky    Research will be undertaken in response to an Announcement
              of   Opportunity (NSF 97-38)for Coastal Studies in the Great Lakes.    This
              collaborative research project between investigators from 13   academic and
              government research institutions is being conducted   under the auspices of the
              NSF Coastal Ocean Processes (CoOP)   program and the NOAA Coastal Ocean
              Program.    This 5-year research program will focus on the importance of  
              episodic events on nearshore-offshore transport and subsequent   ecological
              consequences. The study seeks to 1) determine what   processes control the
              cross-margin (inshore to offshore)   transport of biological, chemical, and
              geological materials in   the coastal margins of the Great Lakes, and to 2)
              develop and   test scientific strategies for assessing, quantifying, and  
              predicting the impacts of multiple stresses both natural and   anthropogenic,
              in the Great Lakes or selected coastal sub-  regions.    A tight coupling
              between contaminated sediments and overlying   water exists in lakes and
              coastal ecosystems through the process   of sediment resuspension. Satellite
              observations in Lake Michigan   illustrate an annually recurrent episode of
              nearshore-offshore   transport, a 10 km wide plume of resuspended material
              extending   over 200 km along the southern shores of the lake. Preliminary  
              evidence indicates that this episodic event may be the major   mechanism for
              cross-margin sediment transport in Lake Michigan.    This type of event impacts
              recycling of biogeochemically   important materials (BIMS), ecosystem
              responses, cross-isobath   transport in the Great Lakes. The program results
              will be   applicable to similar events in many coastal areas.    This
              comprehensive, interdisciplinary study will implement an   integrated
              observational program and numerical modeling effort to   identify, quantify,
              and develop prediction tools for the winter-  spring resuspension event and to
              assess the impact of this event   on the transport and transform ation of BIMS
              and on lake ecology.    This component of the study focuses on real time
              measurements of   key air and water variables necessary for the observational, 
               modeling and forecasting activities, in particular surface   currents, winds
              and waves that are pertinent to the overall   objectives. Two multifrequency HF
              radar units will be deployed   along the shore of lower Lake Michigan to
              provide real time   observations of near surface current and current shear,
              wind   direction and wave height over an area of about 2500 sq. km.   adjacent
              to the lower Lake Michigan shoreline. This work will   contribute to the
              overall goals of understanding episodic events   and cross-margin transport in
              the Great Lakes and developing a   portable data assimilation nowcast/forecast
              system based on the   lower Michigan results.
