Abstract    :
                  ***  CMS 9726925  Steele  The Sixth Pan American Congress of Applied

              The meeting porovides outstanding venues for enhancing  communication among the
              engineering scholarly communities of  the Americas. Panel discussions will be
              held on the topics:  (a) history of women in mechanics, (b) perspective of
              women  in mechanics, and (c) advances in bioengineering.  Selected papers from
              the meeting will be published in a  special issue entitled "Mechanics Pan
              America" of the  International Journal of Solids and Structures.***
