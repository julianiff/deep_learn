Abstract    :
              9726341  Prestegard  The overall objective of this work is to explore a
              potential new source of information on protein structure and dynamics in
              solution.  The new information comes from residual dipolar couplings recently
              seen in NMR spectra of molecules with highly anisotropic magnetic
              susceptibilities when these molecules are placed in very high magnetic fields. 
              The contributions are dependent on the orientation of the vector connecting the
              nuclei relative to the axes of a molecular susceptibility tensor.  Measurement,
              thus, can provide structural information by constraining orientations of remote
              parts of large molecules in ways that are inaccessible using existing NOE based
              distance constraints.  The couplings are also subject to the effects of
              motional averaging.  This is particularly important because the range of
              motions contributing to the averaging process is much larger than those
              contributing to commonly measured NMR relaxation parameters.  Experiments may,
              therefore, give insight into large amplitude, slower, motions that are among
              those most likely to contribute to protein function.    Devising and testing
              methods for measurement and analysis of residual dipolar couplings is the
              primary object of this research.  Two paramagnetic proteins, myoglobin and
              cytochrome b5, are chosen as targets for preliminary application.  Both are
              well characterized structurally and should serve as suitable benchmarks for a
              new structural strategy.  However, both have also been the subject of much
              debate as to motional contributions to function. Methods developed and applied
              to these proteins should contribute to resolution of this debate.  ***
