Abstract    :
              9726642  Young  This project will support a long-term, large-scale factorial
              experiment on the effects of native and domestic herbivores on each other and
              on the land they share in East Africa. Eighteen 4-ha plots have already been
              established that exclude six replicated combinations of (1) cattle, (2) wild
              large mammals, and (3) mega-herbivores (elephants and giraffes). This is the
              first controlled exclusion experiment that factors out the separate and
              combined effects of livestock and large wild herbivores, providing a unique
              opportunity to answer a series of basic and applied questions about the ecology
              of semi-arid ecosystems. This research is being conducted at Mpala Research
              Centre in north central Kenya. It is home to a largely intact fauna that is
              characteristic of East African savanna woodlands, including elephants, two
              species of zebras, cape buffaloes, elands, gazelles, giraffes, hertebeests,
              oryxes, lions, leopards, cheetahs, and many other species of large and small
              mammals. This proposal will document compensatory responses of the vegetation
              and of non-excluded herbivores, underlying vegetation changes associated with
              exclusion, the mode and rate of encroachment by woody plants, and the
              maintenance of the nutrient-rich glades that appear to me major organizing
              features of this landscape mosaic. This research will elucidate several
              fundamental issues in ecology, including the maintenance of resource hot-spots
              by endogenous ecosystem processes in a landscape mosaic.
