Abstract    :
                During the past decade blooms of the brown tide microalga, Aureococcus
              anophagefferens, have devastated the ecology of Peconic Bay and Gardeners Bay
              in eastern Long Island, New York and Great South Bay along the south shore of
              Long Island. Blooms of this organism have also been reported in Rhode Island
              and New Jersey. Economic ramifications of this bloom have included the
              destruction of the 2 million dollar a year scallop fishery in Peconic Bay.
              Although studies have elucidated some of the environmental conditions that
              favor blooms of A. anophagefferens, clear understanding of its biology and
              comprehensive policy for its control cannot be achieved without understanding
              the dynamics of its population genetic structure. The goal is to develop
              Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) based molecular techniques which can be used to
              rapidly characterize the temporal and spatial genetic variation among
              inter-bloom and bloom populations of A. anophagefferens. The hypothesis that
              spatially and temporally disjunct Long Island blooms, represent genetically
              variable populations of A. anophagefferens in which different genotypes are the
              dominant members of spring and summer blooms will be tested using molecular
              techniques to assay for genetic variability in A. anophagefferens. These
              techniques will be used to evaluate the spatial and temporal genetic
              variability of brown tide bloom populations in Long Island samples.
              Comparrisons of the genetic relatedness of the Long Island, N.Y. bloom
              populations to those in Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Texas will also
              performed.
