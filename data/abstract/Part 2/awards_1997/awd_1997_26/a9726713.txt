Abstract    :
              9726713  Sandorfi    This award supports the participation of American
              scientists  in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Probing Hadron Structure with  Polarized
              Photons, to be held in Hawaii, from  February 22-25, l999.  The co-organizers
              are Dr. Andrew  Sandorfi of Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New  York
              and Professor Takashi Nakano of Osaka University in  Japan.  The seminar will
              focus on a study of nonperturbative  QCD dynamics of hadron structure and how
              these can be  effectively proved with spin observables at polarized photon 
              facilities in the U.S. and Japan.  The objective is to focus  on the
              development of collaborations between U.S. and  Japanese physicists in order to
              optimize the capabilities of  new facilities in the two countries, both for
              performing  future experiments as well as theoretical investigations.    The
              session will focus on four theme topics:  (l) identify  the most important
              problems in baryon structure that can be  addressed with Y ray beams;  (2)
              identify the facilities in  the U.S. and Japan whose capabilities are best
              matched to  the problems;  (3) identify the key theoretical areas  requiring
              work in order to interpret data from new  experiments; and (4) form
              collaborative teams to fully  address these new challenging goals.  Results of
              the seminar  should stimulate the cost effective use of large investments  in
              manpower and equipment.   The exchange of ideas and data  with Japanese experts
              in this field will enable U.S.  participants to advance their own work, and
              will set the  stage for future collaborative projects.  Seminar organizers 
              have made a special effort to involve postdoctoral  researchers.  The
              proceedings of the meeting will be  reproduced as a Brookhaven Internal Report
              and will be  distributed to the participants, as well a to relevant  research
              groups in the U.S. and Japan.  ***
