Abstract    :
              PROJECT SUMMARY    Rutledge/97-26464    This research is an investigation of
              both middle latitude and tropical convection.  A  particular strength of this
              research is its inclusion of cloud dynamics, microphysics,  associated
              electrification, and lightning in an integrated approach to the problems. 
              Specific  objectives include: an investigation of deep, tropical convection
              studied with multiparameter  radar during the Maritime Continent Thunderstorm
              Experiment, similar studies of deep,  middle latitude convection sampled in the
              STERAO-A project, a detailed investigation of  severe hailstorms and why some
              produce large numbers of positive cloud-to-ground  lightning flashes, further
              refinement of polarimetric radar techniques for remotely-inferring 
              precipitation processes in clouds, and participation in new field efforts to
              study tropical  continental convection in Brazil and oceanic convection over
              the Marshall Islands.  The  research will lay foundations for improved
              representation of lightning in physical models  and in global models to assess
              effects of NOx produced by lightning on chemical processes  in the atmosphere. 
              One potential practical benefit is the possible use of real-time lightning 
              observations to improve predictions of the behavior of severe storms.  All of
              the objectives  of this research depend on use of existing techniques and
              development of new techniques  for application of multiparameter polarimetric
              radar data.
