Abstract    :
                This three-year award supports continuation of a US-France cooperative
              research project   on investment and technical changes in American and French
              industrial firms.  This next   phase will include data on firms in other major
              European economies.  The collaboration   involves Zvi Griliches at the National
              Bureau of Economic Research, Bronwyn Hall at the   University of California,
              Berkeley and Jacques Mairesse and other researchers at the   Group des Ecoles
              Nationales d'Economie et Statistique in France.  The investigators will  
              continue to: (1) develop determinants of firm-level investment and firm-level
              research and   development; (2) model heterogeneous firm behavior using methods
              of estimation; and (3)   measure capital utilization and its role in production
              at the firm level.  The collaboration   takes advantage of complementary
              expertise in France and provides access to large data   sets in France and OECD
              countries.  It will advance efforts to construct an international   data set on
              industrial firms for comparative international studies.
