Abstract    :
              9726885  Reinen    It has been known for 30 years that hydrous phases subjected
              to  stress during dehydration at low pressures can develop a  mechanical
              instability leading to faulting.  This phenomenon is  considered to be the
              leading candidate to explain earthquakes at  depths between 30 and 300km in
              Earth and a possible mechanism at  all depths at which earthquakes exist.  The
              accepted explanation  of this phenomenon rests on the assumption that the
              volume of  fluid produced in such dehydration reactions is greater than the 
              volume of the dehydrating phase.  It is now known that at very  high pressure,
              the total volume produced by such reactions is  actually smaller than that of
              the parent phase, raising the  question as to whether this phenomenon can
              operate as an  earthquake mechanism at depth.  This project will utilize unique
               high pressure instrumentation to conduct deformation experiments  on
              antigorite serpentine under pressures greater than 2.2 GPa,  physical
              conditions such that the total volume of the product  assemblage is smaller
              than that of the dehydrating phase, in  order to test whether a mechanical
              instability can exist under  these conditions.  It is hypothesized that under
              these  conditions, the primary failure unit will switch from formation  of
              fluid-generated tensile microcracks to formation of fluid-  generated
              compressive microanticracks and that the instability  will be preserved.  ***
