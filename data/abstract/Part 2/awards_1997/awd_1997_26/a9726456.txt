Abstract    :
                9726456  Schwartz  Knowledge about the factors controlling plant rarity are
              critical to successful conservation. This grant from the Division of
              Environmental Biology will utilize the Nature Conservancy Natural Heritage Data
              Base on plants of the United States and Canada to make broad generalizations
              about the characteristics of rare plants. Using statistical techniques, it will
              be determined if rarity is correlated with: (                                  
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                           a)
              life history attributes, (b) taxonomic affiliation, and c) phylogenetic
              lineage. This research focuses on discerning broad patterns of rarity first,
              and then refines the focus down to finer scales (ecological, geographical,
              taxonomic) in order to determine which patterns observed at the broad scale
              remain consistent across scales.
