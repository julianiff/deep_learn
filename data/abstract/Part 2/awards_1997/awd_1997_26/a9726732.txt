Abstract    :
                This three-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research
              aimed at the   development of high performance magnets.  The collaboration
              involves the research   groups of William J. James at the University of
              Missouri at Rolla and Philippe l'Heritier of   the Ecole Normale Superieure de
              Physique, Grenoble, France.  The investigators will   focus on the synthesis
              and characterization of rare earth transition metal alloys.  Nitrogen,   carbon
              and boron will be inserted interstitially and the resulting compounds will be  
              analyzed and characterized by magnetic, thermal and x-ray measurement.  The US 
               investigators will employ neutron diffraction to provide site-specific
              information and   information about magnetic structure.  The French
              investigators will carry out the thermal   analysis using x-ray diffraction. 
              The US investigators bring to this collaboration expertise in magnetic
              characterization and   neutron diffraction techniques.  This is complemented by
              French expertise in chemical and   thermal analyses and in low temperature
              x-ray studies.  The project will advance   understanding of the magnetic
              structure needed for the development of high energy   magnets.
