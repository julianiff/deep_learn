Abstract    :
                    This project is designed to develop new technology in molecular screening
              of tundra soil biota.  The researchers intend to modify cutting-edge techniques
              that utilize oligonucleotide probes bonded to microchips, which would be
              inserted into soil samples.  The probes would be amplified using the Polymerase
              Chain Reaction technology (PCR) and sequenced, then subsequently compared to
              known sequences of biota through computer searches or by direct comparison with
              a sample library.  The technique will allow more rapid characterization of soil
              microbes compared to more traditional methods, while additionally recovering
              DNA for more detailed study.
