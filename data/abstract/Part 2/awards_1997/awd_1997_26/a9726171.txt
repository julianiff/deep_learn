Abstract    :
                This renewal project, supported in the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry
              Program, aims to synthesize and characterize the chemical  and electrochemical
              behavior of monolayer-protected nanoscopic  metal clusters and of novel, mixed
              valent solid and semi-solid  molecular melt phases.  Professor Murray and his
              students at the  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will use a wide
              range  of experimental methods in this work including nuclear magnetic 
              resonance, Fourier transform infrared red, thermal, fluorescence,  and mass
              spectroscopy together with electrochemical techniques and  conductivity
              measurements.  These new interfacial materials with  nanoscopic dimensions hold
              technological promise in  electrocatalysis, molecular devices, and
              electrochromic materials.  Novel thin-film materials incorporating nanoscopic
              gold clusters  and involving electroactive molecular melts prepared from
              polyether  oligomers that exhibit polymer-like solid and semi-solid properties 
              will be studied.  Professor Murray and his students at the  University of North
              Carolina at Chapel Hill will pursue studies of  these materials using a wide
              range of experimental techniques while  considering the applicability of these
              materials in the fields of  electrocatalysis, electrochromic devices, and novel
              chemical  reagents.  This work blends fundamental work in chemistry while 
              keeping clear goals to develop materials with technological  relevance and
              societal value.
