Abstract    :
              Profs. Eric Oldfield and Andrzej Wieckowski will develop in-situ high-field
              nuclear magnetic resonance-electrochemistry (NMRE) techniques to investigate
              interfacial structure and dynamics in electrocatalysts, with the purpose of
              clarifying the role of modification of electrode material in the poisoning of
              Pt electrocatalysts for methanol fuel cells. Both metal surface and adsorbate
              structures in an electrochemical cell under potentiostatic control will be
              characterized. Knight shifts, spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxation times
              determination, aided with density-functional calculations, will be correlated
              with shifts of the Fermi-level LDOS of metal and adsorbates. In particular, the
              research will involve 195Pt NMR of fuel cell catalysts to obtain LDOS
              (bimetallic particles will be composed of Pt with Ru, Sn, Rh, or Cu); and 13C
              and 17O NMR of adsorbed CO to obtain diffusion kinetics. Determination will be
              made of catalyst-support and catalyst-adsorbate interactions; and of the
              effects of electrode potential and electrolyte environment on surface structure
              and dynamics. The wider relevance of the research is in the design of
              CO-poisoning resistant, high current-density electrodes for methanol oxidation,
              which have potential use in mobile power sources.
