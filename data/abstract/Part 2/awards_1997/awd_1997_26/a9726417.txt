              ABSTRACT    OPP-9726510     OPP-9726417  OGILVIE, ASTRID    ROGERS, JEFFREY 
              UNIVERSITY OFCOLORADO   OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY    The project will examine the
              relationship between changing climatic conditions in the vicinity of Iceland
              and the abundance of Atlantic cod for the past 1000 years.  The combination of
              climate and fisheries records will be used to determine possible impacts of
              climate-induced changes in cod fisheries on human populations. Of particular
              importance will be an examination of the societal response to climate change
              and fisheries abundance during two of the most dramatic climate events to occur
              in the North Atlantic region during recorded history, the "Little Ice Age" and
              the "Medieval Warm Period".  The research will involve an interdisciplinary
              approach in which physical, climate, historical, and sociological evidence is
              gathered to examine effects of significant changes in the environment on human
              populations that depend on resources controlled in part by climate-driven
              systems.  Therefore, the project will make a significant contribution to the
              determination of the human dimensions of global change in the North Atlantic
              during two periods of significant climate fluctuations.
