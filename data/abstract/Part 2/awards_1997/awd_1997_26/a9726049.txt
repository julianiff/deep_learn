Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9726049   MOMOH    This award funds a researcher at Howard
              University (HBCU) for a two year project reporting to the Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center for Power Systems Engineering.  The project is
              entitled, "Real Time Pricing of Reactive Power Support Service and Control."   
              The study will develop an optimal reactive-resources-planning tool, similar to
              the optimal generation planning tools that minimize the sum of capital and
              operating costs over some future period, subject to constraints.
