Abstract    :
                This award supports Drs. Patrice Simard, Vladimir Vapnik, Yann LeCun, and Leon
                Bottou to collaborate with Klaus-Robert M¼ller of GMD FIRST (Research Center
              for   Information Technology) in Berlin.  The collaboration will extend current
              knowledge   about support vector machines (SVMs) which can represent functions
              in spaces with   trillions of dimensions and are used for such applications as
              time-series prediction, image   analysis, and optical character recognition. 
              Specifically, the research will study methods   for incorporating invariance
              properties into SVMs, methods for automatically choosing   the parameters and
              kernels of SVMs, numerical techniques for computing support   vectors,
              extending SVM beyond current uses, and improving pattern-recognition  
              performance.  One result of the research will be a numerical code for the
              computation of   support vectors that will be available to the research
              community.
