Abstract    :
                      This proposal seeks support for the principal investigators'
              participation in the multi-investigator, international North Water Polynya
              Program organized by Canada.  The larger project will test hypotheses for the
              formation of the polynya, and this proposal will supply Geochemical tracer
              measurements that are important in gaining an understanding of the present-day
              ecosystem dynamics and their relations to polynya size and formation processes.
               Specifically, the Geochemical tracer work addresses two classes of processes
              operating with the North Water polynya:  1) the sinking flux of particulate
              organic carbon (POC), and 2) net community production and carbon cycling.  The
              sinking flux of POC will be quantified based on the water column distributions
              of the natural U-238  series radionuclide Th-237.  The distribution of
              nutrients, oxygen and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the water column will
              be used to deduce the net biological production of the North Water ecosystem. 
              Dissolved organic carbon will be measured to examine the partitioning between
              the DOC and POC pools.  The principal investigators have been invited to
              participate in the 1998 Canadian-sponsored cruise to the polynya.  Both spatial
              and temporal variability in the Geochemical tracers will be addressed in the
              proposed sampling scheme.
