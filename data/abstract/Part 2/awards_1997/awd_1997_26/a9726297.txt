Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   of
              the Chemistry Division, Weltner will use electron spin resonance   (ESR),
              electron-nuclear double-resonance (ENDOR), Raman and infrared   spectroscopies
              to study the spectra of transient molecules, ions, and   clusters trapped in
              low-temperature matrices consisting of rare-gas and   hydrogen hosts. 
              Transition metal, rare-earth metal, Group III,   supercritical carbon dioxide,
              and other open-shell carbon-based molecules   and their derivatives will be
              characterized for information about their   bonding.    In this study Professor
              Weltner will trap highly reactive species in   solids at very low temperatures
              in order to determine their structures   and measure their electrical and
              magnetic properties.  The broad range of   experimental techniques used in
              these investigations provides a unique   and significant source of data on a
              broad range of molecules, ions, and   clusters which is difficult to gather by
              other methods.  Such data are   important for refining theoretical
              calculational methods as well as for   understanding such processes as
              heterogeneous catalysis and semiconductor   manufacture.
