Abstract    :
                This two-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research aimed
              at   developing new techniques for measuring isotopic abundance in geologic
              samples using   the CAMECA ims 1270 ion microprobe, a new generation high
              sensitivity - high   resolution secondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS).  The
              collaboration involves the   research groups of Kevin McKeegan at the
              University of California, Los Angeles and   Marc Chaussidon at the Center for
              Geochemical Research and Petrography in Nancy,   France.  The first ims 1270 is
              operating at UCLA as a National Science Foundation   national facility.  The US
              and French instruments are equipped with a unique multiple ion   beam collector
              assembly.  This multiple collector should allow improvements in   precision and
              accuracy of isotopic analyses using SIMS.  The US investigators bring to this
              collaboration expertise and experience in measuring   oxygen and carbon
              isotopes with the new ims 1270.  This is complemented by French   experience
              with the multicollector SIMS.  The groups will collaborate by cross- 
              calibrating samples in each laboratory and sharing analytical techniques,
              software   developments, and hardware improvements.  The project will advance
              the use of isotope   measurements of terrestrial and extraterrestrial samples
              and open new research areas in   isotope geochemistry.
