Abstract    :
              9726775  Radnor                                    This is a planning visit
              proposed by Dr. Michael Radnor,  Northwestern University.  The purpose of this
              visit is to  develop with scientists at relevant institutes in Taiwan, 
              Singapore, and Hong Kong a cooperative proposal to study  technology management
              issues in Chinese emerging economies.  Technology management is an important
              area for managing the  rapid growth of new technology and for handling a wide
              array  of technology related issues such as technology transfer,  intelligence,
              partnership, IP protection, etc.  This is an  area of growing importance in
              East Asia.   Dr. Radnor's  proposal for a planning visit to Chinese emerging
              economies  on this issue is opportune.
