Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9726413  KU    This two year "TIE" project funds a collaborative
              study with two Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers (I/UCRC).  The
              two I/UCRC's are the Rutgers University Industry/University Cooperative
              Research Center for Wireless Information Networks and the University of
              California San Diego Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
              Ultra-High Speed Integrated Circuits and Systems.  The "TIE" project is
              entitled, "Interference Cancellation Prototyping and ASIC Development for
              Wireless CDMA Communication."    The Rutgers University I/UCRC will investigate
              the critical issues of acquisition and synchronizing essential for multi-user
              direct sequence CDMA communication convolution coding and utilize recent
              results on multi carrier DS/CDMA systems.  In the second year, further research
              to study other multi-user detection architecture will be carried out after
              adding radio frequency hardware.    The University of California - San Diego
              Center will work with the Rutgers University Center in designing an
              interference cancellation chip and give it to National Semiconductor
              Corporation for fabrication.  In the second year, the chip will be tested and
              incorporated into a CDMA communication system for multi-users.
