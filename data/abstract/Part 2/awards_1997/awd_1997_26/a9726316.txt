Abstract    :
                This three-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research
              aimed at the   development of a fully molecular theory for homogenous
              nucleation of drops in   supersaturated vapors.  It involves the research
              groups of Howard Reiss of the University   of California at Los Angeles and
              Pierre Schaaf of the Institute Charles Sadron in   Strasbourg, France.  They
              propose studies to develop a rigorous statistical theory for the   prediction
              of nucleation rates in substances.  Their work will focus on a single substance
              -   argon vapor.   The US investigator brings to this collaboration theoretical
              expertise.  This is   complemented by the French investigators' expertise in
              experimentation and simulation.    The project will advance understanding of
              the process of nucleation, a ubiquitous   phenomenon that occurs in atmospheric
              science, boiling and cavitation, crystallization and   chemical processing,
              metallurgy, high-energy physics, planetary formation, contrail   formation,
              superfluids, and biological processes.
