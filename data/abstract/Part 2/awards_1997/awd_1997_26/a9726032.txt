Abstract    :
              9726032  Chang    This Americas Program award will support a planning meeting 
              for a regional workshop in materials research.  The planning  meeting, which
              will take place in Sao Carlos, Brazil, at the  Universidade Federale do Sao
              Carlos will convene organizers  from Brazil, Argentina, and Chile to develop an
              agenda for  the regional workshop that will include representatives from  most
              of the southern cone countries of South America.  Expected outcomes of this
              planning meeting will be:  definition of  workshop goals, criteria for
              selection and  number of participants, identification of workshop site and 
              possible related site visits, selection of date and duration  of the workshop,
              workshop design, definition of  deliverables, and an agreed planning schedule
              and budget.  This planning meeting is being organized by Dr. Robert Chang  of
              Northwestern University and Dr. Kathleen Taylor of  General Motors Corporation
              for the U.S. side.  ***
