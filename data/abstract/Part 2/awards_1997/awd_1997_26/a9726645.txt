Abstract    :
                      ECS-9726645  Ron Cole    Prof. Cole and his colleagues will evaluate the
              potential of their electronic-based spoken language systems to improve
              learning, language skills and creative expression in profoundly deaf children. 
              Students attending the Tucker-Maxon Oral  School will use the integrated speech
              recognition, text-to-speech synthesis and an artificial talking head developed
              at the Oregon Graduate Institute's Center for Spoken Language Understanding.
