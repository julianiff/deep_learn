Abstract    :
              9726855  Roth     An understanding of the evolutionary relationships of rodents,
              and of squirrels (family Sciruidae) in particular, is fundamental to
              reconstructing the course of mammalian evolution.  Rodents constitute nearly
              half the extant species of mammals, and morphologically, sciurids are
              relatively primitive, which renders their relationships to other families of
              rodents of key importance in determining the evolutionary history of the
              Rodentia.  The squirrel family is well circumscribed; diverse in its ecology,
              it ranges widely in body size, and is thus a rich source of evolutionary
              patterns.  Its good fossil record and wide geographic distribution further
              permit evolutionary patterns to be placed in temporal and geographic contexts. 
              Phylogenetic relationships of flying squirrels, pygmy squirrels, tree
              squirrels, and ground squirrels had never before been evaluated together using
              a single data set.    In this research by V. Louise Roth and John M. Mercer,
              DNA sequence data will be used to reconstruct the geneaology of the squirrel
              family.  Preliminary studies suggest that the relationships among squirrels
              are, in many fundamental ways, different from what has previously been assumed
              by systematic biologists.  This work should provide a new framework for
              interpreting variation in this group of rodents, clarifying evolutionary
              history in a major component of mammalian diversity.
