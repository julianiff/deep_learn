Abstract    :
                  This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic   Chemistry
              program supports research in the laboratory of Professor Carl   J. Carrano at
              Southwest Texas State University under the initiative on   Research at
              Undergraduate Institutions.  This research will explore the   chemistry of
              `scorpionate` complexes.   Scorpionates are   trispyrazoly-borate and -methane
              ligands, which are facially coordinating   and stabilize metals in a variety of
              oxidation states.  A general   synthetic route into heteroscorpionate ligands,
              which would incorporate a   biologically relevant donor (thiol, phenol,
              carboxylate, etc.) as the   `stinger` tail along with two pyrazolyl `claws,`
              will be developed.   The   facially coordinating nature of these ligands
              together with the   introduction of heteroatoms will provide the basis for
              studying these   compounds as models for metal ion active sites in proteins,
              such as as   nitrile hydratase.           This research at a primarily
              undergraduate institution will   undertake the preparation of new complexes
              with ligands that will allow   the compounds to serve as models for
              metal-centered active sites in   proteins.
