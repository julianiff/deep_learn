Abstract    :
               This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
              the University of Florida, studying the household-level effects of small-scale
              gold mining in Suriname.  Focusing on Maroon as well as Amerindian populations
              in the rural interior of the country, the project will investigate why some men
              work at mining and some do not, and the effects of mining on the agricultural
              system of the villages and on the labor of women.  Using ethnographic methods
              of participant observation and local surveys the project will test hypotheses
              about the role of capital and social resources in facilitating access to mining
              camps, that the household males' labor in mining inversely correlates with
              females' labor in farming, and that social capital variables of ethnic
              discrimination, education and cash income affect mining involvement.  The
              student will also interview participants in the mining economy from NGOs, the
              government and multinational corporations to understand the wider contexts of
              the rural mining industry.  This research is important because it increases our
              knowledge of this important region of the world, as well as advances our
              understanding of the decision making processes of rural tropical individuals
              and households.  Improved understanding of why households engage in off-farm
              work and the impacts of that work on agricultural practices is important to
              policy makers concerned about rural development and tropical deforestation.
