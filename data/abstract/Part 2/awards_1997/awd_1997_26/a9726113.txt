Abstract    :
              This award supports a project to use airborne ice  penetrating radar and
              topographic information to map  internal layering of the divide zone between
              the Amundsen  Sea and Ross Embayment to search for evidence of divide 
              migration.  If collapse has been in progress for some time,  it should be
              detectable in distortions of the layering.  The  project will use the Support
              Office for Aerogeophysical  Research (SOAR) Twin Otter aircraft to map the ice
              along  flow lines which cross the divide.  The data will be used  together with
              ice flow models to infer an ice divide  migration history, obtain information
              about recent  accumulation rate over planned traverse routes and will  provide
              important information on time scale and layer  thickness for the inland West
              Antarctic ice sheet ice coring  project.
