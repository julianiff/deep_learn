Abstract    :
              9726058  Rudnick    This grant provides partial support of the costs of
              acquiring a  new high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer 
              (HR-ICP-MS) equipped with a laser ablation microprobe.  In  addition to having
              higher sensitivity and lower detection limits  for many elements of interest to
              igneous petrologists, magnetic  sector instruments allow resolution of isobaric
              interferences  with some trace elements that are important to study of the 
              evolution of Earth's crust and mantle that are not resolvable  with quadrupole
              ICP-MS. Many of the studies that will be  undertaken require the sensitivity of
              a  HR-ICP-MS and the  capability of laser ablation for direct sampling of solid
               geological materials (i.e. trace element analyses of olivine  phenocrysts in
              Archean komatiites and diamond inclusions and the  determination of chalcophile
              and siderophile element  concentrations in MORB).  Such research is of
              fundamental  importance to our understanding of the evolution of Earth's core, 
              mantle and crust.  With the addition to the faculty of Dr. Daniel  Schrag, a
              new dimension of low temperature geochemistry as  applied to paleoceanographic
              and paleoclimatological research  will be added to the traditional hard rock
              geochemical studies of  this group at Harvard.  ***
