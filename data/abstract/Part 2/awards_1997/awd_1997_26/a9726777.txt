Abstract    :
              9726777  Seymour    This award supports collaborative work between Dr. Joseph D.
               Seymour, Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials  Science, University
              of California at Davis, and Professor  Paul T. Callaghan, Department of
              Physics, Massey University,  New Zealand. This project will take a Nuclear
              Magnetic  Resonance (NMR) spectrometer which operates in the Earth's  magnetic
              field, to Antarctica to measure brine content and  brine diffusion within first
              year sea ice of McMurdo sound.  The objective is to obtain a second season (1st
              season, NZAP  Event K131, Oct.-Nov. 1995) of  NMR data to validate prior 
              results, provide sampling of seasonal ice variation and  establish a
              correlation between NMR measurements, ice  structures and traditional optical
              microscopy data.  In  addition, a system in which a magnet is placed in a bore 
              hole in the ice will be tested, a technique new to the  principal investigator.
               Time in New Zealand will be used to  complete data analysis on extensive
              laboratory NMR  microscopy measurements made during the PI's NSF  postdoctoral
              tenure (1995-1996, Massey University) and  prepare a manuscript on the
              laboratory and field studies.  The laboratory data includes three dimensional
              images of  brine channel structure and spatially resolved measurements  of the
              diffusion tensor. The diffusion data provide the  direction and magnitude of
              brine mobility, of use in  understanding convective heat transport in sea ice.
              This is  the first use of NMR microscopy to quantitatively  characterize
              NaCI/sea ice structure. The project is the only  application of field NMR
              methods to polar research being  pursued and represents validation of NMR as a
              field  instrument for environmental measurements.
