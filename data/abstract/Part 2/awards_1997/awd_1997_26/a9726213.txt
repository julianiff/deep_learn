Abstract    :
                This three-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research on
              the   identification of underwater objects using scattered sound.  The project
              involves the   underwater acoustic group at the University of Delaware, led by
              Robert P. Gilbert, and    the Laboratory for Mechanics and Acoustics of the
              French National Center for Scientific   Research (CNRS), led by Armand Wirgin. 
              They will study a class of acoustic inverse   problems in a shallow sea.  These
              problems are concerned with the identification of   passive, undetermined
              objects.  The unknown parameters of these objects are its location   and with
              respect to some reference frame, its shape.  The investigators will use an
              incident   acoustic wave, which is scattered off an object and emits a signal. 
              The detected signal will   be analyzed, with the help of a computer, by means
              of a suitable inversion algorithm.  The   US research group has investigated
              successfully a case of a homogenous two-dimensional   object in a reflective
              seabed.  In this collaboration, their goal is to identify in real time a  
              three-dimensional object in a non-homogenous sea.  This collaboration takes
              advantage of complementary expertise of US and French   investigators.  The
              results may eventually be applied to searches for mines, navigational  
              obstacles, wrecks, polluting waste deposits, and submarines.
