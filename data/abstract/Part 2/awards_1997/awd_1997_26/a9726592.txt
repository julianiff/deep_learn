Abstract    :
                    FORM 7    PROPOSAL # : 9726592    INVESTIGATOR(S) : WHITE    INSTITUTION:
              INDIANA UNIVERSITY     The aims of this proposal are to investigate some of the
              controls over C cycling, especially methane production, in northern peatland
              communities. The research design involves measurements made in experimental
              peat monoliths at the University of Minnesota's Fens Research Facility in
              Duluth, where temperature and water level are controlled in monoliths differing
              in community composition. The research is placed in the context of how these
              important gas fluxes may change with global climate.     Reviewers agreed that
              the work was important, the researchers were highly productive and
              appropriately experienced, and the broad research design was well-thought out
              and carefully described.  The experimental facility and the measurements to be
              made simultaneously by cooperating investigators make this work particularly
              attractive.     Reviewer scores for this proposal included 4 "excellent," and 1
              "very good"  All 4 "excellent" scores had no criticisms and were uniformly
              supportive. There were no conflicts of interest identified during the review
              process.    On the basis of the reviews and additional discussion the Ecosystem
              Studies panel recommended that this proposal be supported.  The program
              concurs, although a reduction in budget from the original request is
              recommended.      Gaius R. Shaver  Program Director  Ecosystem Studies
