Abstract    :
              9726141  Marsh    Systematics of the Parasitoid Wasp Subfamily Doryctinae in
              Costa Rica (Insecta, Hymenoptera, Braconidae)    Wasps of the family Braconidae
              are parasites of other insects and are therefore important in the biological
              control of agricultural and forest pests. The first step in any successful
              control program is knowledge of the parasites and of which pests they are
              effective in controlling. Yet our knowledge of these particular parasites is
              very meager. The purpose of this project is to study one group of these wasps
              and to provide a workable classification, and to produce identification aids
              for the genera and species found in Costa Rica. Most of the specimens to be
              studied are located in the collection of the Instituto National de
              Biodiversidad in San Jose, Costa Pica (INBio). Specimens from this large
              collection, as well as from collections from other parts of the world, will
              provide the basis for this study. These wasps usually attack bark beetle pests
              in forests, and knowledge of their classification and identification will
              provide new information for potential forest biological control programs in the
              United States as well as in Central America. Furthermore, this study will
              provide valuable information for biodiversity studies in endangered habitats in
              Costa Pica as well as in all of Central America.
