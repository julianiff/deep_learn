Abstract    :
              Grodzicker  97-26948    This proposal requests support for the third biannual
              open-invitation Conference on Zebrafish Development and Genetics.  The meeting
              will focus on the cellular, molecular, and genetic regulation of development
              and growth in zebrafish, the only vertebrate in which systematic large scale
              screens for embryonic lethal mutations have been conducted.  The following
              sessions are planned:  1) Early development and axis formation I,  2)  Axis
              formation II,  3)  Somitogenesis and muscle formation,  4) Central nervous
              system,  5) Neural crest and head development,  6) Sensory systems  7)
              Organogenesis,  8) Other aspects  of development  9) Genomics,  10) Innovative
              methodologies,  11) Perspectives from other fish, and 12) Keynote address.  The
              Perspectives session will expose the zebrafish community to related work in a
              few other key fish (Medaka, Xiphophorus, the pufferfish).  The Keynote address
              will be given by a developmental geneticist whose primary interest is not
              zebrafish, but who is likely to stimulate zebrafish workers to broaden their
              ways of thinking about the ways they approach their research topic.  The
              proposed meeting will attract members from most zebrafish laboratories, and
              will provide an open arena for the presentation of the latest research results.
               It will also provide an opportunity for the exchange of materials and
              information about evolving technologies and methodological approaches.  About
              360 people attended the previous meeting and presentations  were given by
              investigators from 17 countries.  They anticipate an increased number of
              applications for attendance at the proposed meeting.
