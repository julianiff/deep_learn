Abstract    :
                The general hypothesis that the foraging behavior and distribution of high
              level marine predators (sea otters and shorebirds) under natural conditions are
              mediated by benthic prey toxicity due to harmful algal blooms (HAB's) will be
              tested in two geographic regions regions (California and Alaska). Because
              benthic community structure is often controlled from the top down via
              predation, the influence of phytotoxins in these habitats will be further
              amplified if key predators avoid entire regions or prey populations regularly
              exposed to toxic blooms. In southeast Alaska, the general hypothesis that sea
              otter foraging is regulated by paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins (PSPT)
              distribution will be tested by determining: 1) whether or not the expanding
              southeast Alaskan sea otter population has occupied inside passage sites where
              butter clams are abundant but contain biologically significant levels of PSPT
              year round, and 2) if so, whether the sea otters have either shifted their diet
              away from their primary butter clam prey to alternate non toxic species, or are
              continuing to eat butter clams, but perhaps while discarding the most toxic
              body parts. The second research component will focus on the response of three
              common northern California shore birds (Godwits, Dowitchers, Oystercatchers) to
              the predictable seasonal increase in the PSPT content of two major intertidal
              invertebrate prey (mole crabs and mussels). The general hypothesis that the
              foraging strategies of these avian predators is also mediated by PSPT will be
              tested by monitoring and correlating seasonal changes in invertebrate prey
              toxicity levels with changes in the foraging behavior and distribution of the
              birds at several widely separated sites along the California coast.
