Abstract    :
              9726385  Nocedal, Jorge  Northwestern University    Challenges in CISE: 
              Metacomputing Environments for Optimization    By combining distributed
              hardware, network hardware/software   infrastructure, optimization tools, and
              informational material, this   research will produce metacomputing environments
              for optimization powerful   enough to tackle problems of unprecedented scale
              and complexity.    The project integrates fundamental algorithmic and
              applications-oriented   research in optimization with research in software
              infrastructure for   distributed systems management. New algorithms that use
              the powerful but   heterogeneous, high-latency environment of the metacomputer
              platform will be   developed to solve key problems in targeted application
              areas. The   optimization tools will include interfaces that link the client
              workstation   to the metacomputer server in novel ways. The environment will be
              able to   execute in tandem with data-gathering and modeling resources
              elsewhere in   the network.    Focus areas for the algorithmic research include
              combinatorial optimization,   integer programming, global optimization, and
              nonlinear programming, with   target application areas of transportation,
              telecommunications, molecular   conformation, and weather forecasting. Software
              infrastructure research will   focus on the resource allocation, scheduling,
              persistency, and security   mechanisms needed to maximize the usefulness of the
              environment, from the   viewpoint of the optimization tools and their users.
              The project will make   use of the GUSTO metacomputing testbed being
              constructed by the Globus   project.
