In this multi-investigator collaborative proposal the PIs
              propose an ambitious project that will utilize the diverse strengths of the
              participants in a multi-faceted investigation of an aquatic food web.
              Specifically, they will study how gizzard shad influence the trophic structure
              and community organization in reservoirs and tie this to watershed processes.
              They examine the central question of whether or not the influence of shad on
              different groups of organisms is dependent upon lake productivity. Gizzard
              shade is an omnivorous fish that dominates warm-water lake and reservoir food
              webs and becomes more important as productivity increases. This research will
              quantify the watershed features that lead to gizzard shade dominance and
              investigate how impacts of gizzard shade vary across the productivity gradient.
               The study will test hypotheses related to the factors causing gizzard shade
              dominance in hypereutrophic systems and how gizzard shade impacts vary with
              productivity. Specifically, this research will examine the relationships
              between nutrient loading, productivity and gizzard shade abundance and effects
              in 12 Ohio reservoirs, ranging from mesotrophic to hypereutrophic.  These
              comparative field studies will be coupled with a modeling effort aimed at
              relating these patterns to a broadly applicable theory of aquatic food webs and
              ecosystem processes.
