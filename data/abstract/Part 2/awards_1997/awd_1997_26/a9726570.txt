Abstract    :
              Professor Robert E. Wyatt at the Department of Chemistry, University of   Texas
              at Austin, is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational
              Chemistry Program at NSF for theoretical studies of the   spectra, dynamics,
              and reactions of small polyatomic molecules. The work   supported under this
              grant is specifically concerned with spectroscopy   and time-dependent
              vibrational dynamics.  It is divided into four topics:   (1) quantum dynamics
              and spectroscopy of benzene; (2) multiple timescale   intramolecular dynamics
              of formyl fluoride; (3) state specificity and   dissociation dynamics
              fluoroform; and (4) extraction of interior   eigenstates from large matrices. 
              The common theme which links the various parts of the work being carried   out
              under this grant is to obtain information about and understanding of   the
              time, spatial, and energetic aspects of the evolution of   vibrationally
              excited states.  The dynamical properties and the spectra   of molecules are
              consequences of   the way in which the electrons and the   nuclei which compose
              the molecule   interact with each other. A goal of   the supported research is
              to learn how information about these   fundamental interactions can be
              extracted from a knowledge of the   molecular dynamics and spectra.
