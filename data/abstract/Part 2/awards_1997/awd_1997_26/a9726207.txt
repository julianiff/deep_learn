Abstract    :
                This three-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research on
              dielectric   studies of structure and properties of polymeric materials during
              cure and use.  The   project involves David Kranbuehl and his students at the
              College of William and Mary,   researchers at NSF's Science and Technology
              Center for Higher Performance Polymeric   Adhesives and Composites at Virginia
              Polytechnic University, and G. Boiteux and J.P.   Pascault at the University of
              Lyon.  The investigators will study model systems which   focus on and isolate
              the topology of the various stages of thermoset cure, linear step   growth,
              pregel formation, branching, onset of gel, network structure and glass
              formation.  The US investigator brings to this collaboration expertise on cure
              process modeling and   life monitoring and cure of high performance polymeric
              materials.  This is complemented   by French expertise on structure-property
              relationships of polymeric materials, dielectric   measurements, and synthesis
              and formulation of polymer blends.  The project will advance   understanding of
              the relationships of molecular mobility and polarity as a molecular probe   of
              macroscopic properties of polymeric materials.
