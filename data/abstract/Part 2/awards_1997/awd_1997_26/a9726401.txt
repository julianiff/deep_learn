Abstract    :
              9726401  Riseman, Edward  Finn, John  University of Massachusetts, Amherst   
              Challenges in CISE:  Automatic Interpretation of High-Altitude Image Data for
              Eco-System Modeling    The goal of the joint research effort between the
              University of Massachusetts Computer Science Department and the Department of
              Forestry and Wildlife Management is the development and demonstration of a
              practical methodology to enable highly automated and accurate scientific
              monitoring of natural resource and land use via aerial video and photography. 
              A secondary goal is to use portions of the same system for wildlife surveys and
              management.  The research project will almost completely automate and
              significantly extend the manual methodology currently in use involving airborne
              video data collection, time-consuming manual image registration, and
              construction of customized expert system classifiers for vegetation and terrain
              cover.  Thus the proposed computer science research spans technical issues in
              computer vision, machine learning, and high performance computing.
