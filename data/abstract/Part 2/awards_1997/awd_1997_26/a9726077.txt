                                          ABSTRACT                                 
              Understanding the mechanisms and rates of carbon removal  from surface waters
              remains an important goal of the Joint  Global Oceanographic Flux Study
              (JGOFS).  Particle formation  and sinking is an important process for such
              removal.  Much  of the particulate fraction in surface waters is in the form 
              of small cells having slow sinking rates.  For these cells  to sink more
              rapidly, they need to be packaged into larger  particles.  Fecal pellet
              production by animals provides one  way of doing this; aggregate formation
              another.  Because  aggregates are the dominant form of sedimenting particles, 
              understanding the processes that form and destroy aggregates  is crucial for
              JGOS to achieve its goal.    This proposal will develop models to increase our 
              understanding of the processes affecting organic matter  export from the
              surface mixed layer.  To this end, the  models will combine particle
              aggregation models with  plankton food web models.  Data sets from the JGOFS
              process  and time-series studies will be used to determine and refine  the
              ability of the models to predict carbon export.    Data collected during the
              JGOFS field programs will be used  to refine the models.  Combining the
              simulation results with  JGOFS field data will increase our understanding of
              the  processes affecting vertical export fluxes and improve the  accuracy of
              flux predictions made using the models.  The  results of this work will
              increase significantly our ability  to accurately describe the movement of
              organic material from  the surface to the deeper parts of the ocean.
