Abstract    :
                This SGER award will support analysis of stable isotopes and  Mg/Ca in  shells
              of living ostracodes collected over a range of bottom  water  temperatures and
              saturation states, as well as specimens  cultured under  controlled conditions.
               The objective is to determine  whether the Mg/Ca  ratio is a reliable
              indicator of bottom-water temperature.  If a tight  correlation between Mg/Ca
              and temperature can be  demonstrated, it can be  applied to correct
              oxygen-isotope-based estimates, which are  also affected  by the volume of
              water incorporated in ice.  Use of combined  Mg/Ca and  oxygen isotopes will
              then permit paleoceanographers to  assess independently  both global ice volume
              and local bottom water temperatures  under changing  climate conditions.
