Abstract    :
              9726635  Babcock    This award supports the participation of American scientists
               and engineers in a U.S.-Japan seminar on proton-coupled  electron transfer, to
              be held in Kona, Hawaii,  November 11-  15, 1998.  The co-organizers are
              Professor Gerald Babcock of  Michigan State University and Professor Teizo
              Kitagawa of  the Okazaki National Research Institute in Japan.  Recent  rapid 
              advances have been made in this area.  The x-ray  crystal structures of the
              bacterial reaction center, the  cytochrome oxidase and the cytochrome bc1
              complex have been  solved.  Important structural work has come from studies 
              using resonance raman infrared and electron paramagnetic  resonance
              spectroscopy.  In addition models for proton  coupling to electron transfer and
              pathways for proton  transfer into the electron transfer site have been
              presented  and tested by kinetic measurements, site directed  mutagenesis,
              theoretical calculations and other methods.  Discussions will focus on these
              models.    This  area of research has important applications in  photosynthesis
              and respiration; oxygen evolution in  photosystem II and oxygen reduction in
              cytochrome c oxidase,  quinone reduction in bacterial reaction centers and
              quinone  reactions in the cytochrome bc1 complex.  The exchange of  ideas and
              data with Japanese experts in this field will  enable U.S. participants to
              advance their own work, and will  set the stage for future collaborative
              projects.  Seminar  organizers have made a special effort to involve a mix of 
              researchers, including postdoctoral researchers and graduate  students. 
              Proceedings of the meeting are expected to be  made available by the
              organizers.  ***
