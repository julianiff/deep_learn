Abstract    :
                This three-year award supports US-France cooperative research on charge
              transfer   photochemistry of rhenium complexes.  It involves research groups of
              Guillermo   Ferraudi of the University of Notre Dame and Mohamed Sarakha of the
              Photochemistry   Laboratory at the Universite Blaise Pascale.  The
              investigators will study competing   photochemical and photophysical processes
              in rhenium that result from the coexistence   of metal-to-ligand and
              ligand-to-ligand charge transfer states.  Practical applications of   these
              reactions to problems of water decontamination and CO2 (carbon dioxide)
              fixation   will be explored.  The US research group brings to this
              collaboration expertise in the reaction mechanism of   fast photochemical and
              thermal reactions.  This is complemented by the French group's   expertise in
              inorganic photochemistry as applied to continuous photolysis and in  
              environmental photochemistry.  The project will advance understanding of the
              process of   charge separation and formation of photochemical intermediates
              which can be utilized in   environmental applications.
