Abstract    :
              9726571  Andersen    Montana State University provides a 3-year Research
              Experiences for Teachers and Students project serving 20 students entering 11th
              grade and 10 teachers each year.  The project conducts a 3-year statewide
              research project focused on a theme of Western Water Resources.  School teams
              take part in a 4-week summer institute to establish mentorships with faculty,
              staff, and researchers and develop relevant research and problem solving skills
              prior to initiating their research projects.  An electronic network links
              participants and MSU faculty and researchers during the academic year,
              providing continuing interaction, research direction, and research-related
              short courses.  School teams lead and participate in statewide workshops
              focused on integrating research into the high school curriculum.
