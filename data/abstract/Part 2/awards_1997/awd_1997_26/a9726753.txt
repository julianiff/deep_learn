Abstract    :
              This award supports Dr. Mark R. De Guire, one postdoc, and a graduate student
              from   Case Western Reserve in a collaboration with Fritz Aldinger of the Max
              Planck Institute   for Metals Research in Stuttgart.  The collaboration between
              the two groups will   investigate the synthesis of uniform crystalline ceramic
              thin films using aqueous solution   precursors and organic self-assembled
              monolayers (SAMS).  The research tools include   study of nucleation and growth
              of the ceramic films using small-angle x-ray scattering   (SAXS); force
              measurements using atomic force microscopy (AFM); modeling of   interactions
              using Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, and Overbeek theory; and identification of  
              key species responsible for film formation and prediction of optimum deposition
                conditions using thermodynamic modeling of the source solutions.  The two
              groups bring   unique and complementary capabilities to the work.  The U.S.
              group was among the first   to study and develop the deposition of ceramic thin
              films on SAMS.  Researchers at the   Max Planck Institute have extensive
              experience in the study of crystallization using SAXS   and AFM.  The work will
              advance the fundamental understanding of mechanisms whereby   films are formed,
              which will enable greater control of the films' microstructures, higher  
              growth rates, and easier deposition of multi-component films.
