Abstract    :
              9726588  Buchheim    The unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas and its flagellate
              allies are traditionally regarded as representing the simplest of freshwater
              organisms.  However, when one takes a closer look, these green algae are far
              from simple.  They are diverse in morphology (for example, some species are
              unicellular while others form colonies), habitats (different species occur in
              ponds, seashores, soils, even snow), and modes of reproduction.  Comparisons of
              DNA sequences from these algae have revealed unrecognized additional diversity,
              and this molecular diversity is not always consistent with perceptions of
              species diversity that are based on morphology.  For example, in some cases,
              species from comparable habitats (especially those from snow) are close
              relatives, according to molecular sequence information; the relationship is not
              necessarily obvious from the appearance of the species under the microscope. 
              In this study, Mark Buchheim will obtain new DNA sequence data from the nuclear
              and chloroplast genomes of green algae related to Chlamydomonas, and use these
              data to produce new, more informative reconstructions of the phylogenetic
              relationships among these algae.  Dr. Buchheim will explore the taxonomic
              boundaries among these algae, determine to what degree habitat preferences of
              species are correlated with their phylogeny, and explore the relationship
              between history of descent and mode of reproduction.  In this way, an
              ecological dimension will be added to studies of the taxonomy and phylogeny of
              these "simple" green algae.
