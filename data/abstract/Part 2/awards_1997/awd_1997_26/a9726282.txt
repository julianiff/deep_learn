Abstract    :
              9726282  Dietrich    Molecular Phylogeny of Membracoidea (Insecta: Hemiptera): A
              Test of Alternative Evolutionary Scenarios    Comprising over 25,000 described
              species, the Membracoidea (leafhoppers and treehoppers) are a highly diverse
              and successful lineage of plant-feeding insects. Conflicting morphology-based
              hypotheses of phylogenetic relationship have hindered attempts to understand
              the evolutionary origins of various unique ecological and behavioral
              characteristics (e.g., ant-mutualism, parental care, anointing behavior) and
              the possible roles that the acquisition or loss of such traits played in the
              diversification of the group. This project will provide increased resolution of
              the phylogenetic relationships among membracoid family-group taxa by adding
              characters from nuclear ribosomal  (28S) and protein-coding (elongation factor
              l-alpha) gene sequences for a large sample of leafhopper and treehopper
              species. Analyses of these data will address a number of long-standing
              questions, including: (1) Did the initial divergence of treehoppers coincide
              with the loss ofjumping ability and acquisition of a sessile, cryptic juvenile
              stage, or are these retained ancestral characteristicsT; (2) Did treehoppers
              arise prior to the break-up of Gondwana, as implied by one morphology-based
              phylogeny, or did this lineage arise in South America after the isolation of
              that continent, as implied by the fossil record?; (3) Did shifts in habitat,
              host, and/or feeding stragegy promote the diversification of certain leafhopper
              and treehopper groups?; and (4) Were ant mutualism and egg-guarding behavior
              acquired independently in several different lineages?
