Abstract    :
              9726427  Mindell    Birds are important to humans for food, for recreation, as
              indicators of environmental health, and as experimental models in applied and
              basic research.  Despite their importance, their genealogical (evolutionary)
              relationships remain poorly known, restricting our ability  to understand the
              evolutionary processes giving rise to the molecular, morphological and
              behavioral differences among orders of birds.  One of the reasons for our
              limited knowledge of avian ordinal relationships is their apparent rapid
              diversification, with most species arising during a relatively short time-span.
               Resolving genealogy for rapid radiations of species such as this requires
              large sets of characters for numerous  species, and no such data sets are
              currently available.      In this research, David Mindell and Michael Sorenson
              will infer the genealogical relationships among 134 birds, including
              representatives of all commonly recognized avian orders, using 5,000 base pairs
              of mitochondrial DNA sequence from 3 protein-coding genes, 1 ribosomal gene,
              and 9 transfer RNA genes for each species.  They will assess potential causes
              for differences among birds in rates of DNA sequence evolution and determine
              how improved knowledge of these causes may improve the efficiency and accuracy
              of the process of geneaology estimation , and will attempt to estimate the ages
              of various orders and lineages of birds.
