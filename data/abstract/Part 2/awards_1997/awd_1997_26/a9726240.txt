Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT: CMS-9726240, Philip Liu, Cornell U.    The occurrence of a tsunami
              cannot be accurately predicted;  instead, it is  necessary to focus on reducing
              the damage through such measures as  establishing Tsunami Warning Systems, and
              by implementing sound  coastal zone  management policies. Modern geographical
              information system (GIS)  technology  provides a powerful tool for managing the
              data, for interfacing  with  external analysis programs, and for presenting the
              results in the  manner  useful for disaster planning, hazard mitigation, and 
              rehabilitation strategy  comparison.    The objective of this research project
              is to develop a preliminary  tool to  assist engineers and planners in tsunami
              hazard mitigation by  integrating  GIS with the numerical models for tsunami
              propagation and runup,  thereby  permitting engineers and planners to evaluate
              the data to be used  in the  numerical model; to visualize the results from
              modeling exercises;  and to  determine potential flooding areas, evacuation
              routes and the  potential  damage to structures and utilities in the affected
              area.    The project focuses on establishing the framework of a GIS for 
              tsunami  hazard mitigation, using Hilo, Hawaii as the specific site for the 
              preliminary development.
