Abstract    :
                This two-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research on the
                preparation of monolithic, inorganic-organic mesophase materials.  The
              collaboration   involves research groups led by Bradley F. Chmelka at the
              University of California, Santa   Barbara and Florence Babonneau at the CNRS
              (French National Center for Scientific   Research) Laboratory for Chemistry and
              Condensed Matter at the Pierre and Marie Curie   University.  The objectives of
              the project are to:  (1) create macroscopically oriented,   mesostructured
              materials with compositionally diverse transition metal oxide networks;   and
              (2) create new bulk mesoscopically ordered inorganic-organic composite
              materials   using block copolymers.  They will employ NMR spectroscopy and
              sol-gel processing   techniques.  The US investigator brings to this
              collaboration expertise in preparation and molecular   characterization of
              composites using NMR spectroscopy techniques.  This is   complemented by French
              experience in sol-gel chemistry and processing.  The   collaboration takes
              advantage of synchrotron facilities in Paris.  It will advance   understanding
              of the development of new materials used in separation processes, catalysis,  
              and opto-electronic devices or processes.
