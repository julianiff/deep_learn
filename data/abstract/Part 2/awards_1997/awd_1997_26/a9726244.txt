Abstract    :
              This is joint project between UCLA and UC Irvine whose objective is the 
              development of faster processors.  The study concentrates on the effects of 
              redundant arithmetic in reducing critical paths in the processor. Redundant 
              arithmetic eliminates carry chains in adders, making addition a totally
              parallel  operation.  Consequently addition and other operations are speeded
              up.  However,  redundant arithmetic imposes overheads on other operations such
              as logical  operators, shifts, and addressing.  The objective of this research
              is to carry  arithmetic redundancy as far as possible, and to analyze its
              effect on all  aspects of the processor.  Alternative algorithmic and
              architectural solutions  are being developed and analyzed.
