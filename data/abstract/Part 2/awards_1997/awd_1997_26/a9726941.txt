Abstract    :
                This two-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research aimed
              at high-   resolution studies of carbonate sediments from the last glacial
              cycle in the Atlantic and the   Southern Oceans.  The project involves
              researchers Kenneth Sims and Roger Francois at   Woods Hole Oceanographic
              Institution and Francis Albarede at the Ecole Normal   Superieure in Lyon,
              France.  The investigators will evaluate core samples with a resolution   of
              more than 5000 years.  High-resolution analysis of nuclides from cores will be 
               performed using single and multiple plasma mass spectrometry.  French and US
              investigators bring to this collaboration expertise in chemical separation  
              techniques, which they will apply to core samples.  The project takes advantage
              of a   special mass spectrometer, the Plasma 54 from the Ecole Normale
              Superieure in Lyon.    This is equipped with a magnetic prism, multiple
              collection, and ion counting devices.     The project will advance
              understanding of paleocirculation in Atlantic and Southern   Oceans and the
              methodologies of single and multiple plasma spectrometry.
