Abstract    :
              The 1997 ACM SIGCOMM Conference on Communications Architectures, Protocols and
              Applications will be held in Nice, France, from September 16-18, 1997.  This
              conference is the premier technical meeting that examines the state-of-the-art
              in computer networks and communications.  This proposal requests funding to
              assist ten United States-based graduate students in attending this meeting. 
              Participation in conferences such as Sigcomm is an extremely important part of
              the graduate school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with more
              senior researchers and be exposed to leading edge work in the field.  The
              support requested in this proposal will enable the participation of students
              who would otherwise be unable to attend SIGCOMM'97.
