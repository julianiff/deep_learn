Abstract    :
              9726633  Fink    This award supports a three year collaborative research 
              project between Professor Anthony Fink of the University of  California at
              Santa Cruz and Professor Hiroshi Kihara of the  Kansai Medical University in
              Japan.  The researchers will be  exploring protein  folding at subzero
              temperatures.  The  objective of the research is to use subzero temperatures to
               slow the rate of protein folding down so that early events  in folding may be
              monitored.  In particular, they are  interested in using small-angle X-ray
              scattering to measure  the rate at which an unfolded protein becomes compact. 
              Information about concurrent secondary and tertiary  structure formation will
              be obtained from parallel  investigations using circular dichroism and
              fluorescence.     This project brings together the efforts of two  laboratories
              that have complementary expertise, research  capabilities and equipment.  The
              U.S. researchers' primary  expertise is in subzero temperature protein folding
              and the  Japanese expertise in the use of small-angle X-ray  scattering to
              follow conformational changes in proteins.  Current stopped-flow technology is
              limited to processes with  lifetimes of about a millisecond or longer.  the
              initial  collapse of proteins is believed to occur on a faster  timescale.  By
              using subzero temperatures, in conjunction  with suitable cryosolvents, they
              can significantly slow the  protein folding process, effectively extending the
              window of  observation to shorter timescales.  Knowledge of the rate at  which
              the protein collapses is very important and will help  distinguish competing
              models for folding.  This should  significantly increase our understanding of
              the process of  protein folding.  Through the exchange of ideas and 
              technology, this project will broaden our base of basic  knowledge and promote
              international understanding and  cooperation.  ***
