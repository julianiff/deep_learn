Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  DAYTE  EEC-9726831    This award is to support collaboration between
              the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) on
              Micro-engineered Ceramics at the University of New Mexico and the New Mexico
              Highlands University.  The focus of the research is the synthesis and
              characterization of spinel type material.  These materials are used in industry
              in applications such as magnetic memory, transformers, television tubes, and
              components for microwave communications.  The objective is to improve the
              performance of low loss electrical power transformers, microwave integrated
              circuits, thin film magnetic recording materials.  The research centers on
              aerosol decomposition and solution precipitation are to produce materials to
              study the crystal structure of these materials.  The magnetic properties of
              these materials are being measured and analyzed.  There is an impact on the
              education of minorities, as the students involved are either Hispanic or Native
              Americans, and hopefully will encourage these students to pursue careers in
              science and engineering in an area of significance to the US economy.
