This three-year award supports US-France cooperative research
              on methods for optimal control and shape optimization.  The researchers are
              Richard Byrd from the University of Colorado, Jorge Nocedal of Northwestern
              University, Jean Charles Gilbert and Patrick Le Tallec of the French National
              Institute for Research in Informatics and Applied Mathematics (INRIA) in
              Rocquencourt, France.  The objective of their research is to develop new
              algorithms and software for solving large optimal control and shape
              optimization problems.  These problems arise in many areas of application where
              realistic models often involve thousands of variables and constraints.  They
              propose to develop new interior point methods that are tailored to large,
              nonlinear models, and provide high quality implementation of them.  Their
              methods will be guided by two important application areas:  (1) control of an
              immersed vehicle in the ocean; and (2) optimal design of nonlinear
              structures.

The US and French researchers have complementary expertise in
              optimal control problems with constraints and in algorithm design tailored to
              optimal control problems and shape optimization problems.  Their collaboration
              will advance the development of effective software for solving application
              problems.
