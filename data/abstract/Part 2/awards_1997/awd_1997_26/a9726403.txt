Abstract    :
              9726403  Wilcox      This proposal will partially support a Mathematics
              Assessment Resource Center (MARS) to provide technical assistance and
              professional development to states and school districts in implementing new
              approaches to mathematics assessment.    The proposal builds on a planning
              grant, designed to "prove the concept" of such a center.  This planning grant
              permitted MARS to help districts in:  (1) handling performance
              assessment--designing and selecting performance tasks, developing instruments
              for student assessment and system monitoring, implementing assessment, scoring
              student work, scoring and analyzing results; and (2) advancing professional
              development both for and through performance assessment--using assessment as  a
              stimulus for the broader capacity to implement reform, linking assessment with
              curriculum, helping students prepare for performance assessments, developing
              materials to build capacity in local districts.  These materials were
              implemented in New York City, El Paso, Texas, and smaller districts in Michigan
              and Colorado.    MARS now proposes to implement and expand development of
              assessment design and development services, investigation of key issues
              (practical and psychometric); and further dissemination.  MARS expects client
              school districts to pay for delivery of services.  The budget for this project
              declines with each year, as the development work is completed.  As a result of
              the planning grant, over 20 districts or states have requested MARS services 
              The project anticipates working with 40 districts over four years.
