Abstract    :
              9726480 Lake In recent years, biologists wishing to reconstruct the history of
              life have made much use of sequence data from individual macromolecules (DNA
              sequences from genes, amino acid sequences from proteins).  As data from whole
              genomes (each encoding thousands of genes) become available, they become a
              major resource for systematic biologists if they can be utilized effectively. 
              Effective use of genomic data is especially needed to reconstruct ancient
              events in life's history, such as the origin of the eukaryotic cell or the
              appearance and divergence of major lineages of organisms. In this proposal,
              James A. Lake and colleagues will investigate the problem of deriving 
              phylogenetic trees from complete eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes.  More
              specifically, they will test theories for the relationship of eukaryotic to
              prokaryotic genomes, investigate the inheritance of groups of genes within
              functional classes (such as those involved in translation, transcription, amino
              acid biosynthesis, and transport), and relate the trees they generate to trees
              inferred from other classes of evidence, such as the fossil and geochemical
              records.
