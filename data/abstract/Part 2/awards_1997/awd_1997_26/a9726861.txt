Abstract    :
              9726861  Benoit    This research will examine how ecological and social systems
              influence each other through either positive or negative feedbacks.  The
              central hypothesis is that relative health and integrity of ecosystems causes
              and in turn is caused by enhanced human performance and productivity.  The
              current research will use observational techniques integrated by standard
              statistical methods to measure the quantifiable linkages between biophysical
              and social systems.  This investigation will also lay the groundwork for a
              field experiment to test whether restoring a degraded watershed can
              significantly enhance social interactions in associated human communities. 
              State-of-the-art analytical methods will be used to characterize approximately
              30 subwatersheds in terms of key hydrological, chemical, biological, economic,
              and social parameters.  This large number of  biophysical and social measures
              will be integrated within a quantitative context that allows testing of
              predictions and generation of an overall index of watershed quality.
