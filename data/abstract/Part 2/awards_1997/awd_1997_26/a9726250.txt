Abstract    :
                  9726250  Colucci     The goal of this project is to advance our
              understanding of the transition of the large-scale atmospheric flow in the
              Northern Hemisphere into a relatively stable flow pattern known as "blocking". 
              The change to this flow pattern is one of the outstanding weather forecasting
              problems and the processes responsible for the transition are still not
              understood.     Dr. Colucci will focus on two tasks.  The first is to develop a
              climatology of pre-blocking flow conditions and identify, if possible,
              precursors to the transitions.  This work will build upon preliminary work in
              which the initial results are promising, but will expand the climatology to
              include analyzed fields from the European Centre for Medium Range Forecasting
              (ECMWF) for additional years and at several levels.  The second tasks involves
              the analysis of operational ensemble forecasts of blocking events and comparing
              those results with ensemble forecasts done with a research model at the
              National Center for Atmospheric Research.     Insights gained from this
              research may well lead to improved medium range forecast capabilities.
