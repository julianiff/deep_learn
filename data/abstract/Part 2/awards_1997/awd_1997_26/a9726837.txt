Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    PROPOSAL # : 9726837    INVESTIGATOR(S) : DRISCOLL    INSTITUTION:
              SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY     Long-term studies at the Hubbard Brook Experimental
              Forest in New Hampshire and elsewhere in eastern North America have shown the
              depletion of large quantities of calcium from base-poor soil by acid rain. 
              Calcium is an important nutrient of forest ecosystems.  The supply of calcium
              controls the acidity of soil and waters, and influences important
              characteristics of northern forests and streams.  This research will
              investigate the role of calcium in the ecology of forests and streams. The
              supply of calcium to an experimental watershed at Hubbard Brook will be
              enhanced by the experimental addition of a highly-weatherable calcium-silicate
              mineral, wollastonite.  The wollastonite will be applied by helicopter.  The
              added wollastonite will dissolve in approximately seven years, replacing the
              calcium that has been depleted from the watershed over the last 50 years.  The
              wollastonite has a distinct stable isotope signature that will enable the
              transport and fate of added calcium to be traced with high sensitivity. 
              Changes in the chemical characteristics of soil and water, the activity of soil
              microbes, soil invertebrate communities, forest vegetation and stream biota
              will be determined.  Continued monitoring will attempt to quantify the
              cause-effect relationship between the soil calcium content and the ecological
              characteristics of northern forests and streams over very long time scales
              (i.e. 50 yr).
