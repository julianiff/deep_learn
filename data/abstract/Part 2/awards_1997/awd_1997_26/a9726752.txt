Abstract    :
                This award supports Dr. Karl Schoenbach and a postdoctoral student to
              collaborate with   Klaus Frank of the Physics Department at the Friedrich
              Alexander University in   Erlangen.  The collaboration will study two topics: 
              the physics of multiple, parallel   discharges in the steady-state phase, and
              the discharge ignition process.  These studies   have application to the
              development of excimer light sources in direct-current (DC), low-  voltage,
              flat-panel lamps.  Experimental and modeling studies on DC discharges will be  
              combined with ignition-phase studies at Erlangen to accelerate research in the
              area of   flat-panel excimer lamps, which provide quasi-monochromatic light
              sources with a wide   range of applications.  Overall, the combined effort will
              provide a better understanding of   the physics of hollow-cathode discharge
              arrays, provide information on the electric   breakdown in single
              hollow-cathode discharges and discharge arrays, and determine the   effect of
              electrode materials and dielectrics on the performance of the microhollow  
              cathode discharges.
