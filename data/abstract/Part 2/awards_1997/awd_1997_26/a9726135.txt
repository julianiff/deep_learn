Abstract    :
              Achenie  CTS-9726135  The aim of this research is developing novel mathematical
              support and the associated software for doing  simultaneous optimization, and
              flexibility analysis of chemical processes.  Specifically, the following
              problems will be addressed:  (I) estimation of chemical process flexibility,
              (ii) chemical process optimizaion under uncertainty at the design stage and
              (iii) optimization of existing chemical processes under uncertainty.    The
              research effort and the resulting software will allow a process engineer to
              solve the following industrial problems:  (1) an estimate of the ability of a
              chemical process to sustain an acceptable level of performance even when
              external internal factors change in an unpredictable fashion (for example, a
              change of catalyst activity in chemical reactors or a change in feed flow
              rate), (ii) calculation of optimal design margins for process equipment at the
              design stage, and (iii) calculation of optimal values of control variables
              (used for example to satisfy environmental and safety requirements) for
              existing chemical processes under uncertainty.    The proposal is being funded
              under NSF's Cooperative Research Program for Cental and Eastern Europe and the
              Newly-Independent States.  This work is a collaborative effort between the PI
              and two researchers at the Karpov Institute of Physical Chemistry in Russia.
