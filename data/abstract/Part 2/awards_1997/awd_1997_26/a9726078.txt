Abstract    :
              9726078  Waddington  This award supports a project to obtain a number of high- 
              precision borehole temperature profiles at Siple Dome for  paleoclimate
              reconstruction and ice dynamics studies.  Continuous temperature logs will be
              obtained in the 1 km  deep fluid-filled Siple Dome borehole and in several 160
              m  deep holes along a 20 km north-south transect across Siple  Dome.  The
              borehole temperature data will be used to: a)  establish the conductive heat
              flux across the basal  interface of the ice sheet, b) reconstruct the surface 
              temperature history at Siple Dome using geophysical inverse  methods ("borehole
              paleothermometry"), c) constrain how  thick the ice sheet was during the late
              Wisconsin, the  magnitude of the Wisconsin/Holocene deglacial warming, and  the
              background geothermal heat flux, d) determine the  calibration constants for
              the oxygen-isotope  paleothermometer at Siple Dome in the past, and e)
              establish  the spatial variability of surface temperature on the 20 km  scale
              near the main drill site during the last 100 years.  The results at Siple Dome
              are expected to provide data  needed to assess the short-term stability of the
              West  Antarctic Ice Sheet, improve our understanding of the  magnitude of past
              temperature changes at this southern  hemisphere site, and lead to improved
              estimates of the pore  close-off ages in the past which should lead to an
              improved  age scale for the Siple Dome ice core.
