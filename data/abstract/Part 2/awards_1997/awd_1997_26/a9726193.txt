Abstract    :
              The cooperative research program (`Energy and Charge Transfer with
              Functionalized   Phenols-Time-Resolved Photochemical and Radiation Chemical
              Experiments`) is   intended to initiate a collaboration between the Notre Dame
              Radiation Laboratory   (NDRL) and the Interdisciplinary Research Group on Time
              Resolved Spectroscopy (IAG)   at the University of Leipzig.  Until now, the two
              laboratories had been independently using   two of the most powerful
              time-resolved spectroscopic techniques (viz., pulse radiolysis   and flash
              photolysis), but with different detection methods:  Fourier Transformed
              Electron   Paramagnetic Resonance at IAG and Raman spectroscopy and
              conductivity measurements   at NRDL.  The combination of the unique
              methodologies along with the IAG's   outstanding expertise in the field of
              sterically hindered phenols and the NDRL's strong   background in charge and
              energy transfer processes promises a significant advancement in   the
              free-radical related chemistry of an important class of chemical compounds.
