Abstract    :
                This two-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research aimed
              at   understanding how to control super and molecular level structures of
              liquid crystalline   polymers and liquid crystalline block copolymer materials.
               The project involves the   research groups of Edwin L. Thomas at Massachusetts
              Institute of Technology and Jean-  Claude Wittman and Bernard Lotz at the
              Institut Charles Sadron in Strasbourg, France.    The investigators will
              characterize and process these materials.  Thin films of polymer will   be
              processed to undergo microphase separation and liquid crystal formation on
              highly   oriented polytetrafluoroethylene substrates and under an applied
              electric or magnetic field.  The US research group brings to this collaboration
              expertise in applied advanced electron   microscopic techniques.  This is
              complemented by French expertise in crystal physics and   orientational
              processing.  The project will advance understanding of substrate and field  
              processing of liquid crystalline polymeric materials and their optical
              applications.
