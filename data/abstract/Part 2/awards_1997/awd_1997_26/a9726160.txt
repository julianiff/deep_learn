Abstract    :
                  This Interagency Agreement is related to the U.S. Navy nuclear  submarine
              yearly science cruise.  It will cover Arctic Submarine Laboratory's anticipated
              expenses in support of Special Data Acquisition.  This funding is being
              requested to cover the following:    a)  Support for non-baseline Temporary
              Alternations (TEMPALTs).  These are the Gravimeter System (including the Data
              Acquisition System), the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), the Zero
              Angle Photometer System (ZAPS), the Concentrator/Filtration System, and the
              In-line Sample Manifold modification to the Torpedo Room Sampling System.  The
              Arctic Submarine Laboratory will perform the following tasks:    1)  Interface
              with investigators to determine the scope and details of their TEMPALTs.  2) 
              Prepare and /or modify TEMPALT drawings and other supporting documentation for
              submission to Naval Sea Systems Command for approval to install these systems. 
              3)  Fabricate a locking ring for mounting of the ADCP window.  4)  Fabricate
              the In-Line Sample Manifold.    b)  Purchase the expendable
              conductivity-temperature-depth (U/I SSXCTD) probes.  The current planning calls
              for the expenditure of 139 probes during pre-deployment testing and scientific
              data collection.  The Navy is providing 59 of these probes.  Therefore, the
              budget calls for the purchase of 80 probes.  The participating scientists have
              expressed a desire for the submarine to carry additional probes to increase the
              potential for denser sampling in certain areas of special interest.  As many as
              95 probes can be provided at the same per-probe cost.
