Abstract    :
                  9726648    Whitham    Biologists have long considered hybridization to be a
              major impetus to plant evolution.  Mechanisms of how such events influence the
              ecological performance of a species  are largely unexplored. This research will
              consider how variation created by hybridization affects diverse members of an
              ecological community.  The research will focus on cottonwoods (Populus spp.),
              which are important trees in riparian habitats of the western US and known to
              hybridize frequently. One of the goals of this project is to discover whether
              or not the genetic differences in individuals of hybrid populations in the wild
              determine the distribution of invertebrate herbivores. Another is to determine
              if hybrid zone size affects the concentration of herbivores.  In addition,
              common-garden studies will be conducted to determine the underlying mechanisms
              that affect hybrid resistance and susceptibility to herbivores.  These latter
              experiments will allow the investigators to determine the heritability of
              traits involved in herbivore resistance. The outcome of this research is likely
              to provide new insights into how genetic variation resulting from hybridization
              contributes to community level processes.
