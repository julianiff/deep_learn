Abstract    :
              9726237  Madrazo    The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill through the
              Mathematics and Science Education Network (MSEN) provides a 3-year Research
              Experiences for Teachers and Students project.  Research opportunities in
              biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics/technology are provided to 12
              teams of 1 high school teacher and 3 students entering grades 10-12 in the
              first year of the project.  In years two and three the project will serve an
              additional 39 teachers and 117 students.  Research teams of 1 teacher, 3
              students, and a scientist/mathematician collaborate on a research project
              integral to the researcher's on-going research program.  Teachers integrate
              related research experiences into their classrooms,during which the
              participating students serve as peer mentors to their classmates.  During the
              academic year the teams also participate in research symposia to present
              results of their research and discuss results.
