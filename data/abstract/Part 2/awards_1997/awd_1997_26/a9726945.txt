Abstract    :
                This twelve-month award will support a US-Portuguese workshop on regional
              economic   indicators models chaired on the US side by Douglas Woodward of the
              University of   South Carolina and on the Portuguese side by Paulo Guimaraes of
              the University of   Minho in Portugal.  On the European side, the workshop will
              be attended by European   scholars and practitioners outside of Portugal as
              well as those from Portugal.  The goal of   the workshop is to develop a common
              methodology and approach to regional economic   indicator modeling, based on
              work that has been done at the national level.   The US brings to the workshop
              significant methodological advances in the development   of national economic
              indicators, as well as a strong effort to develop regional indicators   at the
              University of South Carolina.  This expertise is matched by similar research
              efforts   at the University of Minho, as well as the Europeans' broader
              experience in developing   indicators to track regional differences in Europe. 
              The different research backgrounds of   the participants will enable the design
              of an integrated approach to regional economic   indicator modeling
