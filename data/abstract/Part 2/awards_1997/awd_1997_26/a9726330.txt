Abstract    :
              This award supports Dr. John Levine and a post doctoral student from the
              University of   Arizona in a collaboration with Hans Joachim Pfl¼ger of the
              Department of Neurobiology   at the Free University of Berlin.  The
              collaboration will determine the neuronal pathways   through which identified
              octopaminergic modulatory neurons are recruited during well-  characterized
              behaviors including crawling, walking, flight, kicking, and ekdysis.  In  
              addition the U.S. and German groups will determine how the patterns of
              modulatory   neuron recruitment are modified to accommodate behavioral changes
              at metamorphosis.    Modulatory neurons release substances, including biogenic
              amines or neuropeptides that   influence the function of the central and
              peripheral nervous systems profoundly.  Although   there is much information
              regarding the effects of modulatory substances on target   neurons or muscles,
              relatively little is understood about the neuronal circuits that activate   the
              modulatory neurons.  This collaboration will use two complementary and well- 
              characterized insect model systems to investigate the mechanisms involved in
              recruitment   of those neurons.
