Abstract    :
              This award supports Dr. Anant K. Ramdas and up to three graduate students from
              Purdue   University in a collaboration with Harald Pascher of the Department of
              Experimental   Physics at the University of Bayreuth.  The collaboration will
              study the collective and   localized excitations in the ternary and quaternary
              alloys of II-VI diluted magnetic   semiconductors.  Experimental investigations
              will involve spontaneous Raman scattering   and coherent Stokes-Raman studies
              supplemented with modulation techniques,   photoluminescence, and Fourier
              transform spectroscopy.  Magnetic interactions in the   diluted magnetic
              semiconductors, controlled by the concentration of the magnetic ions or   by
              the dimensionality in sub-micron quantum well structures manifest themselves in
              a   spectacular manner in numerous phenomena, such as the Faraday and Voigt
              effect,   Raman-electron paramagnetic resonance, and Raman-anti-ferromagnetic
              resonance.
