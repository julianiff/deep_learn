Abstract    :
                 This project will conduct paleontological and geological surveys of western
              Ethiopia in order to prospect for deposits that contain the remains of fossil
              primates, mammals, lower vertebrates, and plants that are of critical
              importance for reconstructing the history of primate and human evolution in
              Africa.  Ethiopia is well known for its rich fossil record that documents the
              early history of hominid evolution, but all of this fossil evidence is
              restricted to the Ethiopian Rift Valley in the east-central to southern portion
              of the country.   Here we will focus efforts in western Ethiopia, an area that
              has never before been examined for fossil bearing deposits.  Sediments and
              volcanic rocks dating from about one to over 40 million years in age are known
              to occur in this region, and it is likely that these sediments contain fossils.
               This is a critical period of time for primate and human evolution.  Likely
              areas for focusing the field efforts will be determined by remote sensing using
              thematic mapping with satellite imagery.  Field work will concentrate on these
              areas for prospecting and recovering fossils, and detailing the geological
              history of the region.
