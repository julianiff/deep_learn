This project is a study of the seasonal variability and
              long term change of the upper ocean structure of the Drake Passage.   It
              consists of  high density sections obtained on each crossing by the U.S.
              Antarctic Program's research vessel Laurence M. Gould, using expendable
              bathythermographs, supplemented by expendable conductivity-temperature-depth
              probes.

This information will lead to the establishment of a high quality
              data base with which to study the magnitude and depth of penetration of the
              seasonal signals, connections to atmospheric forcing, and the effects of
              interannual variations such as those associated with the Antarctic Circumpolar
              Wave. 

Six sections were obtained from the R/V Polar Duke between September
              1996 and April 1997.  The probes are being supplied by the institution with
              other funds, and are launched by the scientific shipboard personnel on each
              cruise.  The continuing data analysis is carried out in cooperation with the
              Argentine Antarctic Institute in Buenos Aires.
