Abstract    :
              This is a project to maintain and augment as necessary, the  network of nearly
              fifty automatic weather stations  established on the Antarctic continent and on
              several  surrounding islands.  These weather stations measure surface  wind,
              pressure, temperature, humidity, and in some instances  other atmospheric
              variables, such as snow accumulation and  incident solar radiation, and report
              these via satellite to  a number of ground stations.  The data are used for 
              operational weather forecasting in support of the United  State Antarctic
              Program, for climatological records, and for  research purposes.  The AWS
              network, which began as a small-  scale program in 1980, has been extremely
              reliable and has  proven indispensable for both forecasting and research 
              purposes.
