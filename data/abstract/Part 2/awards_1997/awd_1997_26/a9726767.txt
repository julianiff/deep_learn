Abstract    :
              9726767  Happer    This award supports a three year collaborative research 
              project between Professor William Happer of Princeton  University and Professor
              Tsutomu Yabuzaki of Kyoto  University in Japan.  The researchers will be
              undertaking  studies relating to new applications for laser optical  pumping of
              high density, low temperature gases.  The  objectives of the research are:  (1)
              to undertake a complete  detailed characterization of optical pumping in low 
              temperature cells, coated with superfluid He. and (2) to  develop an experiment
              to measure the electric dipole moment  (EDM) of atomic Cs in a superfluid He
              coated cell.     This project brings together the efforts of two  laboratories
              that have complementary expertise, research  capabilities and equipment.  The
              collaboration will unite  the experimental and theoretical expertise in laser
              optical  pumping and spin exchange at Princeton with the cryogenic  techniques
              developed at Kyoto University.  The Japanese  collaborator is a world leader in
              the manipulation of alkali  metal vapors in cryogenic cells.  The research
              should  provide insight into the validity of current theoretical  models of
              optical pumping and possibly help ameliorate some  of the disagreements between
              theory and experiments that  currently exist.  Through the exchange of ideas
              and  technology, this project will broaden our base of basic  knowledge and
              promote international understanding and  cooperation.
