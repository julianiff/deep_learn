Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    OPP-9726988       CROSS, MATTHEW  UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO    This
              project continues support for the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Data
              Coordination Center at the National Snow and Ice Data Center.  Data collected
              by ARCSS researchers studying all aspects of global change in the Arctic are
              accumulated in a central data storage facility for dissemination to other ARCSS
              researchers and, after 1-2 years, are made available to the entire scientific
              community.  Dissemination of data is accomplished through publication on CD
              ROMs or by direct access through a World Wide Web site.  The ARCSS Center works
              closely with individual and coordinated groups of researchers to facilitate
              transfer of new data into the archive and to tailor data products relevant to
              researcher needs.  The Data Center is an important component in the integration
              of multidisciplinary research efforts to study the complex interactions and
              feedbacks of global climate with the Arctic system.
