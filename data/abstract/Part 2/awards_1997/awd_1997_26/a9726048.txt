Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC - 9726048  LEE    The polymer industry is one of the major
              industries of the U.S. and it continues to grow. Research in polymer composites
              is an important growing sector which needs research to maintain the U.S. lead
              in the global market.  A planning grant (EEC-9612323) was awarded to Ohio State
              University to determine if an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
              for Advanced Polymer and Composite Engineering was feasible and viable.  As a
              result of the planning award, Ohio State University has raised $296,000 in
              membership funds and approximately another $300,000 in "in-kind" support for an
              Industry/University Research Center for Advanced Polymer and Composition
              Engineering.    The research agenda for the Center will address projects in
              Advanced Plastics Processing, Thermostat Polymers and Composite Manufacturing,
              Joining of Plastic Parts via Integral Attachments and Design and Die/Mold
              Manufacturing.    The award is being cost shared by Dr. J. Lee, Program
              Director, Materials Processing and Manufacturing Program.
