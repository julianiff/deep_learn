In this multi-investigator collaborative
              proposal the PIs propose an ambitious project that will utilize the diverse
              strengths of the participants in a multi-faceted investigation of an aquatic
              food web. Specifically, they will study how gizzard shad influence the trophic
              structure and community organization in reservoirs and tie this to watershed
              processes. They examine the central question of whether or not the influence of
              shad on different groups of organisms is dependent upon lake productivity.
              Gizzard shade is an omnivorous fish that dominates warm-water lake and
              reservoir food webs and becomes more important as productivity increases. This
              research will quantify the watershed features that lead to gizzard shade
              dominance and investigate how impacts of gizzard shade vary across the
              productivity gradient.  The study will test hypotheses related to the factors
              causing gizzard shade dominance in hypereutrophic systems and how gizzard shade
              impacts vary with productivity. Specifically, this research will examine the
              relationships between nutrient loading, productivity and gizzard shade
              abundance and effects in 12 Ohio reservoirs, ranging from mesotrophic to
              hypereutrophic.  These comparative field studies will be coupled with a
              modeling effort aimed at relating these patterns to a broadly applicable theory
              of aquatic food webs and ecosystem processes.
