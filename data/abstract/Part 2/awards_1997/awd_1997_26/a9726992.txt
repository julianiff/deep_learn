Abstract    :
                    9726992    Pickett & Morin    Ecological succession has long been a
              central focus of plant community ecology. Despite the interest and numerous
              studies, most of our understanding of the process is based on examination of
              different aged communities at the same point in time. Such an approach can not
              always factor out site to site variables and thus following the same site over
              time has advantages. This project will continue a long-term study of plant
              succession that began 40 years ago, longer than any other published study.  It
              takes advantage of permanent plots that were delineated in 10 oldfields in the
              northeastern U.S. in 1958 and have been periodically monitored since that time.
              This long-term study records the course of ecological succession following
              abandonment of fields used for different crops and following abandonment in
              different years and in different seasons.  The present funded research will
              continue field monitoring, maintenance of field plots, data entry and data
              analysis.
