Abstract    :
              Stanton    9726663    There has long been an interest in ecology in
              understanding the mechanisms that allow competing species to coexist.  Numerous
              questions remain in this area.  This research would take advantage of a
              widespread occurrence of ant-acacia symbioses in a region of Kenya to observe,
              experiment with, and model interactions between competing species.    In arid
              upland regions, Acacias dominate the limited numbers of trees present.  These
              species, as in other dry tropical habitats exhibit a mutualistic relationship
              with ants.  The presence of ants substantially decrease tree mortality and
              derive substantial benefits from the ants themselves.  There are four symbiotic
              ant species occurring throughout this region where they exhibit a distinct
              hierarchy in competitive interactions.  Individual trees are colonized by a
              single ant species and there are aggressive interactions among the ant species
              for the occupation of each tree with one species being the usual dominant.  At
              the same time, however, the four ant species have persisted in the region for
              an extended time and this project will test the factors that foster this
              continued coexistence.    It will remove ants experimentally from some trees,
              examine recolonization of such tree as well as of potted trees that had been
              allowed to grow without ants, and combine this information in a matrix model
              that predicts the transitions that occur in the occurrence of each ant species
              within the region.    This work will have substantial effects for conservation
              planning and educational development in Kenya.
