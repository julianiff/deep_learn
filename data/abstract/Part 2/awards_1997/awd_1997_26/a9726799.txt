Abstract    :
                This three-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research on
              organic   reaction rates and mechanisms.  It involves the research groups of
              Kendall N. Houk at the   University of California, Los Angeles, and Rene Gree
              at the Ecole Nationale Superieure   de Chimie in Rennes, France.  By
              introducing fluorine into molecules, the investigators   will analyze the
              influence of allylic bonds on the reactivity and stereoselectivity of alkene  
              reactions. They will specifically address cycloaddition and addition reactions.
               The US investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in theoretical and 
               computational chemistry.  The theoretical work will provide prediction of
              interesting   systems for experimental studies.  This will be complemented by
              systematic experimental   studies performed by the French investigators, which
              takes advantage of their unique   methodology for introducing allylic fluorine
              into molecules.  The project could lead to   the development of a new synthetic
              methodology of use to the pharmaceutical and   materials research communities.
