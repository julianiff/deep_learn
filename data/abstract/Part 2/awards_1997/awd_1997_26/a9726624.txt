Abstract    :
              This award supports the PI, Dr. Charlotte Elster, a post doctoral student, and a
              graduate   student from the Ohio University in a collaboration with Walter
              Gl`ckle of the   Department of Theoretical Physics at the Ruhr University in
              Bochum.  The collaboration   will study the properties of very light nuclei
              (2H, 3He, 4He) and the reaction mechanism for   elastic scattering and break-up
              reactions at intermediate energies (100 MeV and higher).    The theoretical
              formulation is based on a scheme that describes scattering in systems  
              containing small numbers of nucleons.  The numerical realization and an
              internal check of   convergence with respect to higher order terms will also be
              undertaken.  The results of the   collaboration should provide interesting
              insights into the reaction mechanism or light   nuclei collisions and lay firm
              ground to test various physical assumptions, such as the   application of free
              nucleon-nucleon forces in these reactions and the properties of ground-  state
              wave functions of light nuclei.
