Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    97-26863  Knight  W/WS: Comprehensive watershed management: A
              spatial water quality assessment system    The complex distribution of
              physical, chemical, biological and human forces in space and time exerts
              significant effects on the magnitude and location of pollution impacts. This
              project will develop a decision support system linking ecological;
              hydrological/geochemical/engineering; and social science research to address
              two questions: 1) How can multiple goals for improvement of river water quality
              and ecosystem integrity be accomplished under various scenarios of present and
              future climatic variability and socio-economic change? and 2) How do different
              geographical patterns of water quality inform potential societal decisions
              affecting water pollution abatement? The project incorporates community-based
              decision making and the role of cities, emerging suburbs and rural areas as
              pollution sources using the Yantra River Basin in Bulgaria as a case study. The
              investigators will test the specific hypothesis that spatial and temporal
              interactions of water quality improvement investments generate significantly
              different patterns of pollution abatement.
