Abstract    :
              Abstract  9726950  Grodzicker      The Cold Spring Harbor meeting on the Cell
              Cycle has been held bi-annually since 1992, and has become one of the most
              important international forums for discussion and criticism of progress in the
              cell cycle field.  One of the highlights of the 1998 meting will be the
              progress in understanding the cell cycle controls on DNA replication.  The
              meeting will also emphasize the impact that cell cycle research is beginning to
              have in understanding mechanisms that control cellular differentiation,
              programmed cell death, senescence and transcription. Platform presentations
              will be selected entirely from submitted abstracts, and strong emphasis will be
              place upon participation by graduate students and post-doctoral fellows.
