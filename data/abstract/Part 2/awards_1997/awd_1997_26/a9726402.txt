                 This  grant  supports  a US/Japan Workshop  on  High  Temperature 
              Superconductivity,  a  two day meeting which  allows  sharing  of  information 
              among  leading academic and  industrial  researchers  with  an  interest in
              promoting applications of high  temperature  superconductivity.   A  central 
              interest  of   the   researchers  participating  in this workshop is the
              commercialization  of  new  technology based on superconductivity.  %%%  This 
              grant  supports  a US/Japan Workshop  on  High  Temperature  Superconductivity,
              which is a two day meeting of leading academic  and  industrial  researchers
              with an interest in applications  of  high   temperature  superconductivity. 
              Technical  knowledge   is  shared, along with information on the status of
              projects in those  firms  in  the  US  and  Japan  which  will  lead  to 
              commercial  technological products based on superconductivity.  Some  of  the 
              product   areas   are   filters  and   related   components   for 
              communications  and particularly cellular telephones;  wires  for  use  in
              magnets, for power transmission, for energy storage,  and  for   motors  and 
              generators;  medical  applications   including  magnetocardiography and
              magnetoencephalograpy based on  sensitive  magnetic   field   sensors   of  
              the   Superconducting   Quantum  Interference Device (SQUID) category; and
              digital devices such as  fast switches for communication systems.  ***
