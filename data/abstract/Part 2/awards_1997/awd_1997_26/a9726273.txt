Abstract    :
              9726273  Miller  This award will support a detailed, high resolution seismic
              study  of the New Jersey margin. Significant research effort has focused  on
              this margin in recent years with objective of NSF support on  understanding
              history and amplitude of sea level change during the  Tertiary. Series of holes
              has been drilled on-shore New Jersey (EAR  and OCE support) and Ocean Drilling
              Program has focused on drilling  offshore sediment sequences. Additional ODP
              drilling planned for  July of this year in mid-shelf region. Office of Naval
              Research  also supporting large project in area to examine acoustics and 
              physical properties of shallow sediments. Present project has  series of
              objectives, including seismically tieing land drilling to  offshore work;
              mapping spatial variability in imaged Tertiary  sediments; examining sea-level
              fluctuation in seismic data; and  surveying shallow water sites for potential
              future drilling.  Principal investigators at Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory
              and  Rutgers University have been leaders in focusing community research 
              effort on this margin.  ***
