Abstract    :
              9726512  Moore    Recent advances in molecular biology made it possible to study
              in much greater detail not only the history of biological diversity but the
              genetic, ecological and geological processes that produce biological diversity.
               The number of species of birds is higher in South America than in other
              regions of the world.  This research by William Moore focuses on two groups of
              woodpeckers that serve as paradigms for studying the origin of avian diversity
              in South America.  The groups are the genus Colaptes (flickers) and the closely
              related genus Piculus. Preliminary evidence suggests that the ancetors of these
              groups entered South America from North America when the Isthmus of Panama was
              formed approximately 3 - 3.5 million years ago.  The subsequent proliferation
              of species appears to be closely associated with the formation of the Andes
              Mountains approximately 2 million years ago.  Speciation was associated with
              dramatic changes in the ecological adaptations of new species; for example,
              forest dwelling species giving rise to grassland species.  Dr. Moore will
              reconstruct a phylogeny for these groups based on DNA sequences from
              mitochondrial genes and introns from nuclear genes.  These sequences mutate at
              rates that are useful for reconstructing the genetic history of groups of
              organisms that are up to 20 million years old.  The phylogeny will be used as a
              framework upon which a better understanding of how and when species formed in
              these groups and obtained their morphological, ecological and behavioral
              characteristics.
