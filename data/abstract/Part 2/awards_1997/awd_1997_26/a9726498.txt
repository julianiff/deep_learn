Abstract    :
              The investigator continues to provide data for atmospheric species at relevant
              energies, as accurate cross section data are needed to model the behavior of
              the upper atmosphere.  His experiments focus on collision of keV-energy oxygen,
              hydrogen, and helium atoms and ions, with atomic oxygen and atomic hydrogen,
              and on electron-impact ionization of molecules.  Finally, he conducts a new
              experiment measuring energy loss in keV-energy collisions of neutral and ionic
              species.
