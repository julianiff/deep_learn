Abstract    :
              We propose a new paradigm for system design in which the  algorithm and circuit
              implementations are jointly designed to  achieve high-performance while
              minimizing average power  consumption. We propose to drive the research using a
              case study  of an adaptive equalizer/decoder where both algorithm selection 
              and asynchronous hardware design will be tackled using a Minimum  Average
              Complexity (MAC) approach.   In particular, we will  develop a detailed
              asynchronous design of representative  components of a MAC optimized mobile
              radio receiver, variable  complexity algorithms for joint adaptive equalization
              and  decoding, a characterization of the average computational load of  these
              algorithms for a typical mobile user, general procedures  for MAC algorithm
              optimization, an architecture for the new  algorithms and a quantitative
              estimate of the power savings  relative to a standard design.
