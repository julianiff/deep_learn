Abstract    :
                Bull   9726902    Many viruses infect several host species.  Yet the process
              by which a virus adapts to multiple hosts as well as expands to new hosts is
              not known.  Viruses that infect multiple species often consist of strains that
              are individually adapted to some hosts, with other strains adapted to other
              hosts.  Introduction of a virus into a new host species may result in
              infections that are not propagated in that species (e.g., human infections by
              Ebola, hanta, and rabies virus) or may cause devastating epidemics (HIV in
              humans, seal plague in harbor seals, canine distemper virus in lions). 
              Virologists have long exploited differential adaptation among alternative hosts
              by creating vaccines for one species either from viruses of a closely-related
              species or by growing viruses in cultured cells of another species to attenuate
              virulence.      This study will develop a bacteriophage system to study
              adaptation to a pair of host species.  Preliminary work with the phage phi X174
              has revealed a one-sided adaptation:  prolonged growth on one of the hosts
              results in changes that inhibit growth on the other host, but growth on the
              other host does not have the corresponding effect.  The proposed work will
              explore this host-specific adaptation under a wide range of long term and short
              term conditions, monitoring fitness and genotype changes that accompany the
              adaptation.  The study should establish a framework for the larger realm of
              host-specific adaptation and attenuation in viruses.  More generally, the work
              is an experimental system of the genetic basis of adaptation that offers a
              level of manipulation and thoroughness of genetic and fitness assay that has
              not been achieved in other systems.
