Abstract    :
                9726165  TUMMALA    This award is to provide funding for the Packaging
              Engineering Research Center at the Georgia Institute of Technology to
              collaborate with seven national and international universities which are
              centers of excellence in the topic of electronic packaging.  The seven
              institutions bring expertise in four major areas:  1) mixed signal design and
              test, 2) limits of flipchip packaging, 3) radio frequency and optoelectronics,
              and 4) thermal management.  The seven institutions are the Technical University
              of Berlin, University of Oregon, University of Illinois, Tufts University,
              University of Puerto Rico, University of Minnesota, and Lehigh University.  The
              addition of these partner institutions bring expertise and equipment and
              facilities which are unique and complement those of the existing center.  The
              Technical University of Berlin opens a door to Europe.  The impact on  the
              educational experience of students involved with the ERC likewise enhances the
              ability of the center to make a lasting contribution to electronic packaging
              worldwide.  The collaboration with the University of Puerto Rico will have a
              positive impact on the education of minority engineering graduates.
