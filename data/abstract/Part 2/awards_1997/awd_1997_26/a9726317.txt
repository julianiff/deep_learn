Abstract    :
              This award supports Dr. Jan Prins, co-PI Siddhartha Chatterjee, and a graduate
              student   from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill in a collaboration
              with Stefan   Jªhnichen of the Department of Communications and Software
              Engineering at the   Technical University of Berlin.  The collaboration will
              study high-performance computing   with the aim of integrating nested
              parallelism into the High Performance Fortran (HPF)   and Fortran 95
              programming languages.  (HPF is a variant of Fortran 95 specifically   targeted
              for programming high-performance parallel computers in a way that does not  
              depend on the computer architecture.)  The time is right to incorporate this
              new   technology into Fortran so that applications can take advantage of the
              capability without   disrupting ongoing development.  Nested parallelism
              enables the expression of adaptive   and sparse solution techniques necessary
              to performing increasingly large and precise   scientific computations.  The
              collaboration combines the complementary strengths and   facilities of the two
              research groups.
