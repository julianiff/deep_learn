Abstract    :
              97-26154  "First International Workshop on the Use of Paper Industry  Sludges in
              Helsinki, Finland"  PI: Thomas Zimmie, Rensselaer Polytechnic University     
              This award is made to support the participation by ten U. S.  university
              geotechnical engineering faculty members to  attend to "First International
              Workshop on the Use of Paper  Industry Sludges in Environmental Geotechnology
              and  Construction."  The workshop will be held in Helsinki,  Finland, August
              11-17, 1997, and includes presentations,  working group sessions and technical
              field visits.  These  technical visits are specially planned to supplement the 
              educational benefits derived from the workshop alone.  First  priority for
              attendees will be given to young faculty  members, particularly individuals
              from under-represented  groups.  ***
