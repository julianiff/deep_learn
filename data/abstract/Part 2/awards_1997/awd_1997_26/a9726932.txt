              Abstract    97-06932  MacIntyre    Turbulent Mixing and Light and Nutrient
              Supply to Phytoplankton    In lakes, physical processes that cause turbulent
              mixing supply resources essential for primary productivity. Partial upwelling
              and shoaling internal waves lead to turbulence and upward transport of deep,
              nutrient rich waters. The resulting nutrient fluxes have been 300% higher than
              those due to processes occurring offshore. Estimating the impact of vertical
              mixing in well-lit surface waters on primary productivity has proved elusive.
              Large eddies circulate phytoplankton and expose them to different intensities
              of irradiance. Photosynthetic rates of algae circulating in large eddies have
              changed by up to 80%.  For lakes varying in size and stratification, the
              investigators will determine the location, frequency and vertical extent of
              mixing events and assess their contribution to nutrient fluxes, phytoplankton
              circulation, and lake productivity.  The researchers will also develop and test
              models for predicting light and nutrient supply in other lakes,  leading to
              improved predictions of primary productivity due to changing land use, weather
              patterns, or climate change.
