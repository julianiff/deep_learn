Abstract    :
                Evolutionary studies of primate foraging strategies and adaptations often  
              assume that there are species-typical foraging patterns.  The degree to   which
              such species-typical patterns exist is debatable however, as   within-species
              variation has not been studied in most species.  This study   examines
              within-species variation in feeding and ranging behavior of two   neighboring
              groups of redtailed monkeys in a Kenyan forest.  The groups   are similar in
              size and composition, but their habitats differ, as one   group lives along the
              forest edge while the other occupies the interior.   We will compare the
              monthly diets of the two groups, and will document the   degree to which
              preferences for particular foods are shared between them,   the degree to which
              differences between groups are related to differences   in which foods are
              available, and the ways in which specific ranging   patterns are related to
              diet.  Data on foraging and food abundance will be   collected over an annual
              cycle by directly observing the animals and   monitoring their food sources. 
              This study will not only provide insight   into the extent and explanations of
              within-species variation in redtail   foraging, but will also contribute
              valuable comparative data that are   useful for models of optimal diet, and for
              planning conservation and   management strategies.
