Abstract    :
              9726013  King    This grant provides partial support of the costs of upgrading
              the  geophysics computing facility at Purdue University.  Specifically, the
              upgrade will involve purchase of SUN Ultra dual  processor workstations, SUN
              Ultra single processor workstations,  memory expansions, SCSI mass store
              devices, tape drives, a  printer, and a scanner.    Rapid obsolescence is a
              trademark of the computer industry and  the computational needs of this active
              group of geoscientists  warrants the latest in UNIX-based CPU's, extensive RAM
              and  massive data storage capabilities.  A mix of seven senior and  junior
              departmental faculty members and their graduate students  will benefit from
              these upgrades for a wide range of research  requiring advanced computation
              including, modeling mantle  dynamics, modeling lithospheric deformation near
              convergent  boundaries, modeling ice-flow dynamics, geomechanical studies of 
              fault-related folding, seismic tomography, and modeling  hydrologically
              mediated landscape evolution.  ***
