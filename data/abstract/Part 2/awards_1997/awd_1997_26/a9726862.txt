Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    97-26862  Hopkinson  W/WS: Integrated, ecological-economic modeling
              of watersheds and estuaries at multiple scales    The objective of this
              research is to integrate socioeconomic models with spatially explicit models of
              land use, ecosystem biogeochemistry and watershed hydrology to provide
              comprehensive assessments of human activities on nutrient, sediment and water
              fluxes for the Ipswich watershed in coastal Massachusetts.  An additional
              objective is to develop approaches that will allow application of these models
              to other watersheds. To assess human impacts on watershed dynamics, the
              investigators will use four types of models: socioeconomic, land-use change,
              hydrologic and stream biogeochemical. A key goal is to develop a means of
              assessing the impacts of urbanization and land-use change on watersheds and
              estuarine ecosystems in general, not just a specific assessment for the Ipswich
              River. The approach will enable the researchers to better assess human impacts
              on watersheds and to evaluate management strategies for minimizing or reversing
              watershed, riverine and estuarine degradation.
