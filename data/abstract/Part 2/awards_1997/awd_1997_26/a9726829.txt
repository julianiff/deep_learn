Abstract    :
                      9726829  Callaway and Zabinski  The highly aggressive invasive weed,
              Centaurea maculosa, appears to utilize an unusual mechanism to exclude a native
              bunchgrass in grasslands of the Intermountain prairie.  The basis of this
              interaction is tied to underground interactions via mycorrhizal fungi. This
              project will evaluate the role of these fungi in acting as mediators of the
              establishment of    Centaurea by preferentially transferring carbon from native
              grasses to this weed. The proposed research includes an integrated sequence of
              greenhouse, common garden, and field experiments to (1) test the generality of
              indirect interactions between mycorrhizal fungi and plant species native to the
              Intermountain grasslands in the presence and absence of the invasive species,
              (2) to determine the mechanism of the fungi-mediated interaction and (3) to
              determine the ecological relevance of such interactions in the field.
