Abstract    :
              9726587  Wheeler    Testing Relationships ofHeteroptera (Insecta) with DNA
              Sequence Data    The Heteroptera or true bugs, a suborder of the Hemiptera,
              represent what  is probably the largest group of insects with incomplete
              development. The approximately 40,000 species placed in the taxon demonstrate a
              tremendous range of life styles and biotic associations. Uniquely among
              insects, some can walk on the surface of water, while some of the truly aquatic
              forms can extract air directly from water through the use of a plastron. Many
              are predaceous on other insects, others feed on plants, including seeds,
              juices, and cell contents, and at least three lineages are vertebrate
              parasites.  Among this great variety of feeding types are found species of
              importance to agriculture and public health. DNA sequence data from four
              nuclear and mitochondrial loci (18SrDNA, 28SrDNA, mt 16SrDNA, and mtCOI) will
              be gathered and combined with morphological information to test 1 ) existing
              theories of higher-level heteropteran evolution and 2) notions of family-group
              relationships within five of the seven recognized higher groups.
