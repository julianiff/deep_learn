Abstract    :
              9726404  Parker  This study will use a combination of field and molecular
              genetic techniques to directly measure effects of artificial defoliation and
              litter manipulation on ectomycorrhizal (EM) community structure and specificity
              patterns in a successional context. EM specificity is thought to be an
              important factor controlling plant community dynamics, however, because it is
              often impossible to definitively identify fungal species forming EM on given
              roots, EM community structure and factors controlling specificity patterns are
              poorly understood. Recent molecular developments have largely solved this
              problem, and in previous work, these methods were used to perform the first
              field test of conflicting hypotheses regarding specificity in a field setting
              in Yellowstone National Park. This project will extend these results to study
              factors that change during forest succession and are thought to influence EM
              community dynamics. Specifically, these investigators will determine the roles
              of soil surface litter and chemistry, and carbon allocation to roots in
              controlling EM specificity. This project will be the first test of litter and
              chemistry effects on specificity using molecular methods, and the first
              assessment of species-specific responses by EM fungi in mutualistic
              relationships with plants to above-ground manipulations. Furthermore, results
              from this study will provide information critical to understanding connections
              between EM and plant community succession in a geographically dominant mixed
              conifer ecosystem.
