Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    97-26860  Loucks  W/WS: Development and implementation of decision
              support systems of predicting economic and ecologic impacts of alternative land
              and water management policies in urbanizing regions.       Community planning
              and environmental assessment boards must frequently evaluate proposed changes
              in current land and/or water use.  The aim of this research is to provide
              planning and environmental boards with an appropriate interactive PC
              computer-based technology for predicting the economic and ecologic impacts of
              decisions they may make regarding alternative water and land use policies. This
              research will identify and quantify how various temporal and spatial patterns
              of surface and ground water flows and pollutant concentrations effect land and
              water ecosystems.   The investigators will also predict how different land and
              water management policies and related socioeconomic activities influence local
              economic development and tax revenues. This research is a multidisciplinary
              effort.  The research team consists of an ecologist, a regional economist; and
              three agricultural-environmental and systems engineers.  A prototype of the
              technology will be ready for evaluation by potential users at the conclusion of
              the project.
