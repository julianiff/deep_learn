Abstract    :
              Powell  9726236    Understanding the forces that have shaped the basic genetic
              material, DNA, has important implications not only for understanding how
              evolution has occurred, but also in understanding how organisms function.  Many
              genes code for the amino acids that are assembled into long chains, which then
              form functioning proteins, including enzymes.  The DNA-based code for amino
              acids is redundant; i.e., there is more than one "word" (called a codon) for a
              single amino acid.  Thus, it is possible to have mutations that do not change
              in any way the protein product; these are called "silent" mutations.      It
              was long thought silent mutations would be invisible to detection by natural
              selection.  Increasing evidence is accumulating that selection can and does
              detect such mutations.  One piece of evidence is that certain "words" for an
              amino acid are used more frequently than others; this is called codon usage
              bias.  In unicellular organisms (bacteria and yeast), it is known that this
              uneven usage of codons happens because the molecules that decode codons, tRNAs,
              are not in equal abundance in the cell.  Especially for genes that are
              expressed at a very high level, there is selection to use the codons for which
              there is the greatest abundance of decoding tRNA.      This hypothesis has
              never been tested in a multicellular eukaryote.  This proposal is the first
              such test employing the model organism, Drosophila.  In particular, Dr. Powell
              has documented that different species of Drosophila have very different codon
              usage bias patterns, i.e., they are biased toward different codons.  If the
              tRNA explanation holds for these organisms, then the tRNA pools should differ
              between species.  Dr. Powell will test this prediction by studying tRNA pools
              in different species.
