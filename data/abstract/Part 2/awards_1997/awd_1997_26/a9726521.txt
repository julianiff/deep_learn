Abstract    :
                This three-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research
              aimed at the   development of methods to predict the constitutive behavior of
              nonlinear composite   materials.  The collaboration involves Pedro Ponte
              Castaneda and John Bassani of the   University of Pennsylvania and the research
              group of Pierre Suquet at the Mechanics and   Acoustics Laboratory of the
              French National Center for Scientific Research in Marseille,   France.  The
              investigators will focus their research on self-consistent models of nonlinear 
               composites and applications to polycrystals.  They will also investigate
              material behavior   at the single-crystal level, including
              elasto-viscoplasticity, multiple-slip hardening, and   size-scale efforts.  The
              US researchers bring to this collaboration expertise in theoretical work on
              nonlinear   homogenization and crystal plasticity.  This is complemented by
              experimental facilities in   Marseille and French expertise in numerical
              methods.  The project will advance   understanding of nonlinear microscopic
              mechanisms involved in deformation and   fracture of materials, such as
              plastics and metals.
