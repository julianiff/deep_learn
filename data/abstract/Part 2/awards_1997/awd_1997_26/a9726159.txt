Abstract    :
              The PI continues his study of Polar Summer Mesospheric Echoes with a new twist: 
              exploring the aeronomy.  Using data acquired by the MST radar at the Early
              Polar Cap Observatory, a post-doc:  (1) looks for interrelationships between
              spectral widths and signal-to-noise, and the phase of any present oscillations,
              (2) compares the scattering properties with the meteor diffusion times to
              locate a Schmidt Number effect in the latter (if it exists), and (3) uses the
              wave dispersion relationship to discover the high frequency limit to which
              meteor temperatures can be pushed by comparing them to wind perturbations
              measured with the radar.  Further, the PI remains committed to exploring
              Canadian instrumentation's data as a marker for global change (as manifested in
              the mesosphere).
