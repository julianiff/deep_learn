Abstract    :
              This award is made to Dr. Chao-Jun Li of the Chemistry Department, Tulane  
              University, for investigation of carbon-carbon bond formation in water.    The
              award is in the Technology for Sustainable Environment component of   the
              EPA/NSF Parnership for Environmental Research, and support is   provided by the
              Organic Synthesis Program and the Office of   Multidisciplinary Activities. 
              Carbon-carbon bond forming reactions are   typically carried out using metal
              catalysts in anhydrous organic   solvents.  In this study, the synthesis of
              various biologically important   compounds and fine chemicals will be carried
              out in  aqueous medium.  The   new method will be more efficient since the
              number of synthetic steps   will be reduced.  Additional research to attempt to
              make the reaction   catalytic is also planned.  Metal recovery and recycling
              from the aqueous   stream will be used to ensure that the new process is
              environmentally   beneficial.  The specific reactions to be investigated
              include indium-promoted   allylations, propargylation-allenylations, and aldol
              reactions.  Large volumes of organic solvents are used in fine chemical and  
              pharmaceutical industries for both reactions and product isolation.    These
              solvents must be recycled or treated by costly methods rather than   being
              expelled into the environment.  By developing alternative synthetic   methods
              using water as a solvent, the disposal problem for organic   solvents can be
              reduced.
