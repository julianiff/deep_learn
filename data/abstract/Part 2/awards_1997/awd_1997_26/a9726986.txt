Abstract    :
              9726986  Kaplan  Over the past 30 years, the Stroud Water Research Center has
              developed and used long-term ecological data for White Clay Creek watershed in
              three interrelated areas of inquiry: biogeochemistry, microbial ecology, and
              macro-invertebrate ecology. These studies represent a unique documentation of
              the temporal variability in a protected Piedmont stream ecosystem. The depth
              and detail in these data provide the baseline for a wide variety of research
              projects concerning the dynamics of stream ecosystems, and are essential in the
              evaluation of long-term patterns of environmental change. This current project
              will (1) maintain existing watershed installations needed to continue
              acquisition of long-term data on White Clay Creek, (2) address the data
              management needs of the long-term research project, including making the data
              available to the research community, and (3) test hypotheses concerning stream
              ecosystem structure and function under stable and/or recovering conditions that
              can only be examined with long-term data. This study is valuable in that it
              provides a long-term perspective on how land use history and atmospheric
              deposition affect stream water quality, organisms in stream communities, and
              ecosystem structure and function.
