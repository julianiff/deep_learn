Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of methodology for the  
              construction of a variety of C-X bonds: C-C, C-N and C-O.   The majority   of
              the effort will be be spent developing methods for catalytic   asymmetric
              activation of alkenes for attack by non-metal bound, external   nucleophiles. 
              To this end, the synthesis  of a variety of novel planar   chiral Pd(II)
              catalysts will be carried out.  The reactions targeted for   catalysis include
              allylic imidate rearrangements, Cope and Claisen   rearrangements, allylic
              ester rearrangements and cyclizations to form   chiral nitrogen and oxygen
              containing heterocycles.  A second aspect of   the research focuses on the
              asymmetric Heck reaction.  The objective of   all of the investigations is to
              develop practical catalytic methods   through systematic studies that will
              provide fundamental insight that   will enable future rational development of
              new asymmetric catalyst   architectures.  With this renewal award, the Organic
              and Macromolecular   Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Larry
              E. Overman of   the Department of Chemistry at the University of California,
              Irvine.    Professor Overman will focus his work on developing new catalytic  
              asymmetric transformations of inexpensive alkenes to valuable enantiopure  
              products.  The development of this type of methodology is of great   importance
              to the pharmaceutical industry.
