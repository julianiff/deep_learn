Abstract    :
              Stable Carbon and Nitrogen Isotope analysis of Eastern Canadian Arctic
              Populations with 14C Chronologies     The role of bowheads whales (Balaena
              mysticetus) in eastern Arctic economies has been a topic of particular interest
              over the past two decades.  It is widely recognized that the composition of
              animal bone assemblages from sites under study is not representative of bowhead
              predation intensities.  Proposed research will address this issue, employing
              stable carbon and nitrogen isotope chemistry to analysis a series of Dorset,
              Thule and proto-historic skeletal remains for dietary differences.  Stable
              isotope techniques are  well suited to distinguish intake of caribou from
              marine mammals and marine planktivores, such as bowheads, from marine
              carnivores in sampled populations.  Radiocarbon dating will establish temporal
              affiliation.
