Abstract    :
                This two-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research on
              studies of   changes in the strength of the earth's magnetic field during the
              Cretaceous period.  The   collaboration involves the research groups of H. Paul
              Johnson at the University of   Washington and Carlos Laj at the Center for
              Radioactive Intensity Studies, Gif-sur-  Yvette, France.  The investigators
              will perform paleointensity experiments on unaltered   Cretaceous volcanic rock
              from the Pacific Northwest.  In the French laboratory, the rocks   will be
              tested for geomagnetic field intensity and correlations between intensity and  
              polarity reversal rates.   The US investigator brings to this collaboration
              expertise in geophysics.  This is   complemented by French expertise in
              experiments in paleointensity.  The project's focus   on long-term changes in
              geomagnetic field strength will advance understanding of   function of the
              geodynamo and interactions between the liquid core and earth's lower   mantle.
