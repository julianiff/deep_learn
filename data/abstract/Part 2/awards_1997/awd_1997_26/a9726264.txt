Abstract    :
              9726264  Ripley    This grant provides partial support to Indiana University for
              the  costs of acquiring a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer  (SIRMS) with
              peripheral sample introduction and gas handling  devices.  The SIRMS will be
              dedicated to sulfur isotopic  analyses, replacing the 19-yr. old Nuclide mass
              spectrometer  currently operated at Indiana University. This new facility will 
              be shared by researchers from Indiana-Bloomington, the University  of Illinois
              at Champaign-Urbana and the University of Missouri-  Columbia.  
              State-of-the-art SIRMS allow analyses of much smaller  gas samples (< 1
              micromole) than currently possible on the  Nuclide, thus greatly expanding the
              analytical possibilities for  this regional group.  This facility will provide
              data for a wide  range of studies in economic geology, paleoceanography, 
              biogeochemistry and sulfur isotope systematics.  Specific studies  will include
              sulfur isotopic investigations of the genesis of  hydrothermal ore bodies
              within the Midcontinent Rift system,  species specific sulfur isotopic analyses
              of organic compounds as  proxies of diagenetic processes in anoxic marine
              sediments,  characterization of the biogeochemical pathways of sulfur in 
              Chesapeake Bay sediment pore-water systems, paleoenvironmental  studies of
              pyrite formation in anoxic Black Sea sediments, and  experimental studies of
              sulfur isotope fractionation in sulfosalt  systems.  ***
