Abstract    :
                This award supports Dr. Philip Pechukas and a graduate student from the
              Columbia   University in a collaboration with Herman Grabert of the Department
              of Physics at the   Albert Ludwigs University in Freiburg.  The collaboration
              brings together the   complementary capabilities of the German and U.S. groups
              to study open systems that   dissipate energy and momentum.  While the
              classical theory of dissipative functions is   highly developed, the theory of
              quantum dissipation is not well understood, especially in   the presence of
              strong interactions with the surroundings.  The present collaboration will  
              answer many current questions in the field by studying a large class of
              generalized models   of quantum dissipation.  Both groups have demonstrated
              success in this area in the past,   and the results of the present
              collaboration could be useful for many fields, including   quantum cosmology,
              the foundations of observation theory, quantum computing, and   modern optics.
