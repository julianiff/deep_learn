This award renews support of  the Fungal Genetics Stock Center
              (FGSC), a collection of filamentous fungi that has been supported by NSF since
              1960.  The FGSC includes almost 9,000 strains consisting mainly of strains of
              Neurospora crasa and Aspergillus nidulans with known mutations, as well as a
              few mutant strains of other fungi, primarily Sordaria fimicola. Most basic
              research into the biology of filamentous fungi makes use of one of these
              organisms.  In addition to these strains, the collection maintains stocks of
              isolated DNAs and libraries of fragments of genomic DNA and cDNA in
              bacteriophage vectors.  During the period of the award, a collection of mutants
              of Magneporthe grisea, a fungus responsible for rice blast, a major disease of
              rice, will be added to the collection.  In recent years, this fungus has become
              an important genetic model system for study of plant disease processes of
              interest to both basic and applied researchers.  
Samples of the collection
              are available to academic and other researchers on request.  A modest fee is
              charged for samples to help cover the cost of operation of the collection.  The
              FGSC maintains a website (http: www.kumc.edu/research/fgsc/) that provides
              information about the collection's contents and publications.
