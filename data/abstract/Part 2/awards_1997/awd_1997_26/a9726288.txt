Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    97-26288  DeLucia  Workshop: Critical assessment of the response of
              forest ecosystems to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide.    The IGBP-GCTE
              workshop on the Critical Assessment of the Response of Forest Ecosystems to
              Elevated Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide will be held in Durham, NC in October 1997.
              This is the third in a series of workshops, the goal of which is to foster the
              exchange of ideas and research findings among a diverse group of scientists
              studying the response of plants, native and cultivated, to increasing levels of
              atmospheric CO2 caused by the combustion of fossil fuels and global
              deforestation. Biogeochemical, ecophysiological and molecular perspectives will
              all be represented at the workshop and sessions will cover the latest
              developments in fundamental aspects of the response of tree communities to
              projected increases in atmospheric CO2.
