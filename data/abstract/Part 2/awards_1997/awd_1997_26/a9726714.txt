Abstract    :
                This two-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research on the
              nature   of Amazon sediment accumulation along the Guianas-Amapa coast of South
              America.    The collaboration involves the research groups led by Mead Allison
              of Texas A & M   University and Frederic Baltzer of the University of Paris,
              Sud.  The objectives of the   project are to determine:  (1) how the interplay
              between mudbank migration and mudcape   growth controls accretion and erosion
              on the Amapa-Guianas coast and (2) how   recruitment, growth rates, and
              survival of coast mangrove swamps are dependent on these   mechanisms.  The
              researchers will conduct a joint field study in French Guiana and bring  
              together information collected by these research groups in previous field
              studies.  The US investigators bring to this collaboration expertise in
              sedimentology,   geochronology and marine geophysics.  This is complemented by
              French expertise in    ecological, botanical and sedimentological studies of
              mangrove swamps.  The project   will advance understanding of the natural
              processes that control the evolution of a muddy   coastal system.  These
              systems make up a significant proportion of the world's coast   zones and are
              critical habitats that are disappearing under human encroachment.
