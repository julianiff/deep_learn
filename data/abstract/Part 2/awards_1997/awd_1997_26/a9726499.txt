Abstract    :
              9726499  Ohanian    Through a Small Grant for Exploratory Research, the WestEd
              National Center for Improving Science Education is investigating how reform in
              mathematics education in the middle school grades has been received by the
              public and how school personnel in these districts have responded to this
              public reaction.  Visits are made to five reform sites to conduct interviews
              with school personnel, parents, and other community members identified as
              taking a position on mathematics education reform.
