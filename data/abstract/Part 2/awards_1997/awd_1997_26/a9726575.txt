Abstract    :
                  CMS 9726575  Duval    Previous research suggests that exposure to a
              fear-arousing  or negative threat appeal type of persuasive communication  can
              increase level of earthquake preparedness.  In this  study a theory of coping
              with threatening events referred to  as the person-relative-to-event (PrE)
              approach is used to  generate predictions concerning the impact of this type of
               communication on earthquake preparedness.  In particular,  using PrE theory as
              a theoretical framework, the proposed  research extends prior findings by
              determining which levels  and combination of various levels of the variables
              included  in the content of negative threat appeals are most effective  in
              increasing earthquake preparedness.  The research will be  conducted in
              laboratory and field settings and will seek to  (1) advance the technological
              base on earthquake  preparedness by determining the conditions that increase 
              individual and household preparedness and mitigation, and  (2) expand the
              existing data base on earthquake preparedness  by obtaining data on current
              levels of household  preparedness among two different populations.  The
              outcomes  from the research can be incorporated into existing  earthquake
              preparedness programs and can also be applied to  hazards other than
              earthquakes, e.g., floods, hurricanes,  and tornadoes.
