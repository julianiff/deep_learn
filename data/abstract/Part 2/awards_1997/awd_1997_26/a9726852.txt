Abstract    :
                  The exploratory research addressed by this project focuses upon development
              of a theory of imprecise risk that is consistent with well-established
              engineering design mathematics, yet allows subjectively specified probability
              measure.  Engineering design activity often requires the a priori subjective
              assignment of a probability measure to all uncertain design inputs.  While
              subjective a priori assignment of probability measure eliminates imprecision in
              the characterization of risk, experience with such exercises shows that
              decision makers are not necessarily self-consistent and often do not satisfy
              the axioms of probability measure and/or utility theory when attempting to
              assign probabilities.  The objectives of this research activity are:  (1) to
              investigate imprecise risk associated with decision making in engineering
              design using measure theoretic principles; (2) to develop, from measure-based
              principles probability bounds on risk using subjectively assigned probability
              measure.      Should this research effort prove successful, it will provide an
              analytical framework for quantifying imprecise risk arising from often
              inconsistent, subjectively assigned event probabilities.  This will enable
              substantially improved decision making in virtually all engineering design.
