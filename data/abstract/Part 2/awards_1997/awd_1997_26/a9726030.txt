Abstract    :
              This project addresses the development and exploitation of a simple   technique
              for preparation of combinatorial libraries of compounds whose   synthetic
              histories are encoded by position along a one-dimensional solid   support. 
              This approach combines the attractive statistical control,   simplicity, and
              flexibility of the split-mix synthetic procedure with the   full library
              analysis of a spatial encoding approach.  Equipment   requirements are simpler
              than those for other spatial-encoding   techniques, and Fourier transformation
              of the signal output will lead   directly to structure-activity relationships.
              With the support of a Small   Grant for Exploratory Research from the Organic
              Synthesis Program,   Professor Alan W. Schwabacher, of the Department of
              Chemistry at the   University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, is developing an
              approach for the   generation and analysis of combinatorial libraries.  By
              adapting known   methods for the preparation of such `libraries` (groups of
              related   compounds) to incorporate the libraries along a one-dimensional solid
                support, these studies may lead to the development of techniques   requiring
              only simple equipment and permitting rapid analysis of   structure-activity
              relationships.
