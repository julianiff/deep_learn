Abstract    :
               The increasing need for high-temperature lightweight aluminum alloy composites
              in the automobile and aerospace industries requires satisfactory performance
              for cost-effective production of the composite parts.  A new method for the
              production of lightweight alloy composites through in-situ formation of
              equilibrium reinforcement phases, without any metastable phase formation is
              proposed in this project.  The principal objectives of this research project
              include: (1) processing of equilibrium silicon carbide, silicon nitride and
              metal silicide reinforced aluminum alloy composites without any intermediate
              metastable phase formations; (2) optimization of materials variables such as
              precursor, compositions and the process variables such as time , temperature,
              composition of melts, and the stirring conditions; (3) modeling of
              thermodynamic properties of the composite melts; and, (4) determination of
              reaction rates and mechanism of the composites formation.  High temperature
              oxidation and sulfidation of the composites will be investigated.   The
              experiments will be performed in an alumina crucible placed in the constant
              temperature zone of resistance heating furnace.     This work is expected to
              generate a newer understanding of the kinetics and thermodynamics of stable
              phase formation and control in composites interface reactions.  The results of
              these studies are expected to ultimately lead to the development of an
              innovative cost-effective method of producing composites for commerce.
