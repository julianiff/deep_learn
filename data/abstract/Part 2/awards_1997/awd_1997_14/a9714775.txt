Abstract    :
              This project is a collaborative team of five  institutions-Hofstra University,
              New York Institute of  Technology, the Uniondale Union Free School District,
              the  Hempstead Union Free School District, and Citizens  Environmental Research
              Institute.  The project targets (1)  seventh and eighth grade girls; (2) girls
              of color; and (3)  low income girls in an effort to increase the number of 
              girls who participate in mathematics and science activities.  The project seeks
              to develop female friendly classroom  practices and science and mathematics
              curriculum and to  place that curriculum within the formal structure of the 
              district instructional requirements.  Three hundred girls,  three hundred boys,
              200 parents, and 30  teachers/administrators will be served.  Project 
              deliverables will be suitable for use nationwide.    The strategies to improve
              attitudes toward and participation  in mathematics and science activities by
              girls include:  (1)  a core project on environmental social justice
              encompassing  the issues and data from the communities in which the girls 
              live; (2) integration of the project into the seventh and  eighth grade core
              science curriculum of the schools; (3)  development of the project so that it
              responds directly to  The Learning Standards for the New York State
              Mathematics,  Science and Technology Frameworks; (4) combination of single  sex
              and coeducational classroom, summer, Saturday, and after  school experiences;
              (5) development of CD ROM and other  instructional materials as models for 7th
              and 8th grade  instruction in New York State and the nation; (6) training  of
              teachers and parents in the curriculum materials, in  gender and learning
              issues, and in the objectives of the  program; (7) development of a seventh and
              eighth grade  science curriculum that is gender fair, encourages girls and 
              children of color to pursue science and mathematics and that  can be used with
              all children to satisfy New York State  Learning Standards for Mathematics,
              Science, and Technology;  (8) inv olvement of teachers in the humanities and
              the  arts-in addition to science, math and technology-to further  the goals of
              the project; and addition of computer  technology and learning in the classroom
              experience and in  teacher skills.    In addition, the project staff includes
              specialists in all  targeted areas.  The project will be led and staffed by 
              female school district and university personnel with  expertise in
              environmental justice, science instruction in  the middle school, gender issues
              in science, adolescent  female development, minority science participation, 
              classroom curriculum, biology, chemistry, mathematics,  social science,
              computer science, and environmental science.
