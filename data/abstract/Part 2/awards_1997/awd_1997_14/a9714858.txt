Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT: CMS-9714858, C.B. Crouse, Dames & Moore    The strong ground shaking
              recorded at the Jensen Filtration  Plant during the 1994 Northridge earthquake
              sequence  (mainshock and aftershocks) offers a unique opportunity to  study
              soil nonlinearity.    Two accelerographs stations close together at the Jensen 
              Filtration Plant in California recorded the earthquake  motions; one station
              was situated over moderately stiff  soil, the other on very stiff soil. The
              character of the two  recordings -- which were quite different -- suggests that
               nonlinear soil response could have been significant at the  moderately stiff
              soil site during the mainshock. However the  two buildings containing station
              accelerographs at this site  were also different, which raises the concern
              whether soil-  structure interaction affected the motions at one or both 
              stations. Thus the objective of this study is to investigate  the influence of
              soil-structure interaction on the  recordings.    Two Federal agencies are
              collaborating in the support of  this project: the US Geological Survey and the
              National  Science Foundation.
