Abstract    :
              This  award  funds an initial exploration of a theoretical  basis  for visual
              image structure, to aid in supporting queries to image  archives.  Digital
              image archives are proliferating, which raises  the  question  of  how  to
              retrieve specific  images  from  them.  However,   while  queries  are 
              naturally  posed  in  high-level,  functional terms, the realizations of such
              queries are  based  on  low-level image operators. An intermediate-level theory
              of visual  structure is necessary to close this gap, which is precisely what 
              this  research  addresses.  Based on an  interpretation  of  edge  elements  as
               tangent  estimates, it is  derived  from  geometric  measure  and  complexity
              theory.  Viewed from below,  the  theory  provides   an   organization  for 
              edge  elements  according   to  dimension.  They  are either bound into
              extended  (1-dimensional)  groups,  into  (2-dimensional) structural classes 
              that  abstract  different   types  of  texture,  or  (0-dimensional) 
              orientation  discontinuities.  Viewed from above, the  representation  induces 
              equivalence  classes  of structure, such  as  bounding  contours,  texture 
              flows  for hair and grass patterns, and  ``T''-junctions  for  points of
              occlusion. Thus queries involving forests  can  be  differentiated  from  those
              involving fur patterns  or  turbulent  water,  and  multiple, overlapping
              objects can be separated  into  components.  Furthermore, images and drawings 
              can  be  segmented  from pages of text.
