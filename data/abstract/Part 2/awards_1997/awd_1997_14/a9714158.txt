Abstract    :
              Abstract  Wang/ATM-9714158    This grant provides support for research being
              pursued by two Ph.D. students on the  microphysical processes of ice particles
              in cirrus clouds.   The funding is for a  period of one year, which should
              allow the students to complete their degree  programs.  The research should
              lead to better understanding of the sensitivity of  microphysical processes to
              variations in the atmospheric conditions (for example,  temperature and
              humidity) in the cloud environment.            wangabs.doc
