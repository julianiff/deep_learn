Abstract    :
              9714414  Pfeffer        The U.S. Weather Research Program (USWRP) is an
              interagency activity  designed to perform and implement the research necessary
              to improve the delivery  of weather services to the nation.  Under this
              Program, the National Science  Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
              Administration, the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration and the
              Office of Naval Research are jointly  evaluating and supporting research of
              high priority to the USWRP.           Accurate quantitative forecasting of
              precipitation (Quantitative Precipitation  Forecasting, QPF) has proven to be
              an especially difficult problem and one where  little progress has been made
              over the last several years.  For this reason, better QPF  techniques has been
              identified by both the scientific and operational communities as  an area ripe
              for research.        The Principal Investigator will investigate new
              applications of statistical  techniques designed to improve QPF.   Two
              nonlinear methodologies will be  pursued in this research with statistics
              derived from 33 years of 3-hourly surface  observations and 12-hourly upper air
              observations covering the United States east of  the Rocky Mountains.  One
              involves the design of neural networks with outputs that  correspond to the
              probability of occurrence of standard precipitation threshold  values.   The
              other methodology involves the use of analogs of time sequences  (rather than
              instantaneous values) of synoptic variables obtained from ensemble  numerical
              forecasts to specify precipitation probabilities.    ***
