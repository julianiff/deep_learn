Abstract    :
              In attempting to quantify the upward coupling of lower atmosphere forcing on the
              thermosphere's composition structure, the investigators are using a 'seamless'
              global model based on physics within two existing models.  The Spectral
              Mesosphere Lower Thermosphere Model (SMLTM) produces realistic simulations of
              mean winds, tidal amplitudes, and gravity wave forcing, while the Coupled
              Thermosphere Ionosphere Model (CTIM) examines physics of the upper atmosphere,
              including thermosphere-ionosphere interactions, and the dynamics and
              composition response to solar and geomagnetic activity.  Combined, the two
              models emphasize the impact seasonal and hemispheric asymmetry of tides and
              gravity waves have on major species composition of the atmosphere.  In
              addition, they determine the impact of lower atmosphere forcing on
              thermospheric composition, temperature and wind structure, and neutral density
              anomalies.
