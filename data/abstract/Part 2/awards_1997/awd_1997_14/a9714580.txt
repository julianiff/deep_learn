Abstract    :
                This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry
              Program, addresses fundamental questions of the growth of  oxide and hydroxide
              films on reactive metals in aqueous solutions.   Professor Kelber, at the
              University of North Texas, will use a  combination of ultra high vacuum
              electrochemical methods and  reflection absorption UV/VIS spectroscopy to
              characterize reactions  at iron and nickel surfaces.  X-ray photoelectron
              spectroscopy will  be used for compositional analysis of the interfaces formed,
              and  the effects of substrate structure and composition on the reactions  of
              the surfaces in aqueous solutions will be probed.  This research  provides
              fundamental understanding of the processes of corrosion,  environmental
              adsorption of species contained in groundwater, and  the action of corrosion
              inhibitors at the surfaces of reactive  metals.   A detailed understanding of
              the interaction of reactive metal and  metal oxide surfaces with aqueous
              environments is important to  controlling and preventing corrosion.  The
              research carried out in  this project provides structural and kinetic
              information which will  help to understand this important process.  A new
              method for  probing these interfaces in situ using reflection absorption UV/VIS
               spectroscopy is being developed.  These studies will increase our 
              understanding of corrosion and related environmentally important  processes.
