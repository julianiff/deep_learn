Abstract    :
                    The Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) will purchase and install of a 
              replacement emergency power generator set in the Whitman Laboratory  Building.
              The current generator set and distribution system, which is  38 years old,
              provides emergency electrical power to the MBL's main  summer laboratory
              (Whitman), to the MBL's main year-round laboratory  (the Lillie Laboratory
              Building), and to the MBL's sole seawater  pumping station, which supplies
              these two laboratories, the Loeb  Laboratory Building (research and research
              training), and the Marine  Resources Center with a constant supply of seawater
              throughout the  year. These improvements will assist the MBL in its ability to 
              support integrated research and educational activities by MBL  investigators
              who need all-weather access to modern laboratory  services, who require
              dependable (and sometimes long-term)  refrigeration to preserve their reagents,
              preparations, and  organisms, and who require flowing seawater in their
              laboratories and  to support the MBL's extensive research animal collections.
