Abstract    :
              9714887  Oldow   In circumstances where the convergence vector between two
              plates is oblique to the suture, deformation is partitioned into arc-parallel
              (strike-slip) and arc normal (thrust) components.  The parameters controlling
              this partitioning are not well known, and several models exist.  This research
              in the Aleutian arc takes advantage of a curved suture between plate where the
              vector varies smoothly from near O (orthogonal) to near 90o (pure strike-slip)
              to address some of the possible parameters.  If the coupling between upper and
              lower plates remains constant, increasing arc-parallel extension in the upper
              plate with increasing obliquity should be observed.  However, no arc-parallel
              extension need occur if coupling decreases with increasing obliquity.  This
              project will employ GPS technology to determine translations of the islands
              along the Aleutian arc and structural analysis to determine operative slip and
              deformation response.  Results should document partitioning of strain with
              increasing obliquity, identify operative slip mechanisms and allow testing of
              several hypotheses about partitioning in situation where convergent vectors are
              oblique to plate margins.
