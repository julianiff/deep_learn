Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9714979  John O'Connell    Thermodynamic properties are a
              principal basis for innovative and improved chemical process synthesis, design
              and optimization.  With the advent of high-speed computers, many of the trial
              and error steps of bench scale and pilot plant development can be eliminated if
              reliable and accurate methods are available for 1) volumes to size units, 2)
              energies to obtain heat and work effects, and 3) chemical potentials/fugacities
              to calculate phase and reaction equilibria for separation and reaction limits. 
              Since thermodynamics show how all of these properties can be obtained from
              rigorous mathematical operations on models such as the equation of state, when
              accurate expressions have been derived and parameter values fitted to the data.
              Large amounts of quantitative results can be directly obtained.  Thus, the goal
              of considerable current research is to find models that can describe many
              classes of substances, mixtures and conditions.    The Project for Standardized
              Validation of Physical Properties Models (SVPPM) has been initiated to provide
              basic information to model generators and users about the consistency,
              behavior, accuracy, and reliability for quantitative property descriptions of
              chemical systems.  Interactions with various industrial experts have stimulated
              enthusiasm and guidance for the project; financial support has been provided
              from NIST.     An organizational structure has been proposed and will be
              implemented in stages.  Current goals are 1) to establish a computer program
              for a range of tests on equations of that will be accessible via the internet
              and 2) to demonstrate it at the 8th International Conference on Properties and
              Phase Equilibria for Product and Process Design in April, 1998.  ***
