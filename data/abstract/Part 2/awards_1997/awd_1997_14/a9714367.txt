Abstract    :
              PROJECT SUMMARY      The dynamics of the fully-developed axisymmetric far jet
              using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) techniques will be investigated
              experimentally.  The overall goal is to obtain a better understanding of the
              structure of the far jet, and the degree to which its evolution is foreshadowed
              by the near jet.   The experiment has two specific objective:    * First, POD
              techniques will be applied to extensive measurements of the velocity
              cross-spectra in order to determine the eigenfunctions describing the far jet. 
                * Second, the eigenfunctions determined will be used to reconstruct the
              instantaneous flow, both spatially and temporally, in whole or in part.    The
              investigation will use two unique experimental apparatus: one a 138 hot-wire
              probe developed earlier to study the jet mixing layer; the other a flying array
              of 15 hot-wire, the spacing of which changes with downstream distance from the
              jet exit.  These techniques will be used in conjunction the known one- and
              two-point similarity properties of the far jet to determine the spatial and
              temporal evolution of the POD eigenfunction which comprise the flow (including
              their streamwise dependence)
