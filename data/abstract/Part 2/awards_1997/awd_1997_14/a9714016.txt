Abstract    :
              Professor Clifford Dykstra is supported by a grant from the Theoretical   and
              Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research on the   analysis of
              dynamical features of weakly bound complexes. Ab initio   electronic structure
              calculations are used for evaluating the intrinsic   electrical response
              properties of molecules. The results of these   calculations are incorporated
              into a molecular mechanics model for   clusters which can then be used to
              predict molecular structures of larger   clusters.  A new feature of this work
              is the incorporation of diffusion   quantum Monte Carlo methodology to improve
              the predictions of dynamical   properties. The primary goal of the work is a
              detailed, fundamental   understanding of weak interactions, including
              transferable potentials,   electronic structure changes, and dynamical
              manifestations.  Weak molecular interactions are important in problems ranging
              from   molecular clustering, certain surface phenomena, nonlinear optical  
              response of aggregations, aspects of protein structure, and drug design.   
              This work is aimed at achieving reliable predictive capability for   structures
              and energetics of weak clusters, and for the changes in   properties of systems
              which experience weak inter- and intramolecular   interactions such as
              hydrogen-bonding.
