Abstract    :
              The investigators continue their observations of temperature and sodium density
              in the mesopause region with a wind/temperature lidar.  They are improving the
              lidar's accuracy and robustness with a daytime and wind capability, with enough
              data in three years to reveal seasonal variations of the data.  In addition to
              exploring climatology and trends, this long data set reveals information on
              variability from climatological mean, tidal and gravity waves, heat flux,
              horizontal winds, and temperature-sodium density correlation.  Continually
              collected, analyzed data can provide interesting results with the lidar.  For
              instance, plotting monthly mean temperatures at each altitude over seven years,
              investigators observed a 3-4 year warming trend (peaking in 1993), believed to
              be the first evidence of Pinatubo impacting the atmosphere as high as 100
              kilometers.
