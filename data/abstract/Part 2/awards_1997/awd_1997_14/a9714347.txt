              of Iowa   The research will assess the possible relations between pattern and
              process by using a spatially explicit simulation model that produces spatial
              patterns which will be compared to patterns recorded by Landsat imagery.  The
              work will allow testing of the effects of different positive feedback strength,
              seed rain, and environmental gradient on the abundance of tree species at an
              ecotone.  A sample of 30 to 40 rectangular hillslopes will be identified for
              this purpose in Glacier National Park.  The patterns observed on the landscape
              and simulated in the model runs will be quantified using common metrics of
              landscape pattern.  Further a hybrid metric will be generated which best
              describes the dominant variation among the sampled units.  A model to predict
              the observed metrics will be fit from the simulation parameterizations.  The
              outcome will be a deeper understanding of the basic ecology of ecotones through
              a stronger conceptualization between pattern and process.  The work is also
              germane to the notion of ecotones as indicators of the impacts of climate
              change.
