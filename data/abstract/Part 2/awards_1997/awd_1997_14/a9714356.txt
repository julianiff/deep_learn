Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is at the meeting point of theory and   experiment. 
              The isomerization and fragmentation reactions of small   hydrocarbons will be
              probed. Reactions for which rates, activation   parameters and mechanisms will
              be examined include: cis-trans   isomerization of ethylene-1,2-d2; structural
              and geometric isomerizations   of cyclopropane-1,2-d2, cyclopropane-1,2,3-d3
              and cyclobutane-1,3-d2,   plus numerous methyl- and ethyl-substituted
              cyclopropanes; geometric   isomerization and elimination of molecular hydrogen
              from   cyclopentene-3,4-d2; isomerization of a number of bicycloalkanes; and  
              thermal decomposition of 2-methyl-2-propanol-1,1,1-d3.  All  of the   reactions
              are of interest to computational modelers, and for each there   is some
              uncertainty over rate, mechanism or stereochemistry.   With this Research in
              Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award, the Organic   Dynamics Program and the
              Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) are   supporting the research
              efforts of Drs. David K.Lewis and Bansi L. Kalra   of the Department of
              Chemistry at Connecticut College.  The project   examines the rates and
              detailed mechanisms of prototype isomerization and   fragmentation reactions of
              small hydrocarbons.  The work, at the   interface of theory and experiment, 
              will allow the continuation of a   well established undergraduate research
              program.
