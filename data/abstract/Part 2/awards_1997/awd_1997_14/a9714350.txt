              This award supports a two day workshop held May 12-14, 1997 in Vienna  Virginia
              to develop the computing and communication research agenda needed  to complete
              the Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiative.  The  approximately 100
              participants were drawn from academia, industry and  government.  Products of
              the workshop are a report posted on the Computing  Research Association web
              site, a published document, and a widely  distributed video of the workshop.
