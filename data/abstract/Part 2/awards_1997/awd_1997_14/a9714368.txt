Abstract    :
              9714368  Coffin  Large igneous provinces have been produced by massive
              accumulations  of basalt produced in the mantle and are represented by features
               such as continental flood basalts and ocean plateaus. Although  significant in
              terms of global geochemical cycling, mantle  convection and cooling, and
              potentially global climate change,  little is known about the specific
              processes responsible for  production of such large volumes of mantle melt or
              their  emplacement at the earth's surface. The present award will support 
              participation of U.S. scientists in a Japanese led study of the  Ontong Java
              Plateau in the western Pacific which is one of the best  examples of an oceanic
              large igneous province. Seismic refraction  and reflection data will be
              acquired to examine the crustal  structure and history of formation of the
              Plateau. Dr. Coffin will  have primary responsibility for processing and
              interpreting seismic  reflection data to be acquired by the Japanese, and will
              also be  involved in all other aspects of data interpretation and modelling. 
              Data from the cruise will be used to guide selection of candidate  drill sites
              for planning by the Ocean Drilling Program.  ***
