Abstract    :
              9714927  Pachavis  The symposium will bring together experts from all over the 
              world to discuss recent advances in materials for  cementitious composites. 
              The organizers anticipate that  discussions that elucidate various aspects of
              the structure-  composition-property relationships in modern cementitious 
              systems will form the basis of the meeting.  The funds being  requested from
              the Foundation will be used to provide  partial travel support primarily for
              graduate students to  attend the meeting.  ***
