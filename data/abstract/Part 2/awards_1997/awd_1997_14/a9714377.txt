Abstract    :
              Abstract - Tsotsis - 9714377    Chemical Reaction Engineering (CRE) is the field
              which deals with the design and engineering aspects of chemically reactive
              systems.  It first arose in the 1940s and 1950s to meet the technical needs of
              the petroleum and chemical industry.  The objective of CRE is to relate
              chemical reactor performance to feed materials characteristics and operating
              variables.  From the catalytic hydrocracking of heavy petroleum fractions to
              produce gasoline and other fuels, to the chemical vapor deposition of thin
              films for microelectronics applications, CRE is an active, productive research
              area.    The primary meetings for the international CRE community are the
              biennial International Symposia in Chemical Reaction Engineering (ISCRE)
              conferences.  The location of these meetings alternates between Europe and
              North America.  These conferences bring together for three days international
              practitioners of the field from both academia and industry.    ISCRE 15 is
              slated to take place in Newport Beach, CA on September 13-16, 1998 and its
              theme is "Chemical Reaction Engineering for a Cleaner Environment, Advanced
              Materials Processing and Increased Profitability."  Though ISCRE 15 will
              emphasize the fundamentals, of equal importance will be the technological
              advances that are currently shaping the future of the field.  Topical areas
              will include:    o Reactors for Materials Processing  o Waste Minimization and
              Remediation  o Environmentally Benign Processing  o Reactor Dynamics  o Reactor
              Control and Safety  o Reactor Scale-up and Economic Evaluation  o Computational
              and Modeling Aspects of Reaction/Reactor Engineering  o Fluid-Solid Catalytic
              and Non-Catalytic Reaction Systems  o Catalytic, Polymerization and Biochemical
              Reactors
