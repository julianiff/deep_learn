                Abstract  Hart, John E.  University of  Colorado  ATM-9714221  Title: Studies
              of Rotating Fluids    The objective of this research is a critical examination
              of theories and modeling techniques relevant to atmospheric dynamics, by means
              of laboratory experiments on mechanically driven rotating fluids. Detailed
              measurements of velocity fields in single-layer and two-layer systems will be
              made using high resolution particle image velocimetry and laser doppler
              anemometry.  The data will test theories of baroclinic wave chaos, Reynolds
              stress closure models of turbulence, and subgrid scale modeling methods
              currently used in meteorological large eddy simulations. Most of the
              experiments will take place in a rotating cylinder, with fluid motions being
              driven mechanically by a differentially rotating lid. This system has
              advantages of simplicity, the presence of a homogeneous direction, the ability
              to study a large range of Reynolds numbers (l03 to order 106), the suitability
              for use of particle image velocimetry, and the relative ease of comparing model
              predictions with the experimentaldata.    Experiments on two-layer flows will
              focus on asymmetries in the baroclinic instability and chaos problems.  An
              extensive set of experiments on single-layer flows will provide a
              categorization of instabilities on the sidewall, as well as data on separation
              and instability in the top and bottom boundary layers. Preliminary work has
              shown that this three-parameter system has numerous instabilities, mixed in
              with vertically erupting horizontal boundary layers.  These phenomena are
              important for understanding the behavior of boundary layers under atmospheric
              vortices.   Detailed characteristics of the flows will be compared with results
              from axisymmetric numerical simulations and linear instability theory.   
              Fundamental studies such as these underlie future improvements in numerical
              models of atmospheric motions.
