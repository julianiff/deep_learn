              ABSTRACT    OPP-9714349      VAN WOERT, MICHAEL  OFFICE OF NAVAL RESEARCH       
                 This project is a key component of a large, coordinated, multi-investigator
              program, Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean.  The research program
              will be conducted for 14 months from a ship frozen into the ice pack. A large
              array of instruments will be deployed from a central camp surrounding the ship
              to measure ice, ocean, and atmospheric conditions through a full annual cycle. 
              This research will be important for the determination of the effects of
              incoming heat radiating onto the ice floe as a function of changing atmospheric
              and oceanic conditions. The SHEBA results will help determine how atmospheric
              heating is coupled to adsorption of heat by the sea ice. These measurements are
              critical to understanding how heat is reflected or absorbed by the ice as it
              melts in the summer and thickens in the winter in response to seasonal
              variations in climate. This project will provide the research support at the
              ship and surrounding camp and will include transport of instruments and
              supplies to the ship/camp, setting up experiments, and providing transportation
              to distant research siteq. The logistical infrastructure provided by this
              project makes an essential contribution to the SHEBA team of researchers. The
              combined set of measurements in SHEBA will allow refinement of climate models
              for the Arctic region. Those improved models will lead to better predictions of
              the climate and the permanence of the Arctic ice cap under a proposed global
              warming that could occur if atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are increased
              above present levels.
