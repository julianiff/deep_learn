Abstract    :
              9714729  This project is a collaborative between George Washington  University
              and Gallaudet.  In addition, several HBCUs and a woman's  college will serve as
              cooperating partners.  The goal of the  project is to increase the
              participation of women in SEM  educational and career pathways.  FORWARD has
              additional foci:   Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing women, women at traditionally Black
               universities.  Guidance counselors and teachers are targeted in  order to
              reach high school deaf women contemplating SEM career  paths.  The project
              provides mentors, interpreters, undergraduate  and graduate research
              experiences for the targeted student  populations, and a variety of model and
              experimental pedagogical  strategies to provide skills and awareness of issues
              and concerns  to teachers and counselors of deaf women and women of color.
