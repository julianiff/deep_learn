Abstract    :
              Under flash-crowd conditions, where congestion arises near the server because a
              large number of users wish to retrieve files from it over a short period of
              time, users are in a unique position to benefit enormously from each other by
              sharing retrieved files. Pseudo-serving, a new paradigm for Internet access,
              provides incentives for users to contribute to the speedy dissemination of
              server files through a contract set by a super-server. Under this contract, the
              super-server grants a user a referral to where a copy of the requested file may
              be retrieved in exchange for her assurance to serve other users for a specified
              period of time. In this proposed project, we will investigate issues that must
              be resolved in order to make pseudo-serving an effective tool for dissipating
              flash-crowds on the Internet. This includes issues related to the acceptability
              of the contract to the user, the ability of the super-server to set contracts
              that account for the physical distribution of sources of the requests, security
              issues and various approaches in dealing with contract breaches, and strategies
              for integrating pseudo-serving into various caching policies. The outcome of
              this research will help the World Wide Web to scale more gracefully and provide
              a mechanism through which users can barter their local resources for
              preferential access to information from busy servers.
