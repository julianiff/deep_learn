Abstract    :
              Abstract - Badgwell - 9714950    Model Predictive Control (MPC) refers to a
              class of algorithms that control future plant behavior through the use of an
              explicit process model.  MPC technology is used throughout the petroleum
              refining and chemical industries.  A typical MPC controller adjusts plant
              inputs once a minute in order to optimize future plant performance.  Industrial
              MPC algorithms use a variety of performance objectives, input
              parameterizations, and process models.  MPC algorithms owe their power to the
              fact that they have a mathematical description of the process to be controlled.
               In practice, however, the model is only an approximation of true plant
              behavior and problems can arise when model errors become significant.    The
              objective of this project is to develop and implement a new family of robust
              MPC algorithms in which plant uncertainty is incorporated directly into the
              control formulation.  Theoretical and computational issues will be addressed;
              prototype algorithms will be developed in the Matlab programming language and
              will be tested on two simulated processes.  In addition, field tests are
              planned on a high purity distillation columns and a polymer reaction system at
              Exxon Chemical Inc.  The verified algorithms will then be incorporated into
              next-generation MPC products by Aspen Technology, Inc.  This is a Grant
              Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) grant.
