Abstract    :
              9714322  Dale    The Birmingham Public School System and the University of
              Alabama  at Birmingham formed a partnership to address the problem of 
              declining mathematics achievement in the district.  This project  will provide
              major staff development for teachers of grades K-5.    The Birmingham K-5
              reform plan has four main elements:    1.   The adoption of a high-quality
              reform-based curriculum series,       Everyday Mathematics.    2.   The
              creation of a mathematics Staff Development Team composed       of classroom
              teachers, mathematics educators, and       mathematicians,     3.   The
              provision of substantive teacher enhancement for all K-5       teachers in the
              system, and    4.   The development of a plan for on-going teacher renewal
              after       the project ends.    All 907 of the district's K-5 teachers will
              participate in an  intensive staff development program that includes summer
              institutes  and academic year meetings.  The Staff Development Team will design
               and implement the program.  The NSF-funded Bridges to Classroom  Mathematics
              Project will work cooperatively with the Staff  Development Team in designing
              the program.  Additionally, five  Mathematics Resource Teachers will support
              classroom teachers  during implementation.  Parents, teachers, administrators,
              and the  business community participated in the planning.  The project 
              evaluation will include participation in the core evaluation  process, along
              with all of the other LSC projects.
