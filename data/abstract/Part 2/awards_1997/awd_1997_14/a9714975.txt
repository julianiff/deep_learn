Abstract    :
                    This proposal is designed to pursue opportunities to advance our knowledge
              of the morphology, functional anatomy, and phylogeny of early mammals.  These
              opportunities developed as the result of the recent discovery of associated
              remains of a haramiyid mammal in the upper Fleming Fjord Formation of East
              Greenland.  The discovery not only reveals greater diversity among early
              mammals than previously known, but also demonstrates how readily the current
              conceptual framework of early mammalian evolution may be reordered by new
              evidence.  The proposed investigation will exploit this discovery by recovering
              associated skeletal remains from the deposits.  The realistic prospect of
              recovering additional associated mammalian skeletal material from the Fleming
              Fjord Formation offers excellent potential to increase significantly our
              knowledge of the early evolution of Mammalia.
