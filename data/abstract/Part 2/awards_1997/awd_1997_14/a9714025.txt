Abstract    :
              9714025  Hardin    This Small Grant for Exploratory Research is based on the
              unexpected observation that a set of guanine-rich oligodeoxynucleotide primers
              as well as related telomeric sequences from yeast, Oxytricha and Tetrahymena
              are capable of priming DNA synthesis by Taq DNA polymerase in the absence of an
              independent DNA template.  This research will determine the rules for base
              incorporation by DNA polymerase using non-B DNA template structures, which
              preliminary data indicates is very specific.  Polymerase fidelity will be
              determined by cloning and sequencing products of multiple, independent
              polymerase chain reactions using a variety of primers, and the sequence data
              will be analyzed for consistency of base incorporation.  Results from this
              research will facilitate development of a system to investigate the chemistry
              and enzymology of genome expansion as it relates to genome evolution, and may
              reveal an alternative mechanism for maintaining chromosome ends (telomers).
