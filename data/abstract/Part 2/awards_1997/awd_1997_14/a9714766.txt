Abstract    :
              9714766  Moody    This is an equipment grant to the University of Virginia's
              Department of Environmental Sciences, an interdisciplinary program concerned
              with the interaction of processes that shape the natural environment, offers
              undergraduate and graduate curriculum with four core components:  atmospheric
              science, ecology, geology and hydrology.  The computational and atmospheric
              data ingest capacities will be upgraded and the department's facility for
              atmospheric data acquisition and display for use in environmental research
              projects will be enhanced.  The facility will also contribute to classroom
              instruction in addition to research applications and hands-on laboratory
              activities using real-time meteorological data.  While many universities
              already provide a distribution of real-time and archived weather information
              and forecasts via the internet, the goal is not to duplicate these kinds of
              community service efforts to make processed data available.  Rather, the goal
              is to make real-time and archived weather information and data display tools
              available to this interdisciplinary community of researchers who are focused on
              a wide range of issues in which knowledge of atmospheric conditions, past,
              present and future often plays a role.
