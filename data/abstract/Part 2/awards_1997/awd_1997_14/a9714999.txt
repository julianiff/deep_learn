Abstract    :
              9714999  Reys    A national center, the Show-Me Center, is established at the
              University of Missouri, Columbia for facilitating and supporting implementation
              of middle school mathematics curriculum based on recommendations of the
              Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics issued by the
              National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.  The Show-Me Center, in
              partnership with the five NSF-supported middle school mathematics materials
              development projects (Connected Mathematics Project; Seeing and Thinking
              Mathematically; Mathematics in Context; Six Through Eight Mathematics, and
              Middle-school Mathematics Through Applications Project) and their commercial
              publishers,  disseminates information and facilitates national awareness and
              implementation of new curricular models which support Standards-based reform in
              middle school mathematics classrooms.  Each materials development project
              serves as a satellite center and is a focal point for establishing networks of
              teachers, schools, districts, and state leadership personnel exploring and
              investing in standards-based reform.
