Abstract    :
                    9712658  Holzer  After the 1989 Loma Prieta, California earthquake,
              Congress  appropriated funds through a special supplement that included  money
              to support research and documentation on the effects of  that event.  This
              money was awarded to investigators through  joint NSF/USGS peer review panels.
              A stipulation in each award  was that investigators contribute to a special
              report on the  earthquake that would serve as the definitive report on the 
              earthquake.  Thus this report should serve as the major reference  on the
              earthquake for future generations of scientists,  engineers, and social
              scientists.  This award provides funding  for publishing that part of the
              report focusing on the  performance of the built environment, which is the
              portion of the  research supported primarily through NSF's Earthquake Hazard 
              Mitigation Program.  This is a collaborative effort between NSF  and the U.S.
              Geological Survey.  ***
