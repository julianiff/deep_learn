Abstract    :
              98714918  Fuentes    Support is provided for graduate students to participate in
              the "Workshop on Biogenic Hydrocarbons in the Atmospheric Boundary Layer",
              which will be held at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, on 24-27
              August, 1997. This meeting will bring together micrometeorologists, plant
              physiologists, and atmospheric chemists and focus on the following issues: (1)
              Plant physiological and environmental controls on biogenic volatile organic
              carbon (BVOC), including the review of recent laboratory and field studies; (2)
              Measurements and modeling of BVOC emissions at the foliage and ecosystem
              levels, including work related to gas exchange using cuvette systems and
              micrometeorological techniques; (3) Atmospheric observations, including recent
              results from BEMA, BOREAS, NARSTO, and SOS, and new developments of analytical
              methods and measurement technologies; (3) Chemical mechanisms for BVOC,
              including laboratory kinetic studies and smog chamber experiments; (4)
              Photochemical modeling of the role of BVOCs on a regional and global scale,
              including the application of chemical mechanisms, combined with emission model
              developments.
