Abstract    :
              The Department of Meteorology at University of Utah requests matching funds to
              assist in the building of a meteorological computation and visualization
              laboratory for undergraduate education and scientific research.  Funds
              requested would be used to purchase four workstations that will complement
              additional hardware acquired by the University.  The improvements enabled by
              the University upgrades and the Unidata equipment award will allow the
              department to continue it role as an archived data acquisition site for the
              Unidata community and, coupled with the vBNS, become a real-time data
              distribution site for the Unidata network.
