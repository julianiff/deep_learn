Abstract    :
              9714843  Dlott    The goal of this work is to understand the mechanical dynamics
              of  molecular materials, and to relate the dynamics to chemical  reactivity and
              function.  The proposed work falls into two  distinct areas, (1) vibrational
              energy transfer and (2) shock  waves in materials.  Simple liquids, such as
              acetonitrile and  water, and solids such as naphthalene which are of current 
              theoretical interest will be studied.  Shock waves will be used  to study
              shock-induced chemical reactions in simple model  systems, and shock-induced
              material transformations and  relaxation processes in complex systems such as
              glasses and  proteins.  Shock methods with greater time resolution using 
              surface sensitive spectroscopies will be developed.  Studies of  laser
              photothermal imaging materials will be extended to a  variety of imaging
              materials with different architectures to  develop a general understanding of
              the fundamentals of laser  photothermal imaging processing.  %%%  An
              understanding of ultrafast dynamics and shock wave induced  chemistry in
              condensed matter systems that include liquids and  solutions, polymeric solids
              and proteins play an important role  in a number of materials areas such as
              biomedical applications,  and photothermal laser-imaging materials for graphic
              arts  applications.  ***
