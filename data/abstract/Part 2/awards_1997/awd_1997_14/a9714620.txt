Abstract    :
              Investigators Gary Swenson and Chester Gardner developed a model relationship
              for the hydroxyl radical Meinel band airglow, focusing on the intensity or
              rotational temperature changes and changes due to atmospheric wave perturbed
              density/temperature.  Now, they extend validating this model to use data from
              two facilities.  They are also using the same relationship of intensity to the
              5577 angstrom emission from atomic oxygen and the oxygen molecule atmospheric
              band airglow.  Finally, they are developing spectral models of airglow images
              to study MesoD campaign data from Illinois, and will upgrade and field an
              airglow imager at Albuquerque, associated with a Starfire follow-on campaign. 
              An added benefit to this project is its investment to planned investigations
              with the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED)
              satellite mission.
