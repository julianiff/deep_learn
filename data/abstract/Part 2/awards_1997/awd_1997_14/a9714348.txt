Abstract    :
                      ABSTRACT  EEC-9714348  Pikal      The key to bringing a successful
              therapeutic entity to market is to develop a stable product that can be
              manufactured and distributed in a dosage form useful to the patient.  The
              development of the manufacturing process for a therapeutic agent must proceed
              quickly and efficiently in order for the pharmaceutical company to be
              economically successful.  However, there are significant technical challenges
              that must be overcome, such as physical and chemical stability problems and
              changes in dosage form performance introduced during the formulation or
              manufacturing process.  Many companies do not have the resources to
              sufficiently research or develop, independently, new formulation and
              manufacturing strategies to overcome these barriers.    The Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center for Pharmaceutical Processing was established at
              Purdue University to partner with pharmaceutical companies to gain
              understanding, at the molecular level, of the effects of processing on critical
              qualities of pharmaceutical products and to improve process monitoring with the
              goal of minimizing validation requirements.  This proposal addresses the
              establishment of a research site at the University of Connecticut to complement
              and extend the technical base of the Pharmaceutical Processing Center. 
              University of Connecticut researchers will bring to the Center expertise in:   
              * stability behavior and characterization of proteins in both solution and
              solid state,  * the science and technology of freeze drying,  * materials
              science of amorphous pharmaceuticals,  * tablet coating science and technology,
               * dissolution behavior, and  * the study of disperse systems with a focus on
              emulsions, interfacial characterization, and micro-encapsulation.
