Abstract    :
              AST-9714246  Jensen    More than half of all stars are not single, isolated
              stars  like our Sun, but rather are members of binary systems.  Therefore, most
              potential sites of extrasolar planet  formation lie in binary star systems. 
              This research project  will use observations at a number of wavelengths and
              with a  number of techniques to investigate the potential for planet  formation
              in binary star systems.  This award is made  through the NSF's special
              competition on Life in Extreme  Environments, with participation by the
              Division of  Astronomical Sciences and the Office of Multidisciplinary 
              Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical  Sciences.
