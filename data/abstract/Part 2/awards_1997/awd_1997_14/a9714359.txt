Abstract    :
              Developments in networking and software technologies are enabling the
              integration of geographically distributed compute, storage, network, and other
              resources into high-performance distributed computing systems or computational
              grids.  These computational grids promise to revolutionize high-performance
              computing by enabling both the construction of tools providing qualitatively
              new capabilities, and wider access to unique resources such as supercomputers,
              scientific databases, and instruments.  However, major technical advances are
              still required if they are to be broadly deployed and used.  This workshop will
              bring together leading researchers and practitioners to survey the state of the
              art in metacomputing, discuss outstanding problems, and identify future
              directions for research and development.  The final product of the workshop
              will be an edited book discussing the state of the art and research challenges
              in building a computational grid.
