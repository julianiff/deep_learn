Abstract    :
              9714759       The Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) Institute at The 
              Pennsylvania State University is a hands-on training program for  women and
              girls to increase their competence in diagnosing,  repairing, upgrading and
              maintaining common PC-based computer  hardware.  Computer science and
              engineering majors continue to be  areas in which women are underrepresented at
              all levels.         To embed this hardware intervention in the sort of social 
              context that researchers say is ideal for women and girls (Rosser,  et al),
              used computers will be from local industry and individuals  for use by our
              participants to test, diagnose and repair.  The  computers will then be
              recycled to rural or inner city schools -  the "benefit to others" that we
              expect will attract women  students.       The proposed training can be adapted
              to other institutions and  population groups as we will demonstrate in the
              course of this  project.  K-12 in-service or pre-service training for teachers
              is  also a target we enclose.  Girl Scout/Boy Scout training, Vo-tech  or high
              school training, and a day-long demonstration model or  summer research camp
              activity for female middle or high school  students will also be included.     
               This is an expansion of an existing program.
