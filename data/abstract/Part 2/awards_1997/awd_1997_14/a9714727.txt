Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9714727  GOODMAN    This two year "TIE" project funds a
              collaborative study with two Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers
              (I/UCRC).  The two I/UCRC's are the Rutgers University Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center for Wireless Information Networks and the
              University of California San Diego Industry/University Cooperative Research
              Center for Ultra-High Speed Integrated Circuits and Systems.  The "TIE" project
              is entitled, "Interference Cancellation Prototyping and ASIC Development for
              Wireless CDMA Communication."    The Rutgers University I/UCRC will investigate
              the critical issues of acquisition and synchronizing essential for multi-user
              direct sequence CDMA communication convolution coding and utilize recent
              results on multi carrier DS/CDMA systems.  In the second year further research
              to study other multi-user detection architecture will be carried out after
              adding radio frequency hardware.    The University of California - San Diego
              Center will work with the Rutgers University Center in designing an
              interference cancellation chip and give it to National Semiconductor Corp. for
              fabrication .  In the second year the chip will be tested and incorporated into
              a CDMA communication system for multi-users.
