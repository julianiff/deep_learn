Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    OPP-9714103       WEBBER, PATRICK  MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY    This
              research project represents one component of a United States research effort
              that contributes to the goals of the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX). 
              ITEX is examining the role of global warming on tundra ecosystems throughout
              the Arctic.  This US project will conduct a manipulative experiment at Barrow
              and Atqasuk, Alaska in which the tundra will be artificially warmed by 3-5o C
              by placing clear plastic cones on isolated portions of the tundra. The species
              composition within the cones will be determined on annual and longer time
              scales.  The short- and long-term response of the vegetation changes that
              result from the artificial temperature increase will be used to project the
              circumarctic response to global climate change that could be caused by a
              doubling of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  This study is a very important
              contribution to the US Global Change Research Program because the Arctic region
              has been predicted to be more sensitive to global climate change than other
              areas of the Earth and, therefore, a knowledge of tundra response to that
              change may provide a means to assess any possible onset of global warming.
