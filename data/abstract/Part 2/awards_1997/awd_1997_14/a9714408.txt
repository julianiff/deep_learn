Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry  
              Program supports research by Dr. Joseph W. Kolis, Chemistry Department,  
              Clemson University, for the study of novel synthetic methods for   transition
              metal-main group solids.  The relatively low reaction   temperature of
              supercritical fluids permits isolation of kinetically   stabilized phases not
              otherwise easily obtainable.  Solids of the general   formula AxMyEz, where
              A=alkali metal, M=Cu, Ag, and E=S, Se, will be   prepared in supercritical
              ammonia or ethylenediamine.  Attempts will also   be made to use bismuth and
              tellurium.  The resulting compounds are   expected to have low dimensional
              structures and potentially interesting   electronic properties.  A dominant
              strategy for the synthesis will be to   replace monovalent alkali metals with
              divalent cations, or replacement of   monovalent coinage metals with open shell
              transition metals such as   manganese (II) or iron (II).   In addition, new
              techniques will be   developed for some unusual aqueous solvents.  Hydrothermal
              brines with   high concentrations of halides, sulfides or carbonates will be
              used to   synthesize new metal chalcogenides under conditions similar to those 
               under which naturally occurring gems and minerals form.  Solid state compounds
              are useful in electronic devices, so development of   new materials and new
              methods to prepare materials are important areas of   research.  The new
              methods to be developed with the support of this award   not only are novel and
              may result in useful new solids, but may have   implications for understanding
              formation of minerals in nature as well
