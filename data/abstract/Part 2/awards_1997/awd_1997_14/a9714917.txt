Abstract    :
                    CHENEY  9714917  The Secretary of the Navy has been designated the
              Executive  Agent of the Department of Defense (DoD) for the logistics  support
              functions of the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP).  The  Executive Agent will
              transfer to the Secretary of the Air  Force (Mar 98) and the Air National Guard
              (ANG) will assume  command and control of Operation Deep Freeze in accordance 
              with the DoD/National Science Foundation Memorandum of  Agreement (MOA) dated
              21 Jan 1997.  During the transition  from the Navy to the Air Force, both the
              Navy and Air  National Guard provide support to the USAP.  This award  provides
              direct funding to the Air National Guard for their  portion of the support.   
              The logistics support provided by the ANG includes, but is  not limited to, the
               air transportation of USAP personnel,  equipment, and materials; the operation
              of support  facilities at the 109th Airlift Wing Schenectady, New York, 
              Christchurch, New Zealand, and McMurdo Station Antarctica;  and the support of
              field science projects in Antarctica.    Normally, in order to exercise proper
              oversight and  accommodate changing requirements, funds under this MOA are 
              awarded incrementally.  This is the first  increment, in the  amount of
              $2,000,000.00 for  Fiscal Year 1997 funding, to be  awarded to the Air National
              Guard Readiness Center, Andrews  AFB MD and will provide operating funds for
              the 109th  Airlift Wing through August 1997.
