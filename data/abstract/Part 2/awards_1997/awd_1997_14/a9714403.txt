Abstract    :
              Prof. Falconer will study the overall reaction, surface processes, and
              deactivation mechanisms of gas-phase photocatalytic oxidation (PCO). The focus
              will be on organic and chlorinated organic environmental contaminants over
              catalysts illuminated with near-UV light, at near room temperature. Probe
              reactants will be ethanol, trichloroethylene, and toluene.  Photocatalysts will
              be based on TiO2, Pt/TiO2, and MnO, and will be deposited as 0.5 micron layers
              on the inside of a Pyrex annular reactor wall illuminated from the outside. The
              concentration of adsorbed and co-adsorbed organic species at steady state, the
              fraction of surface sites active for PCO, and the decay of all of the above
              over time on stream, are to be determined.  The influence of supported Pt on
              the activity, surface chemistry, and deactivation of TiO2, will also be
              studied.  A major goal is to determine the selectivity of the various adsorbed
              species towards partial or total oxidation, and the conditions needed to
              control such selectivity. Techniques to be used include: steady state and
              transient isothermal reaction, steady state and transient 13C isotope tracing,
              temperature-programmed desorption, oxidation and hydrogenation, and FTIR. The
              research outcome is of high significance for the elimination of VOC from waste
              air streams, as well as for the photochemical synthesis of organic
              intermediates.
