Abstract    :
              The Commission on engineering and Technical Systems (CETS), a major unit of the
              National Research Council, created the Board on Infrastructure and the
              Constructed Environmental (BICE) in 1994: The BICE brings together in an
              independent forum expertise from a wide range of scientific, engineering, and
              social science disciplines to address problems and issues in the areas of
              technology, science, and public policy applied to urban systems; public
              facilities; infrastructure systems and services; above ground and  underground
              construction; the relationship between the constructed and natural environments
              and their interaction with human activities; the effects of natural hazards on
              constructed facilities; and related issues of planning, design, construction,
              management surety, and use of built environment.  The BICE provides a unique
              structure to respond to specific requests from government, or to act on its own
              initiative with public or private sector support.  In pursuit of its goals,
              BICE plans to conduct on-going strategic planning and oversee committee
              activities involving studies, workshop, symposia, and a variety of information
              dissemination activities.
