Abstract    :
              The investigator quantifies the variability induced in the high-latitude
              mesospheric airglow and temperature by planetary-scale waves, and determines
              the nature of wave signatures by quantifying their relationship to variations
              of gravity-wave flux and tidal amplitudes.  In conjunction with observations at
              Stockholm University, he is continuing a measurement program of high latitude
              dynamics and chemistry, extending the existing data base of hydroxyl radiance
              and temperature where normal mode periodicities and their transience is
              observed.  In addition, he is analyzing measurements to identify the time
              history of long-period temperature and composition variations in the
              mesosphere.
