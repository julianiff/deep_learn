Abstract    :
              Layered manufacturing refers to the fabrication of a physical part by depositing
               material, layer-by-layer, under computer control.  The fabrication of multi- 
              material structures as well as the embedding of prefabricated components is 
              possible using layered manufacturing.  Mesoscopic devices and functioning 
              assemblies can also be made directly.  The automation of layered manufacturing 
              depends on proper CAD representations of non-homogeneous objects and computer 
              algorithms for extracting process information from the CAD models.  Present CAD
               systems are unable to represent non-homogeneous and multi-material objects. 
              This  project addresses these problems.  Research tasks include the design and 
              implementation of algorithms and the subsequent fabrication of multi-material 
              parts in several media.
