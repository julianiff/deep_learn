Abstract    :
                  9714401  Kunreuther  The project will examine the role of the private and
              public  sectors in managing catastrophe risks from natural hazards.  The  goal
              is to develop a feasible program for minimizing future  losses from natural
              hazards through mitigation while enhancing  the availability and reliability of
              financial protection against  damage from natural hazards.  Alternative
              incentive programs for  encouraging property owners to adopt cost-effective
              mitigation  measures will be designed and evaluated.  Also, new private 
              capital market initiatives, as well as the public sector as  sources of funds
              when large-scale earthquakes or hurricanes  occur, will be examined.  The
              aggregate impact of both loss  reduction initiatives and risk bearing and
              pooling policies will  be evaluated using science-based micro-modeling
              approaches.  This  research will further the understanding of decision making 
              processes and strategies related to risk reduction.  ***
