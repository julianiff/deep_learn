Abstract    :
              This proposal will support a laptop and a projection system for classroom
              instruction using Unidata-provided software and data.  Upgrading two existing
              PCs to new more capable models is also proposed.  This equipment will be used
              to teach new Earth Systems Science courses being developed by the Earth and
              Atmospheric Sciences department of the City College.  The City College, being
              an inter-city school, has a significant minority student population.
