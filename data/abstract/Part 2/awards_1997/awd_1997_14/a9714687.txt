Abstract    :
              This award is for support for a program to make high  resolution studies of
              variations in the concentration of  methane, the oxygenisotope composition of
              paleoatmospheric  oxygen, and the total gas content of deep Antarctic ice 
              cores.  Studies of the concentration and isotopic  composition of air in the
              firn of the Antarctic ice sheet  will also be continued.  One objective of this
              work is to  use the methane concentration and oxygen-isotope composition  of
              oxygen of air in ice as time-stratigraphic markers for  the precise
              intercorrelation of Greenland and Antarctic ice  cores as well as the
              correlation of ice cores to other  climatic records.  A second objective is to
              use variations  in the concentration and interhemispheric gradient of  methane
              measured in Greenland and Antarctic ice cores to  deduce changes in continental
              climates and biogeochemistry  on which the atmospheric methane distribution
              depends.  A  third objective is to use data on the variability of total  gas
              content in the Siple Dome ice core to reconstruct  aspects of the glacial
              history of West Antarctica during the  last glacial maximum.  The fourth
              objective is to  participate in collaborative studies of firn air chemistry  at
              Vostok, Siple Dome, and South Pole which will yield much  new information about
              gas trapping in ice as well as the  concentration history and isotopic
              composition of greenhouse  gases, oxygen, trace biogenic gases and trace
              anthropogenic  gases during the last 100 years.
