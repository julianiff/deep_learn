Abstract    :
              9714914  Agarwal  Description:  This award is for the US-India research
              collaboration   "Evaluation and Characterization of Composite Materials under
              Dynamic  Loading Conditions".  The co-investigators are Professors Shukla of
              the  University of Rhode Island and B.D. Agarwal, Indian Institute of 
              Technology (IIT), Kanpur.  The PIs will carry out research utilizing the 
              experimental facilities established under an earlier Special Foreign  Currency
              grant that supported the development of a dynamic stress and  fracture analysis
              laboratory at IIT, Kanpur.  The facility is now ready and  is being used for
              dynamic photoelastic experiments.  The focus of the  research is to further
              developments in the fabrication of transparent  composites and to conduct new
              investigations on the dynamic fracture and  damage growth in fiber reinforced
              composite materials.  The experimental  technique will utilize the principles
              of dynamic photography and  fractography.             Scope: This award will
              allow the PIs to continue the interesting work  begun on the characterization
              of composite materials under dynamic  loading conditions using the now
              completed experimental facility at  Kanpur.  The PIs have developed a unique
              technique for determining the  internal strain state of composite materials. 
              These materials are finding  increasing application, many of which will involve
              dynamic loading.  The  research will provide new fundamental information about
              composite  materials.  The benefits are mutual and the research results will be
               published.           ***
