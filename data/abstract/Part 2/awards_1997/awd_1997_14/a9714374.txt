Abstract    :
              The National Research Council (NRC) proposes to assess the problems that face
              the Internet over the next decade, identifying factors and issues that must  be
              resolved in order to ensure that the Internet can continue to grow and evolve. 
              The project will address how the Internet relates to other network complexes
              (particularly the telephone and video delivery infrastructures) on which it
              builds and to which it interconnects.  It will use that examination to consider
              broader issues posed by interoperation of networks operated by different
              providers, using similar and different technologies and providing similar and
              different services. This integrated analyis can help to inform technical
              design, development, deployment, operation, and management decisions relevant
              to the evolving networks of networks.  Leveraging expert input, an
              authoritative report and web site will be produced.
