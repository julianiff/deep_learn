Abstract    :
              Turbo coding is the conventional name given to an exciting and relatively new
              digital communication technique capable of approaching the theoretical limits
              imposed by Shannon theory.  The technique has enjoyed enormous recent attention
              from coding theorists, but many practical, engineering-oriented issues remain
              before these coding techniques will see widescale practical implementation.  We
              propose research in the areas of: (1) reduction of decoder latency and
              complexity; (2) developing stream encoder and decoder architectures; (3)
              efficient synchronization at low SNR; (4) improving performance of small-frame
              turbo systems; (5) robustness to channel modeling error, either in estimation
              of SNR or non-Gaussian noise; and (6) use of turbo codes on non-coherent or
              differentially-coherent channels.
