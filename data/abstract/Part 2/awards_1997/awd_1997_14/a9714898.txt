Abstract    :
              More than 40,000 tons of interplanetary dust particles fall  to the Earth's
              surface each year.  Those particles less than  30 micrometers in size retain to
              a large extent their  extraterrestrial isotopic signature.  In the central 
              equatorial Pacific Ocean, a limited geographic region of the  earth's surface,
              the flux of extraterrestrial helium,  determined by normalization to
              thorium-230, has been  relatively constant through the past 200 thousand years.
               In  this research, investigators from the Lamont-Doherty  Geological
              Observatory and Tulane University will carry out  a thorough investigation of
              the apatial and temporal  variability of the He-3 supply to the sediments
              throughout  the world ocean.  Other applications and limitations of 
              extraterrestrial He-3 as a constant-flux proxy will also be  explored.
