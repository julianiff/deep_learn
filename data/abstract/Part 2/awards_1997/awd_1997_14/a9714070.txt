Abstract    :
              A field model of the sun's inner coronal magnetic field , as observed by the
              Ulysses spacecraft at very high latitudes, explained 26-day recurrent energetic
              particle events.  This project explores the consequences of a revised
              heliospheric magnetic field model (Fisk, 1996), including explanation of the
              slow solar wind, elemental abundance's in the solar wind, dynamics of pick-up
              ions, and cosmic ray modulation.  Investigators will research the consequences
              on:  (1) high latitude recurrent energetic particle events, (2) the propagation
              of cosmic rays in the heliosphere, (3) the acceleration of the solar wind, and
              (4) the propagation of pick-up ions in the heliosphere.  Simultaneously, this
              investigation will test the revised model from many vantage points.  The
              investigators hope to increase understanding of heliospheric dynamics through a
              deeper understanding of heliospheric magnetic field.
