Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9714629  J. Schwank    This is a Small Grant for Exploratory
              Research co-funded by the Kinetics and Catalysis and the Process and Reaction
              Engineering programs.  In this research, Professors Schwank and Kravaris will
              explore scientific applications of micromachined hot-plate chemical reactors
              containing catalytically active thin films.  The ability to accurately control
              the film temperature, independently from the gas phase temperature, will allow
              the separate manipulation of heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions.  The
              model reaction to be studied is the selective oxidation of ethylene and
              propylene on silver films.  By maintaining a cold gas phase and a hot surface,
              the selectivity towards partial oxidation products will be optimized.  Arrays
              of microreactors with independent surface composition and temperature control
              will be also explored as a means to achieve spatially nonuniform but well
              controlled temperature distributions.  The control theory of nanoscale
              temperature-controlled flow reactor will be explored, with the objective of
              maximizing conversion and selectivity in a transient operating regime.
