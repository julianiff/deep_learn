Abstract    :
              This project applies recent methods for large-scale nonlinear convex 
              optimization, e.g., semidefinite programming (SDP), to VLSI design problems.
              The  new techniques allow using more accurate models, better but more complex
              cost  functions, new types of constraints, or simply improve the speed and
              capacity of  existing tools. The research focus is on various problems of
              simultaneous delay  optimization, transistor and wire sizing, and placement.
