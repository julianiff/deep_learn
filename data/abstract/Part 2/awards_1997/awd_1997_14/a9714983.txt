                                   OPP97-14983    Antarctic krill represent the largest
              harvestable population  in the ocean, with annual biomass production about
              three  times the global fish catch.  In addition, most organisms in  the
              Southern Ocean are one or two trophic levels from krill.  At the broadest
              level, a fundamental question is:  What  sustains krill and allows it to be
              such a phenomenally  successful organism?  A secondary question is:  What is
              the  effect of krill harvesting by humans on krill-dependent  predators? 
              Although the maximum krill harvest by humans is  small compared to that of
              other predators, the Convention  for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine
              Living Resources  explicitly calls for an ecosystem-based approach in which 
              such indirect effects are considered.  Of particular concern  is the potential
              overlap of the foraging ranges of predators  with the spatial distribution of
              harvesting activity.  The  proposed research has two directions.  The first is
              the  continued development of models for krill predator and krill  fishery
              interactions.  The fishery models will be of clear  significance to the
              Scientific Committee for the Commission  for the Conservation of Antarctic
              Marine Living Resources,  and consequently, to the U.S. Antarctic Program.  The
              model  will also examine indirect food web effects at the level of  the
              individual and the population.  The second direction is  the development of
              life history models for krill, using the  methods of dynamic state variable
              modeling.  These models  will address the highly variable developmental
              patterns of  krill, and therefore have the potential for examining the  nature
              of bimodal size distributions and age-size  relationships, both of which
              influence small scale  population processes and fishery-predator interactions.
