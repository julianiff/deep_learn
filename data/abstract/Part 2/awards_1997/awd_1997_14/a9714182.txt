Abstract    :
              9714182  Liu  It is proposed to develop a finite element model for  computing
              harbor oscillations induced by nonlinear transient  waves.  Vertically
              integrated two-dimensional continuity and  momentum equations, describing fully
              nonlinear and weakly  dispersive waves, are the basis of the numerical model. 
              Since the incident waves are allowed to be irregular waves  with a wide range
              of frequency components, the model has the  capability of examining the
              excitation and resonance of the  long wave components of the incident waves as
              well as the  free and bound infragravity waves generated inside the  harbor
              through nonlinearity.  During the development of the  numerical model both the
              frequency domain and the time  domain approaches will be investigated.  The
              final numerical  model will also include the following practical components: 
              bottom friction, dissipative (absorbing) boundaries, and  harbor entrance loss.
               Special attention will be paid to the  treatment of the open boundary
              condition in the offshore  region.  Pre- and post-processors will be developed
              so that  users can easily modify the input data including the  bathymetry data,
              harbor geometry and the incident wave  conditions.  Graphic displays of input
              information and  numerical solutions will also be included in the post- 
              processors.  The entire software package is aimed to be a  useful and practical
              design tool for harbor engineers and  planners.  ***
