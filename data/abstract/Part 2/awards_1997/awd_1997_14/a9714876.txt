              Abstract:     The Sixth International Valencia Meeting on Bayesian Statistics
              will be   held from May 30 - June 4, 1998, in Las Fuentes, Spain. This series
              of   international Valencia meetings has long been the major venue for  
              presentation and dissemination of research on Bayesian statistical  
              methodology and its applications. The Bayesian approach to statistics   has
              experienced astonishing growth in recent years, driven in large   part by its
              ability to solve difficult applied statistical problems in   science,
              engineering, and society in general.     This group travel award is in support
              of expenses of participants from  the United States. Participation in this
              meeting is crucial   for researchers, especially new researchers, as the pace
              and breadth of   developments in the area is making it increasingly difficult
              to monitor  the field. By attending the meeting, researchers will be able to
              acquire   the latest Bayesian techniques, and will have ample opportunity to  
              obtain feedback on their own work. A large portion of the grant will go  
              towards expenses of graduate students, new researchers, and members of  
              underrepresented groups. In addition, special activities for students   and new
              researchers will be instituted, in part to initiate   international
              interactions and collaborations.
