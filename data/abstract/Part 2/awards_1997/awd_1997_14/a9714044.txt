Abstract    :
                  9714044  Silander    This dissertation enhancement grant supports a US
              graduate  student, Mr. Steven Pousty, working under the guidance of  Dr. John
              Silander, Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary  Biology at the University of
              Connecticut, to conduct a study  on a terrestrial isopod in the Negev Desert in
              Israel.  Data  will be collected on Hemilepistus reaumuri to determine the 
              effect of spatial heterogeneity on dispersal and population  dynamics.  The
              individual and population data will be  integrated into a simulation model
              which will allow Mr.  Pousty to examine the feasibility of scaling from
              individual  movement to larger spatial scales in heterogeneous  environments. 
              Dr. Moshe Shachak, of the Department of  Biology at the Ben Gurion University
              of the Negev, will  collaborate with Mr. Pousty on this project.    This study
              will make an important contribution to the  existing knowledge on the role that
              dispersal has in scaling  organisms to their landscapes, and to our
              understanding of  larger-scale patterns in landscape ecology.  The grant will 
              also provide support to enable a promising student to  establish a strong,
              independent research career.    ***
