Abstract    :
              9714168  Putatunda    The focus of this SGER project is research on a new series
               of high carbon, austempered steels. The steel is synthesized  using concepts
              from austempered ductile cast iron (ADI)  technology.  The steel composition is
              controlled to achieve  a high carbon austenite and lower bainite structure
              after  heat treatment.  Silicon or aluminum additions act to  suppress the
              formation of carbides, thereby increasing the  toughness in these steels.  The
              experimental plan includes  melting and casting the steels, hot rolling,
              austenitizing,  and austempering between 260 and 400 C.  Microstructure in  the
              steels is characterized by microscopy, and the carbon  content and volume
              fractions of austenite and ferrite  determined by x-ray diffraction. 
              Mechanical properties are  measured with emphasis on strength and toughness. 
              The  research should show the feasibility of processing these  steels to the
              properties of interest.  Ford Motor Company  and Wagner Casting Company are
              contributing support to the  effort.  %%%  The austempering process offers a
              low cost, high toughness  steel with a good combination of strength and
              ductility  applicable to the automotive and energy fields.  ***
