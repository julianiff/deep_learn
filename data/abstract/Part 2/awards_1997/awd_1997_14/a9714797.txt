Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9714797  MATHUR    This two year project is a collaborative"TIE"
              study involving two multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research
              Centers (I/UCRC).  The Purdue University research site of the I/UCRC for
              Software Engineering and the Duke University research site of the I/UCRC for
              Advanced Computing and Communication will collaborate on the project
              "Architecture-Based Estimation of Software Reliability."    The Purdue research
              site will:  1.) assess the value of both simulation and execution based
              approaches to software reliability, 2.) investigate the accuracy of reliability
              estimates and   3.) investigate the use of interface mutation for the
              estimation of interface reliability.  The Duke University research site will: 
              1.) investigate the combined coverage and time-based approach for the
              estimation of component and application reliability and also 2.) investigate
              dependency modeling for inter- and intra- component dependencies.  Both
              research sites will work together with the same large commercial system in the
              second year of the project.
