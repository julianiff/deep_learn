Abstract    :
              Investigators observe effects wave-driven fluctuations on composition and
              thermodynamics of the polar middle atmosphere and the lower thermosphere, which
              may reflect effects of tidal, planetary or gravity waves.  They differentiate
              gravity-wave driven disturbances from those due to tides and planetary waves by
              periodicity and persistence of observed wave-like modulations of upper
              atmospheric quantities.  However, they are conducting coordinated measurements
              from four polar stations located at different longitudes, since they cannot
              differentiate migrating tides from non-migrating tides at a single polar
              station.  In investigating MLT disturbances, they are coordinating these polar
              sites airglow observations and detailed model calculations of tidal and
              planetary wave effects on airglow brightness and temperature.  Supplementary
              data is collected from radars and lidars, integrated with airglow measurements
              whenever the former two are available, providing the vertical structure of
              different wave modes.  This research lays groundwork for future support of
              TIMED missions.
