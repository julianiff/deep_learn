Abstract    :
              9714189  Lawrenz    This project proposes to fill the gap in long-term
              enhancement evaluation by conducting a multiple method, longitudinal study of a
              science teacher enhancement project.  This evaluation will examine both the
              long term effects of teacher enhancement on an existing cohort of students, and
              the subsequent effects of teacher enhancement on new cohorts of students. 
              Specifically, the project will examine the persistence of a teacher enhancement
              project by comparing groups of students whose teachers did and did not
              participate in the enhancement project.  Two investigations are proposed: 1)
              follow cohorts of 9th grade students into 12th grade to compare science
              achievement; 2) compare the learning environment and science achievement of
              subsequent cohorts of 9th grade students.  These two investigations will allow
              us to determine the extent to which the teacher enhancement project persisted
              into the future.  The proposed evaluation will be conducted at five high
              schools that participated in the teacher enhancement project.  We will collect
              a comprehensive variety of data including classroom observations of teachers
              twice a year, interviews with teachers and students, interviews with
              principals, student written questionnaires, and both hands-on and written
              assessments of students' achievement of the NRC science standards.  The results
              of this evaluation will be used to examine the extent to which NSF funded
              teacher enhancement can affect teacher performance and subsequently affect
              outcomes in science.
