Abstract    :
              The Department of Meteorology at Penn State University requests partial support
              for an upgrade of present computer capacity in the department.  This upgrade is
              part of a complete overhaul of Penn State's present computing facilities and is
              part of a transition from Penn State-developed weather analysis and display
              system to use of Unidata provided software.  In addition, the transition will
              include archiving data in community-standard formats, such as those developed
              by Unidata.  Penn State is planning to spend approximately $100,000 upgrading
              various parts of their current computing and classroom display systems. 
              Support to acquire two servers, two workstations, disk storage and networking
              component is requested.  This hardware will provide an important component of
              the overall department upgrade.
