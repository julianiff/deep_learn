Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT        The principal investigator proposes to study the use of
              porous silicon layers for improving the performance of vapor sensors.  Silicon
              layers have demonstrated capacitance sensitivity to the amount of vapor
              absorbed and their use will permit the development of miniaturized sensors
              which can operate at high temperatures.  By optimizing the pore structure,
              these sensors will have improved sensitivity and with the inclusion of
              thermoelectric cooling/heating can sense a large range of vapors. 
              Miniaturization will allow for local control of processes and temperatures.
