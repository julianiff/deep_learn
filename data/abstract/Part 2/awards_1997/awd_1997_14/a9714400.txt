Abstract    :
              9714400  Brinson  The objective of this research is to attempt to quantify the 
              mechanical properties within the interphase interface bonded  media.  To
              accomplish this task will require the measurement  of strains within regions
              smaller than one micron.  As most,  if not all, engineering methods to measure
              strains are for  regions larger than a millimeter, it is clear new approaches 
              must be taken.  It is felt that a new exploratory program  based on newly
              acquired equipment at UH and a new approach  may yield significant results. 
              The award of an SGER is made  to ascertain if proposed new procedures will
              allow  measurement of strains in submicron regions and, if so, to  serve as a
              beginning for a longer range program.  The effort  has a short term and long
              term goal.  The short term goal is  to use high resolution digital imaging
              together with optical  and scanning electron microscopy to measure deformations
              and  strains in sub-micron size regions.  The long term goal is  to develop a
              method based on a near field scanning optical  microscope (NSOM) to measure
              deformations in even smaller  regions.  A substantial portion of the effort
              will be to  begin the development of a new analytical approach which  will
              correctly represent material behavior within such small  regions.  The approach
              of necessity will include  heterogeneous and anisoptropic behavior.  Indeed, it
              should  be recognized that observation of materials at such a small  scale may
              not be compatible with current continuum theories  of materials.  ***
