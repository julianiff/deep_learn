Abstract    :
              9714939  Winter     Funding provided by this grant will provide a workstation
              which is needed to support the educational and research goals of the University
              of Puerto Rico which includes a Department of Atmospheric Sciences.  The McIDAS
              program has initiated much interest in weather phenomena, especially of the
              Caribbean region, amongst the students and faculty.  In the fall of 1997 the
              present UNIDATA facilities will be moved to a new larger location.  While
              UNIDATA software currently runs on a loaned computer, students and facilty need
              their own UNIX workstations.  The University of Puerto Rico has committed
              matching funds to supply the necessary number of PCs which will be networked to
              the workstation and provide students with a unique experience to study
              meteorological phenomena.  A large number of students are expected to take this
              landmark course in meteorology which should build the necessary human resources
              to lead Puerto Rico in atmospheric research and teaching.
