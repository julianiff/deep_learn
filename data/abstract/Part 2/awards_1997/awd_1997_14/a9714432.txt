Abstract    :
               The Middle Awash area of Ethiopia has been a remarkably important and
              productive paleontological region, yielding fossil remains of numerous
              vertebrate taxa, including early hominids.  Abundant vertebrate fossils
              collected from Middle Awash deposits represent significant data relevant to
              studying the later Neogene vertebrate evolution in Africa.  This project
              represents a detailed study of vertebrate fauna from the terminal Miocene of
              the Middle Awash Valley.  Results from such comparative analyses are essential
              to our understanding of the Late Miocene vertebrate history of Africa. 
              Argon/argon and paleomagnetic data currently being generated from these
              deposits are establishing a reliable chronostratigraphy for the Middle Awash,
              thereby refining biochronology of other contemporaneous African Late Miocene
              localities for which radiometric dates do not exist.  The results of the
              proposed study will elucidate the paleobiogeography, paleoenvironment, and
              faunal diversity during the time at which hominids are believed to have
              differentiated
