Abstract    :
              Deicing  is  an  important problem  for  operating  aircraft  fleets  and space
              shuttle under cold environments.   Deicing  from  power lines, flood gates in
              dams and bridge piers  are  important  for  avoiding power outrages and floods;
               deicing  from  airfields,  roads, and vehicles is important  in  both 
              civilian and defense sectors.       The  aim of this proposal is to understand
              the physical  mechanisms  that  govern the adhesion of ice  to  structural 
              surfaces, and subsequently, to tailor the microstructure  of  the  interfacial 
              region which will  result  in  the  lowest  possible  interface  strength.  The
              microstructure  will  be  modified  by  using  new  type of  hydrophobic 
              coatings  of  varying  internal structures and thickness, by using surface 
              contaminants,  by  changing the roughness of  the  substrate  surface  which 
              besides  affecting  the  interface  strength  through  modification of the ice
              layer grain-size, can  also  lead  to entrapment of flaws at the ice/structure
              interface.  The  effect  of  time and temperature on the above  strength  will 
              also be studied.  The ice/structure interface strength  will  be  measured  by
              adapting a recently  developed  laser  spallation    experiment.    The  
              proposed   research    is  multidisciplinary  in  nature as it involves  use 
              of  novel  experimentation  (laser,  optics,  materials  science,  wave 
              mechanics), surface science concepts and development of  new  type  of 
              hydrophobic coatings based on SAMS (Self Assembled  Monolayer  System)
              technology developed  in  the  fields  of  chemistry and polymeric sciences.
