Abstract    :
                 9714966 Gibson   This SGER project will explore a unique approach to forming
              large ordered arrays of nanometer-scale metal particles separated by dielectric
              barriers. The idea is to combine a gold-particle supermolecule with
              Langmuir-Blodgett film deposition methods; the approach involves a variety of
              experimentation in dealing with the ability of the hydrophobic tails to be able
              to float large gold-containing head groups. The impact of the project could be
              significant because the presence of a metal particle with an organic shell
              would allow extension of research on colloidal dielectric sphere arrays to
              studies of x-ray photonic bandgaps; analogous supermolecules could be made with
              a variety of metal and semiconductor cores.  If successful the technique would
              impact research in several areas including x-ray optics, mesoscale physics, and
              advanced electronic devices. The ordered arrays will be characterized by TEM,
              x-ray reflectance, and transport measurements. %%%  This project will explore a
              new and innovative approach to the synthesis of photonic nanometer structures
              from the broad perspectives of chemistry, physics, and materials science.  The
              idea being explored is the potential use of surface chemistry techniques for
              the formation of ordered arrays of ultra-small scale metal particles which have
              significant potential applications in several areas of science and technology.
              This project sets specific goals and methods for an initial study to test these
              ideas, and several key issues can be appropriately addressed and resolved by
              the project. ***
