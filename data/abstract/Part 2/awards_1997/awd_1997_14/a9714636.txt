Abstract    :
              Investigators conduct further terrestrial nightglow observations to characterize
              the 500-1000 nm region, initially using long integration times and nightly
              co-adding spectra to maximize signal-to-noise ratio.  The initial goal,
              obtaining a high-quality survey spectrum, is expanded with higher resolution
              measurements of isotopic bands in the b-X O-O band region.  Accurately
              determined intensities of these bands (and other transitions), and their
              variability with vibrational level, provide important information on the energy
              flow among the oxygen electronic states, the ultimate source being the
              recombination of oxygen atoms.  Simultaneous SRI experimental programs also
              stand to benefit some of these observational questions.
