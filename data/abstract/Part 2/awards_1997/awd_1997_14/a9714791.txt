Abstract    :
              The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) will develop an  exciting model program
              designed to interest girls and young  women in science.  Operated in
              partnership with the Girl  Scout Council of Greater New York, the program will
              build on  a highly successful pilot project to reach over 6,000 girls 
              throughout New York City over the grant period and thousands  more thereafter. 
                The Wildlife Science Careers Program will enjoy the full  support of the
              WCS's professional staff, which includes  environmental educators, animal
              curators, animal keepers,  veterinarians, conservation biologists, field
              scientists,  wildlife nutritionists, exhibit designers, and others, many  of
              whom are women.  Participating Girl Scouts will meet  these professionals,
              observe them at work, engage them in  dialogue, take part in hands-on projects,
              and experience  first-hand the excitement and dedication involved in working 
              for the survival of endangered species and natural habitats.    The three-year
              program will consist of five main components:  (1) Five-day Wildlife Science
              Career Workshops at the Bronx  Zoo for 315 Cadette Girl Scouts (ages 12 5o 14)
              that will  introduce them to careers in the wildlife sciences and  conservation
              biology; (2) Field experience for the  participating Cadettes at the WCS's four
              other facilities  (The Aquarium for Wildlife Conservation and the Wildlife 
              Centers of Central Park, Prospect Park and Queens), through  which the girls
              will engage in science exploration  activities and meet additional role models
              in science; (3)  Two-day training seminars for the Cadettes that will provide 
              them with the skills and materials to conduct career and  science awareness
              workshops for troops of younger Girl  Scouts, enabling the Cadettes to meet the
              requirements  necessary to become Girl Scout Program Aides; (4) Two-day 
              leadership training courses for 36 Girl Scout Leaders that  will enable them to
              oversee the progress of the  participating Cadettes and to continue key program
               components after the co nclusion of the grant period; and (5)  An internship
              program for fifty Senior Girl Scouts (ages 14  to 17), who successfully
              complete the training workshops as  Cadettes to become Program Aides, that will
              give them the  opportunity to work side-by-side with scientists and other 
              professional staff in the WCS's five facilities.    The proposed Wildlife
              Science Careers Program represents a  unique means of increasing the
              participation level of girls  and young women in science.  Utilizing a
              non-competitive,  single-sex approach, the program will capitalize on the 
              enthusiasm children and young adults have for visiting  informal science
              centers, such as zoos, to engage the  interest of girls and young women in
              science learning and  careers.  Informal science institutions and Girl Scout 
              Councils have an important role to play in advancing the  interest,
              understanding and skills of women in science, and  in the proposed project, the
              WCS has developed an exciting  model that has the potential to be replicated
              nationwide.
