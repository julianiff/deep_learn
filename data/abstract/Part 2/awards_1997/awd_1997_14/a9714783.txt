Abstract    :
              9714783  Nielsen  Volcanoes in Hawaii are among the most active on Earth.
              However, due to their high rates of eruption and subsidence, direct
              documentation of their temporal evolution is lacking. This project will use
              samples from three deep (~2 km) drill cores in Kilauea Volcano's Lower East
              Rift Zone to study magmatic processes and plume evolution in the type oceanic
              hotspot. The goals of this project are: (1) to document the diversity of
              primitive magmas, preserved as melt inclusions, in the Kilauea plumbing system
              over more than 100 Ka of Kilauea's history, (2) to record the change in source
              compositions over time, (3) to determine volumetric proportions of magmatic
              components contributing to Kilauea lavas through time, and (4) to evaluate
              connectivity of the plumbing systems of Kilauea and Mauna Loa. This study,
              together with an ongoing deep drilling study at Mauna Kea, an older volcano on
              Hawaii, can provide a much longer time-series of Hawaiian plume evolution than
              would be possible by conventional field sampling. This will not only enhance
              our understanding of the evolution of the Hawaiian plume, but will provide a
              benchmark for studying other hotspot volcanoes.
