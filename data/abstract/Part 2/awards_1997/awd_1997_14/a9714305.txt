                                   This grant is awarded through the Separations and
              Purification Program sub-element of the Interfacial, Transport and Separations
              Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division.  The principal
              investigator is Dr. Donald Paul at the University of Texas at Austin.  The
              research is directed at the development of membrane materials that have
              temperature induced changes in permeability.  This is a novel approach where
              the permeability is not a smoothly increasing function of temperature but a
              rather a situation where a small temperature change can serve as a switch for
              substantial permeability changes.  These temperature induced switches in
              permeability are brought about by the use of polymers containing alkyl side
              chain that crystallize relatively independent of the polymer backbone.  When
              the material is heated up beyond the glass transition temperature of the side
              chains, the loss of crystallinity opens up transport pathways and increases the
              permeability.  The switch from a permeable to a relatively nonpermeable
              membrane occurs across the glass transition temperature of the side chains.    
              There are several significant applications of such temperature induced
              permeability switches.  Amongst the most interesting is the potential to use
              seasonal changes in temperature to release agricultural agents such as
              pesticides of fertilizers.  The temperature switches can also be used to
              deliver drugs when these drugs are placed in capsules make from these polymeric
              materials.  The concepts presented here represent frontier areas of polymer
              membrane research.
