Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9714964  GRANT    Wireless communication has raised many questions
              concerning electrical and human capability with wireless electronic devices.
              The public and industry need these questions addressed as wireless technology
              and use literally explode.  A planning grant (EEC-9526073) was awarded in FY95
              to study the feasibility and inability of establishing an Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Wireless Electromagnetic Compatibility
              at the University of Oklahoma.  As a result of this planning meeting, a Center
              meeting the I/UCRC Program requirements has been established with 14 company
              members.    The Center's research agenda encompasses the following projects:
              1.) Mobile Phone RF Enveloped and Power Measurement, 2.) Study of Pacemaker -
              Wireless Phone Planar Separation (Height of Interaction) Study, 3.) Pacemaker
              Evaluation using Modified FDA Protocol, 4.) Hearing Aid Phase II-A: Acoustic
              Measurement with Phones.    The Center has been coordinated with Dr.  Deborah
              Crawford, Program Director,  Physical Foundations of Enabling Technologies
              Program, Electrical and Communications Systems Division.
