Abstract    :
               This university-industry collaborative research award is aimed to develop new
              controllers for the monitoring and control of physical properties including
              viscosity, color, additive concentration, etc., in polymer extrusion and
              injection molding processes.  The practical objectives are to reduce product
              variation and to enhance process efficiency.  The research tasks include:
              development of improved process models based on the mixer geometry, product
              rheology, and operation conditions; adaptation of on-line sensors to measure
              the flow in the extruder; and creation of control algorithms for on-line
              regulation of product quality to meet product specification requirements.   
              The research is central to the future improvement of plastics extrusion and
              injection molding processes.  The inclusion of process dynamics into the
              controller design for these processes may prove to be superior to the present
              process control approach prevalent in the industry.  Successful completion of
              the project could give the United States a competitive edge over its Pacific
              Rim and European competitors in the $300 billion annual global plastics market.
               The industrial collaborators include a resin producer, DuPont, and an
              injection molding machine manufacturer, LDM Technologies.  This provides an
              excellent synergy for project partnership.
