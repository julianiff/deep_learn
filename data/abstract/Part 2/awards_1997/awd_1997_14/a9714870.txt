Abstract    :
               The slender loris is a nocturnal primate of India and Sri Lanka.  Diurnal
              primates, such as monkeys, apes and lemurs, have served as the primary subjects
              for testing hypotheses about the origin and adaptiveness of gregarious living
              in primates.  Anthropologists have hypothesized that social groups are favored
              when primates utilize clumped food resources, such as fruit in a large canopy
              tree, or that social grouping is a correlate of primates' delayed life
              histories (i.e., slow growth and dependent childhood).  Any robust hypotheses
              intended to explain primate sociality must be able to account for the specific
              cases of the less gregarious nocturnal primates.  This study addresses the
              following general questions about lorises:  1) What are the social correlates
              of foraging for dispersed fruit or insect resources?  2) What are the social
              correlates of feeding upon spatially clumped food items?  3) What are the
              social correlates of delayed life history?  Study methods are designed to
              statistically isolate and characterize the contexts in which lorises express
              social interactions, which in turn will test social theory developed from the
              diurnal primates.  An additional significance of this study is that
              supplemental information obtained about habitat preferences and behavior will
              contribute to conservation of the threatened loris.
