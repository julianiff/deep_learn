Abstract    :
              Through climatological studies of the mesospheric wind latitudinal variation,
              the investigator clarifies wave activity coupling from the tropopause to the
              mesosphere, and differential forcing of the mesosphere by gravity waves.  She
              uses one year worth of data, collected from a chain of medium frequency radars
              spanning sub-tropical and mid-latitude regions.  Her comprehensive study
              compares the climatological variability of mesospheric wave activity at each
              station in the latitude chain.  These compares provide quantitative measures of
              the latitudinal variation of wave activity.  Simple models, assessed for their
              accurate reproduction of the mesospheric wave activity's characteristics,
              incorporate wave propagation, saturation and critical layer filtering.  Thorsen
              is aiding future modeling efforts, by clarifying the dominant mechanisms
              controlling wind variance (when observed by radar).
