Abstract    :
              ECS-9714925  Antsaklis    The proposal is for travel funds for the Hybrid
              Systems conference to be held at the University of Notre Dame September 11-13,
              l997.  The funds will be instrumental in enabling participation in the
              conference of  young  researchers, interested in the increasingly important
              area of hybrid systems.    Hybrid systems are interacting networks of digital
              and continuous systems.  Hybrid systems arise throughout business an industry
              in such areas as interactive distributed simulation, traffic control, plant
              process control, military command and control, aircraft and robot design, and
              path planning.  This rapidly developing area is at the interface of control,
              engineering and computer science.    The previous workshops have resulted
              significant advancements in both actual research and interest in additional
              research.
