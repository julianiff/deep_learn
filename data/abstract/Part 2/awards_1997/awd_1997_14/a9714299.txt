Abstract    :
              ***  Caron 9714299    The analysis of microbial biodiversity of extreme
              environments is difficult because traditional methods for examining diversity
              are often ineffective for assessing species richness within these communities.
              Additional difficulties arise due to the difficulties of recreating and
              maintaining pertinent environmental features during sample collection and
              procession. This study focuses on the protistan assemblages (algae and
              protozoa) in the sea ice, sediment and ocean environments of the Ross Sea,
              Antarctica.  The identification of protistan species in natural assemblages
              traditionally has entailed direct microscopical analyses as well as enrichment
              and culture techniques for assessing biodiversity. Determination of diversity
              for these assemblages in therefore susceptible to biases as a consequence of
              sampling, enrichment and culture, as well as selective losses due to sample
              preservation and concentration for microscopy. The goals of this project are:
              (1)  to develop and apply molecular biological approaches to assess species
              diversity of small protists (algae and protozoa smaller than 100 micrometers)
              in ocean water, sea ice and sediment environments and (2)  to obtain baseline
              physiological information on the growth rates, feeding rates and growth
              efficiencies of cultured protozoa under pertinent temperature regimes.
              Molecular biological studies will involve the use of PCR-based protocols to
              examine small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (srDNA) diversity. Approaches and
              techniques developed will be applicable to any other water body or sediment and
              would provide a means to examine the representativeness of protistan cultures
              in extant culture collections.   ***
