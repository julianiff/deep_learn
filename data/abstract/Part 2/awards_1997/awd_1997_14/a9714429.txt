Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  SEYBERT  9714429    This Research Opportunity Award (ROA) funds
              research at an Undergraduate Institution/Research at a Primarily Undergraduate
              Institution (RUI/PUI) project entitled " Acoustic Emission in Air Conditioning
              and Refrigeration Systems.    The research is to be performed collaboratively
              at the University of Kentucky and the Industry/University Cooperative Research
              Center (I/UCRC) for Air Conditioning and Refrigeration at the University of
              Illinois Urbana-Champaign.    The project will study the 1.) the major sources
              and characteristics of acoustic emissions in cooling systems, 2.) modeling and
              analysis techniques for these emissions and 3.) control strategies and
              sensor/actuator configurations for active noise control.    The project is
              being cost shared by Dr. R. Anderson, EpSCOR Program.
