Abstract    :
              This project acquires measurements of the topside ionosphere using an incoherent
              scatter radar at Kharkov, Ukraine.  This data, with simultaneous measurements
              from the Millstone Hill and Arecibo Observatories, contributes to the
              CEDAR/POLITE research program, which studies concentrations of atomic oxygen
              and hydrogen ions at altitudes above 400 km.  Previous collaborative efforts
              between scientists at MIT and the Institute of the Ionosphere in Kharkov have
              incorporated the capabilities of the Ukrainian research facility into US
              research programs to study coupling between atmospheric layers.  The Ukrainian
              facility provides high-quality data that suggests a significant longitude
              effect in the topside ion distribution.  The POLITE campaigns aim to study the
              altitude at which hydrogen ions become more abundant than oxygen ions.  Kharkov
              data from a POLITE campaign in February, 1996 shows this transition height to
              be less than 450 km altitude.  In this project, MIT scientists work with the
              Kharkov staff to interpret these measurements and participate in future POLITE
              campaigns.
