Abstract    :
              9714045  Yalcintas  This Research Planning Grant (RPG) facilitates preliminary 
              studies related to the development of a research proposal on  fatigue damage
              detection of composite materials. The  technique is based on the change of
              vibration  characteristics of composites as they experience fatigue  damage.
              Fiber optic sensors are used to measure the  vibration response of the
              composite structures. Neural  network prediction techniques are then employed
              to evaluate  the measured vibration information, and predict the health 
              conditions and damage state of the composite materials. The  project addresses
              the limitations of composites for defense,  space, automotive, and aerospace
              industries on account of  their brittle nature and low fracture toughness. A 
              continuous fatigue damage detection method is developed that  can inform the
              user of the fatigue stage and remaining life  of composite materials.  ***
