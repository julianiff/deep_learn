Abstract    :
              The Department of Earth Sciences at Millersville University requests matching
              funds to enhance the existing configuration of Unix workstations, expand the
              memory capacity on the primary meteorology server, and replace existing
              X-terminals with Unix workstations.  This request is driven by increased
              demands on current system because of upgrades in Unidata software and
              "intensive and escalating student and faculty use" of Unidata provided
              software.
