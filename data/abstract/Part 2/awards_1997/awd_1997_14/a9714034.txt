Abstract    :
              This research is on developing algorithms and tools to synthesize testable 
              digital sequential circuits. The testable synthesis problem has in the past
              been  dealt with as two independent problems namely, the state assignment
              problem and  the testing problem. Algorithms and tools that can synthesize
              area-efficient and  testable designs of sequential circuits represented as
              finite state machines are  being developed. Methods of partitioning and
              re-synthesizing large sequential  circuits using the CAD tools and/or the test
              architectures developed in this  project and generation of test vectors for the
              resulting circuits are being  explored.
