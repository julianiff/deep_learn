Abstract    :
              Abstract - Gertler 9714891      Implicit modeling approaches to fault detection
              are data driven and are based on multivariate statistical methods.  Principal
              component analysis (PCA) has been applied to model normal chemical process
              behavior, unusual events are then detected by referencing the observed process
              variable against this model.  While these approaches are effective at detecting
              process faults, they do not specifically address the issue of fault isolation. 
                Analytical redundancy methods have been created by the electrical engineering
              control community, which rely on explicit models of the monitored plant.  Based
              on the model, consistency (parity) relations are derived which return residuals
              indicative of faults.  These equations may be viewed as generalizations of
              material and energy balance calculations.  The parity relations may be so
              designed ("structured") that their residuals follow clear patterns in response
              to various faults, thus providing a convenient means of fault isolation.  The
              fundamental results of parity relations have been developed for linear systems,
              they may be applicable to nonlinear systems (the category for most chemical
              manufacturing facilities).    The PI's are planning a combination of the above
              two methods, multivariate statistical techniques and model-based monitoring
              methods, to isolate faults.  They plan to build a structured set of partial PCA
              models using the following steps:  1. A full PCA will be performed to determine
              the number of relations among the variables;  2. A structure matrix will be
              designed utilizing results from the theory of parity relations; and  3. A
              number of partial PCA models will be created, according to the selected
              structure, by simply omitting variables from the full PCA model.
