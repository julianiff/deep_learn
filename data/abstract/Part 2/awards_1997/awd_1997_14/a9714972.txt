Abstract    :
              9714972  Spruck    This award supports the participation of American scientists 
              in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Minimal Surfaces, Geometric  Analysis, and
              Symplectic Geometry, to be held in Baltimore,  Maryland for one week in March
              l999.  The co-organizers are  Professors Joel Spruck of Johns Hopkins
              University and Kenji  Fukaya of Kyoto University in Japan.  The seminar will
              focus  on a study of significant recent developments in these areas  of
              mathematics which are of much current interest.  Because  these areas are
              closely related and share common themes and  techniques the topic is very
              timely.    Additionally, the U.S. researchers will hold a series of  meetings,
              around the country, prior to the seminar.  They  will consist of both
              introductory lectures for students and  research talks by short-term visitors
              and resident experts.  Results of these meetings will be discussed during the 
              seminar.  The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese  experts in this field
              will enable U.S. participants to  advance their own work, and will set the
              stage for future  collaborative projects.  Seminar organizers have made a 
              special effort to involve many younger scientists.  The  proceedings of the
              meeting will be published and made  available upon request.  ***
