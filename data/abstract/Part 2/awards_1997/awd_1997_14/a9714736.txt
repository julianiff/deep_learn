Abstract    :
              Investigators are observing a remarkable physical phenomenon:  long-lived
              luminous trails left behind by some meteors.  Using the Arecibo Observatory and
              the Starfire Optical Range, researchers are observing during the Leonids meteor
              showers in November of 1997, 1998, and 1999.  Primarily, they hope to
              definitively observe meteoric smoke and dust formation, predicted (but not yet
              verified) forty years ago.  Next, they investigate the sodium nightglow band as
              a potential source for long-lived visual trails, dusty plasma physics as a
              contributor to radar scatter, and incoherent scatter reports of meteor trails
              and the ablation and subsequent dynamics of sodium atoms behind a meteor. 
              Finally, they are determining these trails' feasibility for gravity wave
              studies.
