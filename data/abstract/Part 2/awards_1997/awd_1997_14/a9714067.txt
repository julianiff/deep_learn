Abstract    :
                       To stimulate interest and activity in mathematical research,  the
              National Science Foundation each year supports a number of  NSF-CBMS Regional
              Research Conferences in the Mathematical  Sciences. Each five-day conference
              features a distinguished  lecturer who delivers ten lectures on a topic of
              important current  research in one sharply focused area of the mathematical
              sciences.  The lecturer subsequently prepares an expository monograph based 
              upon these lectures, which is normally published by the American  Mathematical
              Society or the Society for Industrial and Applied  Mathematics, or jointly by
              the American Statistical Association and  the Institute of Mathematical
              Statistics. Certain features  differentiate these conferences from typical
              research conferences.  These are: (1) Focus on a single important and timely
              area of  research by a leading practitioner, (2) Continued effect and local 
              stimulation through regional emphasis, (3) Panel review for  quality, breadth,
              and timeliness, and (4) Published monographs for  a wider audience.        
              This project will support such a conference, which will be  held June 22-26,
              1998 at the University of Minnesota, with Robert  J. Zimmer as the principal
              lecturer, on the topic "Ergodic Theory,  groups, and geometry." The emphasis of
              the lectures will be on how  to obtain interesting geometric or topological
              information by  applying measure theoretic methods to the study of group
              actions on  manifolds. Professor Zimmer has played a leading role in the 
              development of this subject, and in many of the significant recent  results.
              The lectures will provide an introduction to the main  techniques of the field,
              and survey the major recent developments  and open problems.
