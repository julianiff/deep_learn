Abstract    :
                  9714982  Dibb     Cosmogenic isotopes represent a largely untapped source of
              information on transport within the stratosphere and exchange between the
              stratosphere and troposphere.  The Be-10 and Be-7 (beryllium) pair of isotopes
              is particularly useful as tracers because their sources are known, they are
              basically non-reactive, and their greatly different half-lives makes their
              ratio a useful clock over time scales of months to several years.     The
              principal investigator and researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National
              Laboratory (LLNL) have compiled the small set of data that exist on these
              isotopes and their ratio.  They will increase the data base by nearly an order
              of magnitude by measuring and analyzing samples taken during several recent
              airborne sampling campaigns.  Latitudinally, the samples range from more than
              70(N to 70(S, from both the lower stratosphere and the upper troposphere.  In
              addition, during the campaigns measurements were obtained of a variety of other
              tracers such as ozone, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane and water
              vapor.  These data will be compared with the beryllium isotopes results data. 
              Dr. Dibb also will work with LLNL scientists who plan to simulate the transport
              and exchange processes of the stratosphere.  The observational data will serve
              as constraints for model simulations of transports in these regions.
