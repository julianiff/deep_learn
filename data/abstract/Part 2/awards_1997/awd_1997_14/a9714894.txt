Abstract    :
              9714894  McDonald   The Cascade range in Washington state is unusual because it
              is an actively rising range in a forearc region.  Existing seismic studies have
              emphasized very young movements, and have shown that the local convergence is
              N-S.  However, the longer deformation signal is not well known.  This proposal
              will use river profiles, fluvial deposits and geomorphology  to measure uplift
              rates in the Olympic Mountains on the scale of tens of thousands of years. 
              This study will yield exportable results by establishing how quantitatively
              geomorphologic processes can be correlated with long term deformation in a
              tectonically active region.
