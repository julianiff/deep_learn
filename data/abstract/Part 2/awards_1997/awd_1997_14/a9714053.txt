              University of Illinois Chicago    Title:  A Feasibility Study: Integration of
              Mixed-Transmission Lines Types Using Micromachining Techniques    This is a
              Research Planning Grant to initiate a program to develop a circuit design
              methodology for high frequency mixed signal (microwave and optical) integration
              that can be used in high speed applications within the field of communications.
