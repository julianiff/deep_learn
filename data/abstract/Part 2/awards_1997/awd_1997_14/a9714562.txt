Abstract    :
                  This grant provides funding for research on the complexity of the design
              process.  Data are obtained as discrete sequences of instructions; they form
              `curves` in a multi-dimensional design space, approximating an underlying
              design `surface`.  Thus, given two points on such a surface (an initial design
              and a final design), there exists a geodesic (or shortest path) in theory. 
              Yet, practical design sequences are rarely optimal in the sense of being the
              shortest.  There are personal preferences and there are group practices which
              cause a design to deviate from the ideal, shortest path.  Such a phenomenon is
              studied by analogy to a Lagrangian; the optimization of a path as the
              maintenance of the excess of the kinetic energy (from an individual, manifested
              as `creativity` or `preference`) over the potential energy (from the
              environment, as `outside influence` or `group practice`).      If successful,
              this research will lead to the understanding of the `mechanics` of creation, as
              constrained by the environment in which the designer is in.  It permits
              explicit experimentation with `what-if` scenarios such as: what happens when
              `peer pressure` exceeds a certain critical point; what if `peer pressure` is
              replaced by `self-drive`?  The work is expected to be useful in explaining the
              emergence of patterns or structures exhibited in socio-economics, biological
              systems, and non-equilibrium chemo-dynamics.
