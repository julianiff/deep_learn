Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the preparation of fluorine containing   molecules
              from monofluoro subunits.  The subunits under investigation are  
              fluorobutenolides, fluorodienes and fluorovinyl sulfoxides.  The  
              fluorobutenolide research probes the potential of the subunits for the  
              synthesis of fluoronucleosides and 2-fluor- and 3-fluor-butenolides.  The  
              fluorodiene study stresses Diels-Alder methodology and polymerization  
              reactions and the fluorovinyl sulfoxides provide entry into a variety of  
              fluorovinyl systems.  It is anticipated that a total of twenty five  
              undergraduate and masters level students will take part in the research.   With
              this Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award, the Organic   and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr.   Timothy B.
              Patrick in the Department of Chemistry of Southern Illinois   University at
              Edwardsville.  With the help of undergraduate and masters   students, 
              professor Patrick will focus his work on designing and   developing new general
              synthetic methodology for the preparation of   complex carbon-fluorine
              molecules.  Molecules of this type have   interesting and useful biological
              properties.
