Abstract    :
              9714575  Logan  Prior exploratory research on this topic was conducted by the 
              Principal Investigator under NSF Small Grant for Exploratory  Research Number
              94-14423.  The objective of research on this  renewal award is to continue
              determination of the feasibility of  using microorganisms capable of using
              chlorate as an electron  acceptor in their metabolic processes for
              decontamination of soil  and aquifers.  The investigators plan on studying
              chlorate-based  microbial respiration in contrast with molecular oxygen
              pathways  by use of respiratory inhibitors to dissect the electron  transport
              chain.  Soil and aquifer contaminants to be  investigated in this research for
              determination of their  biodegradability by chlorate-respiring microorganisms
              include  toluene, p-xylene, ethylbenzene, naphthalene, carbon  tetrachloride,
              chlorophenol, chlorobenzoate, benzene, pentane and  phenol.  The contemplated
              decontamination process based on  results of the proposed research would
              involve simultaneous  injection of chlorates and chlorate-respiring organisms
              into the  contaminated soil or aquifer.    Results of this project are expected
              to provide the basis for its  potential application in engineering design of a
              system to  decontaminate  soil and groundwater aquifers by use of sodium 
              chlorate as a source of respiratory oxygen under conditions that  prevent or
              inhibit use of oxygen from atmospheric sources.  In  contrast to other
              potential chemical electron acceptors such as  nitrates and sulfates,
              byproducts of which are potential  groundwater pollutants, the only byproduct
              of biochemical  chlorate utilization is the chloride ion.  ***
