Abstract    :
              Support will provide Unidata functionality for the campus community at Utah
              State University (USU).  The initiative will be coordinated and managed through
              the Department of Geography and Earth Resources at USU. The equipment will be
              used to establish a new forecasting laboratory with workstation facilities for
              students and research scientists.  The laboratory equipment includes one Unix
              server and four Unix workstations.
