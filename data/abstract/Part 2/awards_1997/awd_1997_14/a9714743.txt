Abstract    :
              Over a three year period, TERC and the University of  California, Santa Barbara
              will collaborate with leaders of  highly-acclaimed mathematics staff
              development programs for  elementary teachers to infuse a thoughtful,
              well-integrated  emphasis on gender equity into these programs.  Materials  for
              these projects will be revised, and new workshop  sessions focusing on equity
              will be created.    Project Results:    1.   A new emphasis on gender equity
              being incorporated into    the most visible and well-attended reform math
              workshops in    the country.  2.   For staff developers and workshop leaders,
              an increased  understanding of ways of incorporating equity issues into 
              workshop discussions and activities.  3.   The development of new workshop
              sessions on topics such    as "gender, technology, and math reform" as
              extensions,    supplements, follow-ups or "replacement units" for   
              collaborators to add to their existing workshops.  4.   For the over 13, 600
              elementary teachers attending    match workshops each summer, an increased
              awareness of how    to make equity a central focus of their work with reform   
              math.
