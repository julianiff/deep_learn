Abstract    :
              9714263  Koch    This grant provides partial support of the costs of upgrading
              the  stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry (SIRMS) facility at the  University
              of California, Santa Cruz.  Funds will be used to  purchase and develop a
              fluorination vacuum line for extraction of  oxygen from silicate, oxide and
              phosphate minerals, and an  induction furnace vacuum line for thermal
              decomposition of  hydrous minerals prior to hydrogen isotopic analyses    These
              new analytic capabilities will provide the recently hired  PI, Paul Koch, with
              the necessary tools to conduct stable  isotopic analyses of fossil bone
              collagen, teeth and soil  carbonates as proxies in paleoecological
              investigations that have  profound implications for understanding Cenozoic
              climate,  habitats and regional tectonics.  ***
