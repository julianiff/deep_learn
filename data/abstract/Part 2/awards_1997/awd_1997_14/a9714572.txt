Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  DIGIACOMO  EEC-9714572    Advanced Communications is an industry that
              is growing substantially in the U.S and the world.  Antennas play an important
              role in wireless communications.  The Villanova University Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center for Advanced Communications is initializing its
              second five year continuing award.  Six companies have full memberships
              totaling $300,000 and another six have associate memberships totaling $70,000. 
                The Center's research agenda will focus on Phased Arrays and Digital Antenna,
              Phase Arrays and Digital Antenna Beamforming, Satellite Communications,
              Cellular Telephone Antennas, Low Profile Antennas, Cellular Base-Station
              Antennas, Signal Classification, and Cellular Buried Components.      A woman
              undergraduate is being funded to augment the Center's research agenda to
              develop an easily-used analysis method to determine reliability and life cycle
              for composite functionally Grade Materials for electronic modules.
