Abstract    :
              9714405  Adams    Adams is currently Director of the new National Institute on
              Mentoring of the National Consortium for Graduate Degrees for Minorities in
              Engineering and Science, Inc. (GEM).  Prior to that, he served as Executive
              Director of GEM.  Originally created as an outgrowth of corporate and
              university concerns to increase the number of underrepresented ethnic/racial
              groups who enter and complete the engineering master's degree, currently GEM
              operates programs and conducts activities that address the underrepresentation
              of ethnic minorities in engineering, science, and mathematics from precollege
              to doctorate levels.
