Abstract    :
              9714890  Friedman       This award provides partial support for a two-day
              conference in  low-dimensional topology at Columbia University and Barnard
              College  on March 14-15, 1998.  Specific areas of concern are: knot theory  via
              braid representations, quantum and finite type knot invariants,  and the study
              of the mapping class group, both as it pertains to 3-  manifold classification
              and in connection with the analogies between  the cohomology of the mapping
              class group and the braid group.  The  invited speakers include Colin Adams,
              Robert Ghrist, Vaughan Jones,  Xiao-Song Lin, William Menasco, Jozef Przytycki,
              and Caroline Series.  The conference surveys the broad outlines of a field that
              has seen  dramatic progress over the last fifteen years, some of which have 
              already found application in the study of DNA and long polymers.  It  also
              explores future directions for research in the field.  ***
