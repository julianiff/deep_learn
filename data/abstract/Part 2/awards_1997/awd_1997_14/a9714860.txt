Through integrated analytical and experimental studies,
              this research will address (a) effects of significant yielding of wall
              reinforcement and combined wall flexural and diagonal shear cracks on stiffness
              and strength of steel/composite coupling beams and beam-wall connection; (b)
              impacts of coupling beam axial forces on member and connection performance; (c)
              level of axial force in steel/composite coupling beams versus reinforced
              concrete coupling beams; (d) slab effects on distribution of internal stresses
              and overall behavior of coupled wall systems with steel/composite beams, and
              those with reinforced concrete coupling beams; (e) importance of soil-structure
              interaction on coupling beam rotation demands; and (f) general modeling of
              structural walls.
This is a collaborative investigation between University of
              Cincinnati (UC) and The Building Research Institute (BRI) of Japan.  In the
              experience study, four approximately 1/3-scale sub assemblages of a coupling
              beam, wall pier, and floor slab will be fabricated and tested.  Wall gravity
              axial load will be simulated in all specimens.  The test results in conjunction
              with the analytical results will be used to modify the existing
              state-of-the-art design techniques for steel/composite coupling beams and their
              connections to reinforced concrete walls.
