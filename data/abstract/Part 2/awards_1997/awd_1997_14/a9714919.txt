Abstract    :
                          Core Support for the Board on Biology                               
                                                     The Board on Biology (BB) a unit under
              the Commission  on Life Sciences of the National Research Council, addresses 
              issues in the biological sciences and their impact on  society.  Its work
              encompasses all of the life sciences,  from molecular genetics to biodiversity.
               Since 1984 BB has  received contracts and grants for the conduct of discrete 
              studies and has received only a small amount of core support  to assist in the
              management of BB, in the oversight of its  committees, in the organization of
              special workshops, and in  the development of new ideas for studies.        
              This award provides modest support for core funding for  BB.  These funds will
              help invigorate the activities of the  Board at a time when rapid advances in
              biology are occupying  an increasingly important role, both in science and in 
              public policy.  BB will facilitate such core activities as a  yearly workshop
              for sponsors, board members, and other  experts to identify and discuss
              emerging issues in selected  areas and other activities of benefit to
              biological science.
