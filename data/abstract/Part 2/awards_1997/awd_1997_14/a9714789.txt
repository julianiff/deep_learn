Abstract    :
              Researchers use the Atmospheric Lidar Observatory to couple lower portion of the
              atmosphere with the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere.  Based on lidar
              observations of mid-stratosphere to lower thermosphere temperatures, this
              emphasizes the transition region between the upper mesosphere and lower
              thermosphere.  Using a much larger telescope, they're able to precisely
              determine Rayleigh-scatter temperatures and time resolution in the upper
              mesosphere, and extend maximum altitude above 100 kilometers.  Nightly averaged
              lidar temperatures are used to study seasonal variations in the transition
              region, especially (1) the mesopause altitude and structure near 87 and 102
              kilometers, (2) the relationship between high-altitude summer inversion layers
              (by Rayleigh lidar) and an inversion layer near 90 kilometers (by sodium
              lidar), (3) the behavior of vertical wave-like appearance of mesospheric
              inversion layers to higher altitudes.  These nightly temporal variations (or
              their monthly averages) examine time-varying phenomena, such as tides and
              downward/upward phase progression of mesospheric inversion layers.
