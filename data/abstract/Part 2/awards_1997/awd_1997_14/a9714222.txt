Abstract    :
              Abstract - Pfefferle      This is a study of hydrocarbon growth mechanisms that
              lead to the formation of soot and soot precursors under diffusion flame
              conditions; such conditions are relevant to most practical combustion
              conditions.  The objective is to determine the effects of combustion conditions
              and fuel structure on the formation pathways of aromatic ring compounds and
              soot.  Both single-fuel flames and methane diffusion flames doped with low
              concentrations of various hydrocarbons are studied.  Soot volume fraction to
              0.1 ppm, morphology and composition of soot, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
              (PAH), and stable intermediate species present at levels above 1 ppm and
              measured.  Particular reaction pathways important in the diffusion flames are
              studies also in a molecular-beam-sampled well-mixed reactor to obtain detailed
              reaction parameters.  This methodology allows fast, quantitative species
              sampling in diffusion flames with significant soot loadings.  Reaction products
              are detected using vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photoionization.  The soot
              measurement technique allows detection of sub-ppm soot volume fractions and
              includes measurement of the translucent particles that may be the direct
              precursors of mature soot.  With this technique, precursor particles can be
              discriminated from mature soot, their composition analyzed, and the process of
              graphitization followed.    Soot and PAH associated with incomplete combustion
              are recognized as major health hazards.  Detailed studies of the formation and
              character of these materials can identify which systems pose the greater
              threats and also suggest control strategies.
