Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  EEC-9714141  WHITE    It is potentially feasible to use
              MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) technology to produce a device for
              trimming and providing the fine RF tuning adjustments needed in
              microwave/millimeter-wave integrated circuits.  However, to date there has not
              been a reported demonstration of this technique in a MEMS device.  This award
              supports a tie project between two Industry/University Cooperative Research
              Centers, Berkeley Sensors and Actuators Center (BSAC) at the University of
              California at Berkeley, and the Center for Advanced Manufacturing and Packaging
              of Microwave, Optical and Digital Electronics (CAMPmode) at the University of
              Colorado at Boulder, to develop a complete numerical/experimental
              characterization at microwave/millimeter-wave frequencies to derive an RF
              network model for MEMS.  The methodology developed will be illustrated by
              implementation of the technique in a high-efficiency, switched mode
              microwave/millimeter-wave power amplifier for mobile and portable systems. 
              CAMPmode is one of the leading university research centers in millimeter
              microwave packaging technologies, and BSAC is one of the leading research
              facilities in the development of MEMS technology.  Together, these two Centers
              are well qualified to perform the proposed research, which is a project that
              neither Center has the capability to perform on its own.
