Abstract    :
              This award supports a workshop to identify new challenges  and future directions
              of research  in computing systems, to  be held in St. Louis on July 31 and
              August 1,1997. The  objective of this workshop is to explore new paradigms in 
              computing systems research by establishing synergy among  different subareas of
              systems such as operating systems,  computer architecture, compilers,
              networking, multimedia,  and  security. The goal of this workshop is to bring 
              together leading experts from these areas to identify grand  challenge problems
              in systems research,  and identify  potential quantum leaps that can be
              achieved by fostering a  closer and focused collaboration among different
              areas. The  workshop also plans to address the issue of building a  national
              level infrastructure for systems research.
