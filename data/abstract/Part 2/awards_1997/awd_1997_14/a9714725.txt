Abstract    :
              9714725  Nelson  This renewal grant to this senior distinguished PI supports 
              work on a variety of topics in condensed matter physics and  statistical
              mechanics, with emphasis on interplay between  geometry and disorder.  There
              are projects on vortices  interacting with artificial pinning centers in a 
              type II  superconductor, localization effects in population biology  and
              thermal fluctuations and dynamics in polymers and  vesicles.  There are plans
              to consider ways of producing a  "work-hardened" state of tangled vortex lines
              by running an  external current parallel to the external magnetic field.  In
              simple models of population biology with convection in  heterogeneous media,
              the underlying mathematical structure  corresponds to a non-Hermitian
              localization problem and is  amenable to laboratory investigation with
              bacteria.  There  are plans to study "Fisher waves" in a spatially 
              inhomogeneous environment.  %%%  This senior distinguished PI is widely
              recognized for  pioneering, innovative research; wonderfully lucid, 
              stimulating and entertaining presentations and a careful  nurturing of students
              and postdocs.   He works on the  statistical mechanics of condensed matter and
              biophysics,  ranging from superconductors to polymers and vesicles.  His  work
              in this renewal grant also contains projects on  localization effects in
              population biology.  ***
