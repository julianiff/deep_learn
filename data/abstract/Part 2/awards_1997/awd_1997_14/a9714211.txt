Abstract    :
              There are three objectives for this workshop, the most important of which is the
               articulation of emerging interdisciplinary research domains, called
              organizational  informatics and  social informatics, that focus on the social
              dimensions of the  integration of computerization and networked information
              into social and  organizational life, including the roles of information
              technologies in social and  organizational change.  Organizational informatics
              is viewed as a subarea of social  informatics.  Findings and theories belong to
              organizational informatics when they can  be characterized in terms of the
              participants of organizations.  Using this criterion  scholarOs and researchers
              understandings of the adoption, use, and impacts  of  groupware fall well
              within organizational informatics.  In contrast, the Internet is used  by
              millions of people outside of their worklives, and the character and
              consequences  of the public's use of the Internet is a topic outside of
              organizational informatics, but  within social informatics.
