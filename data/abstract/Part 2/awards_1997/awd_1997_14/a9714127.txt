Abstract    :
              Professor Michel Broue of the University of Paris VII will give a  series of ten
              lectures entitled "Blocks, Deligne-Lusztig  varieties and reflection groups." 
              In these lectures he will  explain recent advances in the modular
              representation theory of  finite reductive groups obtained by using
              Deligne-Lusztig  varieties to study the modular representation of these groups,
               and how the results thus obtained give strong indications that  there is an as
              yet undiscovered "generic" representation theory  from which the modular
              representation theory of finite reductive  groups can be recovered by
              specialization.  He will also relate  this progress to long-standing
              conjectures in modular  representation theory and discuss directions for future
              research.   The lectures should be of interest to experts and students in all 
              areas of finite group representation theory as well as  researchers in other
              fields, particularly those interested in the  various aspects of complex
              reflection groups.
