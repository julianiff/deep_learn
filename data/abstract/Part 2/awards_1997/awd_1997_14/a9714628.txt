Abstract    :
              9714628  Heimbach     This grant will provide funding to upgrade the University
              of North Carolina's Department of Atmospheric Sciences UNIDATA-supported
              network.  New software, expanded products and increasing applications have
              rendered part of the present system obsolete.  Presently the department has
              four Sun workstations.  The existing server (a Sun LX) will be downgraded and a
              new server, a Sun Ultra 1-170E along with some peripherals, will be added.  The
              department will continue the popular PC-McIDAS by replacing the existing two
              PCs with high-end Pentiums to allow PC-McIDAS upgrades which are not possible
              with the current PCs.     This expansion will allow a wider dissemination of
              the UNIDATA services which have already been profoundly beneficial to the
              educational experiences of the majors, to research and to those enrolled in the
              department's support courses.  A majority of the department's offerings have
              been impacted by the UNIDATA products and three new courses have been developed
              which are specifically directed at UNIDATA applications.  A freshman-level
              atmospheric sciences course is being reorganized to include an
              interdisciplinary component.  The multidisciplinary aspects of this course will
              be supported by the proposed upgrade.     This equipment upgrading is essential
              to continue the department's rigorous instruction in both major and service
              courses, as well as to contribute to research which requires operational
              meteorological data.
