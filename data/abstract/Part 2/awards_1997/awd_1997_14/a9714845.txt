              Frontiers of       Condensed  Matter  Physics" is  organized  at  the      
              University of Pennsylvania on October 13  and  14.       This symposium will
              bring together highly regarded       scientists  in  the  most  promising 
              subareas  of       Condensed Matter Physics for a two-day program  of      
              invited talks and discussion sessions, to be  held       at  the  University of
              Pennsylvania.  The  program       features a session in which will be presented
               the       results  of the two-year  NRC study on the  Future       of 
              Condensed Matter Physics as well as a  session       on  the  Status  of Basic
              Research  in  Industrial       Laboratories.  This symposium will also be 
              opened       to graduate students.       %%%       A special Symposium on "The
