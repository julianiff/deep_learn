              This grant is awarded through the Separations and Purification Program
              sub-element of  the Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of the
              Chemical and Transport Systems Division.  The principal investigator is Dr.
              Charles Martin at Colorado State University.  The objective of the research is
              to develop molecular-recognition membranes that are highly selective.  The
              concept is to introduce apoenzymes (enzymes without cofactors) into a membrane.
               The apoenzyme binds to specific substrates and thereby increases the flux of
              the substrate species compared to other species present in the system.  The PI
              proposes to use this molecular recognition concept to focus on enantiomeric
              separations, using both apoenzymes and synthetic molecular recognition species.
                 This proposal to develop enantioselective membranes ha a high exploratory
              content.  The research proposed here has a potentially tremendous impact in the
              separation of chiral species.  The concepts of molecular recognition and
              selective separations form emerging research areas in separations science and
              technology.  If successful, the research will have a  significant impact on
              pharamaceuticals purification and production scale-up.
