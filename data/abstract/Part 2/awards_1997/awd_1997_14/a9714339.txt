Abstract    :
              ***  Fristsen 9714339    Three to twenty meter thick permanent ice covers on
              lakes in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctic contain viable microbial cells in
              association with sediment aggregates. These aggregates are now recognized as
              sites where physical, chemical and biological interactions promote microbial
              growth under extreme conditions inherent to the ice environment. This
              interdisciplinary research program will define specific processes which allow
              (1) the creation of liquid water (the essential element for life) in the
              permanent ice, (2) the survival and structuring of  microbial populations
              subjected to freezing and thawing, (3) the production of substances which alter
              the physical attributes of the ice crystal habitat and (4) nutrient supply to
              the microbial populations which is essential for not only survival, but net
              microbial growth and biomass accumulation. The work will be on ice aggregates
              embedded within the permanent ice covers on the lakes in the Taylor Valley
              which have been tentatively characterized in previous studies. Research on
              microbes in permanent ice provides information on the ecology of microbes in
              ice ecosystems and promises to have biotechnological implications. Furthermore,
              these studies will provide insights into the conditions which support or have
              supported life beyond our own planet in association with water ice which is
              currently present within and beyond our own solar system.  ***
