              ATM-9714893  Fogel, Marilyn L.  Carnegie Institute of Washington    Drought in
              the Australian Outback:  Milankovitch and Anthropogenic Forcing of the
              Australian Monsoon    Lake Eyre Basin is a monsoon-controlled interior basin
              covering one-sixth of the Australian continent.  A majority of the observed wet
              and dry cycles of this basin are explained by Milankovitch forcing of the
              Australian monsoon.  The failure of Lake Eyre to fill in the early Holocene
              despite strong forcing by solar radiation and sea level is hypothesized to be a
              consequence of systematic burning by the earliest human immigrants.  A
              reduction in the density and composition of vegetation across Australia in the
              past 50 ka, may have resulted in a significant weakening of monsoon penetration
              into the interior with a long-term trend towards increased aridity.  To test
              this hypothesis further, this award supports field, analytical, and modeling
              studies 1) to use newly documented stable-isotope signals in ratite eggshell
              and bone/teeth of other vertebrates to evaluate changes in precipitation and
              vegetation composition over the past 70,000 years across northern Australia, 2)
              to develop a chronology for wet and dry cycles in Lake Gregory, a smaller basin
              wholly within the monsoon-watered region, 3) to refine the chronology of
              deflationary events in the Lake Eyre Basin to more rigorously evaluate the
              correlation to Milankovitch controls, 4) to develop new proxies for
              paleovegetational reconstructions and 5) complete sensitivity tests evaluating
              the role of vegetation change on the penetration of monsoon precipitation into
              the Lake Eyre Basin using General Circulation Models.
