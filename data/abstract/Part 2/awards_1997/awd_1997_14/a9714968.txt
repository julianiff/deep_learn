Abstract    :
                  9714968  Zuckerkandl   Complex organisms evolved from simpler ancestors
              through a process that included gene duplication and divergence.  After
              duplication, the additional genes may have been relatively free to vary and
              take on new functions.  This genetic flexibility has helped many organisms
              adapt to new environments.  The DNA sequences in humans and other organisms
              provide a rich record from which a detailed evolutionary history of gene
              duplication and divergence may be deduced.  This record will be mathematically
              analyzed in multicellular animals.   The primary goal of this project is to
              help illuminate the history and genetic mechanisms of evolution, as well as the
              fundamental question of how complex organisms arose from simpler ancestors. 
              Evolutionary relationships among genes, such as the descent of several modern
              genes from a single ancestral gene, provide a powerful basis for predicting
              molecular function and three-dimensional conformation.  Thus, the basic
              knowledge gained from these evolutionary studies will be used in many other
              fields, including biochemistry, pharmacology, biomedical sciences, and
              biotechnology.
