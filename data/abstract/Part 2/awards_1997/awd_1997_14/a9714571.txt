Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9714571  Douglas J. Raber    The National Research Council (NRC)
              requests partial core support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for
              the continuing activities of the Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology
              (BCST) of the Commission on Physical Sciences, Mathematics, and Applications.  
               As defined in its mission statement, the Board on Chemical Sciences and
              Technology is the recognized and respected body within the National Research
              Council that provides independent, objective information and recommendations in
              chemical sciences and technologies to the government to assure a sound basis
              for policy decisions.  Accordingly, the Board serves as the focal point within
              the National Research Council for concerns and issues effecting chemistry in
              its broadest sense.  To function effectively, the BCST must undertake extensive
              planning for potential studies, carry out oversight of ongoing activities,
              engage in private-sector fund raising, and maintain a broad effort to
              communicate with the  chemical sciences community.  All of these are core
              activities, for which costs cannot be charged to specific projects and which
              therefore require core funding.  The capacity to develop new projects, while
              paying costs partially or fully from core funds, greatly enhances the freedom
              and capacity of the BCST to act responsively and responsibly to important
              issues in the chemical sciences and technology.
