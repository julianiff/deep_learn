Abstract    :
              Form 10 Abstract    Proposal: AST 97-14369  PI:  Saul Perlmutter  Institution: 
              University of California, Berkeley      This Small Grant for Exploratory
              Research (SGER) is for a rapid  response search for gamma ray burst (GRB)
              optical emission, using  the 0.5 m Automated Patrol Telescope in Australia.
              Searches are  triggered by an alert from the BACODINE network, which receives 
              signals from the BATSE experiment on the Compton Gamma Ray  Observatory
              spacecraft when a GRB is detected. The telescope is  already under Internet and
              computer control, but further work is  necessary to automate the search fully,
              by automating the roof,  lens cover, etc. Observations already made of the GRBs
              of  970326.6, 970329, and 970616 will be published, as well as a study  of
              background optical transient rates in large-area, very deep  images taken as
              part of a Supernova Cosmology Project.
