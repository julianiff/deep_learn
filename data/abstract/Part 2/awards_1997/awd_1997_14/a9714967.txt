Abstract    :
              This award funds a workshop to explore the research needs related  to  the 
              interface  between computer  vision  and  control.   The  workshop  will  be
              held June 23-25, 1997 on Block  Island,  Rhode  Island.   A  small  number of
              key researchers from  the  computer  vision and control communities will come
              together to examine  the  topics  which bridge these two domains.  Their
              presentations  and  discussions  in  working groups will undertake to 
              delineate  the  common  ground  and  to  challenge one another  with 
              fundamental  unresolved problems.  The results of the workshop will appear  in 
              a  widely distributed report on research directions in vision and  control.
