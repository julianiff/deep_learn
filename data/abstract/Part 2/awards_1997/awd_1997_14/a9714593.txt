Abstract    :
              The Millstone Hill Observatory, an incoherent scatter radar facility, continues
              its radar and optical research activities of the earth's upper atmosphere. 
              Extensive ionospheric observations capabilities encompass mid-latitude,
              sub-auroral, and auroral features and processes.  The Observatory's radar
              operations support programs like World Day, CEDAR and GEM in community-directed
              research.  In addition, it supports optical experiments and Fabry-Perot
              interferometer and photometer observations, in conjunction with radar
              experiments addressing neutral atmospheric dynamics and temperatures. 
              Resulting radar and optical data is deposited in the CEDAR database at the
              National Center for Atmospheric Research, where it can be accessed by students
              and external investigators.
