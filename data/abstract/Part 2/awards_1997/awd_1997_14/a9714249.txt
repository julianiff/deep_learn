Abstract    :
                  HACU's National Internship Program is a fully administered and
              carefully-managed ten-week program that places college students in stimulating
              and challenging professional and educational roles within the federal sector. 
              Utilizing an intensive summer model, HACU and the sponsoring agencies and
              departments provide academically qualified students with experience-based
              learning.  Student interns are placed federal offices and laboratories in the
              Washington, DC metropolitan area and in field sites throughout the United
              States and Puerto Rico.  Student placements are based upon position
              descriptions provided by supervisors which detail the academic preparation,
              work experience and special skills required to perform the job.    This project
              is jointly supported by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, MPS, and
              the Office of the Director, Directorate Social, Behavioral and Economic
              Sciences, Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, and
              Directorate for Engineering.
