Abstract    :
              Past studies of global changes in the middle atmosphere have predicted dramatic
              changes in thermal regime, structure, and composition with doubled carbon
              dioxide.  The PI responds to these preliminary findings by examining the
              thermal and dynamical response to doubling carbon dioxide in the mesosphere and
              lower thermosphere (MLT), using a three-dimensional Spectral Mesosphere/Lower
              Thermosphere Model.  Recently extended into the thermosphere and tested on
              empirical climatologies, the model is applied to a wide range of carbon dioxide
              concentrations through a parameterization of infrared radiative transfer for
              the middle and upper atmosphere.  The PI also modifies this model to account
              for radiative, dynamical, and chemical feedback important for MLT global change
              studies.  Because of the associated thermal contraction of the upper
              atmosphere, data gathered from the research can eventually be applied to the
              revision of life time and trajectory calculations of orbiting and re-entry
              space vehicles.
