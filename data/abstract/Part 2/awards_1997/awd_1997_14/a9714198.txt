Abstract    :
              9714198  Wen  This mid-career PI has been awarded a grant to continue his  work
              on various aspects of the problem of strongly  correlated electrons.  These
              problems are integral to our  understanding of the quantum Hall effect and the 
              properties  of high Tc superconductors.  This PI has been widely known  for his
              innovative approaches to problems, often bridging  two components of his broad
              background, particle theory and  condensed matter.  His specific projects
              include, (1)  underdoped high Tc superconductors, (2) random critical  points
              and transition between quantum Hall states and (3)  non-abelian fractional
              quantum Hall states and a theory of  topological orders.  %%%  This is a
              mid-career PI who is  well recognized for original  and innovative
              contributions to the physics of  electrons in  very high magnetic fields and
              high Tc superconductors.  In  this renewal grant, he is being supported to
              continue his  work in (1) the special magnetic properties of the  materials, at
              doping levels less than when they are  superconducting and  (2) some recent
              theoretical  developments in the properties of both the integer and  fractional
              quantum Hall effects.  ***
