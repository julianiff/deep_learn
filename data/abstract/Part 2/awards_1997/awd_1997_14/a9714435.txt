Abstract    :
              The Southwest Center for Advanced Technological Education (SCATE) was funded to
              experiment and demonstrate how advanced technological education can be
              delivered over distance learning systems.  In the first three years the Center
              focused on the development of a distance learning infrastructure, professional
              development of faculty and revising materials for distance education delivery. 
              Now the Center is focusing on development and testing of technical courses that
              require a hands-on laboratory component.  Some of these courses are being
              developed in conjunction with other ATE Centers at Maricopa Community College
              District and Bellevue Community College; others are being developed for use at
              industrial sites.  An AAS degree program for distance learning technicians is
              also being developed.  The Center is increasing its role in professional
              development of faculty and in representing the infrastructure needs of the
              technical education community in distance learning networks.
