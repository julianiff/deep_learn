Abstract    :
              Motivated  by  the  challenges of designing  multi-user  software  systems  and 
              by the prospect of ubiquitous electronic  commerce,  the  goal  of this
              research project is to develop the theoretical  foundations  for  reasoning 
              about  utilities  in  a  multi-agent  setting,  and  use  these foundations to
              construct  methods  with  which  to reason effectively about other agents'
              preferences  and  motivations. The approach draws on developments in AI as well
               as  in  economics.  Specifically, the project  defines  a  notion  of  utility
               distribution that plays a role analogous to  that  of  a  probability 
              distribution, and the notion of  a  utility  network  that  allows  one  to 
              reason about utilities  the  way  Bayesian  networks  allow one to reason about
              probabilities.  Beyond  this,  the   project  is  investigating  hybrid 
              networks,  which  allow  simultaneous  reasoning about probabilities  and 
              utilities.  The  results of this project will provide a firm theoretical
              framework  in  which  to reason about beliefs and preferences in multi-agent 
              systems,  with  potential applications  in  software  design  and  electronic
              commerce.
