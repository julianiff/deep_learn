Abstract    :
              Abstract/Young ATM-9714357    The term  green flash  refers to a class of poorly
              understood atmospheric refraction   phenomena that have been observed by
              reliable observers for many years on  occasion when the sun is near the
              horizon.  It is often described as a brief  flash  of  green light at the upper
              edge of the setting sun, but the term is misleading, for  several reasons. 
              First, there are several different observable phenomena that have  been called 
              green flashes  in the past.  Second, the colors can range from yellow to 
              violet.  Third, there is no flash literally.  One can speculate that the term 
              flash  has  been applied because of the brevity, not the intensity, of the
              phenomenon.    There is a simple, but mostly inadequate, model that attempts to
              explain the  phenomenon in one of its forms.  There are neither quantitative
              theories nor  qualitative explanations for any of the other observed forms.    
               The objectives of this research are 1) to determine how many different
              atmospheric  refraction phenomena can be grouped under the heading of the
              phenomena know  popularly as  green flashes ,  2) to assess the relative
              importance of molecular  absorption as a causative factor, and 3) to develop a
              model to predict the observed  colors and to compare the predictions with
              existing observations.  The achievement  of these objectives will not only move
              the phenomena from the poorly-understoood  category to the
              at-least-basically-understood category but also but also provide  insights
              regarding possible techniques that might be developed to determine at least 
              the algebraic sign of the temperature structure of the boundary layer passively
              under  certain conditions that might eventually be of practical use.
