Abstract    :
              Fossil bones of primates, including the remains of several species that are
              closely related to the human lineage, have been recovered from a number of
              sites in South Africa.  Fossils such as these, however, are very poorly known
              from other areas of southern Africa (e.g., Botswana, Angola, and Namibia).
              Almost all the fossils from these sites accumulated in karst caves that had
              formed in the limestones that outcrop in South Africa, Botswana, Angola and
              Namibia.  These limestone caves have yielded only a few fossilized primate
              bones.  However, there are a number of very old volcanic intrusives in Namibi,
              and the chemical composition of these rocks makes them equally susceptible to
              cave formation through water dissolution.  Eleven carbonatite intrusives have
              been identified throughout Namibia.  Fossils dating from about 100 thousand to
              some 2.5 million years ago have been discovered in two karst cave systems that
              formed in one of these intrusives.  This project will explore the remaining ten
              carbonatites in Namibia to determine whether they also contain fossiliferous
              cave sediments of Cenozoic age.  In particular, it is hoped that additional
              sites that may contain fossil primate bones will be identified by this survey. 
              Any such fossils will add significantly to our understanding of primate
              evolution and paleoecology in Africa.
