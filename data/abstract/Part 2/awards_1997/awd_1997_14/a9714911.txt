Abstract    :
              Abstract    Cleveland State University's Advanced Manufacturing Center (AMC)
              provides an  opportunity for students at CSU and three affiliated community
              colleges,  along with workforce trainees, to have hands-on experience in
              manufacturing  process development and production.  The Center's mission is to
              provide the  region's manufacturers with the products, processes, ideas, and
              people they  need to become more profitable and to create jobs.  The Center is
              a  partnership between Cleveland State University, the Cleveland Advanced 
              Manufacturing Program (CAMP), and industry, with at least half of the  revenue
              for the Center coming from industry.  Center students, faculty and  staff work
              on projects that fit the needs of a particular company and then  apply the
              research findings industry-wide, thus giving engineering students  an
              educational experience in industrially relevant engineering problems.  This
              award supports a National conference to benchmark best practices of  similar
              centers, the refinement the AMC model, and the development of a list  of
              possible replication sites.
