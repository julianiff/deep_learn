              Agreement between the National Science Foundation and the Arctic Research
              Commission and provides for its continuing operations.  The Arctic Research
              Commission was established under the Arctic Research Policy Act of 1984 (Public

              will provide administrative services.   This action fulfills the intent of
              Congress to provide funding for the Commission through the NSF.
