Abstract    :
              9714813  Hervig           This award will partially support expenses for invited
               speakers who will present their latest analytical and theoretical  results at
              a special session of the 11th International Conference  on Secondary Ion Mass
              Spectrometry (SIMS). The special session is  entitled "Isotopic Ratio
              Measurements Using SIMS", and the invited  speakers will be selected from
              leading laboratories working in  isotope geochemistry, an area of research
              where recent technical  developments have allowed advances in precise isotope
              ratio  measurements from microscopic samples. The special session has been 
              added to the international SIMS conference with the intent of  bringing the
              microanalytical expertise of the isotope geochemistry  community together with
              interested SIMS specialists from materials  science and the semiconductor
              industry.  ***
