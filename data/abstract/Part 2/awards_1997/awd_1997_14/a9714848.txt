Abstract    :
                  9714848  Giles    This twelve month project helps to support 150 teachers
              participating in the SuperComputing '97 conference including special sessions
              and workshops specifically intended for educators.  The conference theme is
              "the exploration of the many possible roles of high performance networking and
              computing in lifelong education in the 21st century."  This year's program
              broadens the participants beyond teachers to include students, administrators
              and community (technology) leaders, with a particular emphasis on minority
              participation; offers fora on computational science; funds teachers; and
              supports a teacher booth.  The emphasis on computation science is grounded in
              the classroom context, and the PIs seek to generate dialog on how these tools
              and techniques can contribute to the implementation of the national science and
              mathematics standards.    In total 150 teachers, 20 students, 20 school
              administrators, and 10 community technology leaders are participating,
              approximately 50 of whom are from the conference area, San Jose.    Cost
              sharing is 8%.  NSF's funding covers one-half the participants.  Substantial
              corporate contributions are expected to cover the rest, approximately 100, of
              the participants.
